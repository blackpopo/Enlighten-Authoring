Influence of verbal and textual presentation on adherence,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: With the rise of autonomous e-mental health applications, virtual agents can play a major role in improving trustworthiness, therapy outcome and adherence. In these applications, it is important that patients adhere in the sense that they perform the tasks, but also that they adhere to the specific recommendations on how to do them well. One important construct in improving adherence is psychoeducation, information on the why and how of therapeutic interventions. In an e-mental health context, this can be delivered in two different ways: verbally by a (virtual) embodied conversational agent or just via text on the screen. The aim of this research is to study which presentation mode is preferable for improving adherence. METHODS : This study takes the approach of evaluating a specific part of a therapy, namely psychoeducation. This was done in a non-clinical sample, to first test the general constructs of the human-computer interaction. We performed an experimental study on the effect of presentation mode of psychoeducation on adherence. In this study, we took into account the moderating effects of attitude towards the virtual agent and recollection of the information. Within the paradigm of expressive writing, we asked participants (n= 46) to pick one of their worst memories to describe in a digital diary after receiving verbal or textual psychoeducation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We found that both the attitude towards the virtual agent and how well the psychoeducation was recollected were positively related to adherence in the form of task execution. Moreover, after controlling for the attitude to the agent and recollection, presentation of psychoeducation via text resulted in higher adherence than verbal presentation by the virtual agent

Help4Mood aims to support the treatment of patients with Major Depression using Information and Communications Technology (ICT). The resultant Personal Health System (PHS) of Help4Mood uses a set of activity sensors (such as wrist watch, key ring, or under-mattress sensor) that gather information about the daily physical and sleep activities from the patient. This information and other data obtained through standardized questionnaires are analysed in order to infer some recommendations (or alerts) and offer adaptive and tailored tasks as part of the treatment in the form of daily interactive sessions provided by a Virtual Agent (VA). The initial developed work for the project resulted in the MSc Thesis entitled “Generic Data Processing & Analysis Architecture of a Personal Health System to Manage Daily Interactive Sessions in Patients with Major Depression” (Breso, 2013) within the Artificial Intelligence, Pattern Recognition and Digital Imaging MSc program at the Technical University of Valencia. In this MSc Thesis, the author describes the design and the implementation of the Data Processing & Analysis layer of the Help4Mood’s PHS. It had been conceived as the module responsible to analyse relevant patient’s data, plan the daily interactive sessions and recommend a set of tailored activities configured by clinicians that help in the recovery of the patient. Additionally, this system included an initial cognitive-emotional module aimed to infer the specific set of emotions to be displayed by the VA during the interaction The research work presented in this document is an extension of the work done in the MSc's Thesis. The proposed extension will allow a deeper research on how to improve current Human-Agent Interactions particularly addressed to users that are under treatment of Major Depression. Some theories in the areas of psychology and cognitive science will be the basis of a computational model that is expected to improve the production of the daily session’s content and the adequate –emotional– fashion for a better engagement of the users promoting the long-term use of the system."", 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 53, 'citationCount': 9, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3352168', 'name': 'A.

In Internet-based eHealth interventions, ECAs may be used for the delivery of automated human support factors. Objective We aim to provide an overview of the technological and clinical possibilities, as well as the evidence base for ECA applications in clinical psychology, to inform health professionals about the activity in this field of research. Methods Given the large variety of applied methodologies, types of applications, and scientific disciplines involved in ECA research, we conducted a systematic scoping review. Scoping reviews aim to map key concepts and types of evidence underlying an area of research, and answer less-specific questions than traditional systematic reviews. Systematic searches for ECA applications in the treatment of mood, anxiety, psychotic, autism spectrum, and substance use disorders were conducted in databases in the fields of psychology and computer science, as well as in interdisciplinary databases. Studies were included if they conveyed primary research findings on an ECA application that targeted one of the disorders. We mapped each study’s background information, how the different disorders were addressed, how ECAs and users could interact with one another, methodological aspects, and the study’s aims and outcomes. Results This study included N=54 publications (N=49 studies). More than half of the studies (n=26) focused on autism treatment, and ECAs were used most often for social skills training (n=23). Applications ranged from simple reinforcement of social behaviors through emotional expressions to sophisticated multimodal conversational systems. Most applications (n=43) were still in the development and piloting phase, that is, not yet ready for routine practice evaluation or application. Few studies conducted controlled research into clinical effects of ECAs, such as a reduction in symptom severity. Conclusions ECAs for mental disorders are emerging. State-of-the-art techniques, involving, for example, communication through natural language or nonverbal behavior, are increasingly being considered and adopted for psychotherapeutic interventions in ECA research with promising results. However, evidence on their clinical application remains scarce. At present, their value to clinical practice lies mostly in the experimental determination of critical human support factors. In the context of using ECAs as an adjunct to existing interventions with the aim of supporting users, important questions remain with regard to the personalization of ECAs’ interaction with users, and the optimal timing and manner of providing support. To increase the evidence base with regard to Internet interventions, we propose an additional focus on low-tech ECA solutions that can be rapidly developed, tested, and applied in routine practice.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 85, 'citationCount': 247, 'authors': [{'authorId': '39888309', 'name': 'Simon Provoost'}, {'authorId': '4940640', 'name': 'Ho Ming Lau'}, {'authorId': '3003041', 'name': 'J.

Internet interventions are assumed to be cost-effective. However, it is unclear how strong this evidence is, and what the quality of this evidence is. Method. A comprehensive literature search (1990–2014) in Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, NHS Economic Evaluations Database, NHS Health Technology Assessment Database, Office of Health Economics Evaluations Database, Compendex and Inspec was conducted. We included economic evaluations alongside randomized controlled trials of Internet interventions for a range of mental health symptoms compared to a control group, consisting of a psychological or pharmaceutical intervention, treatment-as-usual (TAU), wait-list or an attention control group. Results. Of the 6587 abstracts identified, 16 papers met the inclusion criteria. Nine studies featured a societal perspective. Results demonstrated that guided Internet interventions for depression, anxiety, smoking cessation and alcohol consumption had favourable probabilities of being more cost-effective when compared to wait-list, TAU, group cognitive behaviour therapy (CBGT), attention control, telephone counselling or unguided Internet CBT. Unguided Internet interventions for suicide prevention, depression and smoking cessation demonstrated cost-effectiveness compared to TAU or attention control. In general, results from cost-utility analyses using more generic health outcomes (quality of life) were less favourable for unguided Internet interventions. Most studies adhered reasonably to economic guidelines. Conclusions. Results of guided Internet interventions being cost-effective are promising with most studies adhering to publication standards, but more economic evaluations are needed in order to determine cost-effectiveness of Internet interventions compared to the most cost-effective treatment currently available.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 52, 'citationCount': 244, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2003226', 'name': 'T.

References of selected studies were consulted for relevant articles.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 157 articles were screened, of which 33 articles were retained for full review. The factors related to nonadherence were: a) patient-related (e.g., lower education level, persistent substance use, forensic history, unemployment, history of physical abuse); b) environment-related (e.g., no family involved in treatment, social adjustment difficulties); c) medication-related (e.g., rapid remission of negative symptoms when starting treatment, therapeutic alliance); and d) illness-related (e.g., more positive symptoms, more relapses). Treatment factors that improve adherence include a good therapeutic alliance and a voluntary first admission when hospitalization occurs.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe results of this review suggest that nonadherence to treatment in FEP is multifactorial.

Previous research has highlighted a method of using just the Internet browser and a text editor to create an app, but this does not eliminate the challenges faced by clinicians. More recently, two methodologies of app development have been shared, but there has not been any disclosures pertaining to the costs involved. In addition, limitations such as the distribution and dissemination of the apps have not been addressed. Objective The aims of this research article are to: (1) highlight a low-cost methodology that clinicians without technical knowledge could use to develop educational apps; (2) clarify the respective costs involved in the process of development; (3) illustrate how limitations pertaining to dissemination could be addressed; and (4) to report initial utilization data of the apps and to share initial users’ self-rated perception of the apps. Methods In this study, we will present two techniques of how to create a mobile app using two of the well-established online mobile app building websites. The costs of development are specified and the methodology of dissemination of the apps will be shared. The application of the low-cost methodologies in the creation of the “Mastering Psychiatry” app for undergraduates and “Déjà vu” app for postgraduates will be discussed. A questionnaire survey has been administered to undergraduate students collating their perceptions towards the app. Results For the Mastering Psychiatry app, a cumulative total of 722 users have used the mobile app since inception, based on our analytics. For the Déjà vu app, there has been a cumulative total of 154 downloads since inception. The utilization data demonstrated the receptiveness towards these apps, and this is reinforced by the positive perceptions undergraduate students (n=185) had towards the low-cost self-developed apps. Conclusions This is one of the few studies that have demonstrated the low-cost methodologies of app development; as well as student and trainee receptivity toward self-created Web-based mobile phone apps. The results obtained have demonstrated that these Web-based low-cost apps are applicable in the real life, and suggest that the methodologies shared in this research paper might be of benefit for other specialities and disciplines.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 11, 'citationCount': 48, 'authors': [{'authorId': '153092720', 'name': 'M.

However, despite widespread use of terms such as adherence and compliance, there is little agreement on definitions or measurements. Nonadherence can be intermittent or continuous, voluntary or involuntary, and may be specific to single or multiple interventions, which makes reliable measurement problematic. Both direct and indirect methods of assessment have their limitations. The current literature focuses mainly on psychotic disorders. A large number of trials of various psychological, social, and pharmacologic interventions has been reported. The results are mixed, but interventions specifically designed to improve adherence with a more intensive and focused approach and interventions combining elements from different approaches such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, family-based, and community-based approaches have shown better outcomes. Pharmacologic interventions include careful drug selection, switching when a treatment is not working, dose adjustment, simplifying the treatment regimen, and the use of long-acting injections. The results for the most studied pharmacologic intervention, ie, long-acting injections, are far from clear, and there are discrepancies between randomized controlled trials, nationwide cohort studies, and mirror-image studies. Nonadherence with treatment is often paid far less attention in routine clinical practice and psychiatric training. Strategies to measure and improve adherence in clinical practice are based more on personal experience than on research evidence.

Ten Strategies for Increasing the Timeliness and Usefulness of eHealth Research', 'abstract': 'Background eHealth interventions appear and change so quickly that they challenge the way we conduct research. By the time a randomized trial of a new intervention is published, technological improvements and clinical discoveries may make the intervention dated and unappealing. This and the spate of health-related apps and websites may lead consumers, patients, and caregivers to use interventions that lack evidence of efficacy. Objective This paper aims to offer strategies for increasing the speed and usefulness of eHealth research. Methods The paper describes two types of strategies based on the authors’ own research and the research literature: those that improve the efficiency of eHealth research, and those that improve its quality. Results Efficiency strategies include: (1) think small: conduct small studies that can target discrete but significant questions and thereby speed knowledge acquisition; (2) use efficient designs: use such methods as fractional-factorial and quasi-experimental designs and surrogate endpoints, and experimentally modify and evaluate interventions and delivery systems already in use; (3) study universals: focus on timeless behavioral, psychological, and cognitive principles and systems; (4) anticipate the next big thing: listen to voices outside normal practice and connect different perspectives for new insights; (5) improve information delivery systems: researchers should apply their communications expertise to enhance inter-researcher communication, which could synergistically accelerate progress and capitalize upon the availability of “big data”; and (6) develop models, including mediators and moderators: valid models are remarkably generative, and tests of moderation and mediation should elucidate boundary conditions of effects and treatment mechanisms. Quality strategies include: (1) continuous quality improvement: researchers need to borrow engineering practices such as the continuous enhancement of interventions to incorporate clinical and technological progress; (2) help consumers identify quality: consumers, clinicians, and others all need to easily identify quality, suggesting the need to efficiently and publicly index intervention quality; (3) reduce the costs of care: concern with health care costs can drive intervention adoption and use and lead to novel intervention effects (eg, reduced falls in the elderly); and (4) deeply understand users: a rigorous evaluation of the consumer’s needs is a key starting point for intervention development.

However, these interventions are often plagued by high attrition rates and varying levels of user adherence. Understanding the role of adherence may be crucial to understanding how program usage influences the effectiveness of e-therapy interventions. Objective: The aim of this study was to systematically review the e-therapy literature to (1) describe the methods used to assess adherence and (2) evaluate the association of adherence with outcome of these interventions. Methods: A systematic review of e-therapy interventions was conducted across disease states and behavioral targets. Data were collected on adherence measures, outcomes, and analyses exploring the relationship between adherence measures and outcomes. Results: Of 69 studies that reported an adherence measure, only 33 (48%) examined the relationship between adherence and outcomes. The number of logins was the most commonly reported measure of adherence, followed by the number of modules completed. The heterogeneity of adherence and outcome measures limited analysis. However, logins appeared to be the measure of adherence most consistently related to outcomes in physical health interventions, while module completion was found to be most related to outcomes in psychological health interventions. Conclusions: There is large variation in the reporting of adherence and the association of adherence with outcomes. A lack of agreement about how best to measure adherence is likely to contribute to the variation in findings. Physical and psychological outcomes seem influenced by different types of adherence. A composite measure encompassing time online, activity completion, and active engagements with the intervention may be the best measure of adherence. Further research is required to establish a consensus for measuring adherence and to understand the role of adherence in influencing outcomes.

The assistant is represented by an animated iCat, which shows different facial expressions and provides cooperative feedback following principles from the motivational interviewing method. We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 118 overweight people over a period of four weeks and studied the difference between diary use with and without computer assistant feedback.

This study explored patterns and predictors of mental health treatment dropout in a nationally representative sample.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData were from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication, a nationally representative household survey. Respondents who had received mental health treatment in the 12 months before the interview (N=1,664) were asked about dropout, which was defined as quitting treatment before the provider wanted them to stop. Cross-tabulation and discrete-time survival analyses were used to identify predictors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nApproximately one-fifth (22%) of patients quit treatment prematurely. The highest dropout rate was from treatment received in the general medical sector (32%), and the lowest was from treatment received by psychiatrists (15%). Dropout rates were intermediate from treatment in the human services sector (20%) and among patients seen by nonpsychiatrist mental health professionals (19%). Over 70% of all dropout occurred after the first or second visits. Mental health insurance was associated with low odds of dropout (odds ratio=.6, 95% confidence interval=.4-.9). Psychiatric comorbidity was associated with a trend toward dropout. Several patient characteristics differentially predicted dropout across treatment sectors and in early and later phases of treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRoughly one-fifth of adults in mental health treatment dropped out before completing the recommended course of treatment.

Methods:We assessed physician behavior and length of visit using audio tapes of encounters of 2 unannounced standardized patients (SPs) with 100 community-based primary care physicians participating in a large managed care organization. Physician behavior was assessed via 3 components of the Measure of Patient-Centered Communication (MPCC) scale.

We used multilevel modeling to examine the associations between physicians’ Patient-Centered Communication during the SP visits and ratings of trust by both patients and SPs. Results:Component 1 of the MPCC, which explored the patient's experience of the disease and illness, was independently associated with patient's rating of trust in their physician.

In this study, cognitive processing therapy (CPT) was administered in a Veterans Affairs (VA) posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) specialty clinic in which training and supervision were provided following VA implementation guidelines. The aim was to (a) estimate the proportion of variability in outcome attributable to therapists and (b) identify characteristics of those therapists who produced better outcomes.\n\n\nMETHOD\nWe used an archival database of veterans (n = 192) who completed 12 sessions of CPT by therapists (n = 25) who were trained by 2 nationally recognized trainers, 1 of whom also provided weekly group supervision. Multilevel modeling was used to estimate therapist effects, with therapists treated as a random factor. The supervisor was asked to retrospectively rate each therapist in terms of perceived effectiveness based on supervision interactions. Using single case study design, the supervisor was interviewed to determine what criteria she used to rate the therapists and emerging themes were coded.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWhen initial level of severity on the PTSD Checklist (PCL; McDonald & Calhoun, 2010; Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska, & Keane, 1993) was taken into account, approximately 12% of the variability in the PCL at the end of treatment was due to therapists. The trainer, blind to the results, identified the following characteristics and actions of effective therapists: effectively addressing patient avoidance, language used in supervision, flexible interpersonal style, and ability to develop a strong therapeutic alliance.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study adds to the growing body of literature documenting the importance of the individual therapist as an important factor in the change process.', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 78, 'citationCount': 73, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5467507', 'name': 'Kevin M.

1,3,e21e6fed35fee4476c0d3feda82ccd38390139e6,Design and Evaluation of Personalized Motivational Messages by a Virtual Agent that Assists in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Therapy,"Background Systems incorporating virtual agents can play a major role in electronic-mental (e-mental) health care, as barriers to care still prevent some patients from receiving the help they need. To properly assist the users of these systems, a virtual agent needs to promote motivation. This can be done by offering motivational messages. Objective The objective of this study was two-fold. The first was to build a motivational message system for a virtual agent assisting in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) therapy based on domain knowledge from experts. The second was to test the hypotheses that (1) computer-generated motivating messages influence users’ motivation to continue with therapy, trust in a good therapy outcome, and the feeling of being heard by the agent and (2) personalized messages outperform generic messages on these factors. Methods A system capable of generating motivational messages was built by analyzing expert (N=13) knowledge on what types of motivational statements to use in what situation. To test the 2 hypotheses, a Web-based study was performed (N=207). Participants were asked to imagine they were in a certain situation, specified by the progression of their symptoms and initial trust in a good therapy outcome. After this, they received a message from a virtual agent containing either personalized motivation as generated by the system, general motivation, or no motivational content. They were asked how this message changed their motivation to continue and trust in a good outcome as well as how much they felt they were being heard by the agent. Results Overall, findings confirmed the first hypothesis, as well as the second hypothesis for the measure feeling of being heard by the agent. Personalization of the messages was also shown to be important in those situations where the symptoms were getting worse. In these situations, personalized messages outperformed general messages both in terms of motivation to continue and trust in a good therapy outcome. Conclusions Expert input can successfully be used to develop a personalized motivational message system. Messages generated by such a system seem to improve people’s motivation and trust in PTSD therapy as well as the user’s feeling of being heard by a virtual agent. Given the importance of motivation, trust, and therapeutic alliance for successful therapy, we anticipate that the proposed system can improve adherence in e-mental therapy for PTSD and that it can provide a blueprint for the development of an adaptive system for persuasive messages based on expert input.",2017,70,15,"{'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research', 'volume': '21'}","{'model':

Help4Mood aims to support the treatment of patients with Major Depression using Information and Communications Technology (ICT). The resultant Personal Health System (PHS) of Help4Mood uses a set of activity sensors (such as wrist watch, key ring, or under-mattress sensor) that gather information about the daily physical and sleep activities from the patient. This information and other data obtained through standardized questionnaires are analysed in order to infer some recommendations (or alerts) and offer adaptive and tailored tasks as part of the treatment in the form of daily interactive sessions provided by a Virtual Agent (VA). The initial developed work for the project resulted in the MSc Thesis entitled “Generic Data Processing & Analysis Architecture of a Personal Health System to Manage Daily Interactive Sessions in Patients with Major Depression” (Breso, 2013) within the Artificial Intelligence, Pattern Recognition and Digital Imaging MSc program at the Technical University of Valencia. In this MSc Thesis, the author describes the design and the implementation of the Data Processing & Analysis layer of the Help4Mood’s PHS. It had been conceived as the module responsible to analyse relevant patient’s data, plan the daily interactive sessions and recommend a set of tailored activities configured by clinicians that help in the recovery of the patient. Additionally, this system included an initial cognitive-emotional module aimed to infer the specific set of emotions to be displayed by the VA during the interaction The research work presented in this document is an extension of the work done in the MSc's Thesis. The proposed extension will allow a deeper research on how to improve current Human-Agent Interactions particularly addressed to users that are under treatment of Major Depression. Some theories in the areas of psychology and cognitive science will be the basis of a computational model that is expected to improve the production of the daily session’s content and the adequate –emotional– fashion for a better engagement of the users promoting the long-term use of the system."", 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 53, 'citationCount': 9, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3352168', 'name': 'A.

In Internet-based eHealth interventions, ECAs may be used for the delivery of automated human support factors. Objective We aim to provide an overview of the technological and clinical possibilities, as well as the evidence base for ECA applications in clinical psychology, to inform health professionals about the activity in this field of research. Methods Given the large variety of applied methodologies, types of applications, and scientific disciplines involved in ECA research, we conducted a systematic scoping review. Scoping reviews aim to map key concepts and types of evidence underlying an area of research, and answer less-specific questions than traditional systematic reviews. Systematic searches for ECA applications in the treatment of mood, anxiety, psychotic, autism spectrum, and substance use disorders were conducted in databases in the fields of psychology and computer science, as well as in interdisciplinary databases. Studies were included if they conveyed primary research findings on an ECA application that targeted one of the disorders. We mapped each study’s background information, how the different disorders were addressed, how ECAs and users could interact with one another, methodological aspects, and the study’s aims and outcomes. Results This study included N=54 publications (N=49 studies). More than half of the studies (n=26) focused on autism treatment, and ECAs were used most often for social skills training (n=23). Applications ranged from simple reinforcement of social behaviors through emotional expressions to sophisticated multimodal conversational systems. Most applications (n=43) were still in the development and piloting phase, that is, not yet ready for routine practice evaluation or application. Few studies conducted controlled research into clinical effects of ECAs, such as a reduction in symptom severity. Conclusions ECAs for mental disorders are emerging. State-of-the-art techniques, involving, for example, communication through natural language or nonverbal behavior, are increasingly being considered and adopted for psychotherapeutic interventions in ECA research with promising results. However, evidence on their clinical application remains scarce. At present, their value to clinical practice lies mostly in the experimental determination of critical human support factors. In the context of using ECAs as an adjunct to existing interventions with the aim of supporting users, important questions remain with regard to the personalization of ECAs’ interaction with users, and the optimal timing and manner of providing support. To increase the evidence base with regard to Internet interventions, we propose an additional focus on low-tech ECA solutions that can be rapidly developed, tested, and applied in routine practice.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 85, 'citationCount': 247, 'authors': [{'authorId': '39888309', 'name': 'Simon Provoost'}, {'authorId': '4940640', 'name': 'Ho Ming Lau'}, {'authorId': '3003041', 'name': 'J.

Insomnia impairs people’s daily life and their quality of life decreases. Approximately 10% of the population suffers from insomnia. The common treatment for insomnia is cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), mostly delivered by a therapist that people see once a week. A disadvantage of the current practice of insomnia treatment is the limited accessibility of insomnia treatment. Moreover, adherence to CBT-I exercises seems to be difficult. A virtual sleep coach that is provided through a smartphone might be a possible solution to both of these drawbacks. A virtual coach is never tired, never frustrated, never forgets things, and never gives up. Furthermore, it could improve accessibility, give tailored background information, offer personalized advice and feedback, monitor progress, provide support, and automatically track behaviour. Additionally, the majority of people in wealthy nations own a smartphone and emerging countries are expected to follow soon, making this type of intervention readily accessible to a large group of people. In short, a virtual sleep coach seems to be a good opportunity to improve traditional CBT-I. Concurrent to developing such a virtual sleep coach, answers to the question of how persuasive strategies can contribute to treatment adherence in an effective virtual sleep coach are explored.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 16, 'citationCount': 2, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3369200', 'name': 'Corine H.

For this purpose, a randomized trial was conducted among 465 Dutch adults, comparing three web-based computer-tailored MI/SDT PA interventions, including (i) exclusively open-ended questions (without skillful reflections), (ii) exclusively multiple choice questions (with skillful reflections) and (iii) including both question types (with skillful reflections). Measurements included motivation-related determinants of PA and process variables, measured at baseline, directly following the intervention and 1-month post-intervention. Results suggest that open-ended questions represent an important element in web-based MI in terms of effect on autonomous motivation. In order to optimize appreciation of the intervention, a combination of both open-ended and multiple choice question types seems to hold most promise.

Internet interventions are assumed to be cost-effective. However, it is unclear how strong this evidence is, and what the quality of this evidence is. Method. A comprehensive literature search (1990–2014) in Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, NHS Economic Evaluations Database, NHS Health Technology Assessment Database, Office of Health Economics Evaluations Database, Compendex and Inspec was conducted. We included economic evaluations alongside randomized controlled trials of Internet interventions for a range of mental health symptoms compared to a control group, consisting of a psychological or pharmaceutical intervention, treatment-as-usual (TAU), wait-list or an attention control group. Results. Of the 6587 abstracts identified, 16 papers met the inclusion criteria. Nine studies featured a societal perspective. Results demonstrated that guided Internet interventions for depression, anxiety, smoking cessation and alcohol consumption had favourable probabilities of being more cost-effective when compared to wait-list, TAU, group cognitive behaviour therapy (CBGT), attention control, telephone counselling or unguided Internet CBT. Unguided Internet interventions for suicide prevention, depression and smoking cessation demonstrated cost-effectiveness compared to TAU or attention control. In general, results from cost-utility analyses using more generic health outcomes (quality of life) were less favourable for unguided Internet interventions. Most studies adhered reasonably to economic guidelines. Conclusions.

Data were collected from 348 sales and servicing employees and their supervisors in four private retail companies and five private manufacturing companies located in Southeast China. The results showed that both affect-based trust and cognition-based trust mediated the relationship between transformational leadership and followers’ helping behavior towards coworkers. Furthermore, moderated mediation analyses showed that affect-based trust mediated the relationship between transformational leadership and followers’ helping behavior towards coworkers only among employees with high prosocial motivation, whereas cognition-based trust mediated this relationship among only those with low prosocial motivation.

Ten Strategies for Increasing the Timeliness and Usefulness of eHealth Research', 'abstract': 'Background eHealth interventions appear and change so quickly that they challenge the way we conduct research. By the time a randomized trial of a new intervention is published, technological improvements and clinical discoveries may make the intervention dated and unappealing. This and the spate of health-related apps and websites may lead consumers, patients, and caregivers to use interventions that lack evidence of efficacy. Objective This paper aims to offer strategies for increasing the speed and usefulness of eHealth research. Methods The paper describes two types of strategies based on the authors’ own research and the research literature: those that improve the efficiency of eHealth research, and those that improve its quality. Results Efficiency strategies include: (1) think small: conduct small studies that can target discrete but significant questions and thereby speed knowledge acquisition; (2) use efficient designs: use such methods as fractional-factorial and quasi-experimental designs and surrogate endpoints, and experimentally modify and evaluate interventions and delivery systems already in use; (3) study universals: focus on timeless behavioral, psychological, and cognitive principles and systems; (4) anticipate the next big thing: listen to voices outside normal practice and connect different perspectives for new insights; (5) improve information delivery systems: researchers should apply their communications expertise to enhance inter-researcher communication, which could synergistically accelerate progress and capitalize upon the availability of “big data”; and (6) develop models, including mediators and moderators: valid models are remarkably generative, and tests of moderation and mediation should elucidate boundary conditions of effects and treatment mechanisms. Quality strategies include: (1) continuous quality improvement: researchers need to borrow engineering practices such as the continuous enhancement of interventions to incorporate clinical and technological progress; (2) help consumers identify quality: consumers, clinicians, and others all need to easily identify quality, suggesting the need to efficiently and publicly index intervention quality; (3) reduce the costs of care: concern with health care costs can drive intervention adoption and use and lead to novel intervention effects (eg, reduced falls in the elderly); and (4) deeply understand users: a rigorous evaluation of the consumer’s needs is a key starting point for intervention development. Conclusions The challenges of distinguishing and distributing scientifically validated interventions are formidable. The strategies described are meant to spur discussion and further thinking, which are important, given the potential of eHealth interventions to help patients and families.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 64, 'citationCount': 193, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2413288', 'name': 'T.

In treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), it may be particularly important to establish a strong early alliance to facilitate treatment adherence. However, factors such as childhood sexual abuse (CSA) history and poor social support may impede the development of early alliance in those receiving PTSD treatment. We sought to examine treatment adherence, CSA history, and social support as factors associated with early alliance in individuals with chronic PTSD who were receiving either prolonged exposure therapy (PE) or sertraline.\n\n\nMETHOD\nAt pretreatment, participants (76.6% female; 64.9% Caucasian; mean age = 37.1 years, SD = 11.3) completed measures of trauma history, general support (Inventory of Socially Supportive Behaviors), and trauma-related social support (Social Reactions Questionnaire). Over the course of 10 weeks of PE or sertraline, they completed early therapeutic alliance (Working Alliance Inventory) and treatment adherence measures.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEarly alliance was associated with PE adherence (r = .32, p < .05) and overall treatment completion (r = .19, p < .05). Only trauma-related social support predicted the strength of early alliance beyond the effects of treatment condition (β = .23, p < .05); CSA history was not predictive of a lower early alliance.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGiven the associations with adherence, clinicians may find it useful to routinely assess alliance early in treatment.

Consequently, we designed a persuasive computer assistant and evaluated its influence on self-management, i.e., the use of an online lifestyle diary called DieetInzicht.nl. The assistant is represented by an animated iCat, which shows different facial expressions and provides cooperative feedback following principles from the motivational interviewing method. We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 118 overweight people over a period of four weeks and studied the difference between diary use with and without computer assistant feedback. Results show that the computer assistant contributed to filling in the diary more frequently, reduced the decline in motivation to perform self-management, lowered the (reported) BMI, and improved the ease of use. Furthermore, diary use increased knowledge of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Finally, personal characteristics, i.e., locus of control, vocabulary, computer experience, age, gender, education level and initial BMI, explained the variance in the diary use and its outcome. Of the 118 participants 35 filled in the closing survey, covering motivation, BMI, lifestyle knowledge and ease of use, which implies that the findings based on these results are mainly representative for motivated participants.

Immediately after the encounter, both patients and physicians completed a questionnaire assessing satisfaction with the visit.\n SETTING: The outpatient division of an academic teaching hospital.\n PARTICIPANTS: Thirty residents and specialists in general internal medicine, rheumatology, and gastroenterology, and 330 patients having a follow-up appointment with one of these physicians.\n MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients’ and physicians’ visit-specific satisfaction was assessed using 5 Visual Analogue Scales (0 to 100). Patients’ overall satisfaction was higher than physicians’ satisfaction (mean 81 vs. 66), and correlation of patients’ and physicians’ overall satisfaction with the specific visit was medium sized (r=.28, P<.001). Patients’ satisfaction ratings were associated with their previsit self-efficacy in communicating with their physician (P<.001) and with visiting a female physician (P<.01). Physicians’ satisfaction was associated with patients’ higher educational level (P<.05), primary language being Dutch (P<.001), better mental health (P<.05), and preference for receiving less than full information (P<.05).\n CONCLUSIONS: In an outpatient setting, patients’ visit-specific satisfaction ratings were substantially higher than, and only moderately associated with, physicians’ ratings of the same visit. The dissimilar predictors explaining patients’ and physicians’ satisfaction suggest that patients and physicians form their opinion about a consultation in different ways.

AIM: To determine whether the PCL-5 is worth the extra effort that administration requires from the patient. METHOD: Pretest and retest measurement results of the PCL-5 and the OQ-45 were compared head-to-head in 464 patients from the Sinai Center of Arkin. RESULTS: The correlations between scores on the instruments were high and analysis of variance for repeated measurements revealed no difference in responsiveness. Comparison of Cohen's d (0.49 vs. 0.43) and Delta T (5.0 vs. 4.4), indicated a slightly better responsiveness of the PCL-5 and also the proportion of recovered patients was greater according to the PCL-5 compared to the OQ-SD. CONCLUSION: At first glance, the PCL-5 and the OQ-SD were equally sensitive to detect change during treatment. However, the PCL-5 provided more detailed information about the nature and severity of symptomatology in an individual patient and with the PCL-5 we were slightly better able to demonstrate clinical significant change than with the OQ-SD.

[1] It has been published by the American Psychiatric Association and two years ago the fifth edition was released. [2] Croatian was among the first languages this book was translated to. [3] DSM-5 was translated by psychiatrists and psychologists, mainly from the University psychiatric hospital Vrapce and published by the Naklada Slap publisher.DSM has always been more publicly debated than the other main classification - the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). [4] The same happened with this fifth edition. Even before it was released, numerous individuals, organizations, groups and associations were publicly speaking about the classification, new diagnostic entities and changing criteria. [5]Although there is a tendency of authors of both DSM and ICD to synchronize these two classifications and to make them more harmonized with each new edition, there are several differences among them. While ICD covers all the diseases, disorders and reasons for making a contact with the health system, DSM covers ""only"" mental disorders. Other disorders (medical conditions, as they are named in DSM-5) are not included, except in situations when they lead to a development of a mental disorder. The other main difference is that DSM is more operational zed, and gives criteria for each of the disorders, listing how many criteria have to be met to make a diagnosis of a particular disorder, and what excluding criteria are.Due to the fact that it is used all around the globe and since it has become the most used psychiatric manual, it is sometimes said that DSM is a ""psychiatric Bible"". [6]Some critics of DSM say that it stigmatizes people and that in each edition it includes more diagnostic entities. It is true that in each edition of DSM there are more disorders listed, but this is due to the fact that medicine is a developing area and new insights are made every year, so some disorders are separated into different subtypes or subgroups and different new diagnoses, giving the impression more behaviour are being pathologized. The intention of the authors was to make more homogenous groups. But, the truth is that, compared with ICD, it is more difficult to get a diagnosis in DSM, than in ICD, with the same clinical presentation. [7] DSM requires functional impairment or distress to pathologize behaviour, while in ICD this criterion is not present in every case.During the process of developing DSM-5 there was an open public discussion. [2] For over a year any person was able to participate in the discussion about future criteria, inclusion or exclusion of diagnostic entities from DSM. More than 21000 letters was sent to the authors. This was the unprecedented way of developing a classification that ICD now tries to follow in preparation of its 11th edition.As a direct consequence of such an open and wide discussion, some new disorders were included (e.g. hoarding disorder), some were excluded even though they were included during the proposal period (e.g. hypersexual disorders), some were heavily debated (e.g. narcissistic personality disorder). [8-10]As previously mentioned, DSM and ICD systems try to harmonize more. There were more non-American authors included in DSM-5 than ever before and some of the experts in the field were in the task force of DSM-5 and ICD-11. [2, 11]What is new in DSM-5, compared to DSM-IV. The organization of the chapters has been changed, so now the flow of the disorders follow life cycle. The book starts with neurodevelopmental disorders, followed by schizophrenia, bipolar and depressive disorders, and closing with neurocognitive disorders. …', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 18464, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2166705', 'name': 'G.

Scenarios are a vocabulary for coordinating the central tasks of system development\x97understanding people\'s needs, envisioning new activities and technologies, designing effective systems and software, and drawing general lessons from systems as they are developed and used.

2,4,f8c5a3df26aa68fda00eb3f9d9f46d4bab7dc8b6,JAYLA (Junior Agent to typifY Levels of Autism): A Virtual Training Platform to Teach Severity Levels of Autism,"This initial exploratory study’s primary focus is to investigate the effectiveness of a virtual patient training platform to present a health condition with a range of symptoms and severity levels. The secondary goal is to examine visualization’s role in better demonstrating variances of symptoms and severity levels to improve learning outcomes. We designed and developed a training platform with a four-year-old pediatric virtual patient named JAYLA to teach medical learners the spectrum of symptoms and severity levels of Autism Spectrum Disorder in young children. JAYLA presents three sets of verbal and nonverbal behaviors associated with age-appropriate, mild autism, and severe autism. To better distinguish the severity levels, we designed an innovative interface called the spectrum-view, displaying all three simulated severity levels side-by-side and within the eye span. We compared its effectiveness with a traditional single-view interface, displaying only one severity level at a time. We performed a user study with thirty-four pediatric trainees to evaluate JAYLA’s effectiveness. Results suggest that training with JAYLA improved the trainees’ performance in careful observation and accurate classification of real children’s behaviors in video vignettes. However, we did not find any significant difference between the two interface conditions. The findings demonstrate the applicability of the JAYLA platform to enhance professional training for early detection of autism in young children, which is essential to improve the quality of life for affected individuals, their families, and society.",2021,67,0,{'volume': '2'},"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-4.0973310470581055, -5.540541172027588, 1.3906543254852295, 4.633603572845459,

Head motion, and eye gaze of both interlocutors were recorded, replicated to the avatars and displayed to the partner through a distributed virtual environment. The nonverbal behavior of both interaction partners was recorded, and resulting preprocessed data was classified with up to 92.9parcent classification accuracy, with the amount of eye area focus and the average horizontal gaze change being the most relevant features.

The aims of the study were to explore metabolic perturbations in autism, to investigate whether the severity of autism core symptoms may be associated with specific metabolic signatures; and to examine whether the urine metabolome discriminates severe from mild-to-moderate restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped behaviors. We enrolled 57 children aged 2–11 years; thirty-one with idiopathic autism and twenty-six neurotypical (NT), matched for age and ethnicity. The urine metabolome was investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The urinary metabolome of autistic children was largely distinguishable from that of NT children; food selectivity induced further significant metabolic differences. Severe autism spectrum disorder core deficits were marked by high levels of metabolites resulting from diet, gut dysbiosis, oxidative stress, tryptophan metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction. The hierarchical clustering algorithm generated two metabolic clusters in autistic children: 85–90% of children with mild-to-moderate abnormal behaviors fell in cluster II.

Surveillance is conducted in two phases. The first phase involves review and abstraction of comprehensive evaluations that were completed by medical and educational service providers in the community. In the second phase, experienced clinicians who systematically review all abstracted information determine ASD case status. The case definition is based on ASD criteria described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor 2016, across all 11 sites, ASD prevalence was 18.5 per 1,000 (one in 54) children aged 8 years, and ASD was 4.3 times as prevalent among boys as among girls. ASD prevalence varied by site, ranging from 13.1 (Colorado) to 31.4 (New Jersey). Prevalence estimates were approximately identical for non-Hispanic white (white), non-Hispanic black (black), and Asian/Pacific Islander children (18.5, 18.3, and 17.9, respectively) but lower for Hispanic children (15.4). Among children with ASD for whom data on intellectual or cognitive functioning were available, 33% were classified as having intellectual disability (intelligence quotient [IQ] ≤70); this percentage was higher among girls than boys (40% versus 32%) and among black and Hispanic than white children (47%, 36%, and 27%, respectively). Black children with ASD were less likely to have a first evaluation by age 36 months than were white children with ASD (40% versus 45%). The overall median age at earliest known ASD diagnosis (51 months) was similar by sex and racial and ethnic groups; however, black children with IQ ≤70 had a later median age at ASD diagnosis than white children with IQ ≤70 (48 months versus 42 months).\n\n\nINTERPRETATION\nThe prevalence of ASD varied considerably across sites and was higher than previous estimates since 2014. Although no overall difference in ASD prevalence between black and white children aged 8 years was observed, the disparities for black children persisted in early evaluation and diagnosis of ASD. Hispanic children also continue to be identified as having ASD less frequently than white or black children.\n\n\nPUBLIC HEALTH ACTION\nThese findings highlight the variability in the evaluation and detection of ASD across communities and between sociodemographic groups.

Children and youth with ASD have service needs in behavioral, educational, health, leisure, family support, and other areas. Standardized screening for ASD at 18 and 24 months of age with ongoing developmental surveillance continues to be recommended in primary care (although it may be performed in other settings), because ASD is common, can be diagnosed as young as 18 months of age, and has evidenced-based interventions that may improve function. More accurate and culturally sensitive screening approaches are needed. Primary care providers should be familiar with the diagnostic criteria for ASD, appropriate etiologic evaluation, and co-occurring medical and behavioral conditions (such as disorders of sleep and feeding, gastrointestinal tract symptoms, obesity, seizures, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and wandering) that affect the child’s function and quality of life.

Period Covered 2014. Description of System The Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network is an active surveillance system that provides estimates of the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) among children aged 8 years whose parents or guardians reside within 11 ADDM sites in the United States (Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Wisconsin). ADDM surveillance is conducted in two phases. The first phase involves review and abstraction of comprehensive evaluations that were completed by professional service providers in the community. Staff completing record review and abstraction receive extensive training and supervision and are evaluated according to strict reliability standards to certify effective initial training, identify ongoing training needs, and ensure adherence to the prescribed methodology. Record review and abstraction occurs in a variety of data sources ranging from general pediatric health clinics to specialized programs serving children with developmental disabilities. In addition, most of the ADDM sites also review records for children who have received special education services in public schools. In the second phase of the study, all abstracted information is reviewed systematically by experienced clinicians to determine ASD case status. A child is considered to meet the surveillance case definition for ASD if he or she displays behaviors, as described on one or more comprehensive evaluations completed by community-based professional providers, consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnostic criteria for autistic disorder; pervasive developmental disorder–not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS, including atypical autism); or Asperger disorder. This report provides updated ASD prevalence estimates for children aged 8 years during the 2014 surveillance year, on the basis of DSM-IV-TR criteria, and describes characteristics of the population of children with ASD. In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association published the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), which made considerable changes to ASD diagnostic criteria. The change in ASD diagnostic criteria might influence ADDM ASD prevalence estimates; therefore, most (85%) of the records used to determine prevalence estimates based on DSM-IV-TR criteria underwent additional review under a newly operationalized surveillance case definition for ASD consistent with the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Children meeting this new surveillance case definition could qualify on the basis of one or both of the following criteria, as documented in abstracted comprehensive evaluations: 1) behaviors consistent with the DSM-5 diagnostic features; and/or 2) an ASD diagnosis, whether based on DSM-IV-TR or DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Stratified comparisons of the number of children meeting either of these two case definitions also are reported. Results For 2014, the overall prevalence of ASD among the 11 ADDM sites was 16.8 per 1,000 (one in 59) children aged 8 years. Overall ASD prevalence estimates varied among sites, from 13.1–29.3 per 1,000 children aged 8 years. ASD prevalence estimates also varied by sex and race/ethnicity. Males were four times more likely than females to be identified with ASD. Prevalence estimates were higher for non-Hispanic white (henceforth, white) children compared with non-Hispanic black (henceforth, black) children, and both groups were more likely to be identified with ASD compared with Hispanic children. Among the nine sites with sufficient data on intellectual ability, 31% of children with ASD were classified in the range of intellectual disability (intelligence quotient [IQ] <70), 25% were in the borderline range (IQ 71–85), and 44% had IQ scores in the average to above average range (i.e., IQ >85). The distribution of intellectual ability varied by sex and race/ethnicity. Although mention of developmental concerns by age 36 months was documented for 85% of children with ASD, only 42% had a comprehensive evaluation on record by age 36 months. The median age of earliest known ASD diagnosis was 52 months and did not differ significantly by sex or race/ethnicity. For the targeted comparison of DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 results, the number and characteristics of children meeting the newly operationalized DSM-5 case definition for ASD were similar to those meeting the DSM-IV-TR case definition, with DSM-IV-TR case counts exceeding DSM-5 counts by less than 5% and approximately 86% overlap between the two case definitions (kappa = 0.85). Interpretation Findings from the ADDM Network, on the basis of 2014 data reported from 11 sites, provide updated population-based estimates of the prevalence of ASD among children aged 8 years in multiple communities in the United States. The overall ASD prevalence estimate of 16.8 per 1,000 children aged 8 years in 2014 is higher than previously reported estimates from the ADDM Network. Because the ADDM sites do not provide a representative sample of the entire United States, the combined prevalence estimates presented in this report cannot be generalized to all children aged 8 years in the United States. Consistent with reports from previous ADDM surveillance years, findings from 2014 were marked by variation in ASD prevalence when stratified by geographic area, sex, and level of intellectual ability. Differences in prevalence estimates between black and white children have diminished in most sites, but remained notable for Hispanic children. For 2014, results from application of the DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 case definitions were similar, overall and when stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, DSM-IV-TR diagnostic subtype, or level of intellectual ability. Public Health Action Beginning with surveillance year 2016, the DSM-5 case definition will serve as the basis for ADDM estimates of ASD prevalence in future surveillance reports. Although the DSM-IV-TR case definition will eventually be phased out, it will be applied in a limited geographic area to offer additional data for comparison. Future analyses will examine trends in the continued use of DSM-IV-TR diagnoses, such as autistic disorder, PDD-NOS, and Asperger disorder in health and education records, documentation of symptoms consistent with DSM-5 terminology, and how these trends might influence estimates of ASD prevalence over time. The latest findings from the ADDM Network provide evidence that the prevalence of ASD is higher than previously reported estimates and continues to vary among certain racial/ethnic groups and communities. With prevalence of ASD ranging from 13.1 to 29.3 per 1,000 children aged 8 years in different communities throughout the United States, the need for behavioral, educational, residential, and occupational services remains high, as does the need for increased research on both genetic and nongenetic risk factors for ASD.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 31, 'citationCount': 2879, 'authors': [{'authorId': '123588846', 'name': 'J.

One of the areas where particular difficulties are observable is the understanding of non-verbal communication cues. Thus, investigating the underlying psychological processes and neural mechanisms of non-verbal communication in HFA allows a better understanding of this disorder, and potentially enables the development of more efficient forms of psychotherapy and trainings. However, the research on non-verbal information processing in HFA faces several methodological challenges. The use of virtual characters (VCs) helps to overcome such challenges by enabling an ecologically valid experience of social presence, and by providing an experimental platform that can be systematically and fully controlled. To make this field of research accessible to a broader audience, we elaborate in the first part of the review the validity of using VCs in non-verbal behavior research on HFA, and we review current relevant paradigms and findings from social-cognitive neuroscience. In the second part, we argue for the use of VCs as either agents or avatars in the context of “transformed social interactions.” This allows for the implementation of real-time social interaction in virtual experimental settings, which represents a more sensitive measure of socio-communicative impairments in HFA.

Current data on prevalence, level of functioning, and place of residence were combined with mean annual costs of services and support, opportunity costs, and productivity losses of individuals with ASDs with or without intellectual disability.\n\n\nEXPOSURE\nPresence of ASDs.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nMean annual medical, nonmedical, and indirect economic costs and lifetime costs were measured for individuals with ASDs separately for individuals with and without intellectual disability in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe cost of supporting an individual with an ASD and intellectual disability during his or her lifespan was $2.4 million in the United States and £1.5 million (US $2.2 million) in the United Kingdom. The cost of supporting an individual with an ASD without intellectual disability was $1.4 million in the United States and £0.92 million (US $1.4 million) in the United Kingdom. The largest cost components for children were special education services and parental productivity loss. During adulthood, residential care or supportive living accommodation and individual productivity loss contributed the highest costs. Medical costs were much higher for adults than for children.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nThe substantial direct and indirect economic effect of ASDs emphasizes the need to continue to search for effective interventions that make best use of scarce societal resources.

Methods: The use of computer-based intervention (CBI) in the treatment of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may offer some advantages to traditional one-to-one or group instruction including easier differentiation of instruction, decreased distractions and the incorporation of an individual's relative visual learning strengths. However, the results of past research suggest varying outcomes for CBI with individuals with ASD. This review provides a systematic analysis of studies investigating CBI to improve social and emotional skills (e.g. emotion recognition) of individuals with ASD. Electronic database searches and ancestral searches were used to identify studies that met pre-determined inclusion criteria. The included studies were then summarized in terms of: (a) participant characteristics, (b) social and emotional skills targeted, (c) details of the CBI, (d) results, and (e) certainty of evidence. Results: The results of these studies indicated that CBI's effect on social and emotional skills was mixed, with the majority of studies reporting unacceptable outcomes following intervention. Conclusions: Overall, this review suggests that the use of CBI to improve the social and emotional skills of individuals with ASD is a promising practice. A comparison of CBI plus tutoring and face-to-face social skills training suggests that CBI can be as effective as face-to-face instruction.

As a first step in developing this general understanding of comparison, we propose a general taxonomy of visual designs for comparison that groups designs into three basic categories, which can be combined. To clarify the taxonomy and validate its completeness, we provide a survey of work in information visualization related to comparison. Although we find a great diversity of systems and approaches, we see that all designs are assembled from the building blocks of juxtaposition, superposition and explicit encodings.

Primary care physicians can enhance the health and quality of life of children with autism by providing high-quality and comprehensive primary care. OBJECTIVE. To explore physicians’ perspectives on primary care for children with autism. METHODS. National mail and e-mail surveys were sent to a random sample of 2325 general pediatricians and 775 family physicians from April 2007 to October 2007. RESULTS. The response rate was 19%. Physicians reported significantly lower overall self-perceived competency, a greater need for primary care improvement, and a greater desire for education for children with autism compared with both children with other neurodevelopmental conditions and those with chronic/complex medical conditions. The following barriers to providing primary care were endorsed as greater for children with autism: lack of care coordination, reimbursement and physician education, family skeptical of traditional medicine and vaccines, and patients using complementary alternative medicine. Adjusting for key demographic variables, predictors of both higher perceived autism competency and encouraging an empirically supported therapy, applied behavior analysis, included having a greater number of autism patient visits, having a friend or relative with autism, and previous training about autism. CONCLUSIONS. Primary care physicians report a lack of self-perceived competency, a desire for education, and a need for improvement in primary care for children with autism.

These faces can be used as well-controlled, realistic and dynamic stimuli in emotion research. However, the validity of virtual facial expressions in comparison to natural emotion displays still needs to be shown for the different emotions and different age groups. Methodology/Principal Findings Thirty-two healthy volunteers between the age of 20 and 60 rated pictures of natural human faces and faces of virtual characters (avatars) with respect to the expressed emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and neutral. Results indicate that virtual emotions were recognized comparable to natural ones. Recognition differences in virtual and natural faces depended on specific emotions: whereas disgust was difficult to convey with the current avatar technology, virtual sadness and fear achieved better recognition results than natural faces. Furthermore, emotion recognition rates decreased for virtual but not natural faces in participants over the age of 40. This specific age effect suggests that media exposure has an influence on emotion recognition. Conclusions/Significance Virtual and natural facial displays of emotion may be equally effective. Improved technology (e.g. better modelling of the naso-labial area) may lead to even better results as compared to trained actors.

A central characteristic of SBME is its unique approach to making (and learning from) mistakes, which is regarded as a powerful educational experience and as an opportunity for professional improvement. The basic assumption underlying SBME is that increased practice in learning from mistakes and in error management in a simulated environment will reduce occurrences of errors in real life and will provide professionals with the correct attitude and skills to cope competently with those mistakes that could not be prevented. The main message of the present paper is that this assumption, which serves as the driving force of SBME, should also serve as a starting point for critical thinking and questioning regarding the multiple aspects and components of SBME. These questions, in turn, should lead to empirical research that will provide feedback concerning changes that may be necessary in order to attain the goal of improving medical professionals’ performance. Based on such research, SBME will be held accountable for its outcomes, i.e. whether its educational techniques indeed result in decreased occurrence of errors or not, and whether the ability to cope with the errors that do occur is significantly improved. The first of three issues that were addressed concerns individuals’ experience of performing mistakes. It is suggested that in order to benefit fully from the experience of performing mistakes in a simulated context, medical educators should create a balance between the emotional load associated with the experience and the professional lessons that can be learned. Furthermore, research should focus on the long-term effects of the experience in changing professionals’ attitudes and behaviour. The second question concerned the contribution of the different components of the educational experience to creating the desired changes in professionals’ performance. Analysis of the teaching and learning involved in each stage of the educational event should serve as the basis for research that aims at identifying the unique contribution and efficiency of each element, and defining the essential core activities of a simulated experience. Finally, the need to define a newly emerging profession—SBME educator—was addressed. The professional qualifications are, clearly, multidisciplinary and should be based on the growing experience of medical educators in training students and professionals. Defining the profession is essential in order to create academic environments in which professionals will be trained to develop and implement new programmes, accompanied by research and assessment.', 'year': 2005, 'referenceCount': 22, 'citationCount': 346, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3123954', 'name': 'A.

Background and context:\u2002Simulations are now in widespread use in medical education and medical personnel evaluation. Outcomes research on the use and effectiveness of simulation technology in medical education is scattered, inconsistent and varies widely in methodological rigor and substantive focus. Objectives:\u2002Review and synthesize existing evidence in educational science that addresses the question, ‘What are the features and uses of high-fidelity medical simulations that lead to most effective learning?’. Search strategy: The search covered five literature databases (ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Timelit) and employed 91 single search terms and concepts and their Boolean combinations. Hand searching, Internet searches and attention to the ‘grey literature’ were also used. The aim was to perform the most thorough literature search possible of peer-reviewed publications and reports in the unpublished literature that have been judged for academic quality. Inclusion and exclusion criteria:\u2002Four screening criteria were used to reduce the initial pool of 670 journal articles to a focused set of 109 studies: (a) elimination of review articles in favor of empirical studies; (b) use of a simulator as an educational assessment or intervention with learner outcomes measured quantitatively; (c) comparative research, either experimental or quasi-experimental; and (d) research that involves simulation as an educational intervention. Data extraction:\u2002Data were extracted systematically from the 109 eligible journal articles by independent coders. Each coder used a standardized data extraction protocol. Data synthesis:\u2002Qualitative data synthesis and tabular presentation of research methods and outcomes were used. Heterogeneity of research designs, educational interventions, outcome measures and timeframe precluded data synthesis using meta-analysis. Headline results:\u2002Coding accuracy for features of the journal articles is high. The extant quality of the published research is generally weak. The weight of the best available evidence suggests that high-fidelity medical simulations facilitate learning under the right conditions. These include the following: providing feedback—51 (47%) journal articles reported that educational feedback is the most important feature of simulation-based medical education; repetitive practice—43 (39%) journal articles identified repetitive practice as a key feature involving the use of high-fidelity simulations in medical education; curriculum integration—27 (25%) journal articles cited integration of simulation-based exercises into the standard medical school or postgraduate educational curriculum as an essential feature of their effective use; range of difficulty level—15 (14%) journal articles address the importance of the range of task difficulty level as an important variable in simulation-based medical education; multiple learning strategies—11 (10%) journal articles identified the adaptability of high-fidelity simulations to multiple learning strategies as an important factor in their educational effectiveness; capture clinical variation—11 (10%) journal articles cited simulators that capture a wide variety of clinical conditions as more useful than those with a narrow range; controlled environment—10 (9%) journal articles emphasized the importance of using high-fidelity simulations in a controlled environment where learners can make, detect and correct errors without adverse consequences; individualized learning—10 (9%) journal articles highlighted the importance of having reproducible, standardized educational experiences where learners are active participants, not passive bystanders; defined outcomes—seven (6%) journal articles cited the importance of having clearly stated goals with tangible outcome measures that will more likely lead to learners mastering skills; simulator validity—four (3%) journal articles provided evidence for the direct correlation of simulation validity with effective learning.

In general, clinical examinations using child SPs were found to be valid and generated reliable scores. Child SPs also provided effective feedback. The experience tended to be considered negative for younger children but was quite positive for a number of older children. The use of young SPs should be avoided for ethical reasons, and the use of child SPs should be limited to assessments that cannot be satisfactorily measured by other methods. \n \nConclusion: Through meticulous attention to detail and careful planning, a clinical examination using children as SPs can be practical, valid, and reliable."", 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 27, 'citationCount': 36, 'authors': [{'authorId': '66851117', 'name': 'Tsai Tc'}]}, {'paperId': '1e5288b5026a5748d5546105558654cadcb84fe0', 'title': 'The potential of virtual reality in social skills training for people with autistic spectrum disorders.', 'abstract': ""BACKGROUND\nPeople with autism experience profound and pervasive difficulties in the social domain.

The beneficial aspects and limitations of both paradigms are summarized before an examination of how virtual reality technology may offer a way to combine the strengths from both approaches.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis is not an exhaustive review of the literature; rather, the papers are chosen as representative of the current understanding within each broad topic. Web of Science ISI, EMBASE and PsycInfo were searched for relevant articles.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBehavioural and ToM approaches to social skills training achieve some success in improving specific skills or understanding. However, the failure to generalize learned behaviours to novel environments, and the unwieldy nature of some behavioural methodologies, means that there is a need for a training package that is easy to administer and successful in promoting learning across contexts.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nVirtual reality technology may be an ideal tool for allowing participants to practise behaviours in role-play situations, whilst also providing a safe environment for rule learning and repetition of tasks. Role-play within virtual environments could promote the mental simulation of social events, potentially allowing a greater insight into minds. Practice of behaviours, both within and across contexts, could also encourage a more flexible approach to social problem solving.

[1] It has been published by the American Psychiatric Association and two years ago the fifth edition was released. [2] Croatian was among the first languages this book was translated to. [3] DSM-5 was translated by psychiatrists and psychologists, mainly from the University psychiatric hospital Vrapce and published by the Naklada Slap publisher.DSM has always been more publicly debated than the other main classification - the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). [4] The same happened with this fifth edition. Even before it was released, numerous individuals, organizations, groups and associations were publicly speaking about the classification, new diagnostic entities and changing criteria. [5]Although there is a tendency of authors of both DSM and ICD to synchronize these two classifications and to make them more harmonized with each new edition, there are several differences among them. While ICD covers all the diseases, disorders and reasons for making a contact with the health system, DSM covers ""only"" mental disorders. Other disorders (medical conditions, as they are named in DSM-5) are not included, except in situations when they lead to a development of a mental disorder. The other main difference is that DSM is more operational zed, and gives criteria for each of the disorders, listing how many criteria have to be met to make a diagnosis of a particular disorder, and what excluding criteria are.Due to the fact that it is used all around the globe and since it has become the most used psychiatric manual, it is sometimes said that DSM is a ""psychiatric Bible"". [6]Some critics of DSM say that it stigmatizes people and that in each edition it includes more diagnostic entities. It is true that in each edition of DSM there are more disorders listed, but this is due to the fact that medicine is a developing area and new insights are made every year, so some disorders are separated into different subtypes or subgroups and different new diagnoses, giving the impression more behaviour are being pathologized. The intention of the authors was to make more homogenous groups. But, the truth is that, compared with ICD, it is more difficult to get a diagnosis in DSM, than in ICD, with the same clinical presentation. [7] DSM requires functional impairment or distress to pathologize behaviour, while in ICD this criterion is not present in every case.During the process of developing DSM-5 there was an open public discussion. [2] For over a year any person was able to participate in the discussion about future criteria, inclusion or exclusion of diagnostic entities from DSM. More than 21000 letters was sent to the authors. This was the unprecedented way of developing a classification that ICD now tries to follow in preparation of its 11th edition.As a direct consequence of such an open and wide discussion, some new disorders were included (e.g. hoarding disorder), some were excluded even though they were included during the proposal period (e.g. hypersexual disorders), some were heavily debated (e.g. narcissistic personality disorder). [8-10]As previously mentioned, DSM and ICD systems try to harmonize more. There were more non-American authors included in DSM-5 than ever before and some of the experts in the field were in the task force of DSM-5 and ICD-11. [2, 11]What is new in DSM-5, compared to DSM-IV. The organization of the chapters has been changed, so now the flow of the disorders follow life cycle. The book starts with neurodevelopmental disorders, followed by schizophrenia, bipolar and depressive disorders, and closing with neurocognitive disorders. …', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 18464, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2166705', 'name': 'G.

At the center of apprenticeship is the concept of more experienced people assisting less experienced ones, providing structure and examples to support the attainment of goals. Traditionally apprenticeship has been associated with learning in the context of becoming skilled in a trade or craft—a task that typically requires both the acquisition of knowledge, concepts, and perhaps psychomotor skills and the development of the ability to apply the knowledge and skills in a context-appropriate manner—and far predates formal schooling as it is known today. In many nonindustrialized nations apprenticeship remains the predominant method of teaching and learning. However, the overall concept of learning from experts through social interactions is not one that should be relegated to vocational and trade-based training while K–12 and higher educational institutions seek to prepare students for operating in an information-based society. Apprenticeship as a method of teaching and learning is just as relevant within the cognitive and metacognitive domain as it is in the psychomotor domain. In the last 20 years, the recognition and popularity of facilitating learning of all types through social methods have grown tremendously. Educators and educational researchers have looked to informal learning settings, where such methods have been in continuous use, as a basis for creating more formal instructional methods and activities that take advantage of these social constructivist methods. Cognitive apprenticeship— essentially, the use of an apprentice model to support learning in the cognitive domain—is one such method that has gained respect and popularity throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s. Scaffolding, modeling, mentoring, and coaching are all methods of teaching and learning that draw on social constructivist learning theory. As such, they promote learning that occurs through social interactions involving negotiation of content, understanding, and learner needs, and all three generally are considered forms of cognitive apprenticeship (although certainly they are not the only methods). This chapter first explores prevailing definitions and underlying theories of these teaching and learning strategies and then reviews the state of research in these area.', 'year': 2003, 'referenceCount': 92, 'citationCount': 239, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2621369', 'name': 'V.

They constitute a type of (a) multimodal interface where the modalities are those natural to human conversation: speech, facial displays, hand gestures, and body stance; (b) software agent, insofar as they represent the computer in an interaction with a human or represent their human users in a computational environment (as avatars, for example); and (c) dialogue system where both verbal and nonverbal devices advance and regulate the dialogue between the user and the computer. With an embodied conversational agent, the visual dimension of interacting with an animated character on a screen plays an intrinsic role. Not just pretty pictures, the graphics display visual features of conversation in the same way that the face and hands do in face-to-face conversation among humans.This book describes research in all aspects of the design, implementation, and evaluation of embodied conversational agents as well as details of specific working systems.

Because of the underlying complexity of many such tasks, however, the models of the world implicitly or explicitly embedded in such tools are often incomplete and the problem-solving methods fallible. The result can be ""brittleness"" in situations that were not anticipated by the system designers. To deal with this weakness, it has been suggested that ""cooperative"" rather than ""automated"" problem-solving systems be designed. Such cooperative systems are proposed to explicitly enhance the collaboration of the person (or a group of people) and the computer system. This study evaluates the impact of alternative design concepts on the performance of 30 airline pilots interacting with such a cooperative system designed to support enroute flight planning. The results clearly demonstrate that different system design concepts can strongly influence the cognitive processes and resultant performances of users. Based on think-aloud protocols, cognitive models are proposed to account for how features of the Computer system interacted with specific types of scenarios to influence exploration and decision making by the pilots. The results are then used to develop recommendations for guiding the design of cooperative systems.', 'year': 1994, 'referenceCount': 49, 'citationCount': 488, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144054997', 'name': 'A.

Most pediatricians will have the opportunity to provide a medical home for a child with autism. This technical report serves to complement and expand on the information in the accompanying policy statement to increase the pediatrician\'s fund of knowledge and comfort level in caring for children with autism. In so doing, it is anticipated that earlier diagnosis and referral for appropriate intervention will be possible and that this will, in turn, have a positive effect on long-term outcomes for children with autism and their families. I n 1943, Dr Leo Kanner first described autism in a small group of children who demonstrated extreme aloofness and total indifference to other people. 1 Additionally, the children made little eye contact and had severe language deficits associated with the apparent lack of desire to communicate. They reacted to the environment in very unusual ways and demonstrated no pretend or imaginative play. The term "" infantile autism "" first appeared as a diagnostic label in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), Third Edition. 2 Throughout the years, the definition and criteria for diagnosis have been revised and broadened to include milder and more common forms of the disorder. The newest criteria are published in the DSM, Fourth Edition 3 and the DSM for Primary Care, Child and Adolescent Version. 4 These criteria differ from previous DSM versions in that the term "" qualitative "" has been added to reflect the recent view that a range of qualitative abnormalities exists. Autistic disorder (AD) is currently listed as 1 of 5 pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). The remaining 4 PDDs are pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), Asperger syndrome, Rett syndrome , and childhood disintegrative disorder. Although clinical patterns vary depending on severity , all children with autism demonstrate some degree of qualitative impairment in reciprocal social interaction, qualitative impairment of communication , and restricted, repetitive, and stereotypic patterns of behaviors, interests, and activities. Table 1 lists the 12 DSM criteria that currently characterize AD. Diagnosis is dependent on the presence of at least 6 criteria, with at least 2 relating to disorders of social development and 1 each relating to disorders of communication and stereotypic behavior patterns. Delays or deviances in at least 1 of these areas must have an onset before 3 years of age.

To explore this idea, we developed two virtual agents that attempt to motivate users to perform healthy behaviors - either to increase exercise or fruit and vegetable consumption - and systematically vary whether they use humor or not in their counseling conversations. Human-authored jokes were selected from a large corpus based on the nature of the humor (empathetic affiliative humor that serves to build relational closeness), health topic relevance, and subjective ratings of funniness, as well as relevance to user stage of behavior change. We evaluated our agents in a two-treatment counterbalanced within-subjects experiment, where participants interacted with a humorous and non-humorous agent motivating either exercise or healthy diet. We found the interaction with the humorous agent led to a significantly greater change in motivation to engage in the target behavior than interacting with the non-humorous agent.",2020,56,21,{'name':

Interactive agents from Siri to Anki’s Cozmo robot include the ability to tell jokes to engage users. This ability will build in importance as in-home social agents take on more intimate roles, so it is important to gain a greater understanding of how robots can best use humor. Stand-up comedy provides a naturally-structured experimental context for initial studies of robot humor. In this preliminary work, we aimed to compare audience responses to a robotic stand-up comedian over multiple performances that varied robot timing and adaptivity. Our first study of 22 performances in the wild showed that a robot with good timing was significantly funnier. A second study of 10 performances found that an adaptive performance was not necessarily funnier, although adaptations almost always improved audience perception of individual jokes. The end result of this research provides key clues for how social robots can best engage people with humor. ACM Reference Format: John Vilk and Naomi T. Fitter. 2020.

Previous research using commercial ads demonstrated that individuals’ attention is spontaneously attracted by humor, leading to a memory advantage for humorous information over nonhumorous information. Two experiments investigated whether the positive effect of humor can occur with preventive health ads. In Experiment 1, participants observed humorous and nonhumorous health ads while their viewing times were recorded. In Experiment 2, to compare humorous and nonhumorous ads, the memory of health messages was assessed through a recognition task and a convincing score was collected.

ODVIC is a multimodal Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) that empathically delivers an evidence-based behavior change intervention by adapting, in real-time, its verbal and nonverbal communication messages to those of the user’s during their interaction. We currently focus our work on excessive alcohol consumption as a target behavior, and our approach is adaptable to other target behaviors (e.g., overeating, lack of exercise, narcotic drug use, non-adherence to treatment). We based our current approach on a successful existing patient-centered brief motivational intervention for behavior change---the Drinker’s Check-Up (DCU)---whose computer-delivery with a text-only interface has been found effective in reducing alcohol consumption in problem drinkers. We discuss the results of users’ evaluation of the computer-based DCU intervention delivered with a text-only interface compared to the same intervention delivered with two different ECAs (a neutral one and one with some empathic abilities). Users rate the three systems in terms of acceptance, perceived enjoyment, and intention to use the system, among other dimensions.

The Committee on Exercise and Cardiac Rehabilitation of the American Heart Association endorsed and supported these recommendations. The purpose of the present report is to update and clarify the 1995 recommendations on the types and amounts of physical activity needed by healthy adults to improve and maintain health. Development of this document was by an expert panel of scientists, including physicians, epidemiologists, exercise scientists, and public health specialists. This panel reviewed advances in pertinent physiologic, epidemiologic, and clinical scientific data, including primary research articles and reviews published since the original recommendation was issued in 1995. Issues considered by the panel included new scientific evidence relating physical activity to health, physical activity recommendations by various organizations in the interim, and communications issues. Key points related to updating the physical activity recommendation were outlined and writing groups were formed. A draft manuscript was prepared and circulated for review to the expert panel as well as to outside experts. Comments were integrated into the final recommendation.\n\n\nPRIMARY RECOMMENDATION\nTo promote and maintain health, all healthy adults aged 18 to 65 yr need moderate-intensity aerobic (endurance) physical activity for a minimum of 30 min on five days each week or vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity for a minimum of 20 min on three days each week. [I (A)] Combinations of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity can be performed to meet this recommendation. [IIa (B)] For example, a person can meet the recommendation by walking briskly for 30 min twice during the week and then jogging for 20 min on two other days. Moderate-intensity aerobic activity, which is generally equivalent to a brisk walk and noticeably accelerates the heart rate, can be accumulated toward the 30-min minimum by performing bouts each lasting 10 or more minutes. [I (B)] Vigorous-intensity activity is exemplified by jogging, and causes rapid breathing and a substantial increase in heart rate. In addition, every adult should perform activities that maintain or increase muscular strength and endurance a minimum of two days each week. [IIa (A)] Because of the dose-response relation between physical activity and health, persons who wish to further improve their personal fitness, reduce their risk for chronic diseases and disabilities or prevent unhealthy weight gain may benefit by exceeding the minimum recommended amounts of physical activity.

To examine the stages of change, decisional balance, and self-efficacy constructs in relation to fruit and vegetable intakes by young adults 18–24 years old. Design. A cross-sectional project was conducted by 10 states in January–July 2000 to examine decisional balance and self-efficacy in relation to stage of change for increasing fruit and vegetable intake among young adults. Subjects. In all, 1545 usable surveys were returned (response rate = 55%). More non-respondents were men and precontemplators than respondents. Sixty-one percent of respondents were women, 90.3% were white, and 49.7% were current students. Setting. Alabama, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Nebraska, New York, Rhode Island, Oregon, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. Measures. A telephone screening interview and a self-administered mail survey. Analysis. Analysis of variance, principal components analysis, cluster analysis, and χ2 test. Results. From precontemplation to maintenance, a significant linear trend was found toward higher food intake and self-efficacy for fruits and vegetables. The patterns of shifts in the pros and cons across the stages resembled those of other health behaviors. The decisional balance items were further classified into five component factors that varied significantly in importance across the stages. Four subject clusters were derived (unconcerned, reluctant, exploring, and action-oriented); distribution of the clusters agreed with that of the five stages. Conclusions. This study supports applicability of the Transtheoretical Model for assessing fruit and vegetable consumption by young adults.

One of the most striking results to date for stage-matched programs is the similarity between participants reactively recruited who reached us for help and those proactively recruited who we reached out to help. If results with stage-matched interventions continue to be replicated, health promotion programs will be able to produce unprecedented impacts on entire at-risk populations.', 'year': 1997, 'referenceCount': 34, 'citationCount': 6532, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5306756', 'name': 'J.

In this theory, discourse structure is composed of three separate but interrelated components: the structure of the sequence of utterances (called the linguistic structure), a structure of purposes (called the intentional structure), and the state of focus of attention (called the attentional state). The linguistic structure consists of segments of the discourse into which the utterances naturally aggregate. The intentional structure captures the discourse-relevant purposes, expressed in each of the linguistic segments as well as relationships among them. The attentional state is an abstraction of the focus of attention of the participants as the discourse unfolds. The attentional state, being dynamic, records the objects, properties, and relations that are salient at each point of the discourse. The distinction among these components is essential to provide an adequate explanation of such discourse phenomena as cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions.The theory of attention, intention, and aggregation of utterances is illustrated in the paper with a number of example discourses. Various properties of discourse are described, and explanations for the behavior of cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions are explored.This theory provides a framework for describing the processing of utterances in a discourse. Discourse processing requires recognizing how the utterances of the discourse aggregate into segments, recognizing the intentions expressed in the discourse and the relationships among intentions, and tracking the discourse through the operation of the mechanisms associated with attentional state. This processing description specifies in these recognition tasks the role of information from the discourse and from the participants' knowledge of the domain."", 'year': 1986, 'referenceCount': 49, 'citationCount': 3461, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1692242', 'name': 'B.

Recent studies of conversation from a variety of linguistic, psychological, anthropological and sociological perspectives, have shed light upon a number of issues important to the study of conversational inference. It is generally agreed that grammatical and lexical knowledge are only two of several factors in the interpretation process. Aside from physical setting, participants' personal background knowledge and their attitudes toward each other, sociocultural assumptions concerning role and status relationships as well as social values associated with various message components also play an important role. So far, however, treatment of such contextual factors has been primarily descriptive. The procedure has been to identify or list what can potentially affect interpretation. With rare exceptions, no systematic attempts are made to show how social knowledge is used in situated interpretation. Yet we know that social presuppositions and attitudes shift in the course of interaction, often without a corresponding change in extralinguistic context. As we have argued in previous chapters, the social input to conversation is itself communicated through a system of verbal and nonverbal signs that both channel the progress of an encounter and affect the interpretation of intent. It follows that analysis of such ongoing processes requires different and perhaps more indirect methods of study which examine not the lexical meanings of words or the semantic structure of sentences but interpretation as a function of the dynamic pattern of moves and countermoves as they follow one another in ongoing conversation."", 'year': 1982, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 2530, 'authors': [{'authorId': '69000792', 'name': 'J.

Whether they comply with the recommendations for physical activity or not remains unclear.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nEmpirical articles published in English between 1995 and 2011 were searched in electronic databases and in reference lists, using the search terms 'adherence', 'predictors', 'exercise', and 'cancer' in varying combinations. Twelve of 541 screened abstracts met the inclusion criteria. The included studies' eligibility considering predictors of exercise adherence were reviewed. A quality assessment process evaluating the studies methodological quality was performed. Eight of the reviewed studies were considered eligible for a meta-analysis involving Pearson's r correlations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nExercise stage of change, derived from the transtheoretical model of behaviour change (TTM) was found to be statistically significant and a strong predictor of exercise adherence. In addition, the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) construct; intention to engage in a health-changing behaviour and perceived behavioural control, demonstrated significant correlations with exercise adherence.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe review identified that both the TPB and the TTM frameworks include aspects that predicts exercise adherence in cancer patients, and thus contributes to the understanding of motivational factors of change in exercise behaviour in cancer populations. However, the strengths of predictions were relatively weak. More research is needed to identify predictors of greater importance.\n\n\nRELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE\nSurveying the patients' readiness and intention to initiate and maintain exercise levels, as well as tailoring exercise programmes to individual needs may be important for nurses in order to help patients meet exercise guidelines and stay active."", 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 42, 'citationCount': 135, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1413557460', 'name': 'A.

As one doctor commented: ‘It feels like we are just playing with these peoples’ lives, giving them these ridiculously complex, painful and expensive medical procedures just because we can, not because they have value’ (Boughton 2012). The sensitivities around these issues are significant. Somehow, even gently alluding to the possibility that there may be a time to say ‘No’ to life-saving treatment for some older, chronically sick people raises spectres of ageism, compulsory euthanasia, callous indifference, eugenics or worse. But talk about this we must, difficult as it may be, for these issues are confronting both clinicians and families daily. To allay such concerns at the outset, we do not advocate compulsory euthanasia or any arbitrary ‘cut-off’ age beyond which older people will be ‘denied treatment’ by death panels or ‘left to die’ in the absence of loved ones and comfort (Goodman 2012). What we do question is a seemingly unstoppable ‘technological imperative’ towards increasingly aggressive investigations and treatments of the oldest and sickest of the population. When we have elderly people with multiple comorbidites in intensive care units, or living with minimal cognitive functioning in nursing homes while receiving dialysis and nutrition via a feeding tube, only to be rushed by ambulance to the nearest emergency department for treatment or routinely being given cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) as a ‘default position’ (Blinderman et al. 2012), we must ask, ‘How did it come to this?’ Defensive medicine and the heightened fear of litigation are widely recognised, to the point where ‘do everything possible’ is seen as the safest option or ‘path of least resistance’ (O’Connor et al. 2011). This mindset is, however, notoriously difficult to roll back on an individual case basis and is a genuine minefield for clinicians who wonder if they could ever keep abreast of the burgeoning plethora of legislation, guidelines, policies, compliance requirements and recommendations that seek to govern their every decision. When even the best medico-legal experts find it hard to agree on confronting cases, the average nurse or doctor must wonder whether they can confidently make the best decision (Lawrence et al. 2012). Paternalism in health care is now so ideologically unfashionable that any semblance of a doctor or nurse actually making a decision or suggesting a ‘best course of action’ smacks of ‘dominance’. We have no wish to return to an era of non-negotiable medical omnipotence and authoritarianism, but we recognise that there may be times in people’s lives when they want and appreciate that a health professional and indeed yes, even an ‘expert’, is prepared to ‘tell it straight’ and to honestly advise what may be the best thing to do, difficult though this may be. Some, such as Williams-Murphy (2012), argue more pointedly that even involving (or should that be implicating?) families and relatives in end of life decisions by telling them that this decision is theirs, is an abdication of professional responsibility, possibly ‘cruel’ and no more than ‘burden(ing) families with CPR decisions in the face of futility’. Advances in health care, technology and therapeutics have been a doubleedged sword and the law of unintended consequences (where a policy or law aimed at a positive benefit in one area inadvertently produces a negative effect in another area) applies with a vengeance. Thanks to better health and general living standards in developed countries, people and especially the baby boomers, are living much longer, albeit with the same chronic, debilitating, expensive illnesses that billions of dollars in research and health funding have not eliminated (Callahan 2011). Worse, people may simultaneously believe that advances in medicine’s ability to save their lives and fix their every ailment will happen just as it does on television (Diem et al. 1996, Godlee 2006). The proliferation of prescribed medicines for chronic illnesses in developed countries attests to this (Busfield 2010). Herein perhaps lies the existential crisis at the heart of the financial one: Have we moved from a view of dying and death as sad but integral elements of life’s natural closure, to a view of death as a cultural and professional embarrassment or failure that is to be postponed and fought against, almost regardless of circumstances? The questions we pose ‘When is the right time to die?’ and ‘What is it OK to die from?’ will always be difficult for health professionals, and even more so for individuals and their families to answer, but we cannot refrain from asking them.

Since the end of 2019, the etiologic agent SAR-CoV-2 responsible for one of the most significant epidemics in history has caused severe global economic, social, and health damages. The drug repurposing approach and application of Structure-based Drug Discovery (SBDD) using in silico techniques are increasingly frequent, leading to the identification of several molecules that may represent promising potential.



In this context, here we use in silico methods of virtual screening (VS), pharmacophore modeling (PM), and fragment-based drug design (FBDD), in addition to molecular dynamics (MD), molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM -PBSA) calculations, and covalent docking (CD) for the identification of potential treatments against SARS-CoV-2. We initially validated the docking protocol followed by VS in 1,613 FDA-approved drugs obtained from the ZINC database. Thus, we identified 15 top hits, of which three of them were selected for further simulations. In parallel, for the compounds with a fit score value ≤ of 30, we performed the FBDD protocol, where we designed 12 compounds



By applying a PM protocol in the ZINC database, we identified three promising drug candidates. Then, the 9 top hits were evaluated in simulations of MD, MM-PBSA, and CD. Subsequently, MD showed that all identified hits showed stability at the active site without significant changes in the protein's structural integrity, as evidenced by the RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA graphics. They also showed interactions with the catalytic dyad (His41 and Cys145) and other essential residues for activity (Glu166 and Gln189) and high affinity for MM-PBSA, with possible covalent inhibition mechanism.



Finally, our protocol helped identify potential compounds wherein ZINC896717 (Zafirlukast), ZINC1546066 (Erlotinib), and ZINC1554274 (Rilpivirine) were more promising and could be explored in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trials to prove their potential as antiviral agents.

The platform allows users to customize their virtual agent's personality, background, and conversation premise, thus providing a rich, immersive interaction experience. Furthermore, after the virtual meeting, the user can choose to get the conversation analyzed and receive actionable feedback on their communication skills. This paper illustrates an overview of the platform and discusses the various application domains of this technology, ranging from entertainment to mental health, communication training, language learning, education, healthcare, and beyond. Additionally, we consider the ethical implications of such realistic virtual agent representations and the potential challenges in ensuring responsible use.",2023,25,1,"{'name': 'ArXiv', 'volume':

Alignment techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) greatly reduce the required skill and domain knowledge to effectively harness the capabilities of LLMs, increasing their accessibility and utility across various domains. However, state-of-the-art alignment techniques like RLHF rely on high-quality human feedback data, which is expensive to create and often remains proprietary. In an effort to democratize research on large-scale alignment, we release OpenAssistant Conversations, a human-generated, human-annotated assistant-style conversation corpus consisting of 161,443 messages distributed across 66,497 conversation trees, in 35 different languages, annotated with 461,292 quality ratings. The corpus is a product of a worldwide crowd-sourcing effort involving over 13,500 volunteers. To demonstrate the OpenAssistant Conversations dataset's effectiveness, we present OpenAssistant, the first fully open-source large-scale instruction-tuned model to be trained on human data.

We do not make predictions about the development or adoption timeline of such LLMs. The projected effects span all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure to LLM capabilities and LLM-powered software. Significantly, these impacts are not restricted to industries with higher recent productivity growth. Our analysis suggests that, with access to an LLM, about 15% of all worker tasks in the US could be completed significantly faster at the same level of quality. When incorporating software and tooling built on top of LLMs, this share increases to between 47 and 56% of all tasks.

Previous works usually use a sequence-to-sequence model to correct an ASR output sentence autoregressively, which causes large latency and cannot be deployed in online ASR services. A straightforward solution to reduce latency, inspired by non-autoregressive (NAR) neural machine translation, is to use an NAR sequence generation model for ASR error correction, which, however, comes at the cost of significantly increased ASR error rate. In this paper, observing distinctive error patterns and correction operations (i.e., insertion, deletion, and substitution) in ASR, we propose FastCorrect, a novel NAR error correction model based on edit alignment. In training, FastCorrect aligns each source token from an ASR output sentence to the target tokens from the corresponding ground-truth sentence based on the edit distance between the source and target sentences, and extracts the number of target tokens corresponding to each source token during edition/correction, which is then used to train a length predictor and to adjust the source tokens to match the length of the target sentence for parallel generation. In inference, the token number predicted by the length predictor is used to adjust the source tokens for target sequence generation. Experiments on the public AISHELL-1 dataset and an internal industrial-scale ASR dataset show the effectiveness of FastCorrect for ASR error correction: 1) it speeds up the inference by 6-9 times and maintains the accuracy (8-14% WER reduction) compared with the autoregressive correction model; and 2) it outperforms the popular NAR models adopted in neural machine translation and text edition by a large margin.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 43, 'citationCount': 33, 'authors': [{'authorId': '148398655', 'name': 'Yichong Leng'}, {'authorId': '48391466', 'name': 'Xu Tan'}, {'authorId': '1947929', 'name': 'Linchen Zhu'}, {'authorId': '2110641716', 'name': 'Jin Xu'}, {'authorId': '3440939', 'name': 'Renqian Luo'}, {'authorId': '2049319', 'name': 'Linquan Liu'}, {'authorId': '143826491', 'name': 'Tao Qin'}, {'authorId': '2108750136', 'name': 'Xiang-Yang Li'}, {'authorId': '34122238', 'name': 'Ed Lin'}, {'authorId': '2110264337', 'name': 'Tie-Yan Liu'}]}, {'paperId': '259dbaea3d46478e949bcbb288a86542180273af', 'title': 'Cross-domain Speech Recognition with Unsupervised Character-level Distribution Matching', 'abstract': 'End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) can achieve promising performance with large-scale training data.

While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora.

Our system synthesizes the Turkers\' interpretations, ratings, and comment rankings with the machine-sensed data and enables users to interact with, explore, and visualize personalized and presentational feedback. Our results provide quantitative and qualitative evidence in support of our proposed synthesized feedback, relative to video-only playback with impersonal tips.

During the training, MACH asks interview questions, automatically mimics certain behavior issued by the user, and exhibit appropriate nonverbal behaviors. Following the interaction, MACH provides visual feedback on the user's performance. The development of this application draws on data from 28 interview sessions, involving employment-seeking students and career counselors. The effectiveness of MACH was assessed through a weeklong trial with 90 MIT undergraduates. Students who interacted with MACH were rated by human experts to have improved in overall interview performance, while the ratings of students in control groups did not improve. Post-experiment interviews indicate that participants found the interview experience informative about their behaviors and expressed interest in using MACH in the future."", 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 38, 'citationCount': 286, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144619896', 'name': 'Ehsan Hoque'}, {'authorId': '3237926', 'name': 'M.

The framework assumes the prior noise as a standard Gaussian distribution, whereas the corresponding data distribution may be more complicated than the standard Gaussian distribution, which potentially introduces inefﬁciency in denoising the prior noise into the data sample because of the discrepancy between the data and the prior. In this paper, we propose PriorGrad to improve the efﬁciency of the conditional diffusion model (for example, a vocoder using a mel-spectrogram as the condition) by applying an adaptive prior derived from the data statistics based on the conditional information. We formulate the training and sampling procedures of PriorGrad and demonstrate the advantages of an adaptive prior through a theoretical analysis. Focusing on the audio domain, we consider the recently proposed diffusion-based audio generative models based on both the spectral and time domains and show that PriorGrad achieves a faster convergence leading to data and parameter efﬁciency and improved quality, and thereby demonstrating the efﬁciency of a data-driven adaptive prior.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 41, 'citationCount': 27, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2108229508', 'name': 'Sang-gil Lee'}, {'authorId': '2115191328', 'name': 'Heeseung Kim'}, {'authorId': '2054112350', 'name': 'Chaehun Shin'}, {'authorId': '48391466', 'name': 'Xu Tan'}, {'authorId': '2144545128', 'name': 'Chang Liu'}, {'authorId': '47580728', 'name': 'Qi Meng'}, {'authorId': '143826491', 'name': 'Tao Qin'}, {'authorId': '2154939268', 'name': 'Wei Chen'}, {'authorId': '2999019', 'name': 'Sungroh Yoon'}, {'authorId': '2110264337', 'name': 'Tie-Yan Liu'}]}, {'paperId': None, 'title': 'Anthropic -introducing claude', 'abstract': None, 'year': None, 'referenceCount': None, 'citationCount': None, 'authors': []}, {'paperId': None, 'title': '“Introducing chatgpt,”', 'abstract': None, 'year': None, 'referenceCount': None, 'citationCount': None, 'authors': []}, {'paperId': None, 'title': 'Vicuna : An open - source chatbot impressing gpt - 4 with 90 % * chatgpt quality , ” March 2023 .

Their work may cause suffering and illness, harming their Quality of Life which is understood as the individual’s perception of their life position in cultural context, and value system in which they live. The occupational therapist contributes to the worker’s quality of life. Objective: To describe the profile, job specificities and quality of life of CHAs, contextualizing possible contributions of Occupational Therapy. Method: A descriptive study conducted with health network CHAs Recife/PE. We assessed quality of life using sociodemographic questionnaire, with information on health/life habits and occupational conditions and the WHOQOL-Bref. Results: Seventy-one, most of them women, young, non-smokers and practicing physical activity participated. They work in a regular access area (71.84%), in complete teams (47.89%) and accompanying over 750 people (46.48%). The quality of life has in the social domain achieved greater satisfaction, where the facets personal relationships and social support were better scored. The environment domain obtained lower score, with the facets freedom, physical safety and security, financial resources, transport and physical environment having greater dissatisfaction levels. The occupational therapist can use group activities, expressive tasks and orientations in order to improve the agent’s health by using techniques for safety, team work, self-care and relaxation. Conclusion: The community health agents lack the general definition of quality of life, with domains of satisfaction and dissatisfaction.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with data collected through a survey regarding socio-demographic, occupational, clinical, and exposure characteristics, as well as knowledge about tuberculosis, conducted between 2011 and 2012. All participants underwent a tuberculin skin test (TST), and TSTs were read at 72 h by a trained professional. Results: A total of 218 primary health care workers participated in the study. The prevalence of TST positivity at the ≥ 10-mm and ≥ 5-mm cut-off points was, respectively, 39.4% (95% CI: 32.9-45.9) and 54.1% (95% CI: 47.4-60.7). Regarding occupational categories, community health agents had the highest proportion of TST positivity, regardless of the cut-off point (≥ 10 mm: 47.5%; and ≥ 5 mm: 60.5%).

The cohort was composed of 61 community agents, divided between unexposed individuals (n = 37) and exposed individuals (who were following up tuberculosis patients; n = 24). Over the 12-month follow-up, the tuberculin test was performed, using the tuberculin PPD RT23. The relative risk and 95% confidence interval were calculated, and the correlation between tuberculin response and the agents' occupational history was evaluated by means of Pearson's correlation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe incidence of the response was 41.7% in the exposed group and 13.5% in the unexposed group. The annual risk of infection was 52.8% in the exposed group and 14.4% in the unexposed group (p = 0.013).

In this study, we compared antimicrobial prescribing in a primary care network for uncomplicated UTIs treated through virtual visits and at in-office visits. Design: Retrospective cohort study comparing guideline-concordant antibiotic prescribing for uncomplicated UTI between virtual visits and office visits. Setting: Primary care network composed of 44 outpatient sites and a single virtual visit platform. Patients: Adult female patients diagnosed with a UTI between January 1 and December 31, 2018. Methods: Virtual visit prescribing was compared to office visit prescribing, including agent, duration, and patient outcomes. The health system ASP provides annual education to all outpatient providers regarding local antibiogram trends and prescribing guidelines. Guideline-concordant therapy was assessed based on the network’s ASP guidelines. Results: In total, 350 patients were included, with 175 per group. Patients treated for a UTI through a virtual visit were more likely to receive a first-line antibiotic agent (74.9% vs 59.4%; P = .002) and guideline-concordant duration (100% vs 53.1%; P < .001). Patients treated through virtual visits were also less likely to have a urinalysis (0% vs 97.1%; P < .001) or urine culture (0% vs 73.1%; P < .001) ordered and were less likely to revisit within 7 days (5.1% vs 18.9%; P < .001). Conclusions: UTI care through a virtual visit was associated with more appropriate antimicrobial prescribing compared to office visits and decreased utilization of diagnostic and follow-up

Evolving modalities of care delivery have shifted management of these complaints from in-person face-to-face (F2F) visits, to nurse phone protocol management, and recently to online assessment via eVisit. While research has vetted the use of nurse phone protocol management, eVisit management outcomes have not been thoroughly studied. Purpose: To compare antibiotic prescribing, follow-up rates, and clinical outcomes between F2F visits at a retail clinic, nurse phone protocol encounters, and eVisits for the assessment and management of urinary symptoms and UTIs. Methods: A retrospective chart review of primary care empaneled patients at Mayo Clinic Rochester was conducted of females, 18 to 65 years old, who sought care for urinary symptoms via phone, eVisit, or F2F visit from August 1, 2016, through May 1, 2017. A total of 450 encounters, 150 from each of the 3 encounter types, were manually reviewed and compared for antibiotic prescribing rates, clinical outcomes, and 30-day follow-up rates. Results: Antibiotic prescribing rates for all three encounter types were similar. Referral for follow-up at initial encounter was more likely to be recommended from phone and eVisit encounters than F2F. No significant differences in follow-up rates or clinical outcomes were noted between the three encounter types. Conclusions: eVisits for urinary symptoms and UTI offer patients a convenient option for care without an increased use of antimicrobials, follow-up, or adverse clinical outcomes when compared with F2F visits or nurse-administered phone protocols.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 15, 'citationCount': 20, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2151189862', 'name': 'Martha A Murray'}, {'authorId': '20761975', 'name': 'Kristine S Penza'}, {'authorId': '22352611', 'name': 'Jane F.

Virtual visits have emerged as a popular alternative to office visits for URTIs and may be an important target for antimicrobial stewardship programs. Methods This retrospective cohort study evaluated adult patients diagnosed with sinusitis treated within a single primary care network. The primary objective was to compare guideline-concordant diagnosis between patients treated via virtual visits vs in-office visits. Guideline-concordant bacterial sinusitis diagnosis was based on national guideline recommendations. Secondary objectives included comparing guideline-concordant antibiotic prescribing between groups and 24-hour, 7-day, and 30-day revisits. Results A total of 350 patients were included in the study, with 175 in each group. Patients treated for sinusitis were more likely to receive a guideline-concordant diagnosis in the virtual visit group (69.1% vs 45.7%; P < .001). Additionally, patients who completed virtual visits were less likely to receive antibiotics (68.6% vs 94.3%; P < .001). Guideline-concordant antibiotic selection was similar between groups (67.5% vs 64.8%; P = .641). The median duration of therapy in both groups was 10 days (P = .88). Patients completing virtual visits were more likely to revisit for sinusitis within 24 hours (8% vs 1.7%; P = .006) and within 30 days (14.9% vs 7.4%; P = .027). Conclusions In adult patients presenting with sinusitis, care at a virtual visit was associated with an increase in guideline-concordant diagnosis and a decrease in antibiotic prescribing compared with in-office primary care visits.

Recommendations from this CPG were rapidly disseminated to clinicians via review articles, UpToDate, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website; however, it is unclear if this CPG had an impact on national antibiotic prescribing practices.

We included nonpregnant women aged 18–44 years who had an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis code for a UTI with a concurrent antibiotic prescription. We performed interrupted time series analyses to determine the impact of the CPG on the appropriateness of the antibiotic agent and duration. Results We identified 654 432 women diagnosed with UTI. The patient population was young (mean age, 31 years) and had few comorbidities. Fluoroquinolones, nonfirstline agents, were the most commonly prescribed antibiotic class both before and after release of the guidelines (45% vs 42%). Wide variation was observed in the duration of treatment, with >75% of prescriptions written for nonrecommended treatment durations.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess nitrofurantoin's efficacy and toxicity in the treatment of lower UTI.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed a systematic review of all human controlled clinical trials published from 1946 to 2014 and assessing short-term (≤14 days) nitrofurantoin for lower UTI. Meta-analyses assessing efficacy and adverse events were conducted on randomized trials.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-seven controlled trials including 4807 patients fulfilled entry criteria; most were conducted between the 1970s and 1990s and were at increased risk for various biases. Nitrofurantoin appears to have good clinical and microbiological efficacy for UTI caused by common uropathogens, with clinical cure rates varying between 79% and 92%. The most methodologically robust studies surveyed indicate overall equivalence between nitrofurantoin when given for 5 or 7 days and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials confirmed equivalence in clinical cure, but indicated a slight advantage to comparator drugs in microbiological efficacy (risk ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.97). If given for only 3 days, nitrofurantoin's clinical efficacy was diminished (61%-70%). Toxicity was infrequent (5%-16% in the 17 reporting studies), mild, reversible and predominantly gastrointestinal; meta-analyses confirmed no difference between nitrofurantoin and comparators. Hypersensitivity reactions such as pulmonary fibrosis and hepatotoxicity were not observed. Acquisition of resistance to nitrofurantoin is still relatively rare.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWhen given short term for lower UTI, nitrofurantoin has good clinical and microbiological efficacy; toxicity is mild and predominantly gastrointestinal."", 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 37, 'citationCount': 185, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5091997', 'name': 'A.

Patients benefit from increased access to care, physicians are afforded greater flexibility in care delivery, and the health system itself benefits from lower costs to provide such care. One method of incorporating online care into clinical practice, called electronic office visits or ""eVisits,"" allows physicians to provide a consultation with patients online. We performed an analysis of the current published literature on eVisits as well as present emerging research describing the use of mobile platforms as the delivery model. We focused on the role of eVisits in acute primary care practice.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA literature review was conducted using electronic databases with a variety of search terms related to the use of eVisits in primary care.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeveral advantages to eVisit utilization in the primary care setting were identified, namely, improvements in efficiency, continuity of care, quality of care, and access to care. Barriers to eVisit implementation were also identified, including challenges with incorporation into workflow, reimbursement, physician technological literacy, patient health literacy, overuse, security, confidentiality, and integration with existing medical technologies.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOnly one study of patient satisfaction with eVisit acute primary care services was identified, and this suggests that previous analyses of eVisit utilization are lacking this key component of healthcare service delivery evaluations.

The availability of secure Internet portals creates the opportunity for online eVisits. Increasing numbers of health systems provide eVisits, and many health plans reimburse for eVisits. However, little is known on who chooses to seek care via an eVisit.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nAt four primary care practices, we used the electronic medical record to identify all eVisits and office visits for sinusitis and urinary tract infections (UTIs) between January 2010 and May 2011. From the electronic medical record we abstracted the necessary information on patient demographics. The population studied included 5,165 sinusitis visits (9% of which were eVisits) and 2,954 UTI visits (3% eVisits).\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn multivariate models controlling for other patient factors, the variables most strongly associated with a patient initiating an eVisit versus an office visit were age (18-44 years of age versus 65 years of age and older: sinusitis, odds ratio 1.65 [0.97-2.81]; UTI, 2.97 [1.03-8.62]) and longer travel distance to clinic (>10 miles from patient home to clinic versus 0-5 miles: sinusitis, odds ratio 6.54 [4.68-9.16]; UTI, odds ratio 3.25 [1.74-6.07]).

We present a participatory design methodology for culturally tailoring virtual agents. Investigators worked with key informants from our target population, members of predominantly Black church communities, to design culturally-relevant and sensitive virtual agent health promotion interventions. In the first participatory session, key informants designed agents to assist them with different aspects of their lives, providing input on agent appearance and agent functionality. In a second design session, participants re-wrote the content of a health conversation with an agent, to include personally-relevant content related to their community (e.g., religious and scriptural references). We report design principles for religious tailoring derived from these studies. We conducted a validation study to assess the effects of applying these principles to agents that promoted two health behaviors, finding that participants responded very positively to the tailored

Mobile health (mHealth) technologies have the potential to enhance multiple aspects of AF care, including education, monitoring of symptoms, and encouraging and tracking medication adherence. We have previously implemented and tested relational agents to improve outcomes in chronic disease and sought to develop a smartphone-based relational agent for improving patient-centered outcomes in AF. Objective The objective of this study was to pilot a smartphone-based relational agent as preparation for a randomized clinical trial, the Atrial Fibrillation Health Literacy Information Technology Trial (AF-LITT). Methods We developed the relational agent for use by a smartphone consistent with our prior approaches. We programmed the relational agent as a computer-animated agent to simulate a face-to-face conversation and to serve as a health counselor or coach specific to AF. Relational agent’s dialogue content, informed by a review of literature, focused on patient-centered domains and qualitative interviews with patients with AF, encompassed AF education, common symptoms, adherence challenges, and patient activation. We established that the content was accessible to individuals with limited health or computer literacy. Relational agent content coordinated with use of the smartphone AliveCor Kardia heart rate and rhythm monitor. Participants (N=31) were recruited as a convenience cohort from ambulatory clinical sites and instructed to use the relational agent and Kardia for 30 days. We collected demographic, social, and clinical characteristics and conducted baseline and 30-day assessments of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality of life (AFEQT) measure; self-reported medication adherence with the Morisky 8-item Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8); and patient activation with the Patient Activation Measure (PAM). Results Participants (mean age 68 [SD 11]; 39% [12/31] women) used the relational agent for an average 17.8 (SD 10.0) days. The mean number of independent log-ins was 19.6 (SD 10.7), with a median of 20 times over 30 days. The mean number of Kardia uses was 26.5 (SD 5.9), and participants using Kardia were in AF for 14.3 (SD 11.0) days. AFEQT scores improved significantly from 64.5 (SD 22.9) at baseline to 76.3 (SD 19.4) units at 30 days (P<.01). We observed marginal but statistically significant improvement in self-reported medication adherence (baseline: 7.3 [SD 0.9], 30 days: 7.7 [SD 0.5]; P=.01). Assessments of acceptability identified that most of the participants found the relational agent useful, informative, and trustworthy. Conclusions We piloted a 30-day smartphone-based intervention that combined a relational agent with dedicated content for AF alongside Kardia heart rate and rhythm monitoring. Pilot participants had favorable improvements in HRQoL and self-reported medication adherence, as well as positive responses to the intervention. These data will guide a larger, enhanced randomized trial implementing the smartphone relational agent and the Kardia monitor system.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 67, 'citationCount': 28, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3490149', 'name': 'J.

Materials and methods We conducted a cross-case analysis of 5 diverse case studies with 1 common element: integration of CBPR approaches into health informatics research. After reviewing publications and other case-related materials, all coauthors engaged in collaborative discussions focused on CBPR. Researchers mapped each case to an existing CBPR framework, examined each case individually for success factors and barriers, and identified common patterns across cases. Results Benefits of applying CBPR approaches to health informatics research across the cases included the following: developing more relevant research with wider impact, greater engagement with diverse populations, improved internal validity, more rapid translation of research into action, and the development of people. Challenges of applying CBPR to health informatics research included requirements to develop strong, sustainable academic-community partnerships and mismatches related to cultural and temporal factors. Several technology-related challenges, including needs to define ownership of technology outputs and to build technical capacity with community partners, also emerged from our analysis. Finally, we created several principles that extended an existing CBPR framework to specifically address health informatics research requirements. Conclusions Our cross-case analysis yielded valuable insights regarding CBPR implementation in health informatics research and identified valuable lessons useful for future CBPR-based research. The benefits of applying CBPR approaches can be significant, particularly in engaging populations that are typically underserved by health care and in designing patient-facing technology.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 84, 'citationCount': 143, 'authors': [{'authorId': '143865198', 'name': 'K.

We developed and tested “Gabby,” an online preconception conversational agent system. Methods: One hundred nongravid AA women 18–34 years of age were screened for over 100 PCH risks and randomized to the Gabby or control group. The Gabby group interacted with the system for up to six months; the control group received a letter indicating their health risks with a recommendation to talk with their clinician. The numbers, proportions, and types of risks were compared between groups. Results: There were 23.7 (SD 5.9) risks identified per participant. Eighty-five percent (77 of 91) provided 6 month follow up data. The Gabby group had greater reductions in the number (8.3 vs. 5.5 risks, P < .05) and the proportion (27.8% vs 20.5%, P < 0.01) of risks compared to controls. The Gabby group averaged 63.7 minutes of interaction time. Seventy-eight percent reported that it “was easy to talk to Gabby” and 64% used information from Gabby to improve their health. Conclusion: Gabby was significantly associated with preconception risk reduction. More research is needed to determine if Gabby can benefit higher risk populations and if risk reduction is clinically significant.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 33, 'citationCount': 59, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1746132', 'name': 'B.

The efficacy of a culturally and linguistically adapted virtual advisor that provides tailored physical activity advice and support was tested in low-income older adults. Forty inactive adults (92.5% Latino) 55 years of age and older were randomized to a 4-month virtual advisor walking intervention or a waitlist control. Four-month increases in reported minutes of walking/week were greater in the virtual advisor arm (mean increase = 253.5 ± 248.7 minutes/week) relative to the control (mean increase = 26.8 ± 67.0 minutes/week; p = .0008). Walking increases in the virtual advisor arm were substantiated via objectively measured daily steps (slope analysis p = .002). All but one intervention participant continued some interaction with the virtual advisor in the 20-week poststudy period (mean number of poststudy sessions = 14.0 ± 20.5). The results indicate that a virtual advisor delivering culturally and linguistically adapted physical activity advice led to meaningful 4-month increases in walking relative to control among underserved older adults.

However, literature about the use of this technology by historically underserved populations is limited. Information on culturally informed health and wellness technology and the use of these technologies to reduce health disparities facing historically underserved populations in the United States is sparse in the literature. Objective To examine ways in which technology is being used by historically underserved populations to decrease health disparities through facilitating or improving health care access and health and wellness outcomes. Methods We conducted a systematic review in four library databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Engineering Village) to investigate the use of technology by historically underserved populations. Search strings consisted of three topics (eg, technology, historically underserved populations, and health). Results A total of 424 search phrases applied in the four databases returned 16,108 papers. After review, 125 papers met the selection criteria. Within the selected papers, 30 types of technology, 19 historically underserved groups, and 23 health issues were discussed. Further, almost half of the papers (62 papers) examined the use of technology to create effective and culturally informed interventions or educational tools. Finally, 12 evaluation techniques were used to assess the technology. Conclusions While the reviewed studies show how technology can be used to positively affect the health of historically underserved populations, the technology must be tailored toward the intended population, as personally relevant and contextually situated health technology is more likely than broader technology to create behavior changes. Social media, cell phones, and videotapes are types of technology that should be used more often in the future. Further, culturally informed health information technology should be used more for chronic diseases and disease management, as it is an innovative way to provide holistic care and reminders to otherwise underserved populations. Additionally, design processes should be stated regularly so that best practices can be created. Finally, the evaluation process should be standardized to create a benchmark for culturally informed health information technology.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 173, 'citationCount': 86, 'authors': [{'authorId': '37523105', 'name': 'E.

Shifts in the social and scientific landscape have now set the stage for the next major movement in Clinical Virtual Reality with the “birth” of intelligent virtual humans. Seminal research and development has appeared in the creation of highly interactive, artificially intelligent and natural language capable virtual human agents that can engage real human users in a credible fashion. No longer at the level of a prop to add context or minimal faux interaction in a virtual world, virtual humans can be designed to perceive and act in a 3D virtual world, engage in spoken dialogs with real users and can be capable of exhibiting human-like emotional reactions. This paper will present an overview of the SimCoach project that aims to develop virtual human support agents to serve as online guides for promoting access to psychological healthcare information and for assisting military personnel and family members in breaking down barriers to initiating care. The SimCoach experience is being designed to attract and engage military Service Members, Veterans and their significant others who might not otherwise seek help with a live healthcare provider. It is expected that this experience will motivate users to take the first step – to empower themselves to seek advice and information regarding their healthcare and general personal welfare and encourage them to take the next step towards seeking other, more formal resources if needed.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 24, 'citationCount': 86, 'authors': [{'authorId': '32772262', 'name': 'Albert A.

Interaction terms of religion with social support were used to explore whether other forms of social support could substitute for religion and diminish its protective effect.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPersons who attended religious services had lower mortality than those who did not (age- and sex-adjusted relative hazard [RH] = 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.52, 0.78). Multivariate adjustment reduced this relationship only slightly (RH = 0.76; 95% CI = 0.62, 0.94), primarily by including physical functioning and social support.

It provides detailed descriptions of the sequential resources unacquainted interlocutors use in order to: – generate self-presentation – introduce topics – establish common contextual resources It is argued that these sequential patterns embody conventionalized procedures for establishing an interpersonal relationship involving some degree of: – solidarity (mutual rights and obligations) – familiarity (mutual knowledge of personal background) – mutual affect (emotional commitment) The sequential analysis is based on a conversation analytic approach, while the interpretive framework consists of pragmatic theories of politeness, conversational style and common ground.', 'year': 1999, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 205, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2323665', 'name': 'J.

The virus' main protease is a dimeric enzyme that has only recently begun to be thoroughly described, opening the door for virtual screening more broadly. Here, a PAIN-filtered flavonoid database was screened against four sites of the protease: a free (normal) conformation of the Substrate Binding Site (NSBS), an induced-fit state of the SBS (ISBS), a Dimerization Site (DS) and a Cryptic Site (CS). The mean binding energies of the top five ligands from each site were -9.52, -11.512, -7.042 and -10.348 kcal/mol for the NSBS, the ISBS, the DS and the CS, respectively. For the DS and CS, these top five compounds were selected as candidates to bind their respective site. In the case of SBS, the top 30 ligands with the lowest binding energies from NSBS and ISBS were contrasted and the ones present in both lists were selected as the final candidates. The final list was: Dorsilurin E (FL3FQUNP0001), Euchrenone a11 (FL2FALNP0014), Kurziflavolactone C (FL2FA9NC0016), Licorice glycoside E (FL2F1AGSN001) and Taxifolin 3'- (6""-phenyl- acetylglucoside) (FL4DACGS0020) for the SBS; Sanggenol O (FL2FALNP0020), CHEMBL2171573, Kanzonol E (FL3F1ANP0001), CHEMBL2171584 and Abyssynoflavanone VI (FL2FACNP0014) for DS and CHEMBL2171598, CHEMBL2171577, Denticulaflavanol (FL5FAANR0001), Kurzichalcolactone (FL1CA9NC0001) and CHEMBL2171578 for CS. Virtual screening integrated several confirmation methods, including cross-docking assays and positive and negative controls. All 15 compounds are currently subjected to molecular dynamics so as to theoretically validate their binding to the protease.",2020,73,2,"{'name': 'arXiv: Biomolecules', 'volume': ''}","{'model':

The virus is referred to as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2) and has a genome similar (∼82%) to that of the previously known SARS-CoV (SARS coronavirus). An attractive therapeutic target for CoVs is the main protease (Mpro) or 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro), as this enzyme plays a key role in polyprotein processing and is active in a dimeric form. Further, Mpro is highly conserved among various CoVs, and a mutation in Mpro is often lethal to the virus. Thus, drugs targeting the Mpro enzyme significantly reduce the risk of mutation-mediated drug resistance and display broad-spectrum antiviral activity. The combinatorial design of peptide-based inhibitors targeting the dimerization of SARS-CoV Mpro represents a potential therapeutic strategy. In this regard, we have compiled the literature reports highlighting the effect of mutations and N-terminal deletion of residues of SARS-CoV Mpro on its dimerization and, thus, catalytic activity.

Spike glycoprotein engages host Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors for entry into host cells, where the receptor recognition and attachment of spike glycoprotein to the ACE2 receptors is a prerequisite step and key determinant of the host cell and tissue tropism. Binding of spike glycoprotein to the ACE2 receptor triggers a cascade of structural transitions, including transition from a metastable pre-fusion to a post-fusion form, thereby allowing membrane fusion and internalization of the virus. From ancient times people have relied on naturally occurring substances like phytochemicals to fight against diseases and infection. Among these phytochemicals, flavonoids and non-flavonoids have been the active sources of different anti-microbial agents. We performed molecular docking studies using 10 potential naturally occurring compounds (flavonoids/non-flavonoids) against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and compared their affinity with an FDA approved repurposed drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Further, our molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and energy landscape studies with fisetin, quercetin, and kamferol revealed that these molecules bind with the hACE2-S complex with low binding free energy. The study provided an indication that these molecules might have the potential to perturb the binding of hACE2-S complex. In addition, ADME analysis also suggested that these molecules consist of drug-likeness property, which may be further explored as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

To conquer viral infections, the inhibition of proteases essential for proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins is a conventional therapeutic strategy. To this date, no specific drugs or vaccines are available to treat SARS-CoV-2 despite its close relation to the SARS-CoV-1 virus that caused a similar epidemic in 2003. Thus, there remains an urgent need for the development of specific antiviral therapeutics to conquer SARS-CoV-2. In order to find novel inhibitors, we computationally screened a compound library of over 687 million compounds for binding at the recently solved crystal structure of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. A screening of such a vast chemical space for SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors has not been reported before. After shape screening, two docking protocols were applied followed by the determination of pharmacokinetically relevant molecular descriptors to narrow down the initial hits. Next, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to validate the stability of docked binding modes and comprehensively quantify ligand binding energies. After evaluation of off-target binding, we report a list of 11 drug-like compounds with improved binding free energy to the target protease in contrast to the cocrystallized peptidomimetic lead compound that suffers from poor pharmacokinetic properties.

Over the past few decades, this premier approach technique has proved to be crucial as an automated method in drug design and discovery, as well as in other fields. Data are retrieved from contour surface calculations for each ligand probe and can be analyzed to delineate regions of attraction on the basis of energy levels. Negative energy levels from contours are used to infer protein-ligand affinity clefts and are therefore relevant to drug design.

Therefore, researches targeting these viruses have been required. Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been rising targets of some flavonoids. The antiviral activity of some flavonoids against CoVs is presumed directly caused by inhibiting 3C-like protease (3CLpro). Here, we applied a flavonoid library to systematically probe inhibitory compounds against SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Herbacetin, rhoifolin and pectolinarin were found to efficiently block the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The interaction of the three flavonoids was confirmed using a tryptophan-based fluorescence method, too. An induced-fit docking analysis indicated that S1, S2 and S3′ sites are involved in binding with flavonoids. The comparison with previous studies showed that Triton X-100 played a critical role in objecting false positive or overestimated inhibitory activity of flavonoids.

These approximations do not properly take the effects of neighboring atoms into account and tend to deviate considerably from the true contact surface. We implemented an extension of the original Shrake-Rupley algorithm to accurately estimate interatomic contact surface areas of molecular structures and complexes. Our extended algorithm is able to calculate the contact area of an atom to all nearby atoms by directly calculating overlapping surface patches, taking into account the possible shielding effects of neighboring atoms. Here, we present a versatile software tool and web server for the calculation of contact surface areas, as well as buried surface areas and solvent accessible surface areas (SASA) for different types of biomolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids and small organic molecules. Detailed results are provided in tab-separated values format for analysis and Protein Databank files for visualization. Direct contact surface area calculation resulted in improved accuracy in a benchmark with a non-redundant set of 245 protein–DNA complexes. SASA-based approximations underestimated protein–DNA contact surfaces on average by 40%. This software tool may be useful for surface-based intra- and intermolecular interaction analyses and scoring function development.

Molecular Docking application to predict them is challenging due to their low affinity, hydrophilic nature and ligand conformational diversity. In the last decade several strategies, such as the inclusion of glycan conformation specific scoring functions or our developed solvent-site biased method, have improved carbohydrate docking performance but significant challenges remain, in particular, those related to receptor conformational diversity. In the present work we have analyzed conventional and solvent-site biased autodock4 performance concerning receptor conformational diversity as derived from different crystal structures (apo and holo), Molecular Dynamics snapshots and Homology-based models, for 14 different lectin-monosaccharide complexes. Our results show that both conventional and biased docking yield accurate lectin-monosaccharide complexes, starting from either apo or homology-based structures, even when only moderate (45%) sequence identity templates are available. An essential element for success is a proper combination of a middle-sized (10-100 structures) conformational ensemble, derived either from Molecular dynamics or multiple homology model building. Consistent with our previous works, results show that solvent-site biased methods improve overall performance, but that results are still highly system dependent. Finally, our results also show that docking can select the correct receptor structure within the ensemble, underscoring the relevance of joint evaluation of both ligand pose and receptor conformation.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 30, 'citationCount': 7, 'authors': [{'authorId': '15730402', 'name': 'Juan I.

They can provide druggable pockets in cases where the main functional site of the protein cannot be targeted with sufficient potency or specificity. We show that unbound structures of proteins with cryptic sites have strong binding hot spots and above-average flexibility around the incipient pockets. Binding hot spots can be easily identified computationally, and protein flexibility can often be assessed by the analysis of X-ray structures of the unbound protein, including structures with low resolution. The approach presented here helps to assess the potential druggability of cryptic sites prior to running expensive screening experiments and reveals information about how cryptic sites form. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins reveal the existence of many transient surface pockets; however, the factors determining what small subset of these represent druggable or functionally relevant ligand binding sites, called “cryptic sites,” are not understood. Here, we examine multiple X-ray structures for a set of proteins with validated cryptic sites, using the computational hot spot identification tool FTMap. The results show that cryptic sites in ligand-free structures generally have a strong binding energy hot spot very close by. As expected, regions around cryptic sites exhibit above-average flexibility, and close to 50% of the proteins studied here have unbound structures that could accommodate the ligand without clashes. Nevertheless, the strong hot spot neighboring each cryptic site is almost always exploited by the bound ligand, suggesting that binding may frequently involve an induced fit component. We additionally evaluated the structural basis for cryptic site formation, by comparing unbound to bound structures. Cryptic sites are most frequently occluded in the unbound structure by intrusion of loops (22.5%), side chains (19.4%), or in some cases entire helices (5.4%), but motions that create sites that are too open can also eliminate pockets (19.4%). The flexibility of cryptic sites frequently leads to missing side chains or loops (12%) that are particularly evident in low resolution crystal structures. An interesting observation is that cryptic sites formed solely by the movement of side chains, or of backbone segments with fewer than five residues, result only in low affinity binding sites with limited use for drug discovery.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 53, 'citationCount': 82, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2809709', 'name': 'D.

They thus promptly close in all of the molecular dynamics simulations performed, irrespective of the force-field used. Temperature-based enhanced sampling approaches, such as Parallel Tempering, do not improve the situation, as the entropic term does not help in the opening of the sites. The use of fragment probes helps, as in long simulations occasionally it leads to the opening and binding to the cryptic sites. Our observed mechanism of cryptic site formation is suggestive of an interplay between two classical mechanisms: induced-fit and conformational selection. Employing this insight, we developed a novel Hamiltonian Replica Exchange-based method ""SWISH"" (Sampling Water Interfaces through Scaled Hamiltonians), which combined with probes resulted in a promising general approach for cryptic site discovery. We also addressed the issue of ""false-positives"" and propose a simple approach to distinguish them from druggable cryptic pockets. Our simulations, whose cumulative sampling time was more than 200 μs, help in clarifying the molecular mechanism of pocket formation, providing a solid basis for the choice of an efficient computational method.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 72, 'citationCount': 124, 'authors': [{'authorId': '14735774', 'name': 'Vladimiras Oleinikovas'}, {'authorId': '3052695', 'name': 'G.

HIV-2 exhibits intrinsic resistance to most FDA-approved HIV-1 PI, retaining clinically useful susceptibility only to lopinavir, darunavir, and saquinavir. The mechanisms for this resistance are unclear; although HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases share just 38 to 49% sequence identity, all critical structural features of proteases are conserved. Structural studies have implicated four amino acids in the ligand-binding pocket (positions 32, 47, 76, and 82). We constructed HIV-2ROD9 molecular clones encoding the corresponding wild-type HIV-1 amino acids (I32V, V47I, M76L, and I82V) either individually or together (clone PRΔ4) and compared the phenotypic sensitivities (50% effective concentration [EC50]) of mutant and wild-type viruses to nine FDA-approved PI. Single amino acid replacements I32V, V47I, and M76L increased the susceptibility of HIV-2 to multiple PI, but no single change conferred class-wide sensitivity. In contrast, clone PRΔ4 showed PI susceptibility equivalent to or greater than that of HIV-1 for all PI. We also compared crystallographic structures of wild-type HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases complexed with amprenavir and darunavir to models of the PRΔ4 enzyme. These models suggest that the amprenavir sensitivity of PRΔ4 is attributable to stabilizing enzyme-inhibitor interactions in the P2 and P2′ pockets of the protease dimer. Together, our results show that the combination of four amino acid changes in HIV-2 protease confer a pattern of PI susceptibility comparable to that of HIV-1, providing a structural rationale for intrinsic HIV-2 PI resistance and resolving long-standing questions regarding the determinants of differential PI susceptibility in HIV-1 and HIV-2. IMPORTANCE Proteases are essential for retroviral replication, and HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases share a great deal of structural similarity. However, only three of nine FDA-approved HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PI) are active against HIV-2. The underlying reasons for intrinsic PI resistance in HIV-2 are not known. We examined the contributions of four amino acids in the ligand-binding pocket of the enzyme that differ between HIV-1 and HIV-2 by constructing HIV-2 clones encoding the corresponding HIV-1 amino acids and testing the PI susceptibilities of the resulting viruses. We found that the HIV-2 clone containing all four changes (PRΔ4) was as susceptible as HIV-1 to all nine PI. We also modeled the PRΔ4 enzyme structure and compared it to existing crystallographic structures of HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases complexed with amprenavir and darunavir. Our findings demonstrate that four positions in the ligand-binding cleft of protease are the primary cause of HIV-2 PI resistance.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 48, 'citationCount': 25, 'authors': [{'authorId': '6189394', 'name': 'Dana N.

Zanamivir (Relenza™) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu(®)) are two antiviral drugs currently recommended by the CDC for treating influenza. Both are examples of the successful application of structure-based drug design strategies. These strategies have combined computer- based approaches, such as docking- and pharmacophore-based virtual screening with X-ray crystallographic structural analyses. Docking is a routinely used computational method to identify potential hits from large compound libraries. This method has evolved from simple rigid docking approaches to flexible docking methods to handle receptor flexibility and to enhance hit rates in virtual screening. Virtual screening approaches can employ both ligand-based and structurebased pharmacophore models depending on the available information. The exponential growth in computing power has increasingly facilitated the application of computer-aided methods in drug discovery, and they now play significant roles in the search for novel therapeutics. An overview of these computational tools is presented in this review, and recent advances and challenges will be discussed. The focus of the review will be anti-influenza drug discovery and how advances in our understanding of viral biology have led to the discovery of novel influenza protein targets.

This protocol resulted in six fold purification with 28% final recovery. The purified turmeric protease showed a prominent single peak and band on high-performance liquid chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE, respectively, and an estimated molecular weight of 43 KDa, and exhibited optimal activity between 37 and 60 degrees C. The protease activity of the turmeric protease was significantly inhibited by iodoacetic acid. The turmeric protease had higher alanine and glutamate content and cleaved synthetic peptides N-Cbz-Ile-Pro and N-Cbz-Phe-Leu in a time-dependent manner. Peptide mass fingerprint using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectroscopy revealed peptide matches to proteasome subunit alpha type 3 of Oryza sativa ssp. japonica (Rice). The turmeric protease showed antifungal activity at 10 microg mL(-1) towards pathogens Pythium aphanidermatum, Trichoderma viride and Fusarium sp.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCysteine addition significantly activated turmeric protease.

However, HIV-1 often develops resistance to active-site inhibitors through multiple mutations in PR and therefore recent efforts have focused on inhibiting PR dimerization as an alternative approach. Dimerization inhibitors have been identified using kinetic analysis, but additional characterization of the effect of these inhibitors on PR by physical methods has been difficult. In the present study, we identified a PR(MDR) (multi-drug-resistant HIV-1 PR) that was highly resistant to autoproteolysis. Using this PR and a novel size-exclusion chromatographic approach that incorporated fluorescence and MS detection, we were able to demonstrate inhibition of dimerization using P27 (peptide 27), a peptide dimerization inhibitor of PR previously identified on the basis of kinetic analysis. Incubation of PR(MDR) with P27, or other dimerization inhibitors, led to a dose- and time-dependent formation of PR monomers based on the change in elution time by size exclusion and its similar elution time to engineered forms of monomeric PR, namely PR(T26A) and glutathionylated PR. In contrast, incubation of PR(MDR) with a potent active-site inhibitor did not change the elution time for the PR(MDR) dimer. The monomeric PR induced by P27 had fluorescent characteristics which were consistent with unfolded PR. Structure-activity studies identified the active regions of P27 and experiments were performed to examine the effect of other dimerization inhibitors on PR. The present study is the first characterization of dimerization inhibition of PR(MDR), a prime target for these inhibitors, using a novel size-exclusion chromatographic approach.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 51, 'citationCount': 16, 'authors': [{'authorId': '9222347', 'name': 'D.

The molecular basis for this widespread problem remains hazy. To investigate the mechanism of inhibition at a molecular level, we determined changes in solvent accessibility that occur when an enzyme binds to an aggregate using hydrogen−deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. For AmpC β-lactamase, binding to aggregates of the small molecule rottlerin increased the deuterium exchange of all 10 reproducibly detectable peptides, which covered 41% of the sequence of β-lactamase. This suggested a global increase in proton accessibility upon aggregate binding, consistent with denaturation. We then investigated whether enzyme−aggregate complexes were more susceptible to proteolysis than uninhibited enzyme. For five aggregators, trypsin degradation of β-lactamase increased substantially when β-lactamase was inhibited by aggregates, whereas uninhibited enzyme was generally stable to digestion. Combined, these results suggest that the mechanism of action of aggregate-based inhibitors proceeds via partial protein unfolding when bound to an aggregate particle.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 39, 'citationCount': 187, 'authors': [{'authorId': '35248631', 'name': 'Kristin E.

However, there is little direct experimental evidence for this assumption, and in the case of binding of p-substituted benzenesulfonamide inhibitors to bovine carbonic anhydrase II (BCA II), the observed thermodynamic binding signature derived from isothermal titration calorimetry experiments leads indirectly to the conclusion that a considerable degree of residual entropy remains in the bound ligand. Specifically, the entropy of binding increases with glycine chain length n, and strong evidence exists that this thermodynamic signature is not driven by solvent reorganization. By use of heteronuclear (15)N NMR relaxation measurements in a series (n = 1-6) of (15)N-glycine-enriched ligands, we find that the observed thermodynamic binding signature cannot be explained by residual ligand dynamics in the bound state, but rather results from the indirect influence of ligand chain length on protein dynamics.', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 1, 'citationCount': 36, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145646556', 'name': 'Henning Stöckmann'}, {'authorId': '2529276', 'name': 'A.

The first major outbreak occurred in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong, between January and March 2003. This study reviews the clinical presentation, laboratory findings and response to four different treatment protocols. Case notes and laboratory findings were analysed and outcome measures were collected prospectively. The SARS outbreak in Guangdong province and the outbreak in Guangzhou associated with hospitals in the city are described, documenting clinical and laboratory features in a cohort of 190 patients randomly allocated to four treatment regimens. Patients were infected by close contact in either family or health-care settings, particularly following procedures likely to generate aerosols of respiratory secretions (e.g. administration of nebulized drugs and bronchoscopy). The earliest symptom was a high fever followed, in most patients, by dyspnoea, cough and myalgia, with 24 % of patients complaining of diarrhoea. The most frequent chest X-ray changes were patchy consolidation with progression to bilateral bronchopneumonia over 5-10 days. Thirty-six cases developed adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), of whom 11 died. There was no response to antibiotics. The best response (no deaths) was seen in the group of 60 patients receiving early high-dose steroids and nasal CPAP (continuous airway positive pressure) ventilation; the other three treatment groups had significant mortality. Cross-infection to medical and nursing staff was completely prevented in one hospital by rigid adherence to barrier precautions during contact with infected patients. The use of rapid case identification and quarantine has controlled the outbreak in Guangzhou, in which more than 350 patients have been infected.

We performed an analysis of the atomic structure of the recognition sites seen in 75 protein-protein complexes of known three-dimensional structure: 24 protease-inhibitor, 19 antibody-antigen and 32 other complexes, including nine enzyme-inhibitor and 11 that are involved in signal transduction.The size of the recognition site is related to the conformational changes that occur upon association. Of the 75 complexes, 52 have ""standard-size"" interfaces in which the total area buried by the components in the recognition site is 1600 (+/-400) A2. In these complexes, association involves only small changes of conformation. Twenty complexes have ""large"" interfaces burying 2000 to 4660 A2, and large conformational changes are seen to occur in those cases where we can compare the structure of complexed and free components. The average interface has approximately the same non-polar character as the protein surface as a whole, and carries somewhat fewer charged groups. However, some interfaces are significantly more polar and others more non-polar than the average. Of the atoms that lose accessibility upon association, half make contacts across the interface and one-third become fully inaccessible to the solvent. In the latter case, the Voronoi volume was calculated and compared with that of atoms buried inside proteins. The ratio of the two volumes was 1.01 (+/-0.03) in all but 11 complexes, which shows that atoms buried at protein-protein interfaces are close-packed like the protein interior. This conclusion could be extended to the majority of interface atoms by including solvent positions determined in high-resolution X-ray structures in the calculation of Voronoi volumes. Thus, water molecules contribute to the close-packing of atoms that insure complementarity between the two protein surfaces, as well as providing polar interactions between the two proteins.', 'year': 1999, 'referenceCount': 134, 'citationCount': 1915, 'authors': [{'authorId': '19470661', 'name': 'L.

Since power activates abstraction (e.g., Smith & Trope, 2006), perceivers may expect higher-power individuals to speak more abstractly and therefore will infer that speakers who use more abstract language have a higher degree of power. Across a variety of contexts and conversational subjects in six experiments, participants perceived respondents as more powerful when they used more abstract language (versus more concrete language).

Long-term, we seek sufficient new insight into P450-regulating mechanisms to correctly anticipate how an individual’s P450 expressions will respond when health and/or therapeutic interventions change. To date, improving explanatory mechanistic insight relies on knowledge gleaned from in vitro, in vivo, and clinical experiments augmented by case reports. We are working to improve that reality by developing means to undertake scientifically useful virtual experiments. So doing requires translating an accepted theory of immune system influence on P450 regulation into a computational model, and then challenging the model via in silico experiments. We build upon two existing agent-based models—an in silico hepatocyte culture and an in silico liver—capable of exploring and challenging concrete mechanistic hypotheses. We instantiate an in silico version of this hypothesis: in response to lipopolysaccharide, Kupffer cells down-regulate hepatic P450 levels via inflammatory cytokines, thus leading to a reduction in metabolic capacity. We achieve multiple in vitro and in vivo validation targets gathered from five wet-lab experiments, including a lipopolysaccharide-cytokine dose-response curve, time-course P450 down-regulation, and changes in several different measures of drug clearance spanning three drugs: acetaminophen, antipyrine, and chlorzoxazone. Along the way to achieving validation targets, various aspects of each model are falsified and subsequently refined. This iterative process of falsification-refinement-validation leads to biomimetic yet parsimonious mechanisms, which can provide explanatory insight into how, where, and when various features are generated. We argue that as models such as these are incrementally improved through multiple rounds of mechanistic falsification and validation, we will generate virtual systems that embody deeper credible, actionable, explanatory insight into immune system-drug metabolism interactions within individuals.",2016,53,14,"{'name': 'PLoS ONE', 'volume': '11'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector':

The goal of VBEs is to provide a scientifically useful method of in silico experimentation that can challenge concrete hypotheses and provide explanatory, mechanistic insight into the referent system. We envision virtual experimentation not as a supplement to traditional wet-lab experimentation, but rather as an essential part of the scientific method itself. The goal of this work is to lay preliminary groundwork for realizing this vision, through outlining requirements and describing agent-based models demonstrative of this vision. VBEs focus on reasoning by analogy; thus, a VBE includes model components analogous to particular relevant aspects of the referent experiment---from hypothesis formation to data analysis, and key concepts in between. We explore five exemplary categories of scientifically useful VBEs: hypothesis, experiment context, living counterparts, experiment agents, and measurements. We discuss how to develop model components of each category in the context of agent-based modeling. We highlight the importance of two overarching requirements: concreteness and modularity. Finally, we demonstrate this vision by describing an in silico liver model that partially fulfills the VBE vision and requirements, including components corresponding to each of the five VBE categories.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 24, 'citationCount': 9, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1814142', 'name': 'Brenden K.

Multi‐scale models span a range of spatial and/or temporal scales and can encompass multi‐compartment (e.g., multi‐organ) models. Modeling advances are enabling virtual experiments to explore and answer questions that are problematic to address in the wet‐lab. Wet‐lab experimental technologies now allow scientists to observe, measure, record, and analyze experiments focusing on different system aspects at a variety of biological scales. We need the technical ability to mirror that same flexibility in virtual experiments using multi‐scale models. Here we present a new approach, tuneable resolution, which can begin providing that flexibility. Tuneable resolution involves fine‐ or coarse‐graining existing multi‐scale models at the user's discretion, allowing adjustment of the level of resolution specific to a question, an experiment, or a scale of interest. Tuneable resolution expands options for revising and validating mechanistic multi‐scale models, can extend the longevity of multi‐scale models, and may increase computational efficiency. The tuneable resolution approach can be applied to many model types, including differential equation, agent‐based, and hybrid models. We demonstrate our tuneable resolution ideas with examples relevant to infectious disease modeling, illustrating key principles at work.

To reverse this trend, we offer various suggestions for both the expansion and broader adoption of modeling and simulation (M&S) methods. We suggest strategies and scenarios intended to enable new M&S use cases that directly engage R&D knowledge generation and build actionable mechanistic insight, thereby opening the door to enhanced productivity. What M&S requirements must be satisfied to access and open the door, and begin reversing the productivity decline? Can current methods and tools fulfill the requirements, or are new methods necessary? We draw on the relevant, recent literature to provide and explore answers. In so doing, we identify essential, key roles for agent‐based and other methods. We assemble a list of requirements necessary for M&S to meet the diverse needs distilled from a collection of research, review, and opinion articles. We argue that to realize its full potential, M&S should be actualized within a larger information technology framework—a dynamic knowledge repository—wherein models of various types execute, evolve, and increase in accuracy over time. We offer some details of the issues that must be addressed for such a repository to accrue the capabilities needed to reverse the productivity decline.

Within ISHCs, mobile “compounds” carry information describing referent compound properties. We used an iterative refinement protocol for ISHC refinement and development of parameterization methods. Quasi-autonomous “hepatocytes” and their components (including “transporters” and “enzymes”) use a small, event-specific subset of compound properties to decide how to interact with encountered compounds each simulation cycle. The probability of occurrence for each event is specified by a rule that uses a subset of compound properties known to influence that event in vitro. ISHC experiments mimic in vitro counterparts. In silico clearance is measured the same as in vitro clearance and is used to predict a corresponding CL value. For 39 of 73 compounds having calculated CL S.D.s, 79% of ISHC predictions and 23% of regression predictions were within CL ± 2 S.D.

We provide plausible, concrete answers for two compounds, diltiazem and sucrose, in normal livers and two different types of cirrhotic rat livers: chronic pretreatment of rats with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and alcohol caused different types of cirrhosis. We started with simulated disposition data from normal, multilevel, physiologically based, object-oriented, discrete event in silico livers (normal ISLs) that validated against diltiazem and sucrose disposition data from normal livers. We searched the parameter space of the mechanism and found three parameter vectors that enabled matching the three wet-lab data sets.

The latter provided in silico disposition data that achieved a prespecified degree of validation against wet-lab data. The in silico transformations from normal to diseased ISLs stand as concrete theories for disease progression from the disposition perspective.

Strong correlative evidence implicates LFA-1 clustering as being essential for sustained adhesion, and it may also facilitate rebinding events with its ligand ICAM-1. We cannot challenge those hypotheses directly because it is infeasible to measure either process during leukocyte adhesion following rolling. The alternative approach undertaken was to challenge the hypothesized mechanisms by experimenting on validated, working counterparts: simulations in which diffusible, LFA1 objects on the surfaces of quasi-autonomous leukocytes interact with simulated, diffusible, ICAM1 objects on endothelial surfaces during simulated adhesion following rolling. We used object-oriented, agent-based methods to build and execute multi-level, multi-attribute analogues of leukocytes and endothelial surfaces. Validation was achieved across different experimental conditions, in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo, at both the individual cell and population levels. Because those mechanisms exhibit all of the characteristics of biological mechanisms, they can stand as a concrete, working theory about detailed events occurring at the leukocyte–surface interface during leukocyte rolling and adhesion experiments. We challenged mechanistic hypotheses by conducting experiments in which the consequences of multiple mechanistic events were tracked. We quantified rebinding events between individual components under different conditions, and the role of LFA1 clustering in sustaining leukocyte–surface adhesion and in improving adhesion efficiency. Early during simulations ICAM1 rebinding (to LFA1) but not LFA1 rebinding (to ICAM1) was enhanced by clustering. Later, clustering caused both types of rebinding events to increase. We discovered that clustering was not necessary to achieve adhesion as long as LFA1 and ICAM1 object densities were above a critical level. Importantly, at low densities LFA1 clustering enabled improved efficiency: adhesion exhibited measurable, cell level positive cooperativity.', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 81, 'citationCount': 30, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2112441381', 'name': 'Jonathan Tang'}, {'authorId': '143903228', 'name': 'C.

The same ISL has been validated against liver perfusion data for sucrose and four cationic drugs: antipyrine, atenolol, labetalol, and diltiazem. Parameters sensitive to drug-specific PCPs were tuned so that ISL outflow profiles from a single ISL matched in situ perfused rat liver outflow profiles of all five compounds. Quantitative relationships were then established between the four sets of drug PCPs and the corresponding four sets of PCP-sensitive, ISL parameter values; those relationships were used to predict PCP-sensitive, ISL parameter values for prazosin and propranolol given only their PCPs.

These effects were compared with responses of the better studied and more abundant CYP3A4. CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 were down-regulated by all cytokine treatments. CYP2C18, which is expressed at very low levels in liver, was unaffected by cytokine treatments. The other CYP2Cs and CYP2B6 showed cytokine-specific effects. CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 showed almost identical response patterns, being down-regulated by IL-6 and TGF but not significantly affected by LPS, TNF, IFN, or IL-1. CYP2B6 mRNA responded only to IL-6 and IFN. IL-6 down-regulated the mRNAs of all P450s studied. Western blot analysis of P450 protein expression supported the mRNA data to a large extent, although some inconsistencies were observed.

Among hepatic nonparenchymal inflammatory cells, we examined the role of the abundant natural killer (NK) cells and NK cells with T-cell receptors (NKT cells) in APAP-induced liver injury.\n\n\nMETHODS\nC57BL/6 mice were administered a toxic dose of APAP intraperitoneally to cause liver injury with or without depletion of NK and NKT cells by anti-NK1.1 monoclonal antibody (MAb). Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) levels, liver histology, hepatic leukocyte accumulation, and cytokine/chemokine expression were assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with APAP-treated control mice, depletion of both NK and NKT cells by anti-NK1.1 significantly protected mice from APAP-induced liver injury, as evidenced by decreased serum ALT level, improved survival of mice, decreased hepatic necrosis, inhibition of messenger RNA (mRNA) expression for interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), Fas ligand (FasL), and chemokines including KC (Keratinocyte-derived chemokine); MIP-1 alpha (macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha); MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1); IP-10 (interferon-inducible protein); Mig (monokine induced by IFN-gamma) and decreased neutrophil accumulation in the liver.

[1], who reported evidence for a critical role of the CXC che-mokines keratinocyte (KC) and macrophage-inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) in the pathophysiology of endotoxin (ET)-induced liver injury. The authors showed increased KC and MIP-2 formation during endotoxemia and found that neutralizing antibodies against these chemokines strongly attenuated parenchymal cell apoptosis, prevented neutrophil extravasation, and reduced liver injury after treatment of mice with galactosamine (Gal)/ET [1]. As neutrophil extrav-asation is a prerequisite of injury in this [2] and other inflammatory liver disease models [3], the data of Li et al. [1] appear to identify the missing link and signal, which trigger neutrophil extravasation and the attack on parenchy-mal cells [4]. Moreover, the authors showed a 68% reduction of hepatocellular apoptosis in animals treated with antibod-ies against KC and MIP-2, suggesting an involvement of CXC chemokines in apoptosis signaling, which would be a novel, unrecognized function of CXC chemokines. However, a closer look at the data raises substantial doubts about the interpretations of these results and the validity of the conclusions drawn from these studies. The first concern relates to the inhibition of apoptosis in this model. The assessment of apoptosis with Hoechst stain is clearly not accurate; e.g., 6% apoptosis in control livers [1] is ten-to 100-fold above baseline values [5]. Conversely, the reduced caspase-3 activity, a critical mediator of Gal/ET-induced apoptosis [6], supports the authors' conclusion that anti-CXC antibodies attenuated apoptosis. However, before postulating a novel discovery, the authors should have checked tumor necrosis factor ␣ (TNF-␣) formation. As apoptosis in this model is entirely TNF-dependent [7], the most likely explanation for reduced apoptosis is reduced TNF formation. In fact, injection of high doses of immunoglobulin G (IgG) has been shown to bind ET, which can reduce TNF formation by Kupffer cells [8]. The observation that all IgG treatment attenuated apoptosis and that the combination of two antibodies (twice the IgG dose) had an additive effect [1] is consistent with this explanation. The second concern is related to the conclusion that CXC chemokines are responsible for neutrophil transmigration. The authors showed no effect of the anti-CXC chemokine antibod-ies on leukocyte adherence in postsinusoidal venules, but they did not investigate sinusoidal adherence. As has been shown in this model, neutrophil transmigration occurs from sinusoids and not from venules [2].

To determine whether IL-2 suppression of human hepatocyte CYP3A activity is direct or whether it is facilitated by the presence of Kupffer cells, primary human hepatocytes were cultured alone or cocultured with primary human Kupffer cells at physiologic hepatocyte/Kupffer cell ratios of 10:1 or 10:4. Using proinflammatory cytokines as positive controls, IL-1 (0.2-20 ng/ml) and IL-6 (2-200 ng/ml) exposure resulted in a 70 to 90% decrease in CYP3A activity after 72 h in hepatocyte cultures. In the hepatocyte/Kupffer cell cocultures, an 80% decrease in CYP3A activity was observed with IL-1 (2 ng/ml) or IL-6 (20 ng/ml), suggesting that direct suppressive effects of proinflammatory cytokines on hepatocyte CYP3A activity are not substantially altered by Kupffer cells. In contrast to the effects of these proinflammatory cytokines, no sustained suppression of CYP3A activity was observed with IL-2 (2-200 ng/ml) in hepatocyte cultures. However, in hepatocyte/Kupffer cell cocultures, a concentration-dependent 50 to 70% suppression of CYP3A activity was observed with IL-2 at 72 h. In summary, these data suggest that Kupffer cells are required to reconstitute the suppressive effects of IL-2 on CYP3A activity that are observed in vivo and that hepatocyte/Kupffer cell cocultures may provide a useful model for investigating mechanisms of CYP3A4 regulation by cytokines.

Whereas the expression of most P450s in the liver is suppressed, some are induced. Many of the effects observed in vivo can be mimicked by pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFNs, and P450s are differentially regulated by these agents. Therefore, different cytokine profiles and concentrations in the vicinity of the hepatocyte in different models of inflammation may result in qualitatively and quantitatively different effects on populations of P450s. In addition to cytokines, glucocorticoids may have an important role in P450 regulation in stress conditions, including that caused by inflammatory stimuli. Although in many cases the decreases in activity are due primarily to a down-regulation of P450 gene transcription, it is likely that modulation of RNA and protein turnover, as well as enzyme inhibition, contributes to some of the observed effects. The mechanisms whereby these effects are produced may also vary with both the P450 under study and the time course of the effect. The complexity of the P450 response to inflammation and infection means that all of the above factors must be considered when trying to predict the effect of a given infectious or inflammatory condition on the clinical or toxic response of humans or animals to an administered drug or toxin. The question of whether the down-regulation of the hepatic P450 system to inflammation or infection is a homeostatic or pathological response cannot be answered at present. It is difficult to discern the physiological benefit of reducing hepatic P450 activities, unless it is to prevent the generation of reactive oxygen species generated by uncoupled catalytic turnover of the enzymes. On the other hand, as we proposed some years ago [64], the suppression of P450 may be due to the liver's need to utilize its transcriptional machinery and energy for the synthesis of APPs involved in the inflammatory response. In that case, one could ask why the organism has gone to the trouble of employing differential mechanisms for suppression of P450. One answer could be that the response evolved after the divergence of many of the P450 genes, necessitating the evolution of multiple redundant mechanisms for P450 suppression. In contrast to the down-regulation of P450s in the liver, the induction of several forms in this and other tissues suggests a more specific homeostatic role of these effects, e.g., in generation or catabolism of bioactive metabolites."", 'year': 1997, 'referenceCount': 253, 'citationCount': 489, 'authors': [{'authorId': '39717770', 'name': 'E.

Studies have indicated that more than one P450 is involved in the formation of the three major human metabolites, 4-hydroxyantipyrine, norantipyrine, and 3-hydroxymethylantipyrine. However, the specific P450s involved have not yet been determined. We have developed a sensitive method for the measurement of antipyrine metabolites formed in the in vitro incubations and applied it to determine the P450s participating in the formation of each metabolite in human liver microsomes. The identification of these P450s was accomplished through the use of simple and multivariate regression analysis, selective chemical inhibitors, and microsomes containing cDNA-expressed enzymes. These methods implicated P450s 1A2, 3A, and 2A6 in the formation of 4-hydroxyantipyrine. The predominant form involved in 3-hydroxymethylantipyrine formation was found to be 1A2, although 2C9 and 2E1 seemed to participate to a lesser extent. All forms considered (1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A) seemed to be involved in the formation of norantipyrine, although 1A2 and 2C9 only were accepted in multivariate regression analysis. Thus, antipyrine clearance is indeed a general measure of P450 oxidative capacity, with a slight to moderate weight toward 1A2, depending on the degree of 1A2 expression.

Ingestion of overdoses, however, may lead to acute liver failure accompanied by centrilobular degeneration and necrosis. Although the toxicity of acetaminophen is generally thought to be caused by direct interaction of its reactive metabolites with cellular macromolecules, recent studies have suggested that nonparenchymal cells also may contribute to tissue injury indirectly through the release of cytotoxic mediators. We analyzed the potential role of hepatic macrophages in acetaminophen hepatotoxicity by examining the effects of modulating the activity of these cells on tissue injury. Treatment of male Long Evans Hooded rats with acetaminophen (800 mg/kg) was found to induce extensive centrilobular hepatic necrosis. Pretreatment of the rats with either dextran sulfate or gadolinium chloride, two inhibitors of hepatic macrophage functioning, completely blocked hepatic necrosis, as well as increases in serum transaminase levels induced by acetaminophen. Interestingly, treatment of rats with the macrophage activator, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), also reduced tissue injury induced by acetaminophen. To exclude the possibility that the effects of gadolinium chloride, dextran sulfate, or LPS were due to alterations in acetaminophen metabolism, we analyzed the effects of these agents on various pharmacokinetic properties of this analgesic. Dextran sulfate and gadolinium chloride had no effect on the half‐life of a low dose of acetaminophen (20 mg/kg), or on the activity of any of its individual pathways of metabolism, including the formation of acetaminophenmercapturic acid. LPS treatment of rats caused a general depression of acetaminophen metabolism involving all of the known pathways of metabolic clearance, resulting in a decrease in the blood half‐life of the drug. However, the fraction of the dose converted to the toxic metabolite (NAPQI) was not different from that observed in rats given acetaminophen alone. Collectively, these data indicate that the protection afforded the animals by pretreatment with macrophage modulators was not due to suppression of the formation of NAPQI and hence support the hypothesis that macrophages may contribute directly to acetaminophen hepatotoxicity by an independent mechanism.

Accordingly, this drug has been proposed as a potential noninvasive in-vivo probe for screening the hepatic P450 2E1 activity. This study was carried out to test the specificity of such a substrate when first experiments conducted by using human hepatocyte cultures showed that the chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation activity increased after 3-methylcholanthrene treatment of cells. Indeed, the ability of both rat and human hepatocytes to metabolize chlorzoxazone significantly increased after treatments by 3-methylcholanthrene alone or plus ethanol, suggesting the involvement of P450 1A enzymes in this oxidative reaction. Identical results were obtained by in-vivo treatment of rats with four inducers of P450 1A enzymes, namely, beta-naphthoflavone, isosafrole, Arochlor 1254, and 3-methylcholanthrene. Furthermore, the chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation activity was inhibited by both alpha-naphthoflavone and dimethyl sulfoxide, both known to inhibit P450 1A and P450 2E1 activities, respectively. Finally, the use of yeasts genetically engineered for expression of human P450 1A1, 1A2, 2C9, and 3A4 demonstrated that P450 1A1 was significantly involved in this catalytic activity. In conclusion, these results taken together suggest that chlorzoxazone should be used with precaution as in-vivo tool for evaluating P450 2E1. However, the relative Km of P450 1A1 and 2E1 for chlorzoxazone and, on the other hand, the relative levels of these two enzymes in the human liver suggest that P450 2E1 would generally be the major form metabolizing chlorzoxazone in-vivo.', 'year': 1993, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 126, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2240756560', 'name': 'Veronique Carriere'}, {'authorId': '14664779', 'name': 'T.

This paper models the interpersonal communication process via a multi-agent, self-reasoning model. It considers each agent’s information value and conformity value, two key constructs adopted in this paper. This paper adopts simulated experiments to identify active users based on individuals’ behavioural characteristics, screen out typical users of different activeness levels, and reveal causalities among the outcomes. The findings show that users' activeness determines the information vitality and influence of information dissemination and substantially impacts the dynamics of user-groups. The author concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and methodological contributions and pinpoints these findings for marketers to improve online customer relationship management.",2022,69,1,"{'name': 'Int.

This allows for revealing parallels to the processes of self-identification, as these components represent first-order dimensions of the user-avatar bond. The results show that self-similarity can enhance the effect, as it can lead to a higher personal relevance of the avatar and thus facilitates mental rapprochement between user and avatar. Desirable characteristics of the avatar are integrated into the self-concept, whereas undesirable characteristics can be a barrier to the occurrence of the effect.

Prior research, through the lens of service-dominant logic, has conceptualised fans as active, commanding and critical influencers, revealing complex, multifaceted and developing co-creative relationships, but invariably only with their teams, clubs and online communities, limiting what is currently known about fans, sponsors and co-creation. Given this gap, the current study seeks to explore the perceptions and antecedents of this relationship across European football leagues with an emphasis on understanding perspectives on user generated advertising, developing social media content, creating brand culture and new product/services development for sponsoring brands. Exploratory in outlook, the paper adopts a social constructionist position, utilising 296 participants, from 9 leagues and incorporating 59 clubs. The study reveals the dynamic nature of the fan/co-creation relationship, with data indicating that fanatical and regular fans view co-creation as a cynical, intrusive and disruptive process, while casual fans seem more willing to engage, albeit episodically and driven by the anomalous emotions of guilt and superstition. The paper uncovers behaviours that offer insight for both brand managers and clubs into the reality of fan engagement in the context of co-creation.

In a driving simulator experiment deploying a between‐subjects design, participants (N = 39) were exposed to varying amounts of information displaying upcoming actions of an autonomous vehicle (symbolic information or symbolic + anthropomorphic information). Each group rated trust and liking for the test condition against a reference condition where no information about the upcoming actions was provided through questionnaires. Symbolic + anthropomorphic information resulted in significantly more trust than symbolic information. Through one‐sample tests, it was found that ratings for symbolic + anthropomorphic information were significantly different from no information, while symbolic information by itself was not.

Premised on the theory of information search, we hypothesize that consumers are more likely to engage in active search in the early stages of a movie’s release due to greater choice uncertainty, and passive attention is more likely to kick in for later stages of a movie’s release, as uncertainty decreases. To test the proposed hypotheses, we tracked over 1,500 sources of online expert and consumer reviews for cinematic movies released for an entire year and continuously monitored major social media sites (e.g., Twitter) for comments. We text-mined the comments to elucidate the sentiments and analyzed the data. Confirming our hypotheses, the results showed that expert reviews and pull-based peer comments have a significant influence in early stages of a movie’s release, and the effects decrease over time. In contrast, the volume of comments from push-based microblog platforms have a significant influence on later box office receipts.

Five studies, including textual analysis of more than 1,000 online reviews, demonstrate that compared to more implicit endorsements (e.g., “I liked it,” “I enjoyed it”), explicit endorsements (e.g., “I recommend it”) are more persuasive and increase purchase intent. This occurs because explicit endorsers are perceived to like the product more and have more expertise. Looking at the endorsement language consumers actually use, however, shows that while consumer knowledge does affect endorsement style, its effect actually works in the opposite direction. Because novices are less aware that others have heterogeneous product preferences, they are more likely to use explicit endorsements. Consequently, the endorsement styles novices and experts tend to use may lead to greater persuasion by novices.

We contribute to the debate by investigating theoretically the conditions under which the former fosters or hinders the latter. We focus on two processes of opinion polarization (negative influence and persuasive argument communication) that, according to previous modeling work, can be expected to make conflicting predictions about the relationship between segregation and opinion polarization. With a Schelling-type agent-based model of residential segregation, we generate initial environments with different levels of group segregation. Then we simulate the two processes of opinion dynamics. We show that the negative influence model predicts segregation to hinder the emergence of opinion polarization. On the other hand, the persuasive argument model predicts that segregation does not substantially foster polarization. Moreover, we explore how the spatial patterns of opinion distribution differ between the models: in particular, we investigate the likelihood that group membership and opinion align.

While some social network services have succeeded, others have failed. Understanding the factors that affect the sustainability of social network sites is important for both research and practice. We draw on the sense of community theory to develop a nomological framework of antecedents and consequences associated with sense of community in social network sites. We evaluate the framework with a survey of 506 Facebook users. We find that sense of community has a strong effect on information consumption and contribution, as well as exit intentions among social network site users, thus highlighting the important role of sense of community in the sustainability of social network sites. We also find that both system-related (sense of place associated with the social networking site) and social (social interaction) factors contribute to the development of sense of community. The nomological framework developed in the current study provides a theoretical foundation that could be adapted to study other factors that influence the development of sense of community across different virtual community contexts.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 102, 'citationCount': 59, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144240924', 'name': 'S.

By revisiting and extending earlier work on this topic, the article presents four key considerations for those conducting observational research in virtual worlds: defining and delimiting field sites, discerning attention, charting actions and attributing intention.

An increasing number of people acquire travel information through various types of media. One of the alternative information sources is social media, which enables users to exchange information among members. However, one of the characteristics of social media is information sharing, not information search, which involves both giving (i.e. posting) and taking (i.e. selective reading, forwarding, replying, linking, and liking) information. Compared to the ‘giving’ side of information-sharing research, less effort has been spent on the ‘taking’ side of information research. Therefore, we investigate travel information adoption in social media as well as how individuals communicate with each other. We use the elaboration likelihood model, which measures the impact of central (e.g. argument quality) and peripheral (e.g. credibility) cues on traveller information-sharing behaviour corresponding with social presence on social media. The results of an empirical analysis of 527 respondents, who were experienced in travel information adoption via social media, were examined. Our findings revealed that argument quality had a positive effect on perceived usefulness and source credibility positively affected perceived usefulness and social relationships. Perceived usefulness had a significant positive effect on social relationships. Both perceived usefulness and social relationships affected travel information adoption.

The primary objective of this study is to develop and refine a conceptual framework from social word-of-mouth motivations and the mobile perspective to provide a theoretical understanding of the motivations that induce consumers to engage in check-in behavior. The results show that the social condition (e.g., tie strength, subjective norms, expressiveness, social support, and information sharing) play the most critical role in motivating people to engage in check-in behavior. In addition, the perceptual (e.g., perceived social benefit, perceived enjoyment, and perceived value) and consumption-based conditions (such as customer satisfaction and communicator involvement) also motivate people to engage in check-in behavior and to disseminate their consumption experiences by using mobile devices.

Within these communities, players who share interest in MMORPGs convene, interact, and collaborate with fellow players and achieve game-related outcomes. As these online social networks have been noted to augment, and perhaps supplant person-to-person interaction, this study focuses on the drivers of inherent interpersonal relationships, the nature of the constructed society, and resulting consumer initiatives to sustain and nurture the organization. Specifically, this research suggests that MMORPG communities transcend more facile forms of online or brand communities and demonstrate characteristics that can most aptly be construed as brand tribalism in the anthropological sense. Here, the challenge and telepresence innate in playing MMORPGs, cognitive and affective involvement associated with MMORPGs, and commitment to MMORPGs are modeled as antecedents of brand tribalism or a sense of the relationship with the brand and MMORPG community. Consequently, intent to purchase MMORPG-related virtual products, recruitment of other MMORPG players, and word of mouth are identified as consequences of this unique consumer–brand relationship. Further analysis reveals the negatively charged emotional measure (i.e., defense of the tribe) within the tribalism instrument explains more variance in the outcome variables than the positively charged emotional measures (i.e., lineage, social, sense of community).

We consider eWOM communication not only as an information exchange but also as a social exchange via online consumer discussion forums. Thus, we take a dual view of online communication, considering both its informational and relational influences, to predict eWOM behaviors. We propose a theoretical model, grounded in the elaboration likelihood model, the motivation-opportunity-ability framework, and constraint-based and dedication-based relationships, to predict eWOM intention. We test this model by surveying users of an online discussion forum. Our empirical results indicate that dedication-based relational influence is more significant than informational influence in driving online referral behaviors.

This work presents three studies examining herding in product choices on the Internet. The first two studies addressed how two cues frequently found on the Internet, that is, sales volume and customer reviews, influence consumer on-line product choices. The third study examined the relative effectiveness of two recommendation sources. The experimental results revealed that subjects used the choices and evaluations of others as cues for making their own choices. However, herding effects are offset significantly by negative comments from others. Additionally, the recommendations of other consumers influence the choices of subjects more effectively than recommendations from an expert. Finally, implications of this work are discussed. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. The emerging on-line economy provides consumers with easy access to numerous choices. Unlike traditional face-to-face retail environments, in which products can be seen and touched and customers can consult salespersons, transactions occur in a computer-mediated environment that provides no opportunities for experiencing a product or for face-toface consultation before making a purchase.

Consumers give and seek opinions online in much the same way as they do offline, thereby affecting the sales of many goods and services. To further the understanding of eWOM, the present study used data from a survey of 309 consumers to develop a 32-item self-report scale measuring consumer motivations for online opinion seeking. This study revealed eight distinct factors. Consumers seek the opinions of others online to reduce their risk, because others do it, to secure lower prices, to get information easily, by accident (unplanned), because it is cool, because they are stimulated by off-line inputs such as TV, and to get pre-purchase information. A second study using data from 109 consumers showed that: (1) the scales measuring these motivations are free from social desirability response bias and acquiescence, (2) other consumers’ information is more important than advertising, and (3) consumers are likely to continue to seek WOM online, thereby confirming its importance in ecommerce.', 'year': 2006, 'referenceCount': 57, 'citationCount': 677, 'authors': [{'authorId': '46997370', 'name': 'R.

Homophily limits people's social worlds in a way that has powerful implications for the information they receive, the attitudes they form, and the interactions they experience. Homophily in race and ethnicity creates the strongest divides in our personal environments, with age, religion, education, occupation, and gender following in roughly that order.

These objectives present the ImmunoGrid Consortium with formidable challenges in terms of complexity of the immune system, our partial understanding about how the immune system works, the lack of reliable data and the scale of computational resources required. In this paper, we explain the key challenges and the approaches adopted to overcome them. We also consider wider implications for the present ambitious plans to develop natural-scale, integrated models of the human body that can make contributions to personalized health care, such as the European Virtual Physiological Human initiative. Finally, we ask a key question: How long will it take us to resolve these challenges and when can we expect to have fully functional models that will deliver health-care benefits in the form of

Its applications range from the evaluation of safety and efficacy of treatment to the optimization of therapies and therapeutic regimens. Pharmacogenomics is becoming increasingly important in immunology, for the development of new generation vaccines, immunotherapies and transplantation. The human immune system is a complex and adaptive learning system which operates at multiple levels: molecules, cells, organs, organisms, and groups of organisms. Immunologic research, both basic and applied, needs to deal with this complexity. We increasingly use mathematical modeling and computational simulation in the study of the immune system and immune responses. Thus, quantitative models that appropriately capture the complexity in architecture and function of the immune system are an integral component of the personalized medicine efforts. In silico models of the immune system can provide answers to a variety of questions, including understanding the general behavior of the immune system, the course of disease, effects of treatment, analysis of cellular and molecular interactions, and simulation of laboratory experiments. We herein present the ImmunoGrid project that integrates molecular and system level models of the immune system and processes for in silico studies of the immune function.

The VPH is intended to be a solution to common infrastructure needs for physiome projects across the globe, providing a unifying architecture that facilitates integration and prediction, ultimately creating a framework capable of describing Homo sapiens in silico. The routine reliance of the biomedical industry, biomedical research and clinical practice on information technology (IT) highlights the importance of a tailor-made and robust IT infrastructure, but numerous challenges need to be addressed if the VPH is to become a mature technological reality. Appropriate investment will reap considerable rewards, since it is anticipated that the VPH will influence all sectors of society, with implications predominantly for improved healthcare, improved competitiveness in industry and greater understanding of (patho)physiological processes.

It is a human disease broadly investigated, that is amenable to quantitative analysis. Oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) and their autoantibodies are involved in the development of atherosclerosis in animal models, but their role in humans is still not clear. Computer models may represent a virtual environment to perform experiments not possible in human volunteers that can provide a useful instrument for monitoring both the evolution of atherosclerotic lesions and to quantify the efficacy of treatments, including vaccines, oriented to reduce the LDLs and their oxidized fraction.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe report the application of an agent-based model to model both the immune response to atherogenesis and the atheromatous plaque progression in a generic artery wall. The level of oxidized LDLs, the immune humoral response with production of autoantibodies, the macrophages activity and the formation of foam cells are in good agreement with available clinical data, including the formation of atheromatous plaques in patients affected by hypercholesterolemia.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nThe model is available at http://www.immunogrid.eu/atherogenesis/', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 29, 'citationCount': 58, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2036438', 'name': 'F.

However, since HAART have several undesirable side effects, it is considered useful to suspend the therapy according to a suitable schedule of Structured Therapeutic Interruptions (STI). In the present article we describe an application of genetic algorithms (GA) aimed at finding the optimal schedule for a HAART simulated with an agent-based model (ABM) of the immune system that reproduces the most significant features of the response of an organism to the HIV-1 infection.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe genetic algorithm helps in finding an optimal therapeutic schedule that maximizes immune restoration, minimizes the viral count and, through appropriate interruptions of the therapy, minimizes the dose of drug administered to the simulated patient. To validate the efficacy of the therapy that the genetic algorithm indicates as optimal, we ran simulations of opportunistic diseases and found that the selected therapy shows the best survival curve among the different simulated control groups.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nA version of the C-ImmSim simulator is available at http://www.iac.cnr.it/~filippo/c-ImmSim.html', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 31, 'citationCount': 72, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2978966', 'name': 'F.

The specifics of how and where they might be implemented have recently been reviewed in the literature. However, the background and concerns for selecting between the different available methods have so far not been adequately covered. Summary: Before using predictions systems, it is necessary to not only understand how the methods are constructed but also their strength and limitations. The prediction systems in humoral epitope discovery are still in their infancy, but have reached a reasonable level of predictive strength. In cellular immunology, MHC class I binding predictions are now very strong and cover most of the known HLA specificities. These systems work well for epitope discovery, and predictions of the MHC class I pathway have been further improved by integration with state-of-the-art prediction tools for proteasomal cleavage and TAP binding. By comparison, class II MHC binding predictions have not developed to a comparable accuracy level, but new tools have emerged that deliver significantly improved predictions not only in terms of accuracy, but also in MHC specificity coverage. Simulation systems and mathematical modeling are also now beginning to reach a level where these methods will be able to answer more complex immunological questions.

Classical models were based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs), difference equations, and cellular automata. These models focused on the ‘simple’ dynamics obtained between a small number of reagent types (e.g. one type of receptor and one type of antigen or two T‐cell populations). With the advent of high‐throughput methods, genomic data, and unlimited computing power, immunological modeling shifted toward the informatics side. Many current applications of mathematical models in immunology are now focused around the concepts of high‐throughput measurements and system immunology (immunomics), as well as the bioinformatics analysis of molecular immunology. The types of models have shifted from mainly ODEs of simple systems to the extensive use of Monte Carlo simulations. The transition to a more molecular and more computer‐based attitude is similar to the one occurring over all the fields of complex systems analysis. An interesting additional aspect in theoretical immunology is the transition from an extreme focus on the adaptive immune system (that was considered more interesting from a theoretical point of view) to a more balanced focus taking into account the innate immune system also. We here review the origin and evolution of mathematical modeling in immunology and the contribution of such models to many important immunological concepts.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 149, 'citationCount': 54, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2446921', 'name': 'Y.

Animal and in vitro studies suggest that some strains of influenza may become resistant to oseltamivir while maintaining infectiousness (fitness). Use of antiviral agents on the scale anticipated for the control of pandemic influenza will create an unprecedented selective pressure for the emergence and spread of these strains. Nonetheless, antiviral resistance has received little attention when evaluating these plans. Methods and Findings We designed and analyzed a deterministic compartmental model of the transmission of oseltamivir-sensitive and -resistant influenza infections during a pandemic. The model predicts that even if antiviral treatment or prophylaxis leads to the emergence of a transmissible resistant strain in as few as 1 in 50,000 treated persons and 1 in 500,000 prophylaxed persons, widespread use of antivirals may strongly promote the spread of resistant strains at the population level, leading to a prevalence of tens of percent by the end of a pandemic. On the other hand, even in circumstances in which a resistant strain spreads widely, the use of antivirals may significantly delay and/or reduce the total size of the pandemic. If resistant strains carry some fitness cost, then, despite widespread emergence of resistance, antivirals could slow pandemic spread by months or more, and buy time for vaccine development; this delay would be prolonged by nondrug control measures (e.g., social distancing) that reduce transmission, or use of a stockpiled suboptimal vaccine. Surprisingly, the model suggests that such nondrug control measures would increase the proportion of the epidemic caused by resistant strains. Conclusions The benefits of antiviral drug use to control an influenza pandemic may be reduced, although not completely offset, by drug resistance in the virus. Therefore, the risk of resistance should be considered in pandemic planning and monitored closely during a pandemic.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 43, 'citationCount': 226, 'authors': [{'authorId': '48825765', 'name': 'M.

When predicting cytotoxic T cell epitopes, the main focus has been on the highly specific MHC class I binding event. Methods have also been developed for predicting the antigen‐processing steps preceding MHC class I binding, including proteasomal cleavage and transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) transport efficiency. Here, we use a dataset obtained from the SYFPEITHI database to show that a method integrating predictions of MHC class I binding affinity, TAP transport efficiency, and C‐terminal proteasomal cleavage outperforms any of the individual methods. Using an independent evaluation dataset of HIV epitopes from the Los Alamos database, the validity of the integrated method is confirmed. The performance of the integrated method is found to be significantly higher than that of the two publicly available prediction methods BIMAS and SYFPEITHI. To identify 85% of the epitopes in the HIV dataset, 9% and 10% of all possible nonamers in the HIV proteins must be tested when using the BIMAS and SYFPEITHI methods, respectively, for the selection of candidate epitopes. This number is reduced to 7% when using the integrated method.

A total of 650 simulations of the HIV-1 dynamics were performed with a modified version of the Celada-Seiden immune system model. Statistics are in agreement with epidemiological studies showing a log normal distribution for the time span between infection and the development of AIDS. As predictive parameters of disease progression we found that HIV-1 accumulates ""bit"" mutations mainly in the peptide sequences recognized by cytotoxic CD8 T cells, indicating that cell-mediated immunity plays a major role in viral control. The viral load set point was closely correlated with the time from infection to development of AIDS. Viral divergence from the viral quasispecies that was present at the beginning of infection in long-term nonprogressors (LTNP) was found to be similar to that found in rapid progressors at the time CD4 T cells drop below the critical value of 200 cells/microl. In contrast, the diversity indicated by the number of HIV strains present at the same time was higher for rapid and normal progressors compared to LTNP, suggesting that the early immune response can make the difference.

However, an increased awareness of the potential for transient side-effects following vaccination has prompted an increased emphasis on the use of sub-unit vaccines, rather than those based on whole bacterial cells. The identification of vaccine sub-units is often a lengthy process and bioinformatics approaches have recently been used to identify candidate protein vaccine antigens. Such methods ultimately offer the promise of a more rapid advance towards preclinical studies with vaccines. We have compared the properties of known bacterial vaccine antigens against randomly selected proteins and identified differences in the make-up of these two groups. A computer algorithm that exploits these differences allows the identification of potential vaccine antigen candidates from pathogenic bacteria on the basis of their amino acid composition, a property inherently associated with sub-cellular location.', 'year': 2003, 'referenceCount': 45, 'citationCount': 24, 'authors': [{'authorId': '36978132', 'name': 'C.

The instantaneous force is defined as the force acting on the coordinate of interest so that when it is subtracted from the equations of motion the acceleration along this coordinate is zero. The formula applies to simulations in which the selected coordinates are either unconstrained or constrained to fixed values. It is shown that in the latter case the formula reduces to the expression previously derived by den Otter and Briels [Mol. Phys. 98, 773 (2000)]. If simulations are carried out without constraining the coordinates of interest, the formula leads to a new method for calculating the free energy changes along these coordinates. This method is tested in two examples\u2009—\u2009rotation around the C–C bond of 1,2-dichloroethane immersed in water and transfer of fluoromethane across the water-hexane interface. The calculated free energies are compared with those obtained by two commonly used methods. One of them relies on determining the probability density function of finding the system at different values of the selected coordinate and the other requires calculating the average force at discrete locations along this coordinate in a series of constrained simulations. The free energies calculated by these three methods are in excellent agreement.

After a brief review of the times series analyses applied on secular series of observations, an appropriate method is described for characterizing these properties which finally reduces itself to the search for existing change-points. The examples of the Jones North Hemispheric land temperature averages (1856‐1995) and of the Prague Klementinum ones (1771‐1993) are given and results discussed. Relating the observed chaotic character of the climatological series to the non-linearity of the equations ruling the weather and thus climate evolution, and presenting the example of a solution of the Lorenz non-linear equations showing that non-linearity may be responsible for the instability of the generated process, it seems justified to conclude that there are severe limits to climate predictability at all scales. #1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.', 'year': 1997, 'referenceCount': 34, 'citationCount': 48, 'authors': [{'authorId': '94457989', 'name': 'R.

Usually in cancer vaccination, epitopes from one organism are included in the genome or linked with some protein of another (named carrier) in the hope that the immunogenic properties of the latter will boost an immune response to the former. However, recent results have demonstrated that injections of two different vectors encoding the same recombinant antigen generate high levels of specific immunity. Systematic comparison of the efficacy of different vaccination protocols has been hampered by technical limitations and a clear evidence that the use of multiple vectors has advantage over single carrier injections is lacking. We used a computational model to investigate the dynamics of the immune response to different anti-cancer vaccines based on randomly generated antigen/carrier compounds. More than 3000 simulations of the immune response to tumor were performed. Notably, the model has been extensively validated and it reproduces a relevant number of experimental observations. The model shows that when priming and boosting with the same construct, competition rather than cooperation develops amongst T cell clones of different specificities. Moreover, from the simulations, it appears that the sequential use of multiple carriers may generate more robust anti-tumor immune responses and may lead to effective tumor eradication in a higher percentage of cases.

MDA is a formal approach to understanding games (cid:150) one which attempts to bridge the gap between game design and development, game criticism, and technical game research. We believe this methodology will clarify and strengthen the iterative processes of developers, scholars and researchers alike, making it easier for all parties to decompose, study and design a broad class of game designs and game artifacts.', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 6, 'citationCount': 1705, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2925279', 'name': 'Robin Hunicke'}, {'authorId': '2058094940', 'name': 'M.

Methods: integrative review through scientifi c articles indexed in SciELO, Virtual Library in Human Health and PubMed and published in the last 09 years (2012 to 2020), after certain selection criteria. Results: the analyzed studies showed the importance of turmeric consumption, even if preventively, because it acts as an excellent antioxidant and anti-infl ammatory by fi ghting free radicals, which are causing infl ammation. Conclusion: the results indicate benefi ts of turmeric consumption as an agent for reducing possible risk factors for diseases, as well as its control. However, there is a need for further studies conducted in humans, and it is also essential to know the ideal amount that works with a greater power of action in the body.",2021,16,0,{'name': 'Brasília

However, a discrepancy exists between the well-documented pharmacological activities that curcumin seems to possess in vivo and its poor aqueous solubility, bioavailability, and pharmacokinetic profiles that should limit any therapeutic effect. Thus, it is possible that curcumin could exert direct regulative effects primarily in the gastrointestinal tract, where high concentrations of curcumin are present after oral administration. Indeed, a new working hypothesis that could explain the neuroprotective role of curcumin despite its limited availability is that curcumin acts indirectly on the central nervous system by influencing the “microbiota–gut–brain axis”, a complex bidirectional system in which the microbiome and its composition represent a factor which preserves and determines brain “health”. Interestingly, curcumin and its metabolites might provide benefit by restoring dysbiosis of gut microbiome. Conversely, curcumin is subject to bacterial enzymatic modifications, forming pharmacologically more active metabolites than curcumin.

15,29,3468b4cf828f30a9a9086eccef41ee45f07b1759,An in silico evaluation of anthraquinone derivatives as potential inhibitors of DNA gyrase B of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,"The World Health Organization reported that tuberculosis remains on the list of the top ten threats to public health worldwide. Among the main causes is the limited effectiveness of treatments due to the emergence of a diverse spectrum of resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of the disease. One of the main drug targets studied to combat M. tuberculosis is DNA gyrase, the only enzyme responsible for regulating DNA topology in this specie and considered essential in all bacteria. In this context, the present work tested the ability of 2,824 anthraquinones retrieved from the PubChem database to act as competitive inhibitors through interaction with ATP-binding pocket of DNA gyrase B of M. tuberculosis. Virtual screening results based on molecular docking identified 7122772 (N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-9,10-dioxoanthracene-2-sulfonamide) as the best-scored ligand. From this anthraquinone, a new derivative was designed harbouring an aminotriazole moiety, which exhibited higher binding energy calculated by molecular docking scoring and free energy calculation from molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, in these last analyses, this ligand showed to be stable in complex with the enzyme and further predictions indicated an acceptable pharmacokinetic profile. Taken together, the presented results show a new anthraquinone synthetically accessible and with promising potential to inhibit the GyrB of M. tuberculosis.",2022,48,1,{'name': 'bioRxiv'},"{'model':

We identified six novel hits as DNA gyrase B inhibitors in the present study by employing 3D-pharmacophore structure-based virtual screening. The lead compounds complied with drug-likeness rules and lacked toxicity. Compound 4 (ZINC32858011) showed the highest inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 6.3 ± 0.1 μM against the DNA gyrase enzyme. In contrast, the positive controls ciprofloxacin and novobiocin used in enzyme inhibition assay had IC50 values of 14.4 ± 0.2 and 12.4 ± 0.2 μM, respectively. The molecular docking of the six hits demonstrated that compounds 1, 2, 4, and 6 had suitable fitting modes inside the binding pocket. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for the six hits and the rmsd, rmsf, radius of gyration, and solvent accessible surface area parameters obtained from 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations for the six compounds complexed with a DNA gyrase B protein indicated that compound 4 (ZINC32858011) formed the most stable complex with DNA gyrase B. The binding free energy calculation with the MM-PBSA method suggested that the van der Waals interaction, followed by electrostatic force, played a significant role in the binding. Per-residue free binding energy decomposition showed that Ile78 contributed the most for the binding energy followed by Asn46, Asp49, Glu50, Asp73, Ile78, Pro79, Ala86, Ile90, Val120, Thr165, and Val167.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 49, 'citationCount': 8, 'authors': [{'authorId': '10297574', 'name': 'Samia A Elseginy'}, {'authorId': '2236947209', 'name': 'M.

This method has been proven to balance accuracy and computational efficiency, especially when dealing with large systems. As a result of its popularity, several programs have been developed for performing MM/PB(GB)SA calculations within the GROMACS community. These programs, however, present several limitations. Here we present gmx_MMPBSA, a new tool to perform end-state free energy calculations from GROMACS molecular dynamics trajectories. gmx_MMPBSA provides the user with several options, including binding free energy calculations with different solvation models (PB, GB, or 3D-RISM), stability calculations, computational alanine scanning, entropy corrections, and binding free energy decomposition. Noteworthy, several promising methodologies to calculate relative binding free energies such as alanine scanning with variable dielectric constant and interaction entropy have also been implemented in gmx_MMPBSA. Two additional tools-gmx_MMPBSA_test and gmx_MMPBSA_ana-have been integrated within gmx_MMPBSA to improve its usability. Multiple illustrating examples can be accessed through gmx_MMPBSA_test, while gmx_MMPBSA_ana provides fast, easy, and efficient access to different graphics plotted from gmx_MMPBSA output files.

Newer antibiotic-resistance mechanisms in microbes contribute to the inefficacy of the existing drugs along with the prolonged illness and escalating expenditures. The injudicious usage of the conventional and commonly available antibiotics in human health, hygiene, veterinary and agricultural practices is proving to be a major driver for evolution, persistence and spread of antibiotic-resistance at a frightening rate. The drying pipeline of new and potent antibiotics is adding to the severity. Therefore, novel and effective new drugs and innovative therapies to treat MDR infections are urgently needed. Apart from the different natural and synthetic drugs being tested, plant secondary metabolites or phytochemicals are proving efficient in combating the drug-resistant strains. Various phytochemicals from classes including alkaloids, phenols, coumarins, terpenes have been successfully demonstrated their inhibitory potential against the drug-resistant pathogens. Several phytochemicals have proved effective against the molecular determinants responsible for attaining the drug resistance in pathogens like membrane proteins, biofilms, efflux pumps and bacterial cell communications. However, translational success rate needs to be improved, but the trends are encouraging.

It is estimated that in the next 35 years, drug-resistant TB will kill around 75 million people and cost the global economy $16.7 trillion. Indeed, the COVID-19 pandemic alone may contribute with the development of 6.3 million new TB cases due to lack of resources and enforced confinement in TB endemic areas. Evolution of drug-resistant M.tb depends on numerous factors, such as bacterial fitness, strain’s genetic background and its capacity to adapt to the surrounding environment, as well as host-specific and environmental factors. Whole-genome transcriptomics and genome-wide association studies in recent years have shed some insights into the complexity of M.tb drug resistance and have provided a better understanding of its underlying molecular mechanisms. In this review, we will discuss M.tb phenotypic and genotypic changes driving resistance, including changes in cell envelope components, as well as recently described intrinsic and extrinsic factors promoting resistance emergence and transmission.

The bacterial type IIA topoisomerases, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, are validated antibacterial drug targets with multiple prospective drug binding sites, including the catalytic site targeted by the fluoroquinolone antibiotics. However, growing resistance to fluoroquinolones, frequently mediated by mutations in the drug-binding site, is increasingly limiting the utility of this antibiotic class, prompting the search for other inhibitor classes that target different sites on the topoisomerase complexes. The highly conserved ATP-binding subunits of DNA gyrase (GyrB) and topoisomerase IV (ParE) have long been recognized as excellent candidates for the development of dual-targeting antibacterial agents with broad-spectrum potential. However, to date, no natural product or small molecule inhibitors targeting these sites have succeeded in the clinic, and no inhibitors of these enzymes have yet been reported with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity encompassing the majority of Gram-negative pathogens. Using structure-based drug design (SBDD), we have created a novel dual-targeting pyrimidoindole inhibitor series with exquisite potency against GyrB and ParE enzymes from a broad range of clinically important pathogens. Inhibitors from this series demonstrate potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens of clinical importance, including fluoroquinolone resistant and multidrug resistant strains.

A comprehensive validation of the revised force field was then performed against data not used to guide parametrization: (i) comparison of simulations of eight proteins in their crystal environments with crystal structures; (ii) comparison with backbone scalar couplings for weakly structured peptides; (iii) comparison with NMR residual dipolar couplings and scalar couplings for both backbone and side-chains in folded proteins; (iv) equilibrium folding of mini-proteins.

Amino acids in proximity to bound nonhydrolyzable ATP analog (AMP\u2009·\u2009PNP) or novobiocin in the gyrase B (GyrB) subunit crystal structures were examined for their roles in enzyme function and novobiocin resistance by site-directed mutagenesis. Purified Escherichia coli GyrB mutant proteins were complexed with the gyrase A subunit to form the functional A2B2 gyrase enzyme. Mutant proteins with alanine substitutions at residues E42, N46, E50, D73, R76, G77, and I78 had reduced or no detectable ATPase activity, indicating a role for these residues in ATP hydrolysis. Interestingly, GyrB proteins with P79A and K103A substitutions retained significant levels of ATPase activity yet demonstrated no DNA supercoiling activity, even with 40-fold more enzyme than the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that these amino acid side chains have a role in the coupling of the two activities. All enzymes relaxed supercoiled DNA to the same extent as the wild-type enzyme did, implying that only ATP-dependent reactions were affected. Mutant genes were examined in vivo for their abilities to complement a temperature-sensitive E. coli gyrB mutant, and the activities correlated well with the in vitro activities. We show that the known R136 novobiocin resistance mutations bestow a significant loss of inhibitor potency in the ATPase assay. Four new residues (D73, G77, I78, and T165) that, when changed to the appropriate amino acid, result in both significant levels of novobiocin resistance and maintain in vivo function were identified in E. coli.', 'year': 2003, 'referenceCount': 52, 'citationCount': 80, 'authors': [{'authorId': '31173686', 'name': 'C.

In contrast to E.coli gyrase, the M.smegmatis enzyme exhibits strong decatenase activity at physiological Mg2+ concentrations. Further, the enzymes exhibited marked differences in ATPase activity, DNA binding characteristics and susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. The holoenzyme showed very low intrinsic ATPase activity and was stimulated 20-fold in the presence of DNA. The DNA-stimulated ATPase kinetics revealed apparent K0.5 and kcat of 0.68 mM and 0.39 s(-1), respectively. The dissociation constant for DNA was found to be 9.2 nM, which is 20 times weaker than that of E.coli DNA gyrase. The differences between the enzymes were further substantiated as they exhibited varied sensitivity to moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin.

Basis, form, scope, parameterization, and performance of MMFF94', 'abstract': 'This article introduces MMFF94, the initial published version of the Merck molecular force field (MMFF). It describes the objectives set for MMFF, the form it takes, and the range of systems to which it applies. This study also outlines the methodology employed in parameterizing MMFF94 and summarizes its performance in reproducing computational and experimental data. Though similar to MM3 in some respects, MMFF94 differs in ways intended to facilitate application to condensed‐phase processes in molecular‐dynamics simulations. Indeed, MMFF94 seeks to achieve MM3‐like accuracy for small molecules in a combined “organic/protein” force field that is equally applicable to proteins and other systems of biological significance. A second distinguishing feature is that the core portion of MMFF94 has primarily been derived from high‐quality computational data—ca. 500 molecular structures optimized at the HF/6‐31G* level, 475 structures optimized at the MP2/6‐31G* level, 380 MP2/6‐31G* structures evaluated at a defined approximation to the MP4SDQ/TZP level, and 1450 structures partly derived from MP2/6‐31G* geometries and evaluated at the MP2/TZP level. A third distinguishing feature is that MMFF94 has been parameterized for a wide variety of chemical systems of interest to organic and medicial chemists, including many that feature frequently occurring combinations of functional groups for which little, if any, useful experimental data are available. The methodology used in parameterizing MMFF94 represents a fourth distinguishing feature. Rather than using the common “functional group” approach, nearly all MMFF parameters have been determined in a mutually consistent fashion from the full set of available computational data. MMFF94 reproduces the computational data used in its parameterization very well. In addition, MMFF94 reproduces experimental bond lengths (0.014 Å root mean square [rms]), bond angles (1.2° rms), vibrational frequencies (61 cm−1 rms), conformational energies (0.38 kcal/mol/rms), and rotational barriers (0.39 kcal/mol rms) very nearly as well as does MM3 for comparable systems. MMFF94 also describes intermolecular interactions in hydrogen‐bonded systems in a way that closely parallels that given by the highly regarded OPLS force field. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.', 'year': 1996, 'referenceCount': 57, 'citationCount': 4022, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2709923', 'name': 'T.

Subsequently, on March 12, 2020, 125,048 cases and 4,614 deaths were reported. Coronavirus is an enveloped RNA virus, from the genus Betacoronavirus, that is distributed in birds, humans, and other mammals. WHO has named the novel coronavirus disease as COVID-19. More than 80 clinical trials have been launched to test coronavirus treatment, including some drug repurposing or repositioning for COVID-19. Hence, we performed a search in March 2020 of the clinicaltrials.gov database. The eligibility criteria for the retrieved studies were: contain a clinicaltrials.gov base identifier number; describe the number of participants and the period for the study; describe the participants’ clinical conditions; and utilize interventions with medicines already studied or approved for any other disease in patients infected with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV). It is essential to emphasize that this article only captured trials listed in the clinicaltrials.gov database. We identified 24 clinical trials, involving more than 20 medicines, such as human immunoglobulin, interferons, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir, oseltamivir, methylprednisolone, bevacizumab, and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM). Although drug repurposing has some limitations, repositioning clinical trials may represent an attractive strategy because they facilitate the discovery of new classes of medicines; they have lower costs and take less time to reach the market; and there are existing pharmaceutical supply chains for formulation and distribution.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 54, 'citationCount': 327, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2054330250', 'name': 'Sandro G.

The method, termed Tork, uses normal‐mode analysis in bond–angle–torsion coordinates and focuses on a key subset of torsional coordinates to identify natural molecular motions that lead the initial conformation to new energy minima. New conformations are generated via distortion along these modes and their pairwise combinations, followed by energy minimization. For complexes, special treatment is accorded to the six coordinates that specify the position and orientation of one molecule relative to the other. Tests described here show that Tork is highly efficient for cyclic, acyclic, and mixed single molecules, as well as for host–guest complexes. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

17,32,09244e3b9de20e6856a0600c2deee7c7d9cfd34d,Intelligent Agents: A Way to Engage Seniors in Health Informatics,"E -pharmacies are an excellent form of health informatics to enhance health care management efficacy among seniors by offering access to reliable health information and medication management services. However, seniors’ cognitive aging is often associated with difficulty in learning and retaining new system knowledge, deterring them from using e-pharmacies and leading to social and emotional challenges. To address these challenges, we developed an intelligent agent, or a virtual persona embedded in web interfaces. The agent acted as a virtual pharmacist, providing step-by-step verbal and visual guidance for various e-pharmacy tasks. In collaboration with a local pharmacy and three local senior-serving agencies in Alabama, we implemented this agent in an e-pharmacy interface and invited 24 male and 26 female seniors to experience it. Participants’ ages ranged from 65 to 84. The results revealed that seniors perceived significantly higher ease of use with (vs. without) the virtual pharmacist’s assistance (p < .05). This enhanced ease of use led to the seniors’ increased self-efficacy using the e-pharmacy (β = .81, p < .01). Seniors also perceived higher social support when receiving virtual pharmacist assistance (p < .01), which in turn drove increased trust in the ability (β = .79, p < .001) and integrity (β = .70, p < .001) of the e-pharmacy in meeting their needs. The enhanced efficacy (β = .28, p < .05) and trust in ability (β = .59, p < .001) resulted in greater satisfaction with the e-pharmacy, which in turn facilitated the seniors’ intention to use the e-pharmacy for future needs. This outreach and research program showed the potential of increasing seniors’ engagement with health informatics through the use of intelligent agent technology. Further, the significant role of an intelligent agent may extend beyond the senior population and address the cognitive, social, and emotional obstacles to using health informatics among many other underserved user groups. 234 Journal of Higher Education Outreach and Engagement",2018,0,0,"{'name': 'Journal of Higher Education Outreach and Engagement', 'pages': '233-234', 'volume':

Thus, the objective of the study is to perform a review on bacterial, fungal and viral infections in surgical site in relation to clinical, diagnostic and epidemiological aspects. A bibliographic and exploratory research was carried out and the Virtual Health Library (VHL), Capes Periodicals and the Pubmed to search the articles were consulted. As for the clinical aspects, the phlogistic signs that allow to identify an inflammatory picture, being a response of the organism to some aggressive agent. Among the bacterial diagnostic methods, the most used ones are the color smear examination, cultural and biochemical characteristics, ELISA, PCR and SAR. As for the detection of fungi and yeasts are the production of the germ tube, micro-culture in agar-tween 80 agar, assimilation of carbohydrates or nitrogen and fermentation of carbohydrates. For viruses, virus isolation, cell culture, laboratory animals and embryonated eggs may be used. Although bacterial infections account for most surgical infections, fungal and viral infections can also be seen in hospital settings and their diagnosis needs to be performed as soon as possible for proper treatment, reducing costs for medical services and length of stay of the patient in the hospital environment, also reducing other risks of infection.Keywords: Surgical Wound Infection. Bacterial Infections. Mycoses. Virus Diseases.ResumoAs Infecções do Sítio Cirúrgico (ISC) são infecções relacionadas a procedimentos cirúrgicos em pacientes internados e ambulatoriais, indicadas com alta prevalência em relação às infecções ligadas aos cuidados em saúde evitáveis. Neste sentido, o objetivo do estudo é realizar uma revisão sobre as infecções bacterianas, fúngicas e virais em sítio cirúrgico em relação aos aspectos clínicos, diagnósticos e epidemiológicos. Foi realizada uma pesquisa bibliográfica e exploratória e consultada a Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde (BVS), os Periódicos Capes e o Pubmed para busca dos artigos. Quanto aos aspectos clínicos, os sinais flogísticos que permitem identificar um quadro inflamatório, sendo uma resposta do organismo frente a algum agente agressor. Dentre os métodos diagnósticos bacterianos, os mais utilizados são o Exame de esfregaços corados, Características culturais e bioquímicas, ELISA, PCR e o SAR. Quanto à detecção de fungos e leveduras estão a produção do tubo germinativo, micro cultivo em ágar fubá-tween 80, assimilação de carboidratos ou de nitrogênio e fermentação dos carboidratos. Em relação aos vírus, podem ser utilizadas o isolamento dos vírus, a cultura de células, os animais de laboratório e os ovos embrionados. Apesar das infecções bacterianas representarem a maior parte das infecções cirúrgicas, as infecções fúngicas e virais também podem ser vistas em ambientes hospitalares e seu diagnóstico precisa ser realizado o mais rápido possível para um tratamento adequado, reduzindo os custos com serviços médicos e o tempo de permanência do paciente no ambiente hospitalar, diminuindo também outros riscos de infecção.Palavras-chave: Infecção da Ferida Cirúrgica.

The present study aimed to determine the epidemiological profile of SSI and its association with the risk factors. It is a transversal study done at the Sao Joao Batista Hospital of Vicosa-MG and at the Surgery Service of the Small Animals Veterinary Hospital of the Universidade Federal de Vicosa-MG, from September 2012 to February 2013. Global SSI rates were 0.7% at the human and 3.46% at the veterinary hospitals. At the veterinary hospital, SSI rates were not related to contamination potential, with clean procedures presenting the greater rates. As for the type of surgery, orthopedic ones are the most common in both hospital and also the ones presenting the greater SSI rates. Surgeries during more than 120 minutes were 15.25% of the total of procedures at the human hospital and are even less common in the veterinary, with 1.26%. Rate of SSI does not seem to be related to surgery duration in this classification. Bacteria isolated from surgical wounds were multi-resistant and the obtained data indicated that no criteria of antibiotic prophylaxis existed, mainly for clean surgeries.

To determine healthcare-associated infection (HAI) prevalence in 9 hospitals in Jacksonville, Florida; to evaluate the performance of proxy indicators for HAIs; and to refine methodology in preparation for a multistate survey. Design. Point prevalence survey. Patients. Acute care inpatients of any age. Methods. HAIs were defined using National Healthcare Safety Network criteria. In each facility a trained primary team (PT) of infection prevention (IP) staff performed the survey on 1 day, reviewing records and collecting data on a random sample of inpatients. PTs assessed patients with one or more proxy indicators (abnormal white blood cell count, abnormal temperature, or antimicrobial therapy) for the presence of HAIs. An external IP expert team collected data from a subset of patient records reviewed by PTs to assess proxy indicator performance and PT data collection. Results. Of 851 patients surveyed by PTs, 51 had one or more HAIs (6.0%; 95% confidence interval, 4.5%–7.7%). Surgical site infections (n = 18), urinary tract infections (n = 9), pneumonia (n = 9), and bloodstream infections (n = 8) accounted for 75.8% of 58 HAIs detected by PTs. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen, causing 9 HAIs (15.5%). Antimicrobial therapy was the most sensitive proxy indicator, identifying 95.5% of patients with HAIs. Conclusions. HAI prevalence in this pilot was similar to that reported in the 1970s by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Study on the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control. Antimicrobial therapy was a sensitive screening variable with which to identify those patients at higher risk for infection and reduce data collection burden.

The National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) has provided simple risk adjustment of surgical site infection (SSI) rates to participating hospitals to facilitate quality improvement activities; improved risk models were developed and evaluated. Methods. Data reported to the NHSN for all operative procedures performed from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2008, were analyzed. Only SSIs related to the primary incision site were included. A common set of patient- and hospital-specific variables were evaluated as potential SSI risk factors by univariate analysis. Some ific variables were available for inclusion. Stepwise logistic regression was used to develop the specific risk models by procedure category. Bootstrap resampling was used to validate the models, and the c-index was used to compare the predictive power of new procedure-specific risk models with that of the models with the NHSN risk index as the only variable (NHSN risk index model). Results. From January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2008, 847 hospitals in 43 states reported a total of 849,659 procedures and 16,147 primary incisional SSIs (risk, 1.90%) among 39 operative procedure categories. Overall, the median c-index of the new procedure-specific risk was greater (0.67 [range, 0.59–0.85]) than the median c-index of the NHSN risk index models (0.60 [range, 0.51–0.77]); for 33 of 39 procedures, the new procedure-specific models yielded a higher c-index than did the NHSN risk index models.

This study aimed at providing a review of candidemia, showing some important aspects of etio-epidemiology, fungus/host relation, and laboratorial diagnosis of this emerging systemic infection. During the onset of candidemia, yeasts play a major role on several virulence factors, which ultimately promote its pathogenesis. Among them, it may be highlighted the extracellular enzyme production, dimorphism, hemolysin synthesis, adhesion ability and biofilm development. In infected patients, medicines must be administered in the early stages to minimize the risks of complications and antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, an efficient laboratory diagnosis is required.

METODOS: As coletas foram realizadas mensalmente e em dois periodos, do centro cirurgico e unidades de terapia intensiva adulto e neonatal em hospital de Araraquara, Estado de Sao Paulo. Para coleta de fungos anemofilos foi utilizado amostrador tipo Andersen de simples estagio. A pesquisa de leveduras foi feita das maos e de orofaringe de profissionais de saude, bem como de superficies de leitos e de macanetas das areas criticas. RESULTADOS: Foram recuperados do centro cirurgico 32 generos de fungos anemofilos e 31 das unidades de terapia intensiva. Os generos mais frequentemente isolados foram Cladophialophora spp., Fusarium spp., Penicillium spp., Chrysosporium spp. e Aspergillus spp. Durante o periodo de estudo, houve reforma e implantacao de uma unidade dentro do hospital, que coincidiu com o aumento na contagem de colonias de Cladophialophora spp., Aspergillus spp. e Fusarium spp. Leveduras foram encontradas em 39,4% dos profissionais de saude (16,7% das amostras dos espacos interdigitais, 12,1% do leito subungueal e 10,6% da orofaringe) e, em 44% das amostras do mobiliario, com predominio do genero Candida (C. albicans, C. guilliermondii, C. parapsilosis e C. lusitaniae) seguido por Trichosporon spp. CONCLUSOES: Observou-se numero relativamente elevado de fungos anemofilos (potencialmente patogenicos) em areas especiais e niveis expressivos de leveduras em fontes bioticas e abioticas.

The poor efficacy and unfavorable side effects of current treatments necessitate novel therapeutics. Cruzain, the major cysteine protease of T. cruzi, is one potential novel target. Recent advances in a class of vinyl sulfone inhibitors are encouraging; however, as most potential therapeutics fail in clinical trials and both disease progression and resistance call for combination therapy with several drugs, the identification of additional classes of inhibitory molecules is essential. Using an exhaustive virtual‐screening and experimental validation approach, we identify several additional small‐molecule cruzain inhibitors. Further optimization of these chemical scaffolds could lead to the development of novel drugs useful in the treatment of Chagas’ disease.",2012,54,32,"{'name': 'Chemical Biology & Drug Design',

A vaccine would be key to improve disease control and we review here the recent advances and challenges of a T. cruzi vaccine. There is a growing consensus that a protective immune response requires the activation of a Th1 immune profile, with the stimulation of CD8+ T cells. Several vacines types, including recombinant proteins, DNA and viral vectors, as well as heterologous prime-boost combinations, have been found immunogenic and protective in mouse models, providing proof-of-concept data on the feasibility of a preventive or therapeutic vaccine to control a T. cruzi infection.

Novel chemotherapy with the drug K11777 targets the major cysteine protease cruzain and disrupts amastigote intracellular development. Nevertheless, the biological role of the protease in infection and pathogenesis remains unclear as cruzain gene knockout failed due to genetic redundancy. A role for the T. cruzi cysteine protease cruzain in immune evasion was elucidated in a comparative study of parental wild type- and cruzain-deficient parasites. Wild type T. cruzi did not activate host macrophages during early infection (<60 min) and no increase in ∼P iκB was detected. The signaling factor NF-κB P65 colocalized with cruzain on the cell surface of intracellular wild type parasites, and was proteolytically cleaved. No significant IL-12 expression occurred in macrophages infected with wild type T. cruzi and treated with LPS and BFA, confirming impairment of macrophage activation pathways. In contrast, cruzain-deficient parasites induced macrophage activation, detectable iκB phosphorylation, and nuclear NF-κB P65 localization. These parasites were unable to develop intracellularly and survive within macrophages. IL 12 expression levels in macrophages infected with cruzain-deficient T. cruzi were comparable to LPS activated controls. Thus cruzain hinders macrophage activation during the early (<60 min) stages of infection, by interruption of the NF-κB P65 mediated signaling pathway. These early events allow T. cruzi survival and replication, and may lead to the spread of infection in acute Chagas' disease."", 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 97, 'citationCount': 104, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145068490', 'name': 'P.

We aimed to evaluate nifurtimox tolerance and safety in a cohort of Trypanosoma cruzi-infected adult patients in a country of nonendemicity.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis observational study included all consecutive adults patients who were given a diagnosis of T. cruzi infection from June through December 2008. Eligible patients received nifurtimox at 10 mg/kg/day for 60 days, with regular medical and biological follow-up. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEighty-one patients received nifurtimox. Eight were lost to follow-up during treatment, and 41 (56.2%) completed the 60-day course. All premature treatment terminations were caused by AEs; 97.5% of patients suffered from AEs, mostly expected (90.5%) and not severe. Gastrointestinal symptoms predominated. Six (7.4%) patients presented with a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction: drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (n = 3), Quincke edema (n = 1), acute myocarditis (n = 1), and anaphylaxis (n = 1). Patients with 3 or more AEs had an increased risk of premature treatment termination (hazard ratio, 8.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-45.5).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNifurtimox is poorly tolerated among adults with chronic Chagas disease, resulting in a low treatment completion rate. Considering the significant risk of serious AEs, close monitoring is required, which may be difficult to implement in poor rural areas of countries of endemicity. The safety and efficacy of nifurtimox and benznidazole should be compared to improve current therapeutic recommendations, and pharmacovigilance systems should be enhanced.', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 26, 'citationCount': 180, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144848733', 'name': 'Y.

As the current treatments for African trypanosomiasis and other similar infections are limited, new therapeutics are urgently needed. RNA Editing Ligase 1 (REL1), a protein unique to trypanosomes and other kinetoplastids, was identified recently as a potential drug target. Methodology/Principal Findings Motivated by the urgent need for novel trypanocidal therapeutics, we use an ensemble-based virtual-screening approach to discover new naphthalene-based TbREL1 inhibitors. The predicted binding modes of the active compounds are evaluated within the context of the flexible receptor model and combined with computational fragment mapping to determine the most likely binding mechanisms.

Structure based virtual screening, namely, the in silico evaluation of binding energies and geometries between a protein and its putative ligands, has emerged over the past few years as a promising approach in this field. The success of the method relies on the availability of reliable 3-dimensional (3D) structures of the target protein and its candidate ligands (the screening library), a reliable docking method that can fit the different ligands into the protein's binding site, and an accurate scoring function that can rank the resulting binding modes in accord with their binding affinities. This last requirement is arguably the most difficult to meet due to the complexity of the binding process. A potential solution to this so-called scoring problem is the usage of multiple scoring functions in an approach known as consensus scoring. Several consensus scoring methods were suggested in the literature and have generally demonstrated an improved ranking of screening libraries relative to individual scoring functions. Nevertheless, current consensus scoring strategies suffer from several shortcomings, in particular, strong dependence on the initial parameters and an incomplete treatment of inactive compounds. In this work we present a new consensus scoring algorithm (SeleX-Consensus Scoring abbreviated to SeleX-CS) specifically designed to address these limitations: (i) A subset of the initial set of the scoring functions is allowed to form the consensus score, and this subset is optimized via a Monte Carlo/Simulated Annealing procedure. (ii) Rank redundancy between the members of the screening library is removed. (iii) The method explicitly considers the presence of inactive compounds. The new algorithm was applied to the ranking of screening libraries targeting two G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR). Excellent enrichment factors were obtained in both cases: For the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), SeleX-CS outperformed the best single score and afforded an enrichment factor of 41 at 1% of the screening library compared with the best single score value of 15 (GOLD_Fitness). For the chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) SeleX-CS afforded an enrichment factor of 72 (again at 1% of the screening library) once more outperforming any single score (enrichment factor of 20 by GSCORE). Moreover, SeleX-CS demonstrated success rates of 67% (CCR2) and 73% (CB1) when applied to ranking an external test set. In both cases, the new algorithm also afforded good derichment of inactive compounds (i.e., the ability to push inactive compounds to the bottom of the ranked library). The method was then extended to rank a lead optimization series targeting the Kv4.3 potassium ion channel, resulting in a Spearman's correlation coefficient, p = 0.63 (n = 40), between the SeleX-CS-based rank and the actual pKi values. These results suggest that SeleX-CS is a powerful method for ranking screening libraries in the lead discovery phase and also merits consideration as a lead optimization tool."", 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 47, 'citationCount': 30, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1403167040', 'name': 'S.

Proteolytic enzymes play key roles in the life cycle of protozoan parasites or the pathogenesis of diseases they produce. These roles include processing of host or parasite surface proteins for invasion of host cells, digestion of host proteins for nutrition, and inactivation of host immune defense mediators. Recent findings Drug development for other markets has shown that proteases are druggable targets, and protease inhibitors are now licensed or in clinical development to treat hypertension, diabetes, thrombosis, osteoporosis, infectious diseases, and cancer. Several protease targets have been validated by genetic or chemical knockout in protozoan parasites. Many other parasite proteases appear promising as targets, but require more work for validation, or to identify viable drug leads. Because homologous proteases function as key enzymes in several parasites, targeting these proteases may allow development of a single compound, or a set of similar compounds, that target multiple diseases including malaria, trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, toxoplasmosis, cryptosporidiosis, and amebiasis. Summary Proteases have been validated as targets in a number of parasitic infections. Proteases are druggable targets as evidenced by effective antiprotease drugs for the treatment of many human diseases including hypertension and AIDS.

Here, we report that in trypanosomes, both drugs are activated by a NADH-dependent, mitochondrially localized, bacterial-like, type I nitroreductase (NTR), and that down-regulation of this explains how resistance may emerge. Loss of a single copy of this gene in Trypanosoma cruzi, either through in vitro drug selection or by targeted gene deletion, is sufficient to cause significant cross-resistance to a wide range of nitroheterocyclic drugs. In Trypanosoma brucei, loss of a single NTR allele confers similar cross-resistance without affecting growth rate or the ability to establish an infection.

About 16-18 million persons are infected with the aetiological agent of the disease, Trypanosoma cruzi, and more than 100 million are living at risk of infection. There are different modes of infection: 1) via blood sucking vector insects infected with T. cruzi, accounting for 80-90% of transmission of the disease; 2) via blood transfusion or congenital transmission, accounting for0.5-8% of transmission; 3) other less common forms of infection, eg, from infected food or drinks or via infected organs used in transplants. The acute phase of the disease can last from weeks to months and typically is asymptomatic or associated with fever and other mild non-specific manifestations. However, life-threatening myocarditis or meningoencephalitis can occur during the acute phase. The death rate for persons in this phase is about 10%. Approximately 10-50% of the survivors develop chronic Chagas’ disease, which is characterized by potentially lethal cardiopathy and megacolon or megaoesophagus. There are two drugs available for the aetiological treatment of Chagas’ disease: nifurtimox (Nfx) and benznidazole (Bz). Nfx is a nitrofurane and Bz is a nitroimidazole compound. The use of these drugs to treat the acute phase of the disease is widely accepted. However, their use in the treatment of the chronic phase is controversial. The undesirable side effects of both drugs are a major drawback in their use, frequently forcing the physician to stop treatment. The most frequent adverse effects observed in the use of Nfx are: anorexia, loss of weight, psychic alterations, excitability, sleepiness, digestive manifestations such as nausea or vomiting, and occasionally intestinal colic and diarrhoea. In the case of Bz, skin manifestations are the most notorious (eg, hypersensitivity, dermatitis with cutaneous eruptions, generalized oedema, fever, lymphoadenopathy, articular and muscular pain), with depression of bone marrow, thrombocytopenic purpura and agranulocytosis being the more severe manifestations. Experimental toxicity studies with Nfx evidenced neurotoxicity, testicular damage, ovarian toxicity, and deleterious effects in adrenal, colon, oesophageal and mammary tissue. In the case of Bz, deleterious effects were observed in adrenals, colon and oesophagus. Bz also inhibits the metabolism of several xenobiotics biotransformed by the cytochrome P450 system and its reactive metabolites react with fetal components in vivo. Both drugs exhibited significant mutagenic effects and were shown to be tumorigenic or carcinogenic in some studies. The toxic side effects of both nitroheterocyclic derivatives require enzymatic reduction of their nitro group. Those processes are fundamentally mediated by cytochrome P450 reductase and cytochrome P450. Other enzymes such as xanthine oxidoreductase or aldehyde oxidase may also be involved.', 'year': 2006, 'referenceCount': 58, 'citationCount': 463, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2371053', 'name': 'J.

Previous work has found that several nonspecific compounds form submicrometer aggregates, and it has been suggested that this aggregate species is responsible for the inhibition of many different enzymes. It is not understood how aggregates inhibit their targets. To address this question, biophysical, kinetic, and microscopy methods were used to study the interaction of promiscuous, aggregate-forming inhibitors with model proteins. By use of centrifugation and gel electrophoresis, aggregates and protein were found to directly interact. This is consistent with a subsequent observation from confocal fluorescence microscopy that aggregates concentrate green fluorescent protein. beta-Lactamase mutants with increased or decreased thermodynamic stability relative to wild-type enzyme were equally inhibited by an aggregate-forming compound, suggesting that denaturation by unfolding was not the primary mechanism of interaction. Instead, visualization by electron microscopy revealed that enzyme associates with the surface of inhibitor aggregates. This association could be reversed or prevented by the addition of Triton X-100. These observations suggest that the aggregates formed by promiscuous compounds reversibly sequester enzyme, resulting in apparent inhibition.

This method seems quite independent to the target receptor, the docking program, or even the scoring functions under investigation. Here we present an idealized computer experiment to explore how consensus scoring works. A hypothetical set of 5000 compounds is used to represent a chemical library under screening. The binding affinities of all its member compounds are assigned by mimicking a real situation. Based on the assumption that the error of a scoring function is a random number in a normal distribution, the predicted binding affinities were generated by adding such a random number to the ""observed"" binding affinities. The relationship between the hit-rates and the number of scoring functions employed in scoring was then investigated. The performance of several typical ranking strategies for a consensus scoring procedure was also explored. Our results demonstrate that consensus scoring outperforms any single scoring for a simple statistical reason: the mean value of repeated samplings tends to be closer to the true value. Our results also suggest that a moderate number of scoring functions, three or four, are sufficient for the purpose of consensus scoring.

This general, knowledge-based approach exploits structural information of known protein-ligand complexes extracted from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank and converts it into distance-dependent Helmholtz free interaction energies of protein-ligand atom pairs (potentials of mean force, PMF). The definition of an appropriate reference state and the introduction of a correction term accounting for the volume taken by the ligand were found to be crucial for deriving the relevant interaction potentials that treat solvation and entropic contributions implicitly. A significant correlation between experimental binding affinities and computed score was found for sets of diverse protein-ligand complexes and for sets of different ligands bound to the same target. For 77 protein-ligand complexes taken from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, the calculated score showed a standard deviation from observed binding affinities of 1.8 log Ki units and an R2 value of 0.61. The best results were obtained for the subset of 16 serine protease complexes with a standard deviation of 1.0 log Ki unit and an R2 value of 0.86. A set of 33 inhibitors modeled into a crystal structure of HIV-1 protease yielded a standard deviation of 0.8 log Ki units from measured inhibition constants and an R2 value of 0.74. In contrast to empirical scoring functions that show similar or sometimes better correlation with observed binding affinities, our method does not involve deriving specific parameters that fit the observed binding affinities of protein-ligand complexes of a given training set. We compared the performance of the PMF score, Böhm's score (LUDI), and the SMOG score for eight different test sets of protein-ligand complexes. It was found that for the majority of test sets the PMF score performs best.

Previous studies showed that at least 1 in 1000 eligible blood donors at the Los Angeles County+University of Southern California (LAC+USC) Medical Center Blood Bank had specific antibodies to T. cruzi. In June 1993, serologic screening of prospective allogeneic donors at epidemiologic risk for T. cruzi infection was begun voluntarily. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The risk of T. cruzi infection in all eligible donors was assessed by questionnaire. At‐risk donors were screened serologically for antibodies to T. cruzi with an enzyme immunoassay, and confirmatory testing was done with a radioimmunoprecipitation assay. RESULTS: During the 29‐month study period 1311 (39.5%) of 3320 donors were judged to be at risk for T. cruzi infection. Seven donors (1/475) were reactive by an enzyme immunoassay, and six of these seven (1/ 553) were positive in a radioimmunoprecipitation assay. All radioimmunoprecipitation assay‐ positive donors had been born in countries in which Chagas' disease is endemic. One person in this group had received a transfusion in his homeland. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that a substantive proportion of eligible blood donors at our institution have antibodies specific for T. cruzi and that a commercially available assay can be used to detect these antibodies. Our data suggest that the risk of transmission of T. cruzi by transfusion could be eliminated by serologic testing limited to persons born in or transfused in countries in which Chagas' disease is endemic."", 'year': 1997, 'referenceCount': 22, 'citationCount': 51, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5502317', 'name': 'I.

To investigate the role of cruzipain we transfected T. cruzi epimastigotes with a recombinant cosmid containing approximately 20 tandemly repeated cruzipain genes. Transformed cells had multiple episomal copies of the vector and exhibited considerable overexpression of cruzipain activity. The upregulation was maintained throughout the parasite life-cycle, and electrophoretic detection techniques indicated that overexpression was correlated with correctly processed enzyme. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that cruzipain had the same developmentally regulated subcellular localisation in transformed and non-transformed cells. In the insect epimastigote form, the enzyme was restricted to vesicles of the endosomal/lysosomal system, whereas in the intracellular forms it was also readily detectable on the cell surface. Phenotypic analysis of the transformed parasites showed that they had an enhanced ability to undergo metacyclogenesis and suggested an association between overexpression of cruzipain and increased resistance to the cysteine proteinase inhibitor Cbz-Phe-Phe-CHN2 (where Cbz is benzoyloxycarbonyl). The increased resistance, however, was less than might be expected if cruzipain was the primary target of the inhibitor.

Three days later, he noticed irritation and inflammation of the periorbital region and difficulty in lifting the right upper eyelid. On the fifth day, he complained of fever up to 40 C without chills; this continued until his admission. The patient also complained of severe asthenia, diaphoresis, musculoskeletal pains, and the development of two diffuse erythematous tender plaques in the medial aspect of both thighs. Initial medical examination at the FHospital Universitario de Caracas revealed a fair general condition: temperature, 38.7 C; blood pressure, 115/80; heart rate, 118 beats/min; respiratory rate, 26/min. Marked edema involved the periorbital region with total closure of the eye. The involved skin was hard, erythematous, and moderately painful (Fig. 1). The right conjunctiva was reddened with a scant, yellowish, nonpurulent discharge. Visual acuity was: OD = 20/30, OS = 20/20. The rest of the eye examination was normal. Multiple enlarged lymph nodes were palpable in the right cervical area. They were small, mobile, and neither painful nor attached to underlying tissues. The jugular venous pulse was elevated 2 cm above the sternum. Heart sounds were slightly muffled and a third sound was easily heard. An ejection systolic murmur grade 2/6 over the aortic and left parasterna! area was present, and the apical impulse was not felt. The liver was slightly tender. There were no other areas of edema. The EKC disclosed a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 112 beats/min. Intraventricular conduction delays were not observed. Chest x-rays revealed a grade I-II cardiomegaly with no pulmonary hypertension.

Virtual platforms stand out as strategies for sharing information about COVID-19. Among them, due to its practicality of use, Instagram is being widely used by government institutions and health professionals. Considering the role of the Nutritionist as the professional capable of prescribing dietary planning, such an approach on social networks becomes worrying from the point of view of public health. The aim of this work was to analyze what is being published and who is publishing about nutrition and coronavirus on the social network Instagram. The following hashtags (#) were selected: #nutricaocoronavirus, #nutricaocoronavirus, #nutricaocovid, and #nutricaocovid19. Having recorded the total number of posts for each of them, in May 2020, the publications found were grouped in blocks according to the affinity of subjects. When analyzing all publications (n = 79), the results demonstrate that the most addressed topic was “healthy eating” and that 87.37% of the publications (n = 69) were posted by profiles of nutritionists. Only 12.6% (n = 10) of these publications properly used bibliographic references, being the Federal Council of Nutritionists (CFN) the most used reference. In conclusion, despite the predominance of publications by nutritionists in this filed, to achieve their goal, which is health promotion, these professionals should prioritize the sharing of

22,46,84ab8194a5006fe4c63e0f4dae1905fa88762fed,A Multi-Agent Based Virtual Personal Assistant for E-Health Service,"The application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the health sector is increasingly changing today’s health care. A communication agent for a multi-agent system-based virtual personal assistant is an attempt towards improving health care service delivery. We have developed a Multi Agent System and user interface for management of diabetes patients where the patients and medical specialist can interact easily without necessarily visiting the clinic. The application will enable the users to have regular interactions with each other, reduce the cost of going to the clinic, saves patients and medical personnel time. In order to design the application and user interface, we adopted a user centered approach and conducted interviews with the potential users. We also reviewed existing materials for data. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected during the development process. The application and user interface were evaluated by the potential users (patients and medical personnel). The user evaluation of the system shows that the participants were pleased with the application and the user interface. They interacted with the user interface with ease and they encountered little or no difficulty.

The high-level strategic plan, which is a form of meta-level control, is represented as a network organizational structure that specifies in a general way the information and control relationships among the nodes.

23,52,f9ad409b8a36dd6bd151e835497bdc1883d53c8e,Tele-rehabilitation program in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,"Background: In Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is recommended to improve quality of life (QoL) and exercise capacity (EC). Not all patients with IPF can participate in hospital based PR due to frailty and long travelling distances. Tele-rehabilitation (TR) might be an alternative solution. We investigated the feasibility and efficacy of TR on EC and QoL in patients with IPF. Method: Single-center, prospective, randomized study, including stable patients with IPF for 3 months (3M) of TR: video and chat-consultations with a real physiotherapist and workout sessions with a virtual autonomous physiotherapist agent (VAPA). Forced vital capacity (FVC), diffusion capacity (DLCO) was registered at baseline (BL). EC evaluated with 6-minute-walk-test distance (6MWTD) and QoL with Kings Brief Interstitial Lung Diseases (KBILD) and St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) before and after 3M of training. Control patients did not receive hospital-based PR. Results: 29 patients were included, 15 in the intervention group (IN) (male 86.7%, mean age 69.7±8.7 years, FVC % 76.7±16.4, DLCO % 46.5±11), and 14 in the control group (CO) (male 57.1%, mean age 72±7.6 years, FVC % 90.8±16.5, DLCO % 55±14 ). BL and 3M data can be seen in table. Conclusion: TR with VAPA is feasible for IPF.

Statistical analyses assessed the effects of regulatory focus and message frame on agent perception, motivation and cognitive load.,The results of this paper did not support the hypotheses that chronic promotion-focus learners will benefit more with gain-frame agent than a loss-frame agent, and that chronic prevention-focus learners will benefit more with loss-frame agent than a gain-frame agent. There were main effects of message frame (albeit small effects) – the loss-frame agent was perceived to be more engaging, induced higher motivation and prompted higher germane load than the gain-frame agent. With gain-frame agent, chronic promotion-focus learners had higher motivation toward the e-learning task than other learners.,Prior studies have examined regulatory focus and message frame with agents simulating virtual health advocates. This paper extended on this by examining these roles with a persuasive agent simulating virtual tutor in an e-learning environment.",2020,49,9,"{'name': '', 'pages': '37-51', 'volume':

learning in immersive virtual reality (VR). Sixty‐six middle school students (33 females) were randomly assigned to learn about laboratory safety with one of two pedagogical agents: Marie or a drone, who we predicted serve as a role models for females and males, respectively. The results indicated that there were significant interactions for the dependent variables of performance during learning, retention, and transfer, with girls performing better with Marie (d = 0.98, d = 0.67, and d = 1.03; for performance, retention, and transfer, respectively) and boys performing better with the drone (d = −0.41, d = −0.45, d = −0.23, respectively).

As a consequence, philosophers, psychologists, economists, and others have studied the factors that enhance task motivation. Using a sample of undergraduate students and a sample of working adults, we demonstrate that the manner in which an incentive is framed has implications for individuals' task motivation. In both samples we find that individuals are less motivated when an incentive is framed as a means to accrue a gain (positive framing) as compared with when the same incentive is framed as a means to avoid a loss (negative framing). Further, we provide evidence for the role of the negativity bias in this effect, and highlight specific populations for whom positive framing may be least motivating. Interestingly, we find that people's intuitions about when they will be more motivated show the opposite pattern, with people predicting that positively framed incentives will be more motivating than negatively framed incentives. We identify a lay belief in the positive correlation between enjoyment and task motivation as one possible factor contributing to the disparity between predicted and actual motivation as a result of the framing of the incentive.

People experience regulatory fit when the manner of their engagement in an activity sustains their goal orientation or interests regarding that activity.

Fit influences the strength of value experiences—how good or how bad one feels about something—independently of the pleasure and pain experiences that are associated with outcomes.

Instructional designers seem to base their design choices more on intuitive ideas than on sound research results. There are however some interesting theories that give guidelines for instructional designers. Mayer (1997) describes in his Generative Theory of Multimedia Learning how the learner builds mental representations of multimedia material. One important step in this process is the integration of both visual and verbal information. Multimedia instruction in its most elementary form consists of a picture with an explanatory text. Because picture and text cannot be perceived simultaneously, the learner is forced to switch back and forth between the two and integrate them mentally. According to Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988; Sweller, van Merriënboer & Paas, 1998) this integration process is cognitively demanding and at the expense of mental resources that could otherwise be allocated to the learning process. Sweller et al. call the unnecessary cognitive load caused by the presentation format of instructions extraneous load. A design guideline that follows from Cognitive Load Theory is to keep the extraneous load of instructions as low as possible, so that the available mental resources can be used for the actual learning process. In their empirical research, Sweller and his co-workers have demonstrated a number of ways in which the extraneous load of instructions can be influenced. In our study we compared two ways of lowering the extraneous load of multimedia instructions, preventing split-attention and presenting text as audio, in order to find out which one is more effective.', 'year': 2002, 'referenceCount': 17, 'citationCount': 29, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1918002', 'name': 'H.

To address this pressing issue, we developed the MyREADY TransitionTM BBD App, a patient-facing e-health intervention. The primary aim of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) was to determine whether the App will result in greater transition readiness compared with usual care for youth with BBD. Secondary aims included exploring the contextual experiences of youth using the App, as well as the interactive processes of youth, their parents/caregivers and healthcare providers around use of the intervention. Methods and analysis We aimed to randomise 264 youth with BBD between 15 and 17 years of age, to receive existing services/usual care (control group) or to receive usual care along with the App (intervention group). Our recruitment strategy includes remote and virtual options in response to the current requirements for physical distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We will use an embedded experimental model design which involves embedding a qualitative study within a RCT. The Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire will be administered as the primary outcome measure. Analysis of covariance will be used to compare change in the two groups on the primary outcome measure; analysis will be intention-to-treat. Interviews will be conducted with subsets of youth in the intervention group, as well as parents/caregivers and healthcare providers. Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by the research ethics board of each participating site in four different regions in Canada. We will leverage our patient and family partnerships to find novel dissemination strategies. Study findings will be shared with the academic and stakeholder community, including dissemination of teaching and training tools through patient associations, and patient and family advocacy groups.

On 12 March, the first measures were taken in the Netherlands, including reducing medical therapies to focus on life-saving treatments in the hospitals. Moreover, schools and day care centres were closed per 16 March. This meant that the majority of rehabilitation treatments taking place in schools, day care centres, hospitals and rehabilitation centres were postponed. However, the measures that were taken were not unambiguous. There was discussion about what therapies were—although not life-saving— essential to prevent later adverse events, and the effects of school closing on child health. The Dutch Academy of Childhood Disability performed an inquiry among therapists and paediatric rehabilitation physicians in the Netherlands to provide us with insight on the way the measures were interpreted and effectuated. Starting 8 April, we conducted a survey study in which open questions were asked about the way the governments' measures were interpreted and which therapies and care were considered essential and were thus continued. In total, 237 therapists and physicians working in rehabilitation units in hospitals, day care centres and rehabilitation centres responded. Results of the survey show that there was large variation in the therapies and care that were continued despite the governments' measures. Whereas some clinics cancelled all therapies, others continued specific treatments such as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and serial casting. We found that there was no unanimous interpretation of what urgent/essential care is. The most mentioned interpretation was ‘care that, if postponed, leads to irreversible damage or functional limitations’. Therapists, together with physicians, decided whether treatments fit this definition. In all clinics and hospitals, treatments were continued by telehealth, where possible. As described by Fazzi and Galli (2020), telehealth strategies were implemented quickly. The most important strategy was doing video consultations. Our respondents were generally quite satisfied with this relative new treatment modality. However, despite the possibility of telehealth, therapists reported serious worries because some specific subgroups of vulnerable children and families proved hard to keep in touch with. Moreover, they worried about children with progressive conditions. Additionally, there were signs that the strain was high for some families, because physical therapy had to be delivered by parents themselves while healthy siblings were also at home and required attention. Lastly, children who do not have a laptop or tablet computer cannot take advantage of telehealth innovations, making differences between groups of children larger. These points underline the need to understand the increased risks for vulnerable children and how to minimize them with evidence-based service delivery. The lockdown also brought creativity and new ideas at light. Implementing new technology suddenly was done faster than previously deemed possible, and many therapists found new ways to provide therapies, for instance, through instructional YouTube videos, the use of short videos made by parents about specific problems at home, and Pinterest pages with activities for children to be carried out. Also, social media were used to maintain communication between therapists and to share ideas about telehealth strategies. Good support for information and communications technology (ICT) therefore proved an essential prerequisite for these digital solutions. These creative ideas might further support parental empowerment and involvement in the (rehabilitation) treatment in the future. The lockdown and postponement of therapy provide us with insight in the need for therapy by children with disabilities. The next months, we have the ability to reflect critically on what effects the change in therapy has on children with disabilities and on the way we provide services in the new situation. The discussion on ‘best care’ could possibly get an extra impulse with these new findings in mind (Novak, 2020). Further research that has been started by the European Academy of Childhood Disability should provide insight in the way parents and families themselves experienced the lockdown in European countries. We believe that despite all negative aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we can and should learn from the innovations and transformations for the future."", 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 2, 'citationCount': 7, 'authors': [{'authorId': '15479262', 'name': 'M.

While in-person interviews were the mainstay of data generation in qualitative studies, video conferencing programs, such as Zoom Video Communications Inc. (Zoom), provide researchers with a cost-effective and convenient alternative to in-person interviews. The uses and advantages of face-to-face interviewing are well documented; however, utilizing video conferencing as a method of data generation has not been well examined. The purpose of this paper is to examine the specific attributes of Zoom that contribute to high quality and in-depth qualitative interviews when in person interviewing is not feasible. While video conferencing was developed to facilitate long-distance or international communication, enhance collaborations and reduce travel costs for business these same features can be extended to qualitative research interviews. Overall, participants reported that Zoom video conferencing was a positive experience.

Suitable transition readiness measures are necessary to facilitate effective planning. Currently, there is little consensus about well-validated transition readiness measures. The purpose of this systematic review was to identify best practices in transition readiness measurement for adolescents and young adults with chronic health conditions. Data sources Academic databases searched included PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Google Scholar and Athabasca University Library’s Discover. Study selection Articles were included that discussed the development and psychometric properties of transition readiness measures for adolescents and young adults (11–25 years) with chronic health conditions and/or that utilized a previously developed measure. Data extraction The primary and secondary reviewers extracted data from the selected articles as per the data extraction tool developed for this review. Results Forty-eight articles, representing 19 tools, were included in the review. Ten of the tools were disease-specific; nine were disease-neutral. According to the Cohen criteria, eight measures were “well-established assessments”. The Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire was deemed the best measure of transition readiness available. The literature search included only articles published in peer-reviewed journals; measures nearing completion or awaiting publication were not included. In addition, only English manuscripts were included, many from North America. Conclusions Despite national practice guidelines and ongoing policy development, there is slow movement towards achieving a gold standard or best-practice measure of transition readiness.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 76, 'citationCount': 17, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2104917626', 'name': 'Sarah Parfeniuk'}, {'authorId': '32399410', 'name': 'K.

In this study, we explore the feasibility and acceptability of using Zoom to collect qualitative interview data within a health research context in order to better understand its suitability for qualitative and mixed-methods researchers. We asked 16 practice nurses who participated in online qualitative interviews about their experiences of using Zoom and concurrently recorded researcher observations. Although several participants experienced technical difficulties, most described their interview experience as highly satisfactory and generally rated Zoom above alternative interviewing mediums such as face-to-face, telephone, and other videoconferencing services, platforms, and products.

The major categories of the RUQ–P include primary intervention, such as programs based on applied behavior analysis; childcare or school programs; other interventions, such as speech−language therapy or occupational therapy; other resources, such as medications, respite support, complementary and alternative medicine, and other services and treatments; productivity losses; and government subsidies and charitable gifts. The RUQ–P targeted preschool children ages 2–6 years with an NDD with completion by interview with the primary caregiver. It underwent pilot testing and was validated in a cohort of children in the Preschool Autism Treatment Impact study comparing early preschool behavioral interventions in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, Canada. The RUQ–P collected data on resource use; service intensity; and out-of-pocket costs, such as hourly rates, costs of materials, and travel costs. A cost analysis was undertaken to determine whether the RUQ–P was responsive to differences between treatment groups and changes over time.

If an individual has a chronic condition, this additional burden may hamper adequate development and independence. Transition programmes for young persons with chronic disorders aim to provide the necessary skills for self-management and participation in care. However, strong evidence on the effects of these interventions is lacking. Therefore, as part of the STEPSTONES project (Swedish Transition Effects Project Supporting Teenagers with chrONic mEdical conditionS), we propose a trial to assess the effectiveness of a structured, person-centred transition programme to empower adolescents with congenital heart disease in the transition to adulthood. Methods/design STEPSTONES will use a hybrid experimental design in which a randomised controlled trial is embedded in a longitudinal, observational study. It will be conducted in 4 paediatric cardiology centres in Sweden. 2 centres will be allocated to the randomised controlled trial group, assigning patients randomly to the intervention group (n=63) or the comparison group (n=63). The other 2 centres will form the intervention-naïve control group (n=63).

Thirty-two participated in a cognitive interview, and 337 completed a questionnaire booklet. Interviews were used to develop the TRANSITION-Q. Rasch measurement theory (RMT) analysis was used to identify items that represent the best indicators of self-management skills. Traditional psychometric tests of measurement performance were also conducted.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe response rate was 92% (32/32 cognitive; 337/371 field test). RMT analysis resulted in a 14-item scale with three response options. The overall fit of the observed data to that expected by the Rasch model was non-significant, providing support that this new scale measured a unidimensional construct. Other tests supported the scale as scientifically sound, e.g. Person Separation Index = 0.82; good item fit statistics; no differential item function by age or gender; low residual correlations between items; Cronbach's alpha = 0.85; test-retest reliability = 0.90; and tests of construct validity that showed, as hypothesized, fewer skills in younger participants and in participants who required assistance to complete the scale. Finally, participants who agreed they are ready to transfer to adult healthcare reported higher TRANSITION-Q scores than did participants who disagreed.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe TRANSITION-Q is a short, clinically meaningful and psychometrically sound scale.

Our objective was to summarize evidence from (1) studies characterizing potentially preventable hospitalizations in CMC and (2) interventions aiming to reduce such hospitalizations. METHODS: Our data sources include Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases from their originations, and hand search of article bibliographies. Observational studies (n = 13) characterized potentially preventable hospitalizations, and experimental studies (n = 4) evaluated the efficacy of interventions to reduce them. Data were extracted on patient and family characteristics, medical complexity and preventable hospitalization indicators, hospitalization rates, costs, and days. Results of interventions were summarized by their effect on changes in hospital use. RESULTS: Preventable hospitalizations were measured in 3 ways: ambulatory care sensitive conditions, readmissions, or investigator-defined criteria. Postsurgical patients, those with neurologic disorders, and those with medical devices had higher preventable hospitalization rates, as did those with public insurance and nonwhite race/ethnicity. Passive smoke exposure, nonadherence to medications, and lack of follow-up after discharge were additional risks. Hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions were less common in more complex patients. Patients receiving home visits, care coordination, chronic care-management, and continuity across settings had fewer preventable hospitalizations. Conclusions: There were a limited number of published studies. Measures for CMC and preventable hospitalizations were heterogeneous. Risk of bias was moderate due primarily to limited controlled experimental designs. Reductions in hospital use among CMC might be possible.

Numerous interventions attempt to improve this transition, yet few comprehensively evaluate efficacy. To advance evaluation methods and ultimately the quality of transition services, it is necessary to understand the current state of health care transition measurement. This study examines and categorizes transition measures by using the “Triple Aim” framework of experience of care, population health, and cost of care. METHODS: Ovid Medline and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature were searched for articles published between 1995 and 2013. Two reviewers independently screened studies and included those that evaluated the impact of a health care transition intervention. Measures were subsequently classified according to population health, experience of care, and costs of care. RESULTS: Of the 2282 studies initially identified, 33 met inclusion criteria. Population health measures were used in 27 studies, with disease-specific measures collected most frequently. Fifteen studies measured cost, most often service utilization. Eight studies measured experience of care, with satisfaction assessed most commonly. Only 3 studies examined all 3 domains of the “Triple Aim.” Transition interventions described in the gray literature were not reviewed.

Interventions to facilitate paediatric to adult healthcare transition are recommended, although outcomes are unknown. We sought to determine the impact of a transition intervention on improving knowledge and self-management skills among this population. Methods We conducted a clinical trial of 15–17\u2005year olds with moderate or complex congenital heart disease (CHD) or cardiomyopathy. Participants were systematically allocated to either usual care (controls) or a 1 h nurse-led one-on-one teaching session about their heart. Allocation was determined by week of attendance in the cardiology clinic. The primary outcome was change in Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ) score at 6\u2005months, possible scores ranging from 1 (low) to 5 (optimal). Cardiac knowledge (MyHeart score, range 0–100) was a secondary outcome. Analysis was intention to treat. Results Of 58 participants (48% female), 52 had CHD and 6 had cardiomyopathy. 27 were allocated to the intervention group; 3 declined the intervention and received usual care. When comparing the intervention group with the usual care group at 6\u2005months postintervention, the mean self-management TRAQ score was 3.59 (±0.83) vs 3.16 (±1.05), respectively (p=0.048, adjusted for baseline score); the mean self-advocacy TRAQ score was 4.38 (±0.56) vs 4.01 (±0.95) (p=0.18) and the mean MyHeart score was 75% (±15) vs 61% (±25) (p=0.019). Conclusions A 1 h nurse-led transition intervention resulted in a significant improvement in self-management and cardiac knowledge scores.

An increasing awareness of the need for transition services for youth with chronic health conditions has resulted from advances in medical technology and treatments that have increased the lifespan and quality of life of these youth. Developmentally appropriate care for adolescent patients with special health care needs should be integrated into paediatric and subspecialty practice structures. The transition is simpler for adolescents whose care is relatively uncomplicated, but even healthy teens may benefit from some transition preparation. Adolescents, their families and health care providers must work together to develop transition care that is effective in fostering healthpromoting behaviours and in enhancing the long-term quality of the young adult’s life (1,2). The Canadian Paediatric Society supports the provision of developmentally appropriate care for youth with special health care needs as they move into the adult-oriented health care system.

Our objective was to develop a quick and accurate screening test for limited literacy available in English and Spanish. METHODS We administered candidate items for the new instrument and also the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA) to English-speaking and Spanish-speaking primary care patients. We measured internal consistency with Cronbach’s α and assessed criterion validity by measuring correlations with TOFHLA scores. Using TOFLHA scores <75 to define limited literacy, we plotted receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curves and calculated likelihood ratios for cutoff scores on the new instrument. RESULTS The final instrument, the Newest Vital Sign (NVS), is a nutrition label that is accompanied by 6 questions and requires 3 minutes for administration. It is reliable (Cronbach α >0.76 in English and 0.69 in Spanish) and correlates with the TOFHLA. Area under the ROC curve is 0.88 for English and 0.72 for Spanish versions. Patients with more than 4 correct responses are unlikely to have low literacy, whereas fewer than 4 correct answers indicate the possibility of limited literacy.

The major differences among the approaches are coding schemes, origins of codes, and threats to trustworthiness. In conventional content analysis, coding categories are derived directly from the text data. With a directed approach, analysis starts with a theory or relevant research findings as guidance for initial codes.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: The occupational therapy departments of two university hospitals in Amsterdam. Subjects: One hundred and five consecutive outpatients. Outcome measures: The COPM is a measure of a client's self-perception of occupational performance in the areas of self-care, productivity and leisure. Outcome measures of the COPM are: the client's most important problems in occupational performance and a total score for performance and a total score for satisfaction for these problems. Problems reported in the COPM were compared with the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP68), the Disability and Impact Profile (DIP) and an open-ended question. Results: Complete data were obtained for 99 clients. The identification of occupational performance problems with the COPM surpassed the items reported in the SIP68, the DIP and the open-ended question, which confirms the surplus value of the COPM. Divergent validity was further demonstrated by the low correlation coefficients between the total SIP68 scores and the COPM. Seventy-four per cent of the occupational performance problems reported in the COPM had a corresponding item in the DIP and 49% had a corresponding item in the SIP68. Convergent validity was supported by the fact that 63% of the corresponding problems in the DIP were reported to be a disruption of quality of life and 74% of the corresponding problems in the SIP68 were identified as a disability.

The PedsQL is based on a modular approach to measuring HRQOL and consists of a 15-item core measure of global HRQOL and eight supplemental modules assessing specific symptom or treatment domains. The PedsQL was empirically derived from data collected from 291 pediatric cancer patients and their parents at various stages of treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth reliability and validity were determined. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the core measure (alpha = .83 for patient and alpha = .86 for parent) were acceptable for group comparisons. Alphas for the patient self-report modules generally ranged from .70 to .89. Discriminant or clinical validity, using the known-groups approach, was demonstrated for patients on- versus off-treatments. The 11 scales showed small-to-medium positive intercorrelations, supporting the multidimensional measurement model. Further construct validity was demonstrated via a multimethod-multitrait matrix using standardized psychosocial questionnaires.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe results support the PedsQL as a reliable and valid measure of HRQOL.

27,57,7043a7e10a2f0f6446713aa05fbae1ddb307d784,Complementary role of conversational agents in e-health services,"In recent years, business environments are undergoing disruptive changes across sectors [1]. Globalization and technological advances, such as artificial intelligence and the internet of things, have completely redesigned business activities, bringing to light an ever-increasing interest and attention towards the customer [2], especially in healthcare sector. In this context, researchers is paying more and more attention to the introduction of new technologies capable of meeting the patients’ needs [3, 4] and the Covid-19 pandemic has contributed and still contributes to accelerate this phenomenon [5]. Therefore, emerging technologies (i.e., AI-enabled solutions, service robots, conversational agents) are proving to be effective partners in improving medical care and quality of life [6]. Conversational agents, often identified in other ways as “chatbots”, are AI-enabled service robots based on the use of text [7] and capable of interpreting natural language and ensuring automation of responses by emulating human behavior [8, 9, 10]. Their introduction is linked to help institutions and doctors in the management of their patients [11, 12], at the same time maintaining the negligible incremental costs thanks to their virtual aspect [13–14]. However, while the utilization of these tools has significantly increased during the pandemic [15, 16, 17], it is unclear what benefits they bring to service delivery. In order to identify their contributions, there is a need to find out which activities can be supported by conversational agents.This paper takes a grounded approach [18] to achieve contextual understanding design and to effectively interpret the context and meanings related to conversational agents in healthcare interactions. The study context concerns six chatbots adopted in the healthcare sector through semi-structured interviews conducted in the health ecosystem. Secondary data relating to these tools under consideration are also used to complete the picture on them. Observation, interviewing and archival documents [19] could be used in qualitative research to make comparisons and obtain enriched results due to the opportunity to bridge the weaknesses of one source by compensating it with the strengths of others. Conversational agents automate customer interactions with smart meaningful interactions powered by Artificial Intelligence, making support, information provision and contextual understanding scalable. They help doctors to conduct the conversations that matter with their patients. In this context, conversational agents play a critical role in making relevant healthcare information accessible to the right stakeholders at the right time, defining an ever-present accessible solution for patients’ needs. In summary, conversational agents cannot replace the role of doctors but help them to manage patients. By conveying constant presence and fast information, they help doctors to build close relationships and trust with patients.",2022,47,0,"{'name': '2022 IEEE International Conference on Metrology for

Emerging technologies (i.e. robots and intelligent agents) look relevant. This paper aims to analyze the role of cognitive assistants as boundary objects in value co-creation practices. We include the perceptions of the main actors – patients, (in)formal caregivers, healthcare professionals – for a fuller network perspective to understand the potential overlap between boundary work and value co-creation practices.Design/methodology/approachWe adopted a grounded approach to gain a contextual understanding design to effectively interpret context and meanings related to human–robot interactions. The study context concerns 21 health solutions that had embedded the Watson cognitive platform and its adoption by the youngest cohort (50–64-year-olds) of the ageing population.FindingsThe cognitive assistant acts as a boundary object by bridging actors, resources and activities. It enacts the boundary work of actors (both ageing and professional, caregivers, families) consisting of four main actions (automated dialoguing, augmented sharing, connected learning and multilayered trusting) that elicit two ageing value co-creation practices: empowering ageing actors in medical care and engaging ageing actors in a healthy lifestyle.Originality/valueWe frame the role of cognitive assistants as boundary objects enabling the boundary work of ageing actors for value co-creation. A cognitive assistant is an “object of activity” that mediates in actors' boundary work by offering novel resource interfaces and widening resource access and resourceness. The boundary work of ageing actors lies in a smarter resource integration that yields broader applications for augmented agency."", 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 97, 'citationCount': 9, 'authors': [{'authorId': '35201006', 'name': 'C.

The purpose of this research is to examine what factors can influence customers’ evaluations of social distancing as well as how and when these evaluations drive their usage of chatbot services. Using structural equation modeling to analyze the experimental data from 200 U.S. consumers, we found that when the service situation is utilitarian (hedonic) in nature, customers’ contamination fear influences their chatbot usage during service encounters through their social distancing attitudes (subjective norms) and then perceived usefulness of chatbots.

However, the potential for service users (SUs) living with severe mental illness to use e–mental health resources together with their community mental health workers (MHWs) has received little attention. Objective This study aims to identify how jointly using an interactive website called Self-Management And Recovery Technology (SMART) in a community mental health context influenced therapeutic processes and interactions between SUs and MHWs from their perspective. Methods We conducted a qualitative study using a constructivist grounded theory methodology. Data were collected through individual semistructured interviews with 37 SUs and 15 MHWs who used the SMART website together for 2 to 6 months. Data analysis involved iterative phases of coding, constant comparison, memo writing, theoretical sampling, and consultation with stakeholders to support the study’s credibility. Results A substantive grounded theory, discovering ways to keep life on track, was developed, which portrays a shared discovery process arising from the SU-worker-SMART website interactions. The discovery process included choosing to use the website, revealing SUs’ experiences, exploring these experiences, and gaining new perspectives on how SUs did and could keep their lives on track. SUs and MHWs perceived that their three-way interactions were enjoyable, beneficial, and recovery focused when using the website together. They experienced the shared discovery process as relationship building—their interactions when using the website together were more engaging and equal. Conclusions Jointly using an e–mental health resource elicited recovery-oriented interactions and processes between SUs and MHWs that strengthened their therapeutic relationship in real-world community mental health services. Further work to develop and integrate this novel use of e–mental health in community mental health practice is warranted.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 49, 'citationCount': 10, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144450648', 'name': 'Anne Williams'}, {'authorId': '3631672', 'name': 'E.

Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has acted as a catalyst for the development of service robots in the healthcare sector in an attempt to overcome the difficulties and hardships caused by this virus. The use of service robots are advantageous as they not only prevent the spread of infection, and reduce human error but they also allow front-line staff to reduce direct contact, focusing their attention on higher priority tasks and creating separation from direct exposure to infection. This paper presents a review of various types of robotic technologies and their uses in the healthcare sector. The reviewed technologies are a collaboration between academia and the healthcare industry, demonstrating the research and testing needed in the creation of service robots before they can be deployed in real-world applications and use cases. We focus on how robots can provide benefits to patients, healthcare workers, customers, and organisations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we investigate the emerging focal issues of effective cleaning, logistics of patients and supplies, reduction of human errors, and remote monitoring of patients to increase system capacity, efficiency, resource equality in hospitals, and related healthcare environments.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 142, 'citationCount': 71, 'authors': [{'authorId': '46344132', 'name': 'Jane Holland'}, {'authorId': '7630958', 'name': 'L.

It encompasses the availability of open information on the health, treatment, complications, and recent progress on biomedical research. At present, even in low-income countries, diagnostic and medical services are becoming more accessible and available. However, many issues related to digital health technologies remain unmet, including the reliability, safety, testing, and ethical aspects. Purpose The aim of the review is to discuss and analyze the recent progress on the application of big data, artificial intelligence, telemedicine, block-chain platforms, smart devices in healthcare, and medical education. Basic Design. The publication search was carried out using Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Sciences, Medline, Wiley Online Library, and CrossRef databases. The review highlights the applications of artificial intelligence, “big data,” telemedicine and block-chain technologies, and smart devices (internet of things) for solving the real problems in healthcare and medical education. Major Findings. We identified 252 papers related to the digital health area. However, the number of papers discussed in the review was limited to 152 due to the exclusion criteria. The literature search demonstrated that digital health technologies became highly sought due to recent pandemics, including COVID-19. The disastrous dissemination of COVID-19 through all continents triggered the need for fast and effective solutions to localize, manage, and treat the viral infection. In this regard, the use of telemedicine and other e-health technologies might help to lessen the pressure on healthcare systems. Summary. Digital platforms can help optimize diagnosis, consulting, and treatment of patients. However, due to the lack of official regulations and recommendations, the stakeholders, including private and governmental organizations, are facing the problem with adequate validation and approbation of novel digital health technologies. In this regard, proper scientific research is required before a digital product is deployed for the healthcare sector.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 151, 'citationCount': 55, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2037981398', 'name': 'Maksut Senbekov'}, {'authorId': '5533370', 'name': 'T.

They are increasingly prevalent in health care applications such as those providing education and support to patients with chronic diseases, one of the leading causes of death in the 21st century. AI-based chatbots enable more effective and frequent interactions with such patients. Objective The goal of this systematic literature review is to review the characteristics, health care conditions, and AI architectures of AI-based conversational agents designed specifically for chronic diseases. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review using PubMed MEDLINE, EMBASE, PyscInfo, CINAHL, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. We applied a predefined search strategy using the terms “conversational agent,” “healthcare,” “artificial intelligence,” and their synonyms. We updated the search results using Google alerts, and screened reference lists for other relevant articles. We included primary research studies that involved the prevention, treatment, or rehabilitation of chronic diseases, involved a conversational agent, and included any kind of AI architecture. Two independent reviewers conducted screening and data extraction, and Cohen kappa was used to measure interrater agreement.A narrative approach was applied for data synthesis. Results The literature search found 2052 articles, out of which 10 papers met the inclusion criteria. The small number of identified studies together with the prevalence of quasi-experimental studies (n=7) and prevailing prototype nature of the chatbots (n=7) revealed the immaturity of the field. The reported chatbots addressed a broad variety of chronic diseases (n=6), showcasing a tendency to develop specialized conversational agents for individual chronic conditions. However, there lacks comparison of these chatbots within and between chronic diseases. In addition, the reported evaluation measures were not standardized, and the addressed health goals showed a large range. Together, these study characteristics complicated comparability and open room for future research. While natural language processing represented the most used AI technique (n=7) and the majority of conversational agents allowed for multimodal interaction (n=6), the identified studies demonstrated broad heterogeneity, lack of depth of reported AI techniques and systems, and inconsistent usage of taxonomy of the underlying AI software, further aggravating comparability and generalizability of study results. Conclusions The literature on AI-based conversational agents for chronic conditions is scarce and mostly consists of quasi-experimental studies with chatbots in prototype stage that use natural language processing and allow for multimodal user interaction. Future research could profit from evidence-based evaluation of the AI-based conversational agents and comparison thereof within and between different chronic health conditions. Besides increased comparability, the quality of chatbots developed for specific chronic conditions and their subsequent impact on the target patients could be enhanced by more structured development and standardized evaluation processes.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 81, 'citationCount': 74, 'authors': [{'authorId': '113824585', 'name': 'T.

They are increasingly used in a range of fields, including health care. By enabling better accessibility, personalization, and efficiency, conversational agents have the potential to improve patient care. Objective This study aimed to review the current applications, gaps, and challenges in the literature on conversational agents in health care and provide recommendations for their future research, design, and application. Methods We performed a scoping review. A broad literature search was performed in MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online; Ovid), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica database; Ovid), PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central with the search terms “conversational agents,” “conversational AI,” “chatbots,” and associated synonyms. We also searched the gray literature using sources such as the OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) WorldCat database and ResearchGate in April 2019. Reference lists of relevant articles were checked for further articles. Screening and data extraction were performed in parallel by 2 reviewers. The included evidence was analyzed narratively by employing the principles of thematic analysis. Results The literature search yielded 47 study reports (45 articles and 2 ongoing clinical trials) that matched the inclusion criteria. The identified conversational agents were largely delivered via smartphone apps (n=23) and used free text only as the main input (n=19) and output (n=30) modality. Case studies describing chatbot development (n=18) were the most prevalent, and only 11 randomized controlled trials were identified. The 3 most commonly reported conversational agent applications in the literature were treatment and monitoring, health care service support, and patient education. Conclusions The literature on conversational agents in health care is largely descriptive and aimed at treatment and monitoring and health service support.

Their presence offers many potential benefits, but customers are reluctant to engage with them. A possible explanation is that conversational agents do not make optimal use of communicative behaviors that enhance relational outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to identify which human-like communicative behaviors used by conversational agents have positive effects on relational outcomes and which additional behaviors could be investigated in future research.Design/methodology/approachThis paper presents a systematic review of 61 articles that investigated the effects of communicative behaviors used by conversational agents on relational outcomes. A taxonomy is created of all behaviors investigated in these studies, and a research agenda is constructed on the basis of an analysis of their effects and a comparison with the literature on human-to-human service encounters.FindingsThe communicative behaviors can be classified along two dimensions: modality (verbal, nonverbal, appearance) and footing (similarity, responsiveness). Regarding the research agenda, it is noteworthy that some categories of behaviors show mixed results and some behaviors that are effective in human-to-human interactions have not yet been investigated in conversational agents.Practical implicationsBy identifying potentially effective communicative behaviors in conversational agents, this study assists managers in optimizing encounters between conversational agents and customers.Originality/valueThis is the first study that develops a taxonomy of communicative behaviors in conversational agents and uses it to identify avenues for future research.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 144, 'citationCount': 71, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2156397875', 'name': 'Michelle M.E. van Pinxteren'}, {'authorId': '3283860', 'name': 'M.

The emergence of robots has attracted increasing interest from business scholars and practitioners alike. In this article, we undertake a systematic review of the business literature about the impact of service robots on customers and employees with the objective of guiding future research.Design/methodology/approachWe analyzed the literature on service robots as they relate to customers and employees in business journals listed in the Financial Times top 50 journals plus all journals covered in the cross-disciplinary SERVSIG literature alerts.FindingsThe analysis of the identified studies yielded multiple observations about the impact of service robots on customers (e.g. overarching frameworks on acceptance and usage of service robots; characteristics of service robots and anthropomorphism; and potential for enhanced and deteriorated service experiences) and service employees (e.g. employee benefits such as reduced routine work, enhanced productivity and job satisfaction; potential negative consequences such as loss of autonomy and a range of negative psychological outcomes; opportunities for human–robot collaboration; job insecurity; and robot-related up-skilling and development requirements).

Mental health contributes to 28% of the total burden of disease, compared to 16% each for cancer and heart disease in the UK. Stress, anxiety or depression accounted for 15.8 million days of sickness absence across the UK in 2016. By 2020, the gap between the demand for mental health care and the resources the National Health Service (NHS) can provide is likely to widen, therefore providers are increasingly needing to find more cost-effective ways to deliver mental health care. Digital Interventions have been created to help with these issues, for example anxiety, stress and depression. Chatbots can be incorporated into digital interventions, or used as standalone interventions. Chatbots can be a more interactive experience for the user to receive information, or complete diagnostic tools, or to even be used for counselling. A demo chatbot was created using interactive emoji’s and GIFs to improve the user experience when searching for online self-help tips.

Design A qualitative study using grounded theory. Participants New Zealand family carers (21 women, 5 men) who managed technical health procedures such as enteral feeding, peritoneal dialysis, tracheostomy care, a central venous line or urinary catheter. In addition, 15 health professionals involved in teaching carers were interviewed. Methods Semistructured interviews were coded soon after completion and preliminary analysis influenced subsequent interviews. Additional data were compared with existing material and as analysis proceeded, initial codes were grouped into higher order concepts until a core concept was described. Interviewing continued until no new ideas emerged and concepts were well defined. Results The response of carers to the role of managing technical health procedures in the home is presented in terms of five dispositions: (1) Embracing care, (2) Resisting, (3) Reluctant acceptance, (4) Relinquishing and (5) Being overwhelmed. These dispositions were not static and carers commonly changed between them. Embracing care included cognitive understanding of the purpose and benefits of a procedure; accepting a ‘technical’ solution; practical management; and an emotional response. Accepting embrace is primarily motivated by perceived benefits for the recipient. It may also be driven by a lack of alternatives. Resisting or reluctant acceptance results from a lack of understanding about the procedure or willingness to manage it. Carers need adequate support to avoid becoming overwhelmed, and there are times when it is appropriate to encourage them to relinquish care for the sake of their own needs. Conclusions The concept of embracing care encourages health professionals to extend their attention beyond simply the practical aspects of technical procedures to assessing and addressing carers’ emotional and behavioural responses to health technology during the training process.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 63, 'citationCount': 21, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144936592', 'name': 'Janet McDonald'}, {'authorId': '3687617', 'name': 'E.

Design/methodology/approach – A conceptual analysis of two approaches to understanding service perspectives, service logic (SL) and service-dominant logic (SDL), reveals direct and indirect marketing implications. Findings – The SDL is based on a metaphorical view of co-creation and value co-creation, in which the firm, customers and other actors participate in the process that leads to value for customers. The approach is firm-driven; the service provider drives value creation. The managerial implications are not service perspective-based, and co-creation may be imprisoned by its metaphor. In contrast, SL takes an analytical approach, with co-creation concepts that can significantly reinvent marketing from a service perspective. Value gets created in customer processes, and value creation is customer driven. Ten managerial SL principles derived from these analyses offer theoretical and practi...', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 54, 'citationCount': 403, 'authors': [{'authorId': '96025954', 'name': 'C.

Since theory-based mobile health (mHealth) interventions have been shown to increase patient engagement, mobile phones may be an optimal strategy to reach this population. With increased development of theory-based mHealth technology, these interventions must now be evaluated with these medically underserved populations in a real-world setting. Objective: The aim of our study was to investigate care coordinators’ perceived value of using a health behavior theory-based mHealth platform with Medicaid clients. In particular, attention was paid to the perceived impact on patient engagement. This research was conducted using the patient-provider text messaging (short message service, SMS) platform, Sense Health (now Wellpass), which integrates the transtheoretical model (TTM), also called the stages of change model; social cognitive theory (SCT); supportive accountability; and motivational interviewing (MI). Methods: Interviews based in grounded theory methodology were conducted with 10 care managers to understand perceptions of the relationship between mHealth and patient engagement. Results: The interviews with care managers yielded a foundation for a grounded theory model, presenting themes that suggested 4 intertwined correlative relationships revolving around patient engagement: (1) A text messaging (short message service, SMS) platform supplements the client-care manager dynamic, which is grounded in high quality, reciprocal-communication to increase patient engagement; (2) Texting enhances the relationship between literacy and access to care for Medicaid patients, increasing low-literacy patients’agency to access services; (3) Texting enhances communication, providing care managers with a new means to support their clients; and (4) Reminders augment client accountability, leading to both increased motivation and readiness to change behaviors, as well as an improved client-care manager relationship. Conclusions: Messaging platform features tied to health behavior theory appear to be effective in improving patient engagement. Two-way communication (supportive accountability), trusted relationships (supportive accountability, SCT), personalized messages (TTM), and patient input (TTM, SCT, MI) appeared as the most relevant components in achieving desired outcomes. Additionally, reminder messages were noted as especially useful in making Medicaid patients accountable and in turn engaging them in their health and health care. These findings convey suggested elements for inclusion in other mHealth interventions aiming to improve patient engagement in Medicaid populations.

However, nonadherence to home exercises is still a serious problem as it leads to increased costs due to prolonged treatments. Objective To improve adherence to home exercises, we propose, implement, and assess the novel coaching concept of hybrid ubiquitous coaching (HUC). In HUC, health care experts are complemented by a conversational agent (CA) that delivers psychoeducation and personalized motivational messages via a smartphone, as well as real-time exercise support, monitoring, and feedback in a hands-free augmented reality environment. Methods We applied HUC to the field of physiotherapy and conducted 4 design-and-evaluate loops with an interdisciplinary team to assess how HUC is perceived by patients and physiotherapists and whether HUC leads to treatment adherence. A first version of HUC was evaluated by 35 physiotherapy patients in a lab setting to identify patients’ perceptions of HUC. In addition, 11 physiotherapists were interviewed about HUC and assessed whether the CA could help them build up a working alliance with their patients. A second version was then tested by 15 patients in a within-subject experiment to identify the ability of HUC to address adherence and to build a working alliance between the patient and the CA. Finally, a 4-week n-of-1 trial was conducted with 1 patient to show one experience with HUC in depth and thereby potentially reveal real-world benefits and challenges. Results Patients perceived HUC to be useful, easy to use, and enjoyable, preferred it to state-of-the-art approaches, and expressed their intentions to use it. Moreover, patients built a working alliance with the CA. Physiotherapists saw a relative advantage of HUC compared to current approaches but initially did not see the potential in terms of a working alliance, which changed after seeing the results of HUC in the field. Qualitative feedback from patients indicated that they enjoyed doing the exercise with an augmented reality–based CA and understood better how to do the exercise correctly with HUC. Moreover, physiotherapists highlighted that HUC would be helpful to use in the therapy process. The longitudinal field study resulted in an adherence rate of 92% (11/12 sessions; 330/360 repetitions; 33/36 sets) and a substantial increase in exercise accuracy during the 4 weeks. Conclusions The overall positive assessments from both patients and health care experts suggest that HUC is a promising tool to be applied in various disorders with a relevant set of home exercises. Future research, however, must implement a variety of exercises and test HUC with patients suffering from different disorders.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 113, 'citationCount': 13, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1793743', 'name': 'T.

Further, simulation plays a very important role in the healthcare field, especially in research on medical pathway planning, medical resource allocation, medical activity prediction, etc. By combining digital twin and healthcare, there will be a new and efficient way to provide more accurate and fast services for elderly healthcare. However, how to achieve personal health management throughout the entire lifecycle of elderly patients, and how to converge the medical physical world and the virtual world to realize real smart healthcare, are still two key challenges in the era of precision medicine. In this paper, a framework of the cloud healthcare system is proposed based on digital twin healthcare (CloudDTH). This is a novel, generalized, and extensible framework in the cloud environment for monitoring, diagnosing and predicting aspects of the health of individuals using, for example, wearable medical devices, toward the goal of personal health management, especially for the elderly. CloudDTH aims to achieve interaction and convergence between medical physical and virtual spaces. Accordingly, a novel concept of digital twin healthcare (DTH) is proposed and discussed, and a DTH model is implemented. Next, a reference framework of CloudDTH based on DTH is constructed, and its key enabling technologies are explored. Finally, the feasibility of some application scenarios and a case study for real-time supervision are demonstrated.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 48, 'citationCount': 262, 'authors': [{'authorId': '49420283', 'name': 'Y.

Currently, more than 52% of the Dutch people have a chronic disease of which at least 33% have multiple diseases. Unfortunately, the number of people with a chronic disease is expected just to increase leading to a higher pressure on the quality of healthcare and rising healthcare costs. Personalised coaching to support patients’ self-efficacy on self-management could be a key solution to address these problems. In the last decade, innovative technologies have been developed that focus on self-management of patients. However, this support cannot be fully tailored to the patient as these apps usually do not take into account patients’ behaviour. Therefore, the development of e-supporter has been started in September 2018. E-supporter is an element of the Centre for Care Technology Research (CCTR) e-manager project that aims to improve the quality of life and perceived quality of care in patients with chronic conditions. The concept of e-supporter has been based on literature research, expert meetings and pilot studies. E-supporter will integrate various e-coaching apps that help patients with COPD, asthma and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) to self-manage their disease. These apps have been developed by Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC+), TNO, University of Twente and commercial parties. E-supporter will promote pursuing a personalised treatment plan in daily life by using an intelligent interface that uses information from the ABCC tool, the various integrated e-coaching apps and daily health behaviour, thoughts and moods of the patient. The ABCC tool assesses the disease state, disease burden, and personalized goals that the patient has set together with the healthcare professional during consultation. Tailored coaching content will be developed based on the I-Change model and prediction models that inform the patient of expected consequences and benefits of their behaviour. In addition, e-supporter also helps healthcare professionals to be better informed about patients to enhance personalised care. This all will lead to healthcare that is more efficient, cost-effective, sustainable and of high quality.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 1, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1403500548', 'name': ""W. d'Hollosy""}, {'authorId': '51898535', 'name': 'Laura K Schrijver'}, {'authorId': '1399783888', 'name': 'M.

PURPOSE
To provide a summary of the implementation of a virtual academic detailing pilot program at the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).


SUMMARY
In September 2018, VA Pharmacy Benefits Management implemented a virtual academic detailing (""e-Detailing"") pilot program across three regional networks. Academic detailing involves multifaceted collaborative outreach delivered by trained healthcare clinicians to other clinicians using targeted educational interventions that improve clinical decision-making. Across VA, academic detailing programs are primarily staffed by specially trained clinical pharmacist specialists. Implementation began with an in-person meeting to train academic detailers on using the virtual academic detailing platform (VA Video Connect) and virtual soft skills, which was followed by regular facilitation meetings to address issues and share experiences. During e-Detailing program implementation, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged, prompting the US Department of Health and Human Services to declare a public health emergency. VA followed with restrictions on nonessential travel for all employees, thus hampering in-person academic detailing activities. Fortunately, e-Detailing provided an alternative channel for academic detailers across VA to continue delivering critical outreach to providers during the pandemic. Qualitative assessment of academic detailers' and providers' perceptions on e-Detailing highlighted the need for local leadership support for e-Detailing and telehealth, the efficiency of virtual compared to in-person visits, and potential time savings resulting from avoidance of long commutes.


CONCLUSION
The timing of e-Detailing implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates the need and potential for a virtual platform to deliver timely provider outreach.",2022,0,1,{'name': 'American

30,60,978b9decb7924a0e8feb1937068ddec127ddccef,Leveraging community partnerships: Conversion of a sexual health curriculum as a virtual teaching tool for middle schoolers,"Abstract The disruption of in-person delivery of a sexual health education curriculum to students in 19 urban middle schools in the Midwestern United States was one of many complications in education due the COVID-19 pandemic. Given time constraints and need for program delivery, community partners collaborated to convert the curriculum for virtual delivery.

While quality standards are in place for the format and organization of online courses, professors often are left wondering what activities contribute to learning engagement for their online students. The research question driving this study was, what activities contribute to learning engagement for online students? To investigate this question, an online survey was conducted in one state university of all students taking an online course during the spring semester. With responses from 417 students and using three standardized scale variables for learning engagement, as well as two open-ended questions, course components related to strong learning engagement were identified and examined. Initial findings indicated a statistically significant moderate correlation of learning engagement with the use of higher-order learning and reflective and integrative learning techniques. Specifically, students who reported being highly engaged connected ideas from other courses, changed their understanding of a topic or concept, found connections between their learning and societal problems, and had fun. A regression model using these variables, along with control variables of student age, gender, and out-of-school work, resulted in an R2 of 0.484, suggesting that almost half of the variance in learning engagement can be explained via this model. Further analysis of the qualitative data identified certain aspects of online discussions and assignments as engaging, such as discussions and interactive assignments that are not merely “fun” from a student perspective but also integrate previous learning and connect to current social issues. This includes prompting students with thought-provoking questions that relate to “real-world” situations and inviting students to share diverse opinions as well as develop personal perspectives.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 49, 'citationCount': 78, 'authors': [{'authorId': '47154190', 'name': 'J.

Infographics are one way of presenting complex and dense informational content in a way that supports cognitive processing, learning, and future recognition and recollection. But the power of infographics is that they are a way of delivering the maximum amount of content in the least amount of space while still being precise and clear; because they are visual presentations as opposed to oral or text presentations, they can quickly tell a story, show relationships, and reveal structure. The following paper reports on an exploration of top 20 ‘liked’ infographics on a popular infographic sharing website to better understand what makes an effective infographic in order to better prepare graduate students as consumers and designers of infographics.

To improve educational productivity, 1 In the United States, online learning alternatives are proliferating rapidly. Recent estimates suggest that 1.5 million elementary and secondary students participated in some form of online learning in 2010 (Wicks 2010). The term online learning can be used to refer to a wide range of programs that use the Internet to provide instructional materials and facilitate interactions between teachers and students and in some cases among students as well. Online learning can be fully online, with all instruction taking place through the Internet, or online elements can be combined with face-to-face interactions in what is known as blended learning (Horn and Staker 2010). many school districts and states are turning to online learning. The purpose of this report is to support educational administrators and policymakers in becoming informed consumers of information about online learning and its potential impact on educational productivity. The report provides foundational knowledge needed to examine and understand the potential contributions of online learning to educational productivity, including a conceptual framework for understanding the necessary components of rigorous productivity analyses, drawing in particular on cost-effectiveness analysis as an accessible method in education. Five requirements for rigorous cost-effectiveness studies are described: 1) Important design components of an intervention are specified; 2) Both costs and outcomes are measured; 1 As defined in this report, productivity is a ratio between costs and outcomes that can be improved in one of three ways: by reducing costs while maintaining outcomes, improving outcomes while maintaining costs or transforming processes in a way that both reduces costs and improves outcomes. Any improvements in productivity are likely to require initial investments, but successful efforts reduce costs over the long term, even after these initial investments are taken into account. vi 3) At least two conditions are compared; 4) Costs and outcomes are related using a single ratio for each model under study; 5) Other factors not related to the conditions being studied are controlled or held constant. The report also includes a review of ways that online learning might offer productivity benefits compared with traditional place-based schooling. Unfortunately, a review of the available research that examined the impact of online learning on educational productivity for secondary school students was found to be lacking. …', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 116, 'citationCount': 183, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3454428', 'name': 'M.

31,61,3694de7adabdd2fb83d593c745410bf9e1afe017,Virtual conversational agents versus online forms: Patient experience and preferences for health data collection,"Objective Virtual conversational agents, or chatbots, have emerged as a novel approach to health data collection. However, research on patient perceptions of chatbots in comparison to traditional online forms is sparse. This study aimed to compare and assess the experience of completing a health assessment using a chatbot vs. an online form. Methods A counterbalanced, within-subject experimental design was used with participants recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk). Participants completed a standardized health assessment using a chatbot (i.e., Dokbot) and an online form (i.e., REDCap), each followed by usability and experience questionnaires. To address poor data quality and preserve integrity of mTurk responses, we employed a thorough data cleaning process informed by previous literature. Quantitative (descriptive and inferential statistics) and qualitative (thematic analysis and complex coding query) approaches were used for analysis. Results A total of 391 participants were recruited, 185 of whom were excluded, resulting in a final sample size of 206 individuals. Most participants (69.9%) preferred the chatbot over the online form. Average Net Promoter Score was higher for the chatbot (NPS = 24) than the online form (NPS = 13) at a statistically significant level. System Usability Scale scores were also higher for the chatbot (i.e. 69.7 vs. 67.7), but this difference was not statistically significant. The chatbot took longer to complete but was perceived as conversational, interactive, and intuitive. The online form received favorable comments for its familiar survey-like interface. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate that a chatbot provided superior engagement, intuitiveness, and interactivity despite increased completion time compared to online forms. Knowledge of patient preferences and barriers will inform future design and development of recommendations and best practice for chatbots for healthcare data collection.",2022,41,1,"{'name':

However, the SUS was not specifically designed to evaluate mobile apps, or in particular digital health apps (DHAs). Objective The aim of this study was to examine whether the widely used SUS distribution for benchmarking (mean 68, SD 12.5) can be used to reliably assess the usability of DHAs. Methods A search of the literature was performed using the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, CORE, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases to identify SUS scores related to the usability of DHAs for meta-analysis. This study included papers that published the SUS scores of the evaluated DHAs from 2011 to 2021 to get a 10-year representation. In total, 117 SUS scores for 114 DHAs were identified. R Studio and the R programming language were used to model the DHA SUS distribution, with a 1-sample, 2-tailed t test used to compare this distribution with the standard SUS distribution. Results The mean SUS score when all the collected apps were included was 76.64 (SD 15.12); however, this distribution exhibited asymmetrical skewness (–0.52) and was not normally distributed according to Shapiro-Wilk test (P=.002). The mean SUS score for “physical activity” apps was 83.28 (SD 12.39) and drove the skewness. Hence, the mean SUS score for all collected apps excluding “physical activity” apps was 68.05 (SD 14.05). A 1-sample, 2-tailed t test indicated that this health app SUS distribution was not statistically significantly different from the standard SUS distribution (P=.98). Conclusions This study concludes that the SUS and the widely accepted benchmark of a mean SUS score of 68 (SD 12.5) are suitable for evaluating the usability of DHAs. We speculate as to why physical activity apps received higher SUS scores than expected. A template for reporting mean SUS scores to facilitate meta-analysis is proposed, together with future work that could be done to further examine the SUS benchmark scores for DHAs.', 'year': 2022, 'referenceCount': 40, 'citationCount': 25, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2003389747', 'name': 'Maciej Hyzy'}, {'authorId': '2113885887', 'name': 'Raymond R.

They are increasingly used in a range of fields, including health care. By enabling better accessibility, personalization, and efficiency, conversational agents have the potential to improve patient care. Objective This study aimed to review the current applications, gaps, and challenges in the literature on conversational agents in health care and provide recommendations for their future research, design, and application. Methods We performed a scoping review. A broad literature search was performed in MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online; Ovid), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica database; Ovid), PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central with the search terms “conversational agents,” “conversational AI,” “chatbots,” and associated synonyms. We also searched the gray literature using sources such as the OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) WorldCat database and ResearchGate in April 2019. Reference lists of relevant articles were checked for further articles. Screening and data extraction were performed in parallel by 2 reviewers. The included evidence was analyzed narratively by employing the principles of thematic analysis. Results The literature search yielded 47 study reports (45 articles and 2 ongoing clinical trials) that matched the inclusion criteria. The identified conversational agents were largely delivered via smartphone apps (n=23) and used free text only as the main input (n=19) and output (n=30) modality. Case studies describing chatbot development (n=18) were the most prevalent, and only 11 randomized controlled trials were identified. The 3 most commonly reported conversational agent applications in the literature were treatment and monitoring, health care service support, and patient education. Conclusions The literature on conversational agents in health care is largely descriptive and aimed at treatment and monitoring and health service support. It mostly reports on text-based, artificial intelligence–driven, and smartphone app–delivered conversational agents.

This study evaluated the efficacy of collecting such family health histories through a virtual conversational agent (VCA) interface, a new method for collecting this information. Standard and VCA interfaces for FHx collection were investigated with 50 participants, recruited via email and word of mouth, using a within‐subject experimental design with the order of the interfaces randomized and counterbalanced. Interface workload, usability, preference, and satisfaction were assessed using the NASA Task Load Index workload instrument, the IBM Computer System Usability Questionnaire, and a brief questionnaire derived from the Technology Acceptance Model. The researchers also recorded the number of errors and the total task completion time. It was found that the completion times for 2 of the 5 tasks were shorter for the VCA interface than for the standard one, but the overall completion time was longer (17 min 44 s vs. 16 min 51 s, p = .019). We also found the overall workload to be significantly lower (34.32 vs. 42.64, p = .003) for the VCA interface, and usability metrics including overall satisfaction (5.62 vs. 4.72, p < .001), system usefulness (5.76 vs. 4.84, p = .001), information quality (5.43 vs. 4.62, p < .001), and interface quality (5.66 vs. 4.64, p < .001) to be significantly higher for this interface as well. Approximately 3 out of 4 participants preferred the VCA interface to the standard one. Although the overall time taken was slightly longer than with standard interface, the VCA interface was rated significantly better across all other measures and was preferred by the participants.

In-depth interviews were conducted with 56 Spanish-speaking participants; a subset of 30 also participated in a qualitative component to evaluate the acceptability and usability of Spanish VICKY. Overall, agreement in family history assessment was moderate between VICKY and a genetic counselor (weighted kappa range: 0.4695 for stroke—0.6615 for heart disease), although this varied across disease subtypes. Participants felt comfortable using VICKY and noted that VICKY was very likeable and possessed human-like characteristics. They reported that VICKY was very easy to navigate, felt that the instructions were very clear, and thought that the time it took to use the tool was just right. Spanish VICKY may be useful as a tool to collect family health history and was viewed as acceptable and usable.

The ability to rapidly collect large amounts of high-quality human subjects data has advanced multiple fields, including personality and social psychology.

We present empirical evidence of a substantial decrease in data quality using a four-wave naturalistic experimental design: pre-, during, and post-summer 2018. During and to some extent post-summer 2018, we find significant increases in participants failing response validity indicators, decreases in reliability and validity of a widely used personality measure, and failures to replicate well-established findings.

However, little is known about the perspectives of practicing medical physicians on the use of chatbots in health care, even though these individuals are the traditional benchmark of proper patient care. Objective This study aimed to investigate the perceptions of physicians regarding the use of health care chatbots, including their benefits, challenges, and risks to patients. Methods A total of 100 practicing physicians across the United States completed a Web-based, self-report survey to examine their opinions of chatbot technology in health care. Descriptive statistics and frequencies were used to examine the characteristics of participants. Results A wide variety of positive and negative perspectives were reported on the use of health care chatbots, including the importance to patients for managing their own health and the benefits on physical, psychological, and behavioral health outcomes. More consistent agreement occurred with regard to administrative benefits associated with chatbots; many physicians believed that chatbots would be most beneficial for scheduling doctor appointments (78%, 78/100), locating health clinics (76%, 76/100), or providing medication information (71%, 71/100). Conversely, many physicians believed that chatbots cannot effectively care for all of the patients’ needs (76%, 76/100), cannot display human emotion (72%, 72/100), and cannot provide detailed diagnosis and treatment because of not knowing all of the personal factors associated with the patient (71%, 71/100). Many physicians also stated that health care chatbots could be a risk to patients if they self-diagnose too often (714%, 74/100) and do not accurately understand the diagnoses (74%, 74/100). Conclusions Physicians believed in both costs and benefits associated with chatbots, depending on the logistics and specific roles of the technology. Chatbots may have a beneficial role to play in health care to support, motivate, and coach patients as well as for streamlining organizational tasks; in essence, chatbots could become a surrogate for nonmedical caregivers. However, concerns remain on the inability of chatbots to comprehend the emotional state of humans as well as in areas where expert medical knowledge and intelligence is required.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 34, 'citationCount': 162, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5458608', 'name': 'A.

As use of MTurk has grown, so have questions from behavioral researchers about its participants, reliability, and low compensation. In this article, we review recent research about MTurk and compare MTurk participants with community and student samples on a set of personality dimensions and classic decision-making biases. Across two studies, we find many similarities between MTurk participants and traditional samples, but we also find important differences. For instance, MTurk participants are less likely to pay attention to experimental materials, reducing statistical power. They are more likely to use the Internet to find answers, even with no incentive for correct responses. MTurk participants have attitudes about money that are different from a community sample’s attitudes but similar to students’ attitudes. Finally, MTurk participants are less extraverted and have lower self-esteem than other participants, presenting challenges for some research domains. Despite these differences, MTurk participants produce reliable results consistent with standard decision-making biases: they are present biased, risk-averse for gains, risk-seeking for losses, show delay/expedite asymmetries, and show the certainty effect—with almost no significant differences in effect sizes from other samples. We conclude that MTurk offers a highly valuable opportunity for data collection and recommend that researchers using MTurk (1) include screening questions that gauge attention and language comprehension; (2) avoid questions with factual answers; and (3) consider how individual differences in financial and social domains may influence results.

Definitions of these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and streamlined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of .98 for usefulness and .94 for ease of use.

32,62,baca04a9af95b0fee7f7a574a790f8baa5da25cc,Older adults' experience with virtual conversational agents for health data collection,"Introduction Virtual conversational agents (i.e., chatbots) are an intuitive form of data collection. Understanding older adults' experiences with chatbots could help identify their usability needs. This quality improvement study evaluated older adults' experiences with a chatbot for health data collection. A secondary goal was to understand how perceptions differed based on length of chatbot forms. Methods After a demographic survey, participants (≥60 years) completed either a short (21 questions), moderate (30 questions), or long (66 questions) chatbot form. Perceived ease-of-use, usefulness, usability, likelihood to recommend, and cognitive load were measured post-test. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were used. Results A total of 260 participants reported on usability and satisfaction metrics including perceived ease-of-use (5.8/7), usefulness (4.7/7), usability (5.4/7), and likelihood to recommend (Net Promoter Score = 0). Cognitive load (12.3/100) was low. There was a statistically significant difference in perceived usefulness between groups, with a significantly higher mean perceived usefulness for Group 1 than Group 3. No other group differences were observed. The chatbot was perceived as quick, easy, and pleasant with concerns about technical issues, privacy, and security. Participants provided suggestions to enhance progress tracking, edit responses, improve readability, and have options to ask questions. Discussion Older adults found the chatbot to be easy, useful, and usable. The chatbot required low cognitive load demonstrating it could be an enjoyable health data collection tool for older adults. These results will inform the development of a health data collection chatbot technology.",2023,41,0,"{'name': 'Frontiers in Digital Health', 'volume': '5'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector':

However, research on patient perceptions of chatbots in comparison to traditional online forms is sparse. This study aimed to compare and assess the experience of completing a health assessment using a chatbot vs. an online form. Methods A counterbalanced, within-subject experimental design was used with participants recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk). Participants completed a standardized health assessment using a chatbot (i.e., Dokbot) and an online form (i.e., REDCap), each followed by usability and experience questionnaires. To address poor data quality and preserve integrity of mTurk responses, we employed a thorough data cleaning process informed by previous literature. Quantitative (descriptive and inferential statistics) and qualitative (thematic analysis and complex coding query) approaches were used for analysis. Results A total of 391 participants were recruited, 185 of whom were excluded, resulting in a final sample size of 206 individuals. Most participants (69.9%) preferred the chatbot over the online form. Average Net Promoter Score was higher for the chatbot (NPS\u2009=\u200924) than the online form (NPS\u2009=\u200913) at a statistically significant level. System Usability Scale scores were also higher for the chatbot (i.e. 69.7 vs. 67.7), but this difference was not statistically significant. The chatbot took longer to complete but was perceived as conversational, interactive, and intuitive. The online form received favorable comments for its familiar survey-like interface. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate that a chatbot provided superior engagement, intuitiveness, and interactivity despite increased completion time compared to online forms.

Objective: The current study aims to: Assess the feasibility of administering the PHQ-9 in a sample of adults and older adults via chatbot, report the psychometric properties of and identify the relationship between demographic variables and PHQ-9 total scores. Methods: A sample of 3,902 adults and older adults in the US and Canada were recruited through Facebook from August 2019 to February 2020 to complete the PHQ-9 using a chatbot. Results: A total of 3,895 (99.82%) completed the PHQ-9 successfully. The internal consistency of the PHQ-9 was 0.896 (p < 0.05).

Such an assertion has the potential to change how research funds are allocated in potentially harmful ways. Therefore, we sought to interrogate the claims made by Peer et al. We found surprising methodological decisions, which were undisclosed in their paper, that severely limit the inferences that can be drawn from their data.

This study uses data from the 2020 CALSPEAKS survey to identify disparities in eHealth literacy among older adults aged 65+ residing in California, USA (N = 237). eHealth literacy is self-assessed using the previously validated 8-item eHEALS questionnaire. Ordinary least squares regression analyses are performed on individual eHEALS items and on a summed eHealth literacy score, with demographic and technology use-related characteristics as predictors. Results show that the strongest and most consistent predictors of eHealth literacy include education, frequency of Internet use, and breadth of Internet activities regularly performed.

They are increasingly used in a range of fields, including health care. By enabling better accessibility, personalization, and efficiency, conversational agents have the potential to improve patient care. Objective This study aimed to review the current applications, gaps, and challenges in the literature on conversational agents in health care and provide recommendations for their future research, design, and application. Methods We performed a scoping review. A broad literature search was performed in MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online; Ovid), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica database; Ovid), PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central with the search terms “conversational agents,” “conversational AI,” “chatbots,” and associated synonyms. We also searched the gray literature using sources such as the OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) WorldCat database and ResearchGate in April 2019. Reference lists of relevant articles were checked for further articles. Screening and data extraction were performed in parallel by 2 reviewers. The included evidence was analyzed narratively by employing the principles of thematic analysis. Results The literature search yielded 47 study reports (45 articles and 2 ongoing clinical trials) that matched the inclusion criteria. The identified conversational agents were largely delivered via smartphone apps (n=23) and used free text only as the main input (n=19) and output (n=30) modality. Case studies describing chatbot development (n=18) were the most prevalent, and only 11 randomized controlled trials were identified. The 3 most commonly reported conversational agent applications in the literature were treatment and monitoring, health care service support, and patient education. Conclusions The literature on conversational agents in health care is largely descriptive and aimed at treatment and monitoring and health service support. It mostly reports on text-based, artificial intelligence–driven, and smartphone app–delivered conversational agents.

Rather than relaying the PHQ-9 verbatim, the doctor deviates from the wording so that the response options are selectively offered to upgrade the severity of the patient’s symptoms. This works in favor of a positive diagnosis and is used to justify a treatment recommendation that the patient previously resisted. This contrasted with the rest of the data set, where diagnosis was either not delivered (as patients are presenting with ongoing problems) or delivered without using the PHQ-9.

This study evaluated the efficacy of collecting such family health histories through a virtual conversational agent (VCA) interface, a new method for collecting this information. Standard and VCA interfaces for FHx collection were investigated with 50 participants, recruited via email and word of mouth, using a within‐subject experimental design with the order of the interfaces randomized and counterbalanced. Interface workload, usability, preference, and satisfaction were assessed using the NASA Task Load Index workload instrument, the IBM Computer System Usability Questionnaire, and a brief questionnaire derived from the Technology Acceptance Model. The researchers also recorded the number of errors and the total task completion time. It was found that the completion times for 2 of the 5 tasks were shorter for the VCA interface than for the standard one, but the overall completion time was longer (17 min 44 s vs. 16 min 51 s, p = .019). We also found the overall workload to be significantly lower (34.32 vs. 42.64, p = .003) for the VCA interface, and usability metrics including overall satisfaction (5.62 vs. 4.72, p < .001), system usefulness (5.76 vs. 4.84, p = .001), information quality (5.43 vs. 4.62, p < .001), and interface quality (5.66 vs. 4.64, p < .001) to be significantly higher for this interface as well. Approximately 3 out of 4 participants preferred the VCA interface to the standard one. Although the overall time taken was slightly longer than with standard interface, the VCA interface was rated significantly better across all other measures and was preferred by the participants.

Alongside unprecedented opportunities to harness these technologies, there are equally unprecedented challenges. Notably, older adults may experience the first-level digital divide, that is, lack of access to technologies, and/or the second-level digital divide, that is, lack of use/skill, alongside issues with data input and analysis.

For example, if a physician knows that a patient has a history of familial hypercholesterolemia, the physician can encourage the patient to make lifestyle changes or, if appropriate, take medication to reduce his or her risk for heart disease. Information from the family history also plays an important role in the interpretation of genetic test results. For example, if a healthy 35-year-old woman with no documented family history of breast cancer receives a BRCA1 test result showing a variant of unknown significance, the clinician might recommend "" watchful waiting "" ; however, if the same woman has a known family history that includes a mother with bilateral breast cancer at age 42 years and a maternal aunt with ovarian cancer at 53 years, the clinician can now recommend a substantially different course of action, from active surveillance to consideration of preemptive bilateral mastectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy. Despite the increasing complexity of genomics and genetic testing, the family health history continues to be a simple and powerful way to assess an individual patient\'s risk for disease. Despite its importance in health care and person-alized medicine, the family health history remains un-derutilized in clinical practice constrained by time, accuracy , and physician bias. Physicians, other clinicians, and even trainees often lack time to collect, interpret, and discuss the family history during a busy clinical visit. As a result, family history information is often incompletely collected during a clinical encounter, is gathered from only a minority of patients, and lacks the necessary detail for accurate risk assessment. 1 Even if sufficient time could be created to record a detailed family history, a patient\'s self-reported family history is often suboptimal. The accuracy and consistency of self-reported family history range widely from 30% to 90%, depending on the degree of family relat-edness and the reported disease. 1 Health history of first-degree relatives (eg, parents, siblings, and children) tends to be more accurately reported than that of more distant relatives (eg, aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents).

To maximize the benefits of these e-health technologies, it is important to assess the e-health literacy of individuals. The eHealth Literacy Scale has been used widely in the past several years, but mainly in younger populations. The purpose of this study was to test the psychometric aspects of the eHealth Literacy Scale for older adults using a secondary data analysis (N = 866; mean age, 62.8 ± 8.5 years). Reliability of the eHealth Literacy Scale was examined by calculating &agr; coefficients and conducting test-retest procedures. Its validity was assessed using exploratory factor analysis and the hypothesis testing procedure. Findings demonstrated that eHealth Literacy Scale was internally consistent (&agr; = .94) and stable (t244 = −1.48, P = .140). The exploratory factor analysis yielded a single factor structure explaining 67.3% of the variance. The hypothesis testing also supported the validity of eHealth Literacy Scale. In recent years, there have been great efforts to use e-health interventions to engage patients in healthcare and to help them manage their own health. Our study suggests that the eHealth Literacy Scale, a short screening tool for e-health literacy, can be successfully used for older adults.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 43, 'citationCount': 126, 'authors': [{'authorId': '122371520', 'name': 'SeonYoon Chung'}]}, {'paperId': '4a9f6ab88907fffa1dc505aaa9a1eef0c84d1167', 'title': 'eHealth Literacy and Web 2.0 Health Information Seeking Behaviors Among Baby Boomers and Older Adults', 'abstract': 'Background Baby boomers and older adults, a subset of the population at high risk for chronic disease, social isolation, and poor health outcomes, are increasingly utilizing the Internet and social media (Web 2.0) to locate and evaluate health information. However, among these older populations, little is known about what factors influence their eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information. Objective The intent of the study was to explore the extent to which sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use influences eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information among baby boomers and older adults. Methods A random sample of baby boomers and older adults (n=283, mean 67.46 years, SD 9.98) participated in a cross-sectional, telephone survey that included the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) and items from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) assessing electronic device use and use of Web 2.0 for health information. An independent samples t test compared eHealth literacy among users and non-users of Web 2.0 for health information. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use on self-reported eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for seeking and sharing health information. Results Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information. Respondents reporting use of Web 2.0 reported greater eHealth literacy (mean 30.38, SD 5.45, n=101) than those who did not use Web 2.0 (mean 28.31, SD 5.79, n=182), t 217.60=−2.98, P=.003. Younger age (b=−0.10), more education (b=0.48), and use of more electronic devices (b=1.26) were significantly associated with greater eHealth literacy (R 2 =.17, R 2adj =.14, F9,229=5.277, P<.001). Women were nearly three times more likely than men to use Web 2.0 for health information (OR 2.63, Wald= 8.09, df=1, P=.004). Finally, more education predicted greater use of Web 2.0 for health information, with college graduates (OR 2.57, Wald= 3.86, df =1, P=.049) and post graduates (OR 7.105, Wald= 4.278, df=1, P=.04) nearly 2 to 7 times more likely than non-high school graduates to use Web 2.0 for health information. Conclusions Being younger and possessing more education was associated with greater eHealth literacy among baby boomers and older adults. Females and those highly educated, particularly at the post graduate level, reported greater use of Web 2.0 for health information. More in-depth surveys and interviews among more diverse groups of baby boomers and older adult populations will likely yield a better understanding regarding how current Web-based health information seeking and sharing behaviors influence health-related decision making.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 80, 'citationCount': 506, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5327078', 'name': 'Bethany Tennant'}, {'authorId': '4299403', 'name': 'M.

As use of MTurk has grown, so have questions from behavioral researchers about its participants, reliability, and low compensation. In this article, we review recent research about MTurk and compare MTurk participants with community and student samples on a set of personality dimensions and classic decision-making biases. Across two studies, we find many similarities between MTurk participants and traditional samples, but we also find important differences. For instance, MTurk participants are less likely to pay attention to experimental materials, reducing statistical power. They are more likely to use the Internet to find answers, even with no incentive for correct responses. MTurk participants have attitudes about money that are different from a community sample’s attitudes but similar to students’ attitudes. Finally, MTurk participants are less extraverted and have lower self-esteem than other participants, presenting challenges for some research domains. Despite these differences, MTurk participants produce reliable results consistent with standard decision-making biases: they are present biased, risk-averse for gains, risk-seeking for losses, show delay/expedite asymmetries, and show the certainty effect—with almost no significant differences in effect sizes from other samples. We conclude that MTurk offers a highly valuable opportunity for data collection and recommend that researchers using MTurk (1) include screening questions that gauge attention and language comprehension; (2) avoid questions with factual answers; and (3) consider how individual differences in financial and social domains may influence results.

Over 40% of US and Canadian adults have low basic literacy levels, suggesting that eHealth resources are likely to be inaccessible to large segments of the population. Using information technology for health requires eHealth literacy—the ability to read, use computers, search for information, understand health information, and put it into context. The eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) was designed (1) to assess consumers’ perceived skills at using information technology for health and (2) to aid in determining the fit between eHealth programs and consumers. Objectives The eHEALS is an 8-item measure of eHealth literacy developed to measure consumers’ combined knowledge, comfort, and perceived skills at finding, evaluating, and applying electronic health information to health problems. The objective of the study was to psychometrically evaluate the properties of the eHEALS within a population context. A youth population was chosen as the focus for the initial development primarily because they have high levels of eHealth use and familiarity with information technology tools. Methods Data were collected at baseline, post-intervention, and 3- and 6-month follow-up using control group data as part of a single session, randomized intervention trial evaluating Web-based eHealth programs. Scale reliability was tested using item analysis for internal consistency (coefficient alpha) and test-retest reliability estimates. Principal components factor analysis was used to determine the theoretical fit of the measures with the data. Results A total of 664 participants (370 boys; 294 girls) aged 13 to 21 (mean = 14.95; SD = 1.24) completed the eHEALS at four time points over 6 months. Item analysis was performed on the 8-item scale at baseline, producing a tight fitting scale with α = .88. Item-scale correlations ranged from r = .51 to .76. Test-retest reliability showed modest stability over time from baseline to 6-month follow-up (r = .68 to .40). Principal components analysis produced a single factor solution (56% of variance). Factor loadings ranged from .60 to .84 among the 8 items. Conclusions The eHEALS reliably and consistently captures the eHealth literacy concept in repeated administrations, showing promise as tool for assessing consumer comfort and skill in using information technology for health. Within a clinical environment, the eHEALS has the potential to serve as a means of identifying those who may or may not benefit from referrals to an eHealth intervention or resource.

Definitions of these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and streamlined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of .98 for usefulness and .94 for ease of use.

33,65,3b39040ac65caa867a0e5f3a41121dfbdcefb9ae,Health Educator Participation in Virtual Micro-Credentialing Increases Physical Activity in Public Health Competencies,"Background: Physical activity is an important component of leading a healthy life. Public health is one of the nine major sectors for disseminating information about physical activity and increasing the physical activity of the general public. Purpose: Increase competency among Cooperative Extension agents (i.e., public health workers) on selecting, delivering, and evaluating physical activity programs through a theory-based online training program. Methods: Cooperative Extension agents from two states were invited to participate via statewide listservs. Participants were invited to attend sessions, complete competency checks, and between-session assignments each week. The study was conducted using a video conferencing platform. The intervention was 9 weeks from June to July 2020 and had 130 participants. Pre- and post-program surveys included physical activity competencies and validated scales for flourishing and physical activity status. Data for competencies pre and post were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.01. Physical activity and flourishing pre and post were compared using t-tests, p < 0.05. Results: Physical activity in public health competency increased significantly (p < 0.00) as did agents' personal physical activity levels (p < 0.05). Changes in flourishing were not significant (p < 0.09) but trended in the hypothesized direction.

One in 3 adults in America suffers from obesity, and related chronic health conditions such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes are on the rise. The rise of chronic disease prevention needs may be mitigated through changes in health behaviors, which have led to the need for evidence-based health promotion interventions. To scale these interventions (ie, deliver from one population to the next), a number of public and private organizations have to take action. One such public organization, the Cooperative Extension System (herein: “Extension”), employs county-based health educators who identify community needs, works with university-based personnel to address these needs, and evaluates the public impact of the interventions delivered. Extension reaches more than 6 million Americans per year in direct programming, has $375 million in grant funds, and has the ability to adapt and collaborate to meet the changing needs of Americans by integrating research, best practices, and policy mandates. Extension serves the diverse needs of the American population, including agriculture, youth development (4-H), finance, and chronic disease prevention.

Little is known about how these intermediaries communicate and learn about existing evidence-based programming. This study serves to explore this gap by learning about information sources and channels used within Extension. Design: Sequential explanatory mixed methods approach. Setting: National Cooperative Extension System. Participants: Extension community-based health educators. Methods: A nationally distributed survey with follow-up semistructured interviews. Survey results were analyzed using a Kruskal-Wallis 1-way analysis of variance test paired with Bonferroni post hoc. Transcripts were analyzed by conventional content analysis. Results: One hundred twenty-one Extension educators from 33 states responded to the survey, and 18 of 20 invited participants completed the interviews. Educators’ information seeking existed in 2 forms: (1) information sources for learning about programming and (2) channels by which this information is communicated. Extension educators reported contacting health specialists and other educators. Extension educators also reported using technological means of communication such as e-mail and Internet to reach information sources such as peers, specialists, academic journals, and so on. Conclusion: Extension state specialists were preferred as primary sources for intervention information, and technology was acknowledged as an easy contact channel.

The purpose of this paper was to determine if an evidence-based intervention (EBI) developed in one state Extension system could be scaled-out to a new state system. Methods and results: The RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) framework was used to guide an iterative evaluation of three translational stages. Stage 1: Before program adoption, Extension health educators were surveyed and interviewed to assess physical activity programming perceptions and factors that may influence their decision to attend training or deliver the program in practice. Results indicated that a virtual, scalable training protocol would be necessary and that training needed to include hands-on instruction and be catered to those who were less confident in physical activity program delivery. Stage 2: Training attendees were surveyed pre- and post-training on factors related to the adoption-decision making process and contacted post-training to assess program delivery status. Training did not influence perceptions of the program, intent to deliver, or confidence in delivering the program. Stage 3: During program implementation, the program was evaluated through the RE-AIM framework by surveying across three key stakeholder groups: (1) program participants, (2) potential delivery personnel, and (3) Extension administrators. Findings indicate that the program has the potential to reach a large and representative proportion of the target audience, especially in rural areas. However, adoption and implementation rates among Extension health educators and community partners were low and data collection for effectiveness, implementation, and maintenance was a challenge. Conclusion: Overall, the results indicate initial struggles to translating and evaluating the program in a large, rural state. Implications for practice include making system-level changes to increase physical activity program adoption rates among Extension health educators and improve data collection and program evaluation through this community-based organization.

Physical activity fosters normal growth and development and can make people feel, function, and sleep better and reduce risk of many chronic diseases. Objective To summarize key guidelines in the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition (PAG). Process and Evidence Synthesis The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee conducted a systematic review of the science supporting physical activity and health. The committee addressed 38 questions and 104 subquestions and graded the evidence based on consistency and quality of the research. Evidence graded as strong or moderate was the basis of the key guidelines. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) based the PAG on the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report. Recommendations The PAG provides information and guidance on the types and amounts of physical activity to improve a variety of health outcomes for multiple population groups. Preschool-aged children (3 through 5 years) should be physically active throughout the day to enhance growth and development. Children and adolescents aged 6 through 17 years should do 60 minutes or more of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily. Adults should do at least 150 minutes to 300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes to 150 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. They should also do muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week. Older adults should do multicomponent physical activity that includes balance training as well as aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Pregnant and postpartum women should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week. Adults with chronic conditions or disabilities, who are able, should follow the key guidelines for adults and do both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Recommendations emphasize that moving more and sitting less will benefit nearly everyone. Individuals performing the least physical activity benefit most by even modest increases in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Additional benefits occur with more physical activity. Both aerobic and muscle-strengthening physical activity are beneficial. Conclusions and Relevance The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition, provides information and guidance on the types and amounts of physical activity that provide substantial health benefits. Health professionals and policy makers should facilitate awareness of the guidelines and promote the health benefits of physical activity and support efforts to implement programs, practices, and policies to facilitate increased physical activity and to improve the health of the US population.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 22, 'citationCount': 4339, 'authors': [{'authorId': '11691783', 'name': 'Katrina L.

The article's purpose is to synthesize the systematic review literature about CME effectiveness published since 2003. Methods: We identified 8 systematic reviews of CME effectiveness published since 2003 in which primary research studies in CME were reviewed and physicians’ performance and/or patient health outcomes were included as outcome measures. Results: Five systematic reviews addressed the question of “Is CME Effective?” using primary studies employing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or experimental design methods and concluded: (1) CME does improve physician performance and patient health outcomes, and (2) CME has a more reliably positive impact on physician performance than on patient health outcomes. The 8 systematic reviews support previous research showing CME activities that are more interactive, use more methods, involve multiple exposures, are longer, and are focused on outcomes that are considered important by physicians lead to more positive outcomes. Discussion: Future research on CME effectiveness must take account of the wider social, political, and organizational factors that play a role in physician performance and patient health outcomes. We now have 39 systematic reviews that present an evidence‐based approach to designing CME that is more likely to improve physician performance and patient health outcomes.

Evaluation instruments assessed changes related to confidence, intention to use learned skills, usefulness of sessions, and satisfaction with the training.\n\n\nRESULTS\nResults demonstrated that a core competency-based training can successfully affect CHWs' perceived confidence and intentions to apply learned content, and can provide a larger social justice context of their role and work.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis program demonstrates that a core competency-based framework coupled with CAI-research-specific skill sessions (1) provides skills that CAI-CHWs intend to use, (2) builds confidence, and (3) provides participants with a more contextualized view of client needs and CHW roles."", 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 17, 'citationCount': 43, 'authors': [{'authorId': '83050213', 'name': 'Yumary Ruiz'}, {'authorId': '49181813', 'name': 'Sergio Matos'}, {'authorId': '7018707', 'name': 'Smiti Kapadia'}, {'authorId': '31427096', 'name': 'N.

These training and development activities allow organizations to adapt, compete, excel, innovate, produce, be safe, improve service, and reach goals. Training has successfully been used to reduce errors in such high-risk settings as emergency rooms, aviation, and the military. However, training is also important in more conventional organizations. These organizations understand that training helps them to remain competitive by continually educating their workforce. They understand that investing in their employees yields greater results. However, training is not as intuitive as it may seem. There is a science of training that shows that there is a right way and a wrong way to design, deliver, and implement a training program. The research on training clearly shows two things: (a) training works, and (b) the way training is designed, delivered, and implemented matters. This article aims to explain why training is important and how to use training appropriately. Using the training literature as a guide, we explain what training is, why it is important, and provide recommendations for implementing a training program in an organization. In particular, we argue that training is a systematic process, and we explain what matters before, during, and after training. Steps to take at each of these three time periods are listed and described and are summarized in a checklist for ease of use. We conclude with a discussion of implications for both leaders and policymakers and an exploration of issues that may come up when deciding to implement a training program. Furthermore, we include key questions that executives and policymakers should ask about the design, delivery, or implementation of a training program. Finally, we consider future research that is important in this area, including some still unanswered questions and room for development in this evolving field.

The Committee on Exercise and Cardiac Rehabilitation of the American Heart Association endorsed and supported these recommendations. The purpose of the present report is to update and clarify the 1995 recommendations on the types and amounts of physical activity needed by healthy adults to improve and maintain health. Development of this document was by an expert panel of scientists, including physicians, epidemiologists, exercise scientists, and public health specialists. This panel reviewed advances in pertinent physiologic, epidemiologic, and clinical scientific data, including primary research articles and reviews published since the original recommendation was issued in 1995. Issues considered by the panel included new scientific evidence relating physical activity to health, physical activity recommendations by various organizations in the interim, and communications issues. Key points related to updating the physical activity recommendation were outlined and writing groups were formed. A draft manuscript was prepared and circulated for review to the expert panel as well as to outside experts. Comments were integrated into the final recommendation.\n\n\nPRIMARY RECOMMENDATION\nTo promote and maintain health, all healthy adults aged 18 to 65 yr need moderate-intensity aerobic (endurance) physical activity for a minimum of 30 min on five days each week or vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity for a minimum of 20 min on three days each week. [I (A)] Combinations of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity can be performed to meet this recommendation. [IIa (B)] For example, a person can meet the recommendation by walking briskly for 30 min twice during the week and then jogging for 20 min on two other days. Moderate-intensity aerobic activity, which is generally equivalent to a brisk walk and noticeably accelerates the heart rate, can be accumulated toward the 30-min minimum by performing bouts each lasting 10 or more minutes. [I (B)] Vigorous-intensity activity is exemplified by jogging, and causes rapid breathing and a substantial increase in heart rate. In addition, every adult should perform activities that maintain or increase muscular strength and endurance a minimum of two days each week. [IIa (A)] Because of the dose-response relation between physical activity and health, persons who wish to further improve their personal fitness, reduce their risk for chronic diseases and disabilities or prevent unhealthy weight gain may benefit by exceeding the minimum recommended amounts of physical activity.

Fourteen of 64 studies identified met these criteria and were included in the analyses.

Diffusion is the communication of an innovation through certain channels over time among members of a social system. It is a communication whose messages are concerned with new ideas; it is a process where participants create and share information to achieve a mutual understanding. Initial chapters of the book discuss the history of diffusion research, some major criticisms of diffusion research, and the meta-research procedures used in the book. This text is the third edition of this well-respected work. The first edition was published in 1962, and the fifth edition in 2003. The book's theoretical framework relies on the concepts of information and uncertainty. Uncertainty is the degree to which alternatives are perceived with respect to an event and the relative probabilities of these alternatives; uncertainty implies a lack of predictability and motivates an individual to seek information. A technological innovation embodies information, thus reducing uncertainty. Information affects uncertainty in a situation where a choice exists among alternatives; information about a technological innovation can be software information or innovation-evaluation information. An innovation is an idea, practice, or object that is perceived as new by an individual or an other unit of adoption; innovation presents an individual or organization with a new alternative(s) or new means of solving problems. Whether new alternatives are superior is not precisely known by problem solvers. Thus people seek new information. Information about new ideas is exchanged through a process of convergence involving interpersonal networks. Thus, diffusion of innovations is a social process that communicates perceived information about a new idea; it produces an alteration in the structure and function of a social system, producing social consequences. Diffusion has four elements: (1) an innovation that is perceived as new, (2) communication channels, (3) time, and (4) a social system (members jointly solving to accomplish a common goal). Diffusion systems can be centralized or decentralized. The innovation-development process has five steps passing from recognition of a need, through RD (2) persuasion to form an attitude, (3) decision, (4) implementation, and (5) confirmation (reinforcement or rejection). Innovations can also be re-invented (changed or modified) by the user. The innovation-decision period is the time required to pass through the innovation-decision process. Rates of adoption of an innovation depend on (and can be predicted by) how its characteristics are perceived in terms of relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability. The diffusion effect is the increasing, cumulative pressure from interpersonal networks to adopt (or reject) an innovation. Overadoption is an innovation's adoption when experts suggest its rejection. Diffusion networks convey innovation-evaluation information to decrease uncertainty about an idea's use. The heart of the diffusion process is the modeling and imitation by potential adopters of their network partners who have adopted already. Change agents influence innovation decisions in a direction deemed desirable.

NN provide regular telephone follow-ups to manage patients' symptoms and assess toxicities, adherence to treatment and supportive care needs. Patients can have access to a mobile application to record tracking data, contact NN via secure messaging, view therapy and side effect information or store documents. Methods: A questionnaire was addressed to patients after using for 5 months the CAPRI intervention in order to assess their experience with the device. In parallel, interviews were conducted with patients. To determine patient utilization of the mobile application, data were extracted over a 24-month period. Results: 148 patients completed the evaluation (response rate = 81%). 15 interviews were conducted. Patients' experience with CAPRI intervention is very positive: The open-ended comments on the questionnaires and interviews with patients highlighted the importance of listening, having a contact person who is easily reachable, available and empathetic. 83% of patients preferred contacting NN by phone rather than through the mobile application. Only 50% (n = 74) of patients reported having tried to connect to the mobile application and 38% reported monitoring data at least once. Conclusions: Patients' experience is highly positive about the intervention. However, the application is poorly used, patients seems to prefer human contact. In perspective, results from the randomized trial currently conducted will evaluate the impact of the intervention on clinical criteria.[Table: see text]",2019,0,0,{'name': 'Journal of Clinical

35,67,d43e6953286ced39f4555085312eea08c5e92f70,Rapid Transition to Virtual Assessment and Treatment in an Interdisciplinary Randomized Clinical Trial for Youth With Chronic Pain,"Objectives: COVID-19 abruptly halted in-person clinical care and research requiring a shift to virtual assessment and treatment. This unexpected transition of a 2-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining interdisciplinary graded exposure treatment (GET Living) compared with multidisciplinary pain management for youth with chronic pain provided an opportunity to implement the first remotely delivered exposure treatment and remotely delivered biomechanical assessment for pediatric chronic pain. Here we describe these new approaches and provide lessons learned to inform future efforts in digital health care. Methods: A total of 68 youth (M=14.2 y; 80.9% female) were enrolled in the RCT (n=31 in-person, n=5 hybrid, n=32 virtual, n=9 withdrew). Of those withdrawn, n=3 withdrew due to COVID-19 related reasons. Some RCT elements required slight modification (eg, e-consent, actigraphy deployment, recruitment, and screening), while others were significantly altered (eg, session format and lab-based biomechanical assessment). Data from exit interviews were also examined to assess perspectives on the virtual format transition. Results: Results showed an increased enrollment rate when virtual care was an option (70.7%) compared with in-person (44.3%). Equivalent rates of completion for daily assessment (in-person, 72.8%; virtual, 73.3) were also observed, and participants described enhanced experience when able to complete exercises and exposures in their home environment during session (vs. a rehabilitation gym) allowing for genuine in vivo exposures (eg, household chores, riding bicycles). Discussion: Overall, our data demonstrate acceptability, feasibility, and equivalent patient engagement to virtual treatment. Novel methods implemented in this RCT can inform trial design and measures of clinical endpoints for future digital health interventions.",2022,38,5,"{'name': 'The Clinical Journal of Pain', 'pages':

This article reports on the factor structure and psychometric properties of this measure. Methods The COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Scales (CEFIS) were developed by a multidisciplinary, multi-institutional team using a rapid iterative process. Data from 1805 caregivers recruited from 28 programs at 15 institutions across the United States were collected from May—September 2020. We examined the underlying structure of the CEFIS using exploratory factor analyses and its internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha). Results Participants reported a range of COVID-19-related events (M = 8.71 events of 25). On the bidirectional 4-point impact scale, mean scores were mostly above the midpoint, indicating a slightly negative impact. Cronbach’s alpha was excellent for Exposure (α\u2009=\u2009.80) and Impact (α\u2009=\u2009.92). Factor analysis identified six factors for Exposure (COVID-19 experiences, Access to essentials, Disruptions to living conditions, Loss of income, Family caregiving and activities, and Designation as an essential worker). There were three factors for Impact (Personal well-being, Family interactions, and Distress). Discussion The CEFIS has strong factors assessing Exposure to events related to COVID-19, and the Impact of these events on families of children in pediatric healthcare. These initial validation data support use of the CEFIS for measuring the effect of the pandemic.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 11, 'citationCount': 72, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4878654', 'name': 'A.

This perspective presents a mix of theoretical and practice perspectives to support the implementation of telehealth. Although research evidence is just emerging, there is sufficient indication to believe telehealth is effective. However, which telehealth strategies are best for which children and families, and which intervention goals, are not yet clear. Methods We discuss how different telehealth strategies (e.g. videoconferencing, emails, phone calls, online programs) are being used to address specific intervention goals. Comments from therapists using telehealth and examples of practices in different context and with different populations are provided. We discuss how newly adopted telehealth practices could be included in future hybrid service delivery models and programs, as well as factors influencing the decision to offer face-to-face or online interventions.

The following paper discusses how these circumstances (e.g., stay-at-home orders, school closures, changes in pediatric healthcare delivery) impact disease management at the individual, family, community, and healthcare system levels. We also discuss how barriers to pediatric adherence and self-management exacerbated by the pandemic may disproportionately affect underserved and vulnerable populations, potentially resulting in greater health disparities. Given the potential for widespread challenges to pediatric disease management during the pandemic, ongoing monitoring and promotion of adherence and self-management is critical. Technology offers several opportunities for this via telemedicine, electronic monitoring, and mobile apps. Moreover, pediatric psychologists are uniquely equipped to develop and implement adherence-promotion efforts to support youth and their families in achieving and sustaining optimal disease management as the current public health situation continues to evolve. Research efforts addressing the short- and long-term impact of the pandemic on pediatric adherence and self-management are needed to identify both risk and resilience factors affecting disease management and subsequent health outcomes during this unprecedented time.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 33, 'citationCount': 32, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3958256', 'name': 'J.

Mobile health (mHealth) describes the practice of delivering healthcare via mobile devices and may be an ideal solution to increase access and reach of evidence-based behavioral health interventions. Areas covered The aim of this narrative review is to present a state-of-the-art overview of evidence-based mHealth efforts within the field of pediatric chronic pain and consider new and promising directions for study. Given the nascent nature of the field, published mHealth interventions in all stages of development are discussed. Literature was identified through a non-systematic search in PubMed and Google Scholar, and a review of reference lists of papers that were identified as particularly relevant or foundational (within and outside of the chronic pain literature). Expert opinion mHealth is a promising interventional modality with early evidence suggesting it is primed to enhance behavioral health delivery and patient outcomes.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers are abruptly changing their care delivery to protect patients and staff from infection and to reallocate resource towards the greatest acute needs. Elective, routine, and nonemergency casework has stopped in secondary and tertiary centres, while in primary care, patients are requested to stay away or “socially distance,” and in residential care facilities and hospices, strict isolation and separation protocols have been introduced. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine and eHealth approaches were being developed and tested in a gradual fashion with many studies focusing on lessons learned and barriers to using digital solutions. Overnight, however, treating or supporting people with non-urgent and long-term conditions at a distance from healthcare providers has become imperative. These immediate changes are happening across healthcare systems. Telemedicine is being used to demand-manage the flow of patients with respiratory distress accessing emergency departments; video consultation is being introduced in multiple settings; and using social media is being discussed positively for its potential to direct people to trusted resources, to counteract misinformation, and to provide psychological first aid.

Methods We searched the Cochrane, PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PEDRO databases from 2000 to 2015 for randomised controlled trials, comparing exercise-based telemedicine intervention to no intervention or usual care in adults with chronic pain. Primary outcome data were pooled using random effect meta-analysis. Primary outcomes were pain, physical activity (PA), limitations in activities of daily living (ADL) and quality of life (QoL). Secondary outcomes were barriers, facilitators and usability of telemedicine. Results Sixteen studies were included. Meta-analyses were performed in three subgroups of studies with comparable control conditions. Telemedicine versus no intervention showed significantly lower pain scores (MD −0.57, 95% CI −0.81; −0.34), but not for telemedicine versus usual care (MD −0.08, 95% CI −0.41; 0.26) or in addition to usual care (MD −0.25, 95% CI −1.50; 1.00). Telemedicine compared to no intervention showed non-significant effects for PA (MD 19.93\u2009min/week, 95% CI −5.20; 45.06) and significantly diminished ADL limitations (SMD −0.20, 95% CI −0.29; −0.12).

Few studies have compared quantitative measurements of lower extremity functional tasks between 2D and 3D.\n\n\nPURPOSE\nTo compare kinematic measurements of the trunk and lower extremity in the frontal and sagittal planes between 2D video camera and 3D motion capture analyses obtained concurrently during a SLS.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nDescriptive laboratory study.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty-six healthy, recreationally active adults volunteered to participate. Participants performed three trials of the single leg squat on each limb, which were recorded simultaneously by three 2D video cameras and a 3D motion capture system. Dependent variables analyzed were joint displacement at the trunk, hip, knee, and ankle in the frontal and sagittal planes during the task compared to single leg quiet standing.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDependent variables exhibited moderate to strong correlations between the two measures in the sagittal plane (r\u2009=\u20090.51-.093), and a poor correlation at the knee in the frontal plane (r\u2009=\u20090.308) at (p\u2009≤\u20090.05) All other dependent variables revealed non-significant results between the two measures. Bland-Altman plots revealed strong agreement in the average mean difference in the amount of joint displacement between 2D and 3D in the sagittal plane (trunk\u2009=\u20091.68\u2009º, hip\u2009=\u20092.60\u2009º, knee\u2009=\u20090.74\u2009º, and ankle\u2009=\u20093.12\u2009º). Agreement in the frontal plane was good (trunk\u2009=\u20097.92\u2009°, hip\u2009=\u2009-8.72\u2009º, knee\u2009=\u2009-6.62\u2009º, and ankle\u2009=\u20093.03\u2009°).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nModerate to strong relationships were observed between 2D video camera and 3D motion capture analyses at all joints in the sagittal plane, and the average mean difference was comparable to the standard error of measure with goniometry.

One important response to pediatric pain is acceptance: the degree to which an individual participates in routine daily activities in the presence of pain and is willing to let pain be a part of their life without efforts to control or avoid it. However, no tool currently exists to assess parents’ own acceptance of their child’s pain. The aim of this study was to validate the Parent Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (PPAQ). Materials and Methods:The PPAQ was administered to 310 parents of youth with chronic pain in an outpatient pediatric headache program and a day hospital pain rehabilitation program. An exploratory factor analysis revealed 2 factors for the PPAQ: an 11-item Activity Engagement scale and a 4-item Acceptance of Pain-related Thoughts and Feelings scale. Results:The PPAQ total score and subscales demonstrated strong internal consistency. Greater parent pain acceptance was positively associated with child pain acceptance, and was negatively correlated with parent protective behaviors, parent minimizing behaviors, parent and child pain catastrophizing, and child fear of pain. Parent protective behaviors and child pain acceptance both served as mediators of the relationship between parent pain acceptance and child functional disability. Conclusions:The PPAQ is a valid measure of parent pain acceptance and may provide valuable insights into parent responses to child pain and the ways in which parent acceptance influences child outcomes.

Psychological therapies, traditionally delivered face-to-face with a therapist, are efficacious at reducing pain intensity and disability. However, new and innovative technology is being used to deliver these psychological therapies remotely, meaning barriers to access to treatment such as distance and cost can be removed or reduced. Therapies delivered with technological devices, such as the Internet, computer-based programmes, smartphone applications, or via the telephone, can be used to deliver treatment to children and adolescents with chronic pain.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo determine the efficacy of psychological therapies delivered remotely compared to waiting-list, treatment-as-usual, or active control treatments, for the management of chronic pain in children and adolescents.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched four databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO) from inception to June 2014 for randomised controlled trials of remotely delivered psychological interventions for children and adolescents (0 to 18 years of age) with chronic pain. We searched for chronic pain conditions including, but not exclusive to, headache, recurrent abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, and neuropathic pain. We also searched online trial registries for potential trials. A citation and reference search for all included studies was conducted.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nAll included studies were randomised controlled trials that investigated the efficacy of a psychological therapy delivered remotely via the Internet, smartphone device, computer-based programme, audiotapes, or over the phone in comparison to an active, treatment-as-usual, or waiting-list control. We considered blended treatments, which used a combination of technology and face-to-face interaction. We excluded interventions solely delivered face-to-face between therapist and patient from this review. Children and adolescents (0 to 18 years of age) with a primary chronic pain condition were the target of the interventions. Each comparator arm, at each extraction point had to include 10 or more participants.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nFor the analyses, we combined all psychological therapies. We split pain conditions into headache and mixed (non-headache) pain and analysed them separately. Pain, disability, depression, anxiety, and adverse events were extracted as primary outcomes. We also extracted satisfaction with treatment as a secondary outcome. We considered outcomes at two time points: first immediately following the end of treatment (known as 'post-treatment'), and second, any follow-up time point post-treatment between 3 and 12 months (known as 'follow-up'). We assessed all included studies for risk of bias.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nEight studies (N = 371) that delivered treatment remotely were identified from our search; five studies investigated children with headache conditions, one study was with children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and two studies included mixed samples of children with headache and mixed (i.e. recurrent abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain) chronic pain conditions. The average age of children receiving treatment was 12.57 years.For headache pain conditions, we found one beneficial effect of remotely delivered psychological therapy. Headache severity was reduced post-treatment (risk ratio (RR) = 2.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.56 to 4.50, z = 3.62,p < 0.01, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 2.88). For mixed pain conditions, we found only one beneficial effect: psychological therapies reduced pain intensity post-treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) = -0.61, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.25, z = 3.38, p < 0.01). No effects were found for reducing pain at follow-up in either analysis. For headache and mixed conditions, there were no beneficial effects of psychological therapies delivered remotely for disability post-treatment and a lack of data at follow-up meant no analyses could be run. Only one analysis could be conducted for depression outcomes. We found no beneficial effect of psychological therapies in reducing depression post-treatment for headache conditions. Only one study presented data in children with mixed pain conditions for depressive outcomes and no data were available for either condition at follow-up. Only one study presented anxiety data post-treatment and no studies reported follow-up data, therefore no analyses could be run. Further, there were no data available for adverse events, meaning that we are unsure whether psychological therapies are harmful to children who receive them. Satisfaction with treatment is described qualitatively.'Risk of bias' assessments were low or unclear. We judged selection, detection, and reporting biases to be mostly low risk for included studies. However, judgements made on performance and attrition biases were mostly unclear.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nPsychological therapies delivered remotely, primarily via the Internet, confer benefit in reducing the intensity or severity of pain after treatment across conditions. There is considerable uncertainty around these estimates of effect and only eight studies with 371 children contribute to the conclusions. Future studies are likely to change the conclusions reported here. All included trials used either behavioural or cognitive behavioural therapies for children with chronic pain, therefore we cannot generalise our findings to other therapies. However, satisfaction with these treatments was generally positive. Larger trials are needed to increase our confidence in all conclusions regarding the efficacy of remotely delivered psychological therapies. Implications for practice and research are discussed."", 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 74, 'citationCount': 222, 'authors': [{'authorId': '39712323', 'name': 'E.

Despite advancements in pain assessment and management research, pain due to cancer and/or its treatments continues to be poorly managed. Our research group has developed a native iPhone application (app) called Pain Squad to tackle the problem of poorly managed pain in the adolescent with cancer group. The app functions as an electronic pain diary and is unique in its ability to collect data on pain intensity, duration, location, and the impact pain has on an adolescent’s life (ie, relationships, school work, sleep, mood). It also evaluates medications and other physical and psychological pain management strategies used. Users are prompted twice daily at configurable times to complete 20 questions characterizing their pain and the app transmits results to a database for aggregate reporting through a Web interface. Each diary entry represents a pain case filed by an adolescent with cancer and a reward system (ie, moving up through law-enforcement team ranks, built-in videotaped acknowledgements from fictitious officers) encourages consistent use of the diary. Objective Our objective was to design, develop, and test the usability, feasibility, compliance, and satisfaction of a game-based smartphone pain assessment tool for adolescents with cancer. Methods We used both low- and high-fidelity qualitative usability testing with qualitative semi-structured, audio-taped interviews and iterative cycles to design and refine the iPhone based Pain Squad app. Qualitative thematic analysis of interviews using constant comparative methodology captured emergent themes related to app usability. Content validity was assessed using question importance-rating surveys completed by participants. Compliance and satisfaction data were collected following a 2-week feasibility trial where users were alarmed to record their pain twice daily on the app. Results Thematic analysis of usability interviews showed the app to be appealing overall to adolescents. Analyses of both low- and high-fidelity testing resulted in minor revisions to the app to refine the theme and improve its usability. Adolescents resoundingly endorsed the game-based nature of the app and its virtual reward system. The importance of app pain diary questions was established by content validity analysis. Compliance with the app, assessed during feasibility testing, was high (mean 81%, SD 22%) and adolescents from this phase of the study found the app likeable, easy to use, and not bothersome to complete. Conclusions A multifaceted usability approach demonstrated how the Pain Squad app could be made more appealing to children and adolescents with cancer. The game-based nature and built-in reward system of the app was appealing to adolescents and may have resulted in the high compliance rates and satisfaction ratings observed during clinical feasibility testing.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 35, 'citationCount': 263, 'authors': [{'authorId': '7137938', 'name': 'J.

Physical fitness includes 4 components: muscular endurance and strength, flexibility, body composition, and cardiorespiratory endurance or aerobic fitness (2). Cardiorespiratory endurance or aerobic fitness is most strongly associated with health benefits in the general population and is therefore the primary focus of most exercise programs (3,4). Children with JIA have a moderate to large impairment in aerobic fitness as represented by peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) compared with healthy children (5). VO2peak has been described as the golden standard for aerobic fitness and is frequently examined using symptom limited bicycle ergometry (SLBE) in combination with a metabolic cart to analyze respiratory gases (6). However, bicycle ergometry and metabolic measurements are not always feasible in pediatric patients. It may be difficult to motivate nonathletic children to an exhaustive effort, intensive exercise may pose a risk to children with cardiopulmonary or musculoskeletal disease, and metabolic measurements systems may not be available, particularly in a field setting (7). Therefore, there is need for simple and inexpensive measurement tools to measure aerobic fitness. The 6-Minute Walking Test (6MWT), a simple and inexpensive measurement tool, is a good candidate (8). The 6-MWT is a self-paced and submaximal endurance test. In adult patients the 6-MWT has been widely used, most often in patients with pulmonary or cardiac diseases (9,10). Literature provides support for the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the 6-MWT for a wide spectrum of adult individuals (9). In addition, the 6-MWT is described as easy to administer, better tolerated, and more reflective of activities of daily living than other walking tests and has therefore been described as the test of choice when using a functional walk test for clinical or research purposes (10). In pediatric patients, only 2 studies report the use of the 6-MWT (11,12). Gulmans et al found that for this group the 6-MWT is a valid and useful test to assess the exercise tolerance and endurance in children with cystic fibrosis (11). Nixon et al suggested that the 6-MWT might provide an alternative method for assessing functional exercise capacity in severely ill children (12). Despite these promising results, the validity of the 6-MWT in children with rheumatic disease has, to our knowledge, never before been examined. Validity refers to the question as to whether an instrument appears to measure what it purports to measure, i.e., endurance. In addition, validity indicates whether a variable can be correlated with the “gold standard” for cardiorespiratory endurance, i.e., VO2peak.

36,68,451728091adaea473451cd452161f56c60436d4b,Assessing the impact of forest structure disturbances on the arboreal movement and energetics of orangutans—An agent-based modeling approach,"Agent-based models have been developed and widely employed to assess the impact of disturbances or conservation management on animal habitat use, population development, and viability. However, the direct impacts of canopy disturbance on the arboreal movement of individual primates have been less studied. Such impacts could shed light on the cascading effects of disturbances on animal health and fitness. Orangutans are an arboreal primate that commonly encounters habitat quality deterioration due to land-use changes and related disturbances such as forest fires. Forest disturbance may, therefore, create a complex stress scenario threatening orangutan populations. Due to forest disturbances, orangutans may adapt to employ more terrestrial, as opposed to arboreal, movements potentially prolonging the search for fruiting and nesting trees. In turn, this may lead to changes in daily activity patterns (i.e., time spent traveling, feeding, and resting) and available energy budget, potentially decreasing the orangutan's fitness. We developed the agent-based simulation model BORNEO (arBOReal aNimal movEment mOdel), which explicitly describes both orangutans' arboreal and terrestrial movement in a forest habitat, depending on distances between trees and canopy structures. Orangutans in the model perform activities with a motivation to balance energy intake and expenditure through locomotion. We tested the model using forest inventory data obtained in Sebangau National Park, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. This allowed us to construct virtual forests with real characteristics including tree connectivity, thus creating the potential to expand the environmental settings for simulation experiments. In order to parameterize the energy related processes of the orangutans described in the model, we applied a computationally intensive evolutionary algorithm and evaluated the simulation results against observed behavioral patterns of orangutans. Both the simulated variability and proportion of activity budgets including feeding, resting, and traveling time for female and male orangutans confirmed the suitability of the model for its purpose. We used the calibrated model to compare the activity patterns and energy budgets of orangutans in both natural and disturbed forests . The results confirm field observations that orangutans in the disturbed forest are more likely to experience deficit energy balance due to traveling to the detriment of feeding time. Such imbalance is more pronounced in males than in females. The finding of a threshold of forest disturbances that affects a significant change in activity and energy budgets suggests potential threats to the orangutan population. Our study introduces the first agent-based model describing the arboreal movement of primates that can serve as a tool to investigate the direct impact of forest changes and disturbances on the behavior of species such as orangutans. Moreover, it demonstrates the suitability of high-performance computing to optimize the calibration of complex agent-based models describing animal behavior at a fine spatio-temporal scale (1-m and 1-s granularity).",2022,79,2,{'volume': '10'},"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [0.577957034111023, -1.7900007963180542, 2.049034595489502, 5.109560489654541, 4.164819240570068, -4.218119144439697,

Yet, despite the known importance of tropical peatlands for biodiversity conservation and serious threat that anthropogenically induced fires pose to this ecosystem, the influence of protected area designation on fire occurrence in tropical peatland has been poorly assessed thus far. Our study addresses this knowledge gap through providing a novel assessment of fire patterns from a tropical peatland protected area and surrounding landscape. We investigated the importance of both climatic factors (top-down mechanism) and human interventions (bottom-up mechanism) on fire occurrence through analyzing 20-years (2001–2020) of LANDSAT and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) images of the Padang Sugihan Wildlife Reserve and a 10-km buffer area surrounding this in Sumatra, Indonesia. Fire density was assessed in relation to road and canal construction. Monthly and annual precipitation was compared between wet and dry years. The reserve was effective in limiting fire compared to surrounding landscapes only in wet years. We revealed that peat fire occurrence in the protected area and buffer zone was not due to climatic factors alone, with distance from canals and roads also contributing toward fire occurrence. Our results suggest that it is essential to address tropical peatland fire processes at a landscape level, particularly at the surroundings of protected areas, in order to increase the effectiveness of fire protection, improve fire risk classification maps, and conserve threatened tropical peatland wildlife such as the Sumatran elephant.', 'year': 2022, 'referenceCount': 85, 'citationCount': 2, 'authors': [{'authorId': '47346983', 'name': 'M.

Evolution has shaped the interaction between species and their environments. Thus, alterations to the species‐typical “wild‐type” behavioral repertoire (and the ability of the individual to adapt flexibly which elements of the repertoire it employs) may disrupt the relationship between the organism and its environment, creating cascading One Health effects. A good example is rehabilitant orangutans where, for example, seemingly minor differences from wild conspecifics in the time spent traveling on the ground rather than in the forest canopy can affect an individual's musculoskeletal and nutritional health, as well as social integration. It can also increase two‐way transmission of infectious diseases and/or pathogens with local human populations, or potentially with neighboring wild populations if there are no geographical barriers and rehabilitants travel far enough to leave their release area. Primates are well known ecosystem engineers, reshaping plant communities and maintaining biodiversity through seed dispersal, consuming plants, and creating canopy gaps and trails. From the habitat perspective, a rehabilitant orangutan which does not behave like a wild orangutan is unlikely to fulfill these same ecosystem services. Despite the importance of the diversity of an ape's behavioral repertoire, how it compares to that of wild conspecifics and how it alters in response to habitat variation, behavior is an often under‐appreciated aspect of One Health. In this review, focusing on orangutans as an example of the kinds of problems faced by all captive great apes, we examine the ways in which understanding and facilitating the expression of wild‐type behavior can improve their health, their ability to thrive, and the robustness of local One Health systems."", 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 110, 'citationCount': 3, 'authors': [{'authorId': '153931250', 'name': 'Jackie Chappell'}, {'authorId': '5259876', 'name': 'S.

In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of sanitation felling on stopping the spread of a bark beetle population from an un-managed to a managed forest area. For this, we advance an individual-based dispersion model of Ips typographus by adding the influence of wind on the beetle dispersion and by importing GIS data to simulate real world forests. To validate the new model version and to find reasonable parameter values, we conduct simulation experiments to reproduce infestation patterns that occurred in 2015, 2016, and 2017 within the national park Saxon Switzerland, Germany. With the then calibrated model IPS-SPREADS (Infestation Pattern Simulation Supporting PREdisposition Assessment DetailS), we investigate the impact of different factors such as the distance between beetle source trees and the forest border on the amount of damage within the managed forest stand and test the effectiveness of different levels of sanitation felling and its point of action on reducing the amount of damaged trees. As expected, the results of the model calibration show that the direction of wind plays an important role for the occurring infestation patterns and that bark beetle energy reserve is reduced during mass outbreaks. The results of the second experiment show that the main drivers for the amount of damaged trees are the primary attractiveness and the distance to beetle source trees. Sanitation felling effectiveness is highest when performed near the beetle source trees, with considerably high felling intensities and if there is at least some distance to the managed forest. IPS-SPREADS can be used in future studies as a tool for testing further management measures (e.g., pheromone traps) or to assess the risk for bark beetle infestations of forest areas near to wind-felled or already infested trees.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 75, 'citationCount': 6, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1659339738', 'name': 'Bruno Walter Pietzsch'}, {'authorId': '108207848', 'name': 'Felix Peter'}, {'authorId': '26072405', 'name': 'U.

To help rescued orphans recover from maternal loss our rehabilitation programme is modelled on the natural infant development of orangutans. Orphaned apes cannot be released back into freedom before they have learned the skills necessary to survive alone. To prevent suffering after release we documented the development of survival skills during the rehabilitation process. Seven orangutan orphans aged 1.5–9 years were observed over 18 months in their forest school, immersed in a natural forest environment with human surrogate mothers and other orphans. Social interactions deviated from wild mother-reared immatures: Infant orphans spent more time playing with peers, rested less, and were far from their human surrogate mothers earlier and often than wild immatures are from their biological mothers. Around weaning age, 4- to 7-year-old orphans took up a typical orangutan life-style: they interacted less with human surrogate mothers and peers, stayed high in the trees and slept in nests in the forest. Their time budgets resembled those of wild adults. We conclude that it is not only ethical but also possible to assess survival competences of rehabilitant orphans before release and choose release candidates accordingly. Abstract Orangutans depend on social learning for the acquisition of survival skills. The development of skills is not usually assessed in rescued orphans’ pre-release. We collected data of seven orphans over an 18-months-period to monitor the progress of ontogenetic changes. The orphans, 1.5–9 years old, were immersed in a natural forest environment with human surrogate mothers and other orphans. Social interactions deviated significantly from those of wild mother-reared immatures. Infants spent more time playing socially with peers, at the expense of resting and solitary play. Infants were also more often and at an earlier age distant from their human surrogate mothers than wild immatures are from their biological mothers. We found important changes towards an orangutan-typical lifestyle in 4- to 7-year-old orphans, corresponding to the weaning age in maternally reared immatures. The older orphans spent less time interacting with human surrogate mothers or peers, started to use the canopy more than lower forest strata and began to sleep in nests in the forest. Their time budgets resembled those of wild adults. In conclusion, juvenile orphans can develop capacities that qualify them as candidates for release back into natural habitat when protected from humanising influences and immersed in a species-typical environment.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 56, 'citationCount': 5, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5921920', 'name': 'S.

The model describes (1) above- and belowground fires, which spread independently but interact with each other; (2) above- and belowground biomass; and (3) the watertable determining peat dryness and susceptibility to fire. We applied PeatFire to a region in South Sumatra that has experienced profound natural rainforest loss due to peat fires. Sensitivity analysis of the model suggests that fire sizes depend mostly on watertable depth, peat-dry-index and number of dry days before ignition. Using pattern-oriented modelling, these factors were parameterised so that the model output matches spatiotemporal fire patterns observed in the study region in 2015.

In this study, we introduced the OLR–MC index—one of the rain-related indices derived from OLR (outgoing longwave radiation) in MC (maritime continent) area in Indonesia. This index showed stronger correlation with active peatland fires than the conventional ENSO index, and is likely to be able to respond to heat and dry weather supposed to be under climate-change conditions. We then analyzed peatland fires in the top six fire years from 2002 to 2018 and showed that peatland fires occurred in three stages—surface fire, shallow peatland fire and deep peatland fire. To explain each stage, we proposed a one-dimensional groundwater level (GWL) prediction model (named as MODEL-0). MODEL-0 predicts GWL from daily rainfall. Analysis using MODEL-0 showed the GWL thresholds for the three fire stages were between -300 mm and -500 mm; peatland fire activities during the three fire stages were dependent on these GWL values.

Using indirect nest count methods, we implemented surveys and estimated population densities of the Northeast Bornean orang‐utan (Pongo pygmaeus morio) across the continuous logged forest and forest remnants in a recently salvage‐logged area and oil palm plantations in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We then assessed the influence of landscape features and forest structural metrics obtained from LiDAR data on estimates of orang‐utan density. Recent salvage logging appeared to have a little short‐term effect on orang‐utan density (2.35\u2009ind/km 2), which remained similar to recovering logged forest nearby (2.32\u2009ind/km 2). Orang‐utans were also present in remnant forest patches in oil palm plantations, but at significantly lower numbers (0.82\u2009ind/km 2) than nearby logged forest and salvage‐logged areas. Densities were strongly influenced by variation in canopy height but were not associated with other potential covariates. Our findings suggest that orang‐utans currently exist, at least in the short‐term, within human‐modified landscapes, providing that remnant forest patches remain.

The most typical cases involve quantifying the difference of two samples in terms of their mean values using the t statistic or other measures, such as Cohen's d or U metrics. In both cases the aim is to quantify how large such differences have to be in order to be classified as notable effects. These issues are particularly relevant when dealing with experimental and applied psychological research. However, most of these standard measures require some distributional assumptions to be correctly used, such as symmetry, unimodality, and well-established parametric forms. Although these assumptions guarantee that asymptotic properties for inference are satisfied, they can often limit the validity and interpretability of results. In this article we illustrate the use of a distribution-free overlapping measure as an alternative way to quantify sample differences and assess research hypotheses expressed in terms of Bayesian evidence. The main features and potentials of the overlapping index are illustrated by means of three empirical applications. Results suggest that using this index can considerably improve the interpretability of data analysis results in psychological research, as well as the reliability of conclusions that researchers can draw from their studies."", 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 32, 'citationCount': 123, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145299924', 'name': 'M.

While a number of general patterns have been identified, the mechanisms underlying the structure of plant-pollinator networks are poorly understood. Here we present an agent based model (ABM) that simulates the movement of bees over heterogeneous landscapes and captures pollination events, enabling the influence of landscape pattern on pollination networks to be explored. Using the model, we conducted a series of experiments using virtual landscapes representing a gradient of forest loss and fragmentation. The ABM was able to produce expected trends in network structure, from simulations of interactions between individual plants and pollinators. For example, results indicated an increase in the index of complementary specialization (H2’) and a decline in network connectance with increasing forest cover. Furthermore, network nestedness was not associated with the degree of forest cover, but was positively related to forest patch size, further supporting results obtained in the field. This illustrates the potential value of ABMs for exploring the structure and dynamics of plant-pollinator networks, and for understanding the mechanisms that underlie them.

We assessed (1) the extent to which great apes use diagonal sequence, diagonal couplet gaits, like other primates, (2) the extent to which gait and posture vary across great apes, and (3) the role of body mass and limb proportions on ape quadrupedal kinematics.\n\n\nMETHODS\nHigh-speed digital video of zoo-housed bonobos (Pan paniscus, N\u2009=\u20098), chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes, N\u2009=\u200913), lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla, N\u2009=\u200913), and orangutans (Pongo spp. N\u2009=\u20096) walking over-ground at self-selected speeds were used to determine the timing of limb touch-down, take-off, and to measure joint and segment angles at touch-down, midstance, and take-off.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe great apes in our study showed broad kinematic and spatiotemporal similarity in quadrupedal walking. Size-adjusted walking speed was the strongest predictor of gait variables. Body mass had a negligible effect on variation in joint and segment angles, but stride frequency did trend higher among larger apes in analyses including size-adjusted speed. In contrast to most other primates, great apes did not favor diagonal sequence footfall patterns, but exhibited variable gait patterns that frequently shifted between diagonal and lateral sequences.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSimilarities in the terrestrial walking kinematics of extant great apes likely reflect their similar post-cranial anatomy and proportions.

Such interactions are especially complex in tropical ecosystems, including endangered peat forests of Central Borneo, a biodiversity hot spot and home to the critically endangered orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii). We combined studies of the digestive physiology of captive orangutans in Australia with detailed field studies of wild orangutans in the Natural Laboratory of Peat-Swamp Forest of Sabangau, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. By measuring the gut transit time (TT) of indigestible seed mimics (beads) in captivity and applying this as a temporal constraint to movement data of wild orangutans, we developed a mechanistic, time-explicit spatial model to project the seed dispersal patterns by these large-bodied, arboreal frugivores. We followed seven orangutans and established home range kernels using Time Local Convex Hull (T-LoCoH) modelling. This allowed us to model individual orangutan movements and to adjust these models according to gut transit times to estimate seed dispersal kernels. Female movements were conservative (core ranges of 55 and 52 ha in the wet and dry seasons, respectively) and revisitation rates to the same location of n = 4 in each 24-h block. Male movements were more unpredictable, yielding fragmented core ranges and revisitation rates to the same location of only 1.2 times each 24 h; males also demonstrated large disjunctions where they moved rapidly over long distances and were frequently lost from view. Seed dispersal kernels were nested predictably within the core ranges of females, but not males. We used the T-LoCoH approach to analyse movement ecology, which offered a powerful tool to predict the primary deposition of seeds by orangutans, thereby providing a reliable method for making a priori predictions of seed dispersal dynamics by other frugivores in novel ecosystems.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 121, 'citationCount': 14, 'authors': [{'authorId': '6221959', 'name': 'Esther Tarszisz'}, {'authorId': '39936237', 'name': 'S.

Overall, the tall forest classes (≥20 m) were preferred. They were preferred for feeding, irrespective of canopy connectivity, whereas classes with a connected canopy (canopy cover ≥75%), irrespective of canopy height, were preferred for resting and nesting, suggesting that tall trees are preferred for feeding and connected canopy for security and protection. The smaller forest classes (≤10 m high) were least preferred and were used mainly for travelling from patch to patch. Thus, selective logging is demonstrated here to be compatible with orang-utan survival as long as large food trees and patches of primary forest remain.

An individual’s behavior may be regulated by its emotional state and its interaction history with specific individuals. Emotional bookkeeping is a candidate mechanism to keep track of received benefits from specific individuals without requiring high cognitive abilities. However, how this mechanism may work is difficult to study in real animals, due to the complexity of primate social life. To explore this theoretically, we introduce an agent-based model, dubbed EMO-model, in which we implemented emotional bookkeeping. In this model the social behaviors of primate-like individuals are regulated by emotional processes along two dimensions. An individual’s emotional state is described by an aversive and a pleasant dimension (anxiety and satisfaction) and by its activating quality (arousal). Social behaviors affect the individuals’ emotional state. To implement emotional bookkeeping, the receiver of grooming assigns an accumulated affiliative attitude (LIKE) to the groomer. Fixed partner-specific agonistic attitudes (FEAR) reflect the stable dominance relations between group members. While the emotional state affects an individual’s general probability of executing certain behaviors, LIKE and FEAR affect the individual’s partner-specific behavioral probabilities. In this way, emotional processes regulate both spontaneous behaviors and appropriate responses to received behaviors, while emotional bookkeeping via LIKE attitudes regulates the development and maintenance of affiliative relations. Using an array of empirical data, the model processes were substantiated and the emerging model patterns were partially validated. The EMO-model offers a framework to investigate the emotional bookkeeping hypothesis theoretically and pinpoints gaps that need to be investigated empirically.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 153, 'citationCount': 24, 'authors': [{'authorId': '40467403', 'name': 'E.

The underlying mechanisms behind these movement patterns, such as the use of spatial memory, are topics of considerable debate. To augment existing evidence of spatial memory use in primates, we generated movement patterns from simulated primate agents with simple sensory and behavioral capabilities. We developed agents representing various hypotheses of memory use, and compared the movement patterns of simulated groups to those of an observed group of red colobus monkeys (Procolobus rufomitratus), testing for: the effects of memory type (Euclidian or landmark based), amount of memory retention, and the effects of social rules in making foraging choices at the scale of the group (independent or leader led). Our results indicate that red colobus movement patterns fit best with simulated groups that have landmark based memory and a follow the leader foraging strategy. Comparisons between simulated agents revealed that social rules had the greatest impact on a group’s step length, whereas the type of memory had the highest impact on a group’s path tortuosity and cohesion. Using simulation studies as experimental trials to test theories of spatial memory use allows the development of insight into the behavioral mechanisms behind animal movement, developing case-specific results, as well as general results informing how changes to perception and behavior influence movement patterns.', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 41, 'citationCount': 24, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3457511', 'name': 'T.

Arboreal inhabitants must adapt to changes in the compliance and stability of supports when moving around trees. Because the orangutan is the largest habitual arboreal inhabitant, it is unusually susceptible to branch compliance and stability and therefore represents a unique animal model to help investigate how animals cope with the mechanical heterogeneity of the tropical canopy. The aim of this study was to investigate how changes in compliance and time of oscillation of branches are related to easily observable traits of arboreal supports. This should help predict how supports react mechanically to the weight and mass of a moving orangutan, and suggest how orangutans themselves predict branch properties. We measured the compliance and time of oscillation of branches from 11 tree species frequented by orangutans in the rainforest of Sumatra. Branches were pulled at several points along their length using a force balance at the end of a stiff rope, and the local diameter of the branch and the distance to its base and tip were measured. Compliance was negatively associated with both local diameter and length to the tip of the branch, and positively, if weakly, associated with length from the trunk. However, branch diameter not only predicted compliance best, but would also be easiest for an orangutan to observe. In contrast, oscillation times of branches were largely unaffected by local diameter, and only significantly increased at diameters below 2 cm. The results of this study validate previous field research, which related locomotory modes to local branch diameter, while suggesting how arboreal animals themselves sense their mechanical environment.', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 38, 'citationCount': 25, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3577067', 'name': 'A. van Casteren'}, {'authorId': '2226965', 'name': 'W.

We compared habitat structure and support availability in three orangutan study sites—two on Sumatra (Pongo abelii) in the dry‐lowland forest of Ketambe and peat swamp forest of Suaq Balimbing, and one on Borneo (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii) in the disturbed peat swamp forest of Sabangau—to better understand orangutan habitat use. Our analysis revealed vast differences in tree and liana density between the three sites. Sabangau had a much higher overall tree density, although both Sumatran sites had a higher density of larger trees. The two peat swamp forests were more similar to each other than to Ketambe, particularly with regard to support availability. Ketambe had a wider variety of supports of different sizes and types, and a higher density of larger lianas than the two peat swamps. Orangutans in all three sites did not differ substantially in terms of their preferred supports, although Sumatran orangutans had a strong tendency to use lianas, not observed in Sabangau. Differences in observed frequencies of locomotor behavior suggest the homogeneous structure of Sabangau limits the locomotor repertoire of orangutans, with high frequencies of fewer behaviors, whereas the wider range of supports in Ketambe appears to have facilitated a more varied locomotor repertoire. There were no differences among age‐sex classes in the use of arboreal pathways in Suaq Balimbing, where orangutans selected larger trees than were typically available. This was less apparent in Sabangau, where orangutans generally used trees in relation to their environmental abundance, reflecting the homogeneous nature of disturbed peat swamp forest. These results demonstrate that forest architecture has an important influence on orangutan locomotion, which may become increasingly important as the structure of orangutan habitat continues to be altered through human disturbance.

This study aimed to investigate the mechanical design and architecture of orangutan nests and determine the degree of technical sophistication used in their construction. We measured the whole nest compliance and the thickness of the branches used and recorded the ways in which the branches were fractured. Branch samples were also collected from the nests and subjected to three-point bending tests to determine their mechanical properties. We demonstrated that the center of the nest is more compliant than the edges; this may add extra comfort and safety to the structure. During construction orangutans use the fact that branches only break half-way across in “greenstick” fracture to weave the main nest structure. They choose thicker branches with greater rigidity and strength to build the main structure in this way. They then detach thinner branches by following greenstick fracture with a twisting action to make the lining.

POM is the multi-criteria design, selection and calibration of models of complex systems. POM starts with identifying a set of patterns observed at multiple scales and levels that characterize a system with respect to the particular problem being modelled; a model from which the patterns emerge should contain the right mechanisms to address the problem. These patterns are then used to (i) determine what scales, entities, variables and processes the model needs, (ii) test and select submodels to represent key low-level processes such as adaptive behaviour, and (iii) find useful parameter values during calibration.

The sustained environmental change wildlife are experiencing may surpass the capacity of developmental, genetic, and demographic mechanisms that populations have evolved to deal with these alterations. Undeniably, habitat fragmentation, habitat loss, and human disturbance are causing a decline in species numbers on a global scale, with shifts or reductions occurring in species-distribution ranges. The knowledge of species distribution is a vital component in wildlife conservation and management. Such information aids in quantifying animal–habitat relationships, describing and predicting differential space use by animals, and ultimately identifying habitat that is important to an animal (Beyer et al. 2010). The field of species distribution modeling (SDM) as a means of quantifying species– environment relationships has been extensively developed since the first formal definition of differential habitat selection theory by Fretwell and Lucas in 1969. It has since produced a variety of numerical tools that combine observations of species occurrence or abundance with environmental estimates based on statistically or theoretically derived response surfaces (Guisan and Zimmermann 2000). These models include presence/absence models, dispersal/migration models, disturbance models, and abundance models; they are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. SDMs are used to determine the suitability of the organisms’ habitat, relying on density/abundance measures or the ratio between used and available habitats to infer habitat quality. These models use spatial environmental data to make inferences on species’ range limits (Kearney and Porter 2009). Most approaches are correlative in that they statistically link spatial data (typically geographic information systems data) to species distribution records. Despite the prevalence of SDMs in applied ecology, a review of recent papers cautions using a statistical description that implicitly captures these “habitat use” processes as they are statistically associated with the predictor variables, but may not be so biologically. Firstly, habitat use does not necessarily equate with high quality habitat, range requirements, nor resultant increased wildlife fitness because biotic and abiotic cues can cause animals to choose habitats that do not provide the necessary resources to ensure high fitness returns (Jonzen 2008; Perot and Villard 2009). Secondly, SDMs are frequently applied for predicting potential future distributions of range-shifting species, despite these models’ assumptions that (1) species are at equilibrium with the environments, and (2) the data used to train (fit) the models are representative of conditions to which the models are already', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 98, 'citationCount': 20, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3663322', 'name': 'C.

Backward elimination log-linear modeling was employed to expose the main influences on orangutan locomotion. Our results showed that the most important distinctions with regard to locomotion were between suspensory and compressive, or, orthograde (vertical trunk) and pronograde (horizontal trunk) behavior. Whether orangutans were traveling or feeding had the most important influence on locomotion whereby compressive locomotion had a strong association with feeding, suspensory locomotion had a strong association with travel in the peripheral strata using multiple supports, whereas vertical climb/descent and oscillation showed a strong association with travel on single supports in the core stratum. In contrast to theoretical predictions on positional behavior and body size, age-sex category had a limited influence on locomotion. The study revealed that torso orthograde suspension dominates orangutan locomotion, concurring with previous studies in dipterocarp forest. But, orangutans in the Sabangau exhibited substantially higher frequencies of oscillatory locomotion than observed at other sites, suggesting this behavior confers particular benefits for traversing the highly compliant arboreal environment typical of disturbed peat swamp forest.

Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes. ”Now we must consider in general the common reason for moving with any movement whatever.“ (Aristotle, De Motu Animalium, 4th century B.C.)', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 51, 'citationCount': 2232, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2162780', 'name': 'Ran Nathan'}, {'authorId': '1829415', 'name': 'W.

Here, we calculate the energetic cost of alternative methods of gap crossing in orangutans (Pongo abelii). Tree sway (in which orangutans oscillate a compliant tree trunk with increasing magnitude to bridge a gap) was found to be less than half as costly as jumping, and an order of magnitude less costly than descending the tree, walking to the vine and climbing it. Observations of wild orangutans suggest that they actually use support compliance in many aspects of their locomotor behaviour.

They are consequently an important model in the interpretation of the morphological commonalities of the apes, which are locomotor features associated with arboreal living. This paper presents a detailed analysis of orangutan positional behavior for all age-sex categories and during a complete range of behavioral contexts, following standardized positional mode descriptions proposed by Hunt et al. ([1996] Primates 37:363-387). This paper shows that orangutan positional behavior is highly complex, representing a diverse spectrum of positional modes. Overall, all orthograde and pronograde suspensory postures are exhibited less frequently in the present study than previously reported. Orthograde suspensory locomotion is also exhibited less often, whereas pronograde and orthograde compressive locomotor modes are observed more frequently. Given the complexity of orangutan positional behavior demonstrated by this study, it is likely that differences in positional behavior between studies reflect differences in the interplay between the complex array of variables, which were shown to influence orangutan positional behavior (Thorpe and Crompton 2005 Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 127:58-78). With the exception of pronograde suspensory posture and locomotion, orangutan positional behavior is similar to that of the African apes, and in particular, lowland gorillas.

We examined patterns of relatedness and parentage in a wild orang‐utan population in Borneo using noninvasively collected DNA samples from animals observed to defecate, and microsatellite markers to assess dispersal and mating strategies. Surprisingly, resident females were equally as related to other resident females (mean rxy = 0.303) as resident males were to other resident males (mean rxy = 0.305). Moreover, resident females were more related to each other and to the resident males than they were to nonresident females, and resident males were more related to each other (and resident females) than they were to nonresident males.

This phenomenon has been documented in the dynamics of species representing a variety of taxa and ecological roles. Synchrony may arise from three primary mechanisms:(a) dispersal among populations, reducing the size of relatively large populations and increasing relatively small ones; (b) congruent dependence of population dynamics on a synchronous exogenous random factor such as temperature or rainfall, a phenomenon known as the “Moran effect”; and (c) trophic interactions with populations of other species that are themselves spatially synchronous or mobile. Identification of the causes of synchrony is often difficult. In addition to intraspecific synchrony, there are many examples of synchrony among populations of different species, the causes of which are similarly complex and difficult to identify.

In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN/sup 2/) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed.', 'year': 2002, 'referenceCount': 32, 'citationCount': 37713, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145080287', 'name': 'K.

The Overview, Design concepts and Details (ODD) protocol for describing Individual-and Agent-Based Models (ABMs) is now widely accepted and used to document such models in journal articles. As a standardized document for providing a consistent, logical and readable account of the structure and dynamics of ABMs, some research groups also find it useful as a workflow for model design. Even so, there are still limitations to ODD that obstruct its more widespread adoption. Such limitations are discussed and addressed in this paper: the limited availability of guidance on how to use ODD; the length of ODD documents; limitations of ODD for highly complex models; lack of sufficient details of many ODDs to enable reimplementation without access to the model code; and the lack of provision for sections in the document structure covering model design ratio-nale, the model’s underlying narrative, and the means by which the model’s fitness for purpose is evaluated. We document the steps we have taken to provide better guidance on: structuring complex ODDs and an ODD summary for inclusion in a journal article (with full details in supplementary material; Table 1); using ODD to point readers to relevant sections of the model code; update the document structure to include sections on model rationale and evaluation. We also further advocate the need for standard descriptions of simulation experiments and argue that ODD can in principle be used for any type of simulation model.

The peels of pomegranate fruits are the major by-products enriched in antioxidants and broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents and can prevent food deterioration even. Objective: To assess the quantitative assay for Alkaloids, Tannins, Phenolic acids, Saponins and Flavonoids in pomegranate peel extract (PPE), and evaluate the replacement of PPE as a natural anti-rancidity for corn in comparison with the widespread synthetic antioxidant TBHQ (28 ppm) with evaluation of the antibacterial and anti-candida effect of PPE. Results: The quantitative assay for PPE were total flavonoids (304.21±0.43mg/g Rutin), total phenolic acids (352.60±0.54mg/g Gallic acid), total Tannins (1.66±0.11%), total Saponins (2.67±0.13 %) and total Alkaloids (1.51±0.17%). Using 28 parts per million of pomegranate peel extract and placing it on the oil increased the life of the oil and resisted rancidity for a period of 17.7 hr. compared to tertiary butyl hydroquinone TBHQ (28 ppm) which gave an approximate result of 19.68 hr. Based on the observed results, PPE was an active anti-bacterial and anti-candida substance for gram negative, gram-positive bacteria and candida. Diameter of the inhibitory area was about 20, 19, 23, 31, 17 and 18 mm against K. pneumoniae, E. coli, S. aureus and S. haemolyticus, C. albicans and C. aures respectively. S. haemolyticus was found to be more susceptible to PPE with an inhibition zone diameter of 31 mm. The MICs values against the bacterial and candida strains ranged from 250 μg/ml to 500 μg/ml, and minimum lethal concentrations (MLCs) ranged from 500 μg/ml to 1000 μg/ml Conclusion: PPE is effective in food preservation, and has antimicrobial activities to provide a comprehensive guide for farmers, food processing, and storage sectors and academia.",2022,44,1,{'name': 'Al-Azhar Medical

The antimicrobial efficacy was evaluated against bacterial and fungal strains. The morphological structures, optical and surface properties of as-synthesized nanoparticles have been investigated via a Transmission electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, UV-Vis absorption, and Fourier transform infrared, respectively. The colloidal stability was evaluated using dynamic light scattering and zeta-potential measurements. The average size of as-synthesized particles was about 15±5nm. The green synthesized AgNPs showed significant antibacterial activity against different bacterial species via the agar well diffusion assay. The inhibition zones were varied from 27 to 34mm against 6 bacterial species (K. pneumoniae, E.coli, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and S. haemolyticus). In such a case, the minimal inhibition concertation of AgNPs against bacterial isolates was 4μg/ml for all isolates, except E.coli was 8μg/ml. Also, the silver particles showed an antifungal behavior against 4 fungal species (A. niger, P. marneffie, C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis) with an inhibition zone from 19 to 39mm in diameter. Whereas, the MICs for fungal isolates 8μg/ml for all isolates. Treated Wi-38 cells with AgNPs demonstrated various levels of cytotoxicity dependent on the concentration of AgNPs using MTT assay with IC50 \uf07e 447.6.

The high tannin content, especially punicalagin, found in pomegranate extracts, has been reported as the main compound responsible for such antimicrobial activity. Because the pomegranate peel chemical composition may vary with the type of cultivar (sweet, sour-sweet and sour), pomegranates may also differ with respect to their antimicrobial capacity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe extract from PTO8 pomegranate cultivar peel had the highest antimicrobial activity, as well as the highest punicalagins (α and β) and ellagic acid concentrations. In the results obtained from both antibacterial and antifungal activity studies, the sour-sweet pomegranate cultivar PTO8 showed the best antimicrobial activity, and the highest ellagic acid concentrations.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe results of the present study suggest that ellagic acid content has a significant influence on the antimicrobial activity of the pomegranate extracts investigated. The pomegranate peel of the PTO8 cultivar is a good source of antifungal and antibacterial compounds, and may represent an alternative to antimicrobial agents of synthetic origin. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 43, 'citationCount': 113, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1388881931', 'name': 'E.

Pomegranate peel extracts (PoPx), derived from hydro-alcoholic extracts were evaluated for antioxidant, antimicrobial and potential antiulcer properties. Higher levels of total phenolics (427.19 mgGAE/g of extracts) recovered from hydro-alcoholic extracts exhibited significant (P\u2009<\u20090.05) ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radicals scavenging activity. PoPx inhibited urease activity by 97.9% and IC50 for all extracts was estimated to be in a range of 30–44.4 μM. Potent inhibitory effects of PoP extracts were observed against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Aspergillus niger and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was recorded between 0.25–0.89 mg/mL. The study indicates that PoPx of the white rind cultivar is a potential source of active biomolecules that could further be explored as a source of bioactive compounds and therapeutic agent against various ailments. \n \nPractical Applications \nThe findings of this study propose PoP of white rind cultivar as valuable waste of pomegranate juice processing industry.

Materials and Methods: Hydroalcoholic extracts of pulp from both Punica granatum (pomegranate) and Aloe barbadensis miller (aloe vera) were prepared to concentrations of 5, 25, 50 and 100%. Pure sorbitol powder dissolved in distilled water was taken as the negative control. Streptococcus mutans (S mutans) was isolated from saliva by inoculation on to Mitus Salivarius Bacitracin (MSB) agar, which was then streaked onto agar plates containing Brain Heart Infusion. In each petridish, wells were prepared and using a sterile micropipette, 125μl of the specific concentration of the extract (pomegranate/ aloe vera/ sorbitol) was deposited in each well. This was done in triplicate for each concentration of the extracts. The effect of different concentrations of the extracts on S mutans was observed and the data was subjected to statistical analysis. Results: Pomegranate extract showed significantly higher inhibitory effect on S mutans at all concentrations ( P ≤0.05). On comparison of all three extracts at different concentrations, a significant difference ( P ≤0.05) was observed only at 50 and 100% concentrations. The inhibitory effect of pomegranate extract was significantly different when compared to aloe vera and sorbitol extracts. ( P ≤0.01).

The mean size of the synthetic particles is approximately 20 ± 5 nm and they have a hexagonal crystal structure. In addition, the prepared nanoparticles have strong light absorption in the ultraviolet region of λ = 265 and 370 nm. To achieve the goal of this study, the efficiency of ZnO-NP was determined as an antibacterial and antifungal against different bacterial and fungal strains. It was found that ZnO-NP showed significant antibacterial activity, where the inhibition zones were varied from 21 to 35mm in diameter against six bacterial species (i.e. K. pneumoniae, E. coli, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and S. haemolyticus). In such a case, the minimal inhibitory concentration of zinc oxide nanoparticles against bacterial strains were 50, 12.5, 12.5, 50, 12.5, and 12.5μg/ml for K. pneumoniae, E. coli, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and S. haemolyticus, respectively.

Design Cluster randomized controlled trial with three waves of longitudinal assessments at baseline, 3 and 6 months post intervention. Setting Community-based and patient-centered self-care for behavioral intervention in urban settings of China. Participants A total of 450 participants diagnosed with hypertension from 12 community health centers in Wuhan, China were recruited, and were randomly assigned by center to receive either KM2H2 plus standard CBHCP care (6 centers and 232 patients) or the standard care only (6 centers and 218 patients). Intervention KM2H2 is a behavioral intervention guided by the Transtheoretical Model, the Model of Personalized Medicine and Social Capital Theory. It consists of six intervention sessions and two booster sessions engineered in a progressive manner. The purpose is to motivate and maintain physical activities for the prevention of heart attack and stroke. Outcome Measures Heart attack and stroke (clinically diagnosed, primary outcome), blood pressure (measured, secondary outcome), and physical activity (self-report, tertiary outcome) were assessed at the individual level during the baseline, 3- and 6-month post-intervention. Results Relative to the standard care, receiving KM2H2 was associated with significant reductions in the incidence of heart attack (3.60% vs. 7.03%, p < .05) and stroke (5.11% vs. 9.90%, p<0.05), and moderate reduction in blood pressure (-3.72mmHg in DBP and -2.92 mmHg in DBP) at 6-month post-intervention; and significant increases in physical activity at 3- (d = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.85) and 6-month (d = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.85) post-intervention, respectively. Conclusion The program KM2H2 is efficacious to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke among senior patients who are on anti-hypertensive medication. Findings of this study provide solid data supporting a formal phase-III trial to establish the effectiveness of KM2H2 for use in community settings for prevention.

Mobile health strategies could address this gap but lack evidence of therapeutic benefit.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo examine the effect of a lifestyle-focused semipersonalized support program delivered by mobile phone text message on cardiovascular risk factors.\n\n\nDESIGN AND SETTING\nThe Tobacco, Exercise and Diet Messages (TEXT ME) trial was a parallel-group, single-blind, randomized clinical trial that recruited 710 patients (mean age, 58 [SD, 9.2] years; 82% men; 53% current smokers) with proven coronary heart disease (prior myocardial infarction or proven angiographically) between September 2011 and November 2013 from a large tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nPatients in the intervention group (n\u2009=\u2009352) received 4 text messages per week for 6 months in addition to usual care. Text messages provided advice, motivational reminders, and support to change lifestyle behaviors. Patients in the control group (n=358) received usual care. Messages for each participant were selected from a bank of messages according to baseline characteristics (eg, smoking) and delivered via an automated computerized message management system. The program was not interactive.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary end point was low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level at 6 months. Secondary end points included systolic blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, and smoking status.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 6 months, levels of LDL-C were significantly lower in intervention participants, with concurrent reductions in systolic blood pressure and BMI, significant increases in physical activity, and a significant reduction in smoking. The majority reported the text messages to be useful (91%), easy to understand (97%), and appropriate in frequency (86%). [table: see text].\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nAmong patients with coronary heart disease, the use of a lifestyle-focused text messaging service compared with usual care resulted in a modest improvement in LDL-C level and greater improvement in other cardiovascular disease risk factors. The duration of these effects and hence whether they result in improved clinical outcomes remain to be determined.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nanzctr.org.au Identifier: ACTRN12611000161921.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 34, 'citationCount': 556, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2595589', 'name': 'C.

We aimed to describe factors associated with the extent to which needs were met in Australian survivors of stroke. Method Multifaceted strategies were used to obtain a national sample. Adults 12+ months poststroke and living in the community participated. Needs were assessed over the domains of health, everyday living, work, leisure, social support, and finances. Multivariable negative-binomial and logistic regression were used. Results Seven hundred sixty-five survivors completed surveys. Most (84%) reported having needs that were not being fully met (median 4 of 20, Q1, Q3: 1, 9). Variations occurred based on age, residential location, time since stroke, and disability level. Multivariable results showed that having fatigue, cognition or emotional problems, decreasing age, and increased disability were associated with increasing numbers of needs not being fully met (P < 0·001). Factors associated with needs not being fully met were as follows: (1) greater disability (adjusted odds ratio: 3·4, 95% confidence interval: 1·9, 6·0) and fatigue problems (adjusted odds ratio: 2·0, 95% confidence interval: 1·1, 3·4) (health domain); (2) greater disability (adjusted odds ratio: 7·0, 95% confidence interval: 3·0, 17·0) and being one to two-years poststroke (adjusted odds ratio: 3·4, 95% confidence interval: 1·5, 7·8) (work domain); and (3) increased disability (adjusted odds ratio: 3·8, 95% confidence interval: 2·2, 6·5) and memory problems (adjusted odds ratio: 2·1, 95% confidence interval: 1·0, 4·2) (leisure domain).

This study aimed to develop a bank of text messages designed to provide advice, motivation, and support for decreasing cardiovascular risk. Design: Iterative development process with mixed methods Methods: An initial bank of 120 text messages was drafted based on behaviour change techniques, guidelines, and input from clinicians and public health experts. A questionnaire was then administered to participants (n\u2009=\u200953) for evaluation of message content, usefulness, and language. To test the process of delivery, a pilot study was conducted using a specifically designed computer programme that delivered messages to multiple mobile phones according to a pre-specified schedule. Data were collected regarding message timing, delivery, and usefulness. Results: In the qualitative questionnaire, 92% of participants found the messages easy to understand and 86% found the messages contained useful information. Positive feedback was also obtained from the pilot study. Based on these results, together with suggestions provided, several messages were reworded and an additional 44 were written.

The transtheoretical model, which describes behavior change as occurring through a series of stages, may be a useful way of assessing patients’ readiness to change behavior. The model has been successfully applied to other chronic conditions and argues that people progressing “forward” through the stages are more likely to successfully change their behavior. The aim of this study was to describe stroke patients’ readiness to change behaviors for stroke-related risk factors using this model, in the absence of a behavior modification intervention. Method: Patients (n = 27) from an acute stroke ward of a major metropolitan hospital in Brisbane, Australia, were interviewed prior to and at 3 months following hospital discharge regarding their awareness of stroke risk factors and their readiness to change stroke risk–related behaviors. Results: At both points in time, 30% of patients could not spontaneously nominate one or more stroke risk factors. Despite a trend of “forward” progression in stages of change between the 2 interviews for behaviors relating to hypertension, heart disease, and high cholesterol, there were no statistically significant changes over time for any of the behaviors.

This study estimates the prevalence of self-reported need in community-dwelling stroke survivors across the United Kingdom. Methods— We conducted a survey of stroke survivors 1 to 5 years poststroke recruited through Medical Research Council General Practice Research Framework general practices and 2 population-based stroke registers. Levels and type of need were calculated with comparisons among sociodemographic groups, disability level, and cognitive status using the &khgr;2 test or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Results— From 1251 participants, response rates were 60% (national sample) and 78% (population registers sample) with few differences in levels of reported need between the 2 samples. Over half (51%) reported no unmet needs; among the remainder, the median number of unmet needs was 3 (range, 1 to 13). Proportions reporting unmet clinical needs ranged from 15% to 59%; 54% reported an unmet need for stroke information; 52% reported reduction in or loss of work activities, significantly more from black ethnic groups (P=0.006); 18% reported a loss in income and 31% an increase in expenses with differences by age, ethnic group, and deprivation score. In multivariable analysis, ethnicity (P=0.032) and disability (P=0.014) were associated with total number of unmet needs. Conclusions— Multiple long-term clinical and social needs remain unmet long after incident stroke. Higher levels of unmet need were reported by people with disabilities, from ethnic minority groups, and from those living in the most deprived areas.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the pooled cumulative risk of stroke recurrence. Methods— Studies reporting cumulative risk of recurrence after first-ever stroke were identified using electronic databases and by manually searching relevant journals and conference abstracts. Overall cumulative risks of stroke recurrence at 30 days and 1, 5, and 10 years after first stroke were calculated, and analyses for heterogeneity were conducted. A Weibull model was fitted to the risk of stroke recurrence of the individual studies and pooled estimates were calculated with 95% CI. Results— Sixteen studies were identified, of which 13 studies reported cumulative risk of stroke recurrence in 9115 survivors. The pooled cumulative risk was 3.1% (95% CI, 1.7–4.4) at 30 days, 11.1% (95% CI, 9.0–13.3) at 1 year, 26.4% (95% CI, 20.1–32.8) at 5 years, and 39.2% (95% CI, 27.2–51.2) at 10 years after initial stroke. Substantial heterogeneity was found at all time points. This study also demonstrates a temporal reduction in 5-year risk of stroke recurrence from 32% to 16.2% across the studies. Conclusions— The cumulative risk of recurrence varies greatly up to 10 years. This may be explained by differences in case mix and changes in secondary prevention over time However, methodological differences are likely to play an important role and consensus on definitions would improve future comparability of estimates and characterization of groups of stroke survivors at increased risk of recurrence.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 34, 'citationCount': 493, 'authors': [{'authorId': '39571596', 'name': 'Keerthi M.

A variety of factors, including infrequent exercise participation, may be responsible for the deconditioning observed. According to the transtheoretical model (TTM), individuals progress through cognitive processes, termed stages, that indicate their readiness to undertake a particular healthy behavior, such as exercise. Our study examined 178 community-dwelling stroke patients’ readiness to initiate an exercise program and their current exercise patterns. Using the Stages of Change Questionnaire, we found over 75% of respondents to be in the exercise preadoption stages of precontemplation, contemplation, or preparation. Moreover, participants classified in the postadoption stages of maintenance and action reported exercising significantly more than those in the preadoption stages. Individuals in the postadoption stages were also participating in significantly more sessions of strenuous or moderate exercise than those in the preadoption stages. It was concluded that the TTM is a valid theoretical framework to measure stroke patients’ readiness to participate in exercise.

The purpose of the present study was to compare conventional assessment on the modified Rankin Scale with assessment through a structured interview. Methods— Sixty-three patients with stroke 6 to 24 months previously were interviewed and graded independently on the modified Rankin Scale by 2 observers. These observers then underwent training in use of a structured interview for the scale that covered 5 areas of everyday function. Eight weeks after the first assessment, the same observers reassessed 58 of these patients using the structured interview. Results— Interrater reliability was measured with the &kgr; statistic (weighted with quadratic weights). For the scale applied conventionally, overall agreement between the 2 raters was 57% (&kgr;w=0.78); 1 rater assigned significantly lower grades than the other (P =0.048). On the structured interview, the overall agreement between raters was 78% (&kgr;w=0.93), and there was no overall difference between raters in grades assigned (P =0.17). Rankin grades from the conventional assessment and the structured interview were highly correlated, but there was significantly less disagreement between raters when the structured interview was used (P =0.004).

Methods— The primary caregivers of stroke patients registered in the North East Melbourne Stroke Incidence Study (NEMESIS) were interviewed at 3, 6, and 12 months after stroke, and the nature and amount of informal care provided were documented. The opportunity and replacement costs of informal care for all first-ever-in-a-lifetime strokes (excluding subarachnoid hemorrhages) that occurred in 1997 in Australia were estimated. Results— Among 3-month stroke survivors, 74% required assistance with activities of daily living and received informal care from family or friends. Two thirds of primary caregivers were women, and most primary caregivers (>90%) provided care during family or leisure time. Total first-year caregiver time costs for all first-ever-in-a-lifetime strokes were estimated to be A$21.7 million (opportunity cost approach) or A$42.5 million (replacement cost approach), and the present values of lifetime caregiver time costs were estimated to be A$171.4 million (opportunity cost approach) or A$331.8 million (replacement cost approach).

As an illustration of the breadth of its applicability, we present the basic construct of control theory—the discrepancy-reducing feedback loop—and discuss certain of its implications for theory in three separate areas of human psychology. In personality-s ocial, clinical, and health psychology, the construct proves to fit well with known phenomena and with the theories most recently developed to account for the phenomena.

This theory states that psychological procedures, whatever their form, alter the level and strength of self-efficacy. It is hypothesized that expectations of personal efficacy determine whether coping behavior will be initiated, how much effort will be expended, and how long it will be sustained in the face of obstacles and aversive experiences. Persistence in activities that are subjectively threatening but in fact relatively safe produces, through experiences of mastery, further enhancement of self-efficacy and corresponding reductions in defensive behavior. In the proposed model, expectations of personal efficacy are derived from four principal sources of information: performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states. The more dependable the experiential sources, the greater are the changes in perceived selfefficacy. A number of factors are identified as influencing the cognitive processing of efficacy information arising from enactive, vicarious, exhortative, and emotive sources. The differential power of diverse therapeutic procedures is analyzed in terms of the postulated cognitive mechanism of operation. Findings are reported from microanalyses of enactive, vicarious, and emotive modes of treatment that support the hypothesized relationship between perceived self-efficacy and behavioral changes.

We also contacted researchers for additional information.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised trials involving patients or carers of patients with a clinical diagnosis of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) where an information intervention was compared with standard care, or where information and another therapy were compared with the other therapy alone.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and methodological quality and extracted data. Primary outcomes were knowledge about stroke and stroke services, and impact on mood.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nSeventeen trials involving 1773 patient and 1058 carer participants were included. Eight evaluated a passive and nine an active information intervention. Meta-analyses showed a significant effect in favour of the intervention on patient and carer knowledge, one aspect of patient satisfaction, and patient depression scores. There was no significant effect on number of cases of anxiety or depression in patients, carer mood or satisfaction, or death. Qualitative analyses found no strong evidence of an effect on other outcomes. Post-hoc subgroup analyses showed that active information had a significantly greater effect than passive information on patient mood but not on other outcomes.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThere is evidence that information improves patient and carer knowledge of stroke, aspects of patient satisfaction, and reduces patient depression scores. However, the reduction in depression scores was small and probably clinically insignificant. Although the best way to provide information is still unclear there is some evidence that strategies that actively involve patients and carers and include planned follow up for clarification and reinforcement have a greater effect on patient mood."", 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 31, 'citationCount': 297, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2119123984', 'name': 'Jane Smith'}, {'authorId': '144233450', 'name': 'A.

Armitage and Conner (2001) identified its application in 154 different contexts. The Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen, 1988) assumes that the best prediction of behaviour is given by asking people if they are intending to behave in a certain way. Here we note that the intention will not express itself in behaviour if it is physically impossible to perform the behaviour or if unexpected barriers stand in the way. Assuming intention can explain behaviour, how can intention be explained?. According to Azjen, three determinants explain behavioural intention: 1. The attitude (opinions of oneself about the behaviour); 2. The subjective norm (opinions of others about the behaviour); 3. The perceived behavioural control (self-efficacy towards the behaviour).', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 51, 'citationCount': 7674, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145737174', 'name': 'M.

The death of the young wrestling promise Hana Kimura, in the year 2020, reactivated debates about the consequences that virtual attacks can generate for the mental health of the victims. This theoretical study presents, from a bibliographical survey (physical libraries and online platforms), the general objective of pointing out the psychological impacts of cyberbullying, based on the story of a fatal victim (Hana Kimura). The specific objectives are: to define cyberbullying, considering its difference from bullying and the psychological consequences on the victims; to present the story of Hana Kimura, including some data from her childhood and especially her participation in the reality show Terrace House: Tokyo (a period that marks her last months of life); to understand, based on CBT, the processes that lead victims of cyberbullying to depression and suicide, based on the speeches and behaviors presented by Hana.",2022,11,0,{'name': 'Psicologia e Saúde em Debate'},"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector':

Methods: Immortalized human gingival fibroblast and human fetal osteoblast cell lines were cultured, separately, in 96-well plates. After reaching confluency, they were exposed to H 2 O 2 solutions at 16 different concentrations ranging between 0.05 µg/ml and 10 µg/ml for 1 h, 24 h or 72 h in triplicate assays (n=24), using culture media alone as the control. Cell viability was measured by previously established fluorometric methods, using a resazurin-based assay, and cell morphology by using an inverted microscope with integrated phase-contrast optics. Data were statistically analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s and Dunnet’s post hoc tests and Pearson correlation coefficient (r), as appropriate ( α =0.05). Results: H 2 O 2 induced a decrease in cell viability to below 50% in fibroblasts and around 50% in osteoblasts, in all tested concentrations after 1h exposure, and a decrease in cell viability to above 70% after 24 h and 72 h (P<0.05). A significant negative correlation was detected between H 2 O 2 and cell viability at 1 h and 72 h for osteoblast (r=-0.471) and HGF (r=-0.12) cells, respectively. The cell morphology analysis showed cell detachment and lower cell density, in agreement with these findings. Conclusions: H 2 O 2 induced cell alterations with moderate to severe cytotoxic effects in osteoblast and gingival fibroblasts.

The literature has shown that there is no consensus on the concept of cyberbullying, but there are arguments that advocate its specificity and differentiation vis-à-vis bullying, (it can occur at any moment and without a physically demarcated space; it can be disseminated globally, the length of permanence of the offensive posts is undetermined). As for the gender issue associated with this practice, a reductionist bias was observed in the debate, indicating differences based on an alleged technological superiority of boys. The reviewed studies show that both victims and those who practice cyberbullying undergo negative experiences in their psychological and behavioral health, where school dropout may also occur, along with social isolation, depression, suicidal ideation and suicide.

The scope of cyberbullying is vast, in terms of means as well as content. It includes bullying through text messages, phone calls, e-mails, instant messengers, social media platforms, or in chat rooms. It varies from posting hurtful words, derogatory comments, posting fake information on public forums or blogs, hacking accounts for personal vendetta to rape or death threats. It can be as ruinous as revenge porn, which is posting sexually explicit images or videos of a person on the Internet, typically by a former sexual partner, without the consent of the subject and in order to cause them distress or embarrassment. The impact of such acts can be catastrophic, especially for young adults, who feel so embarrassed and humiliated that they cannot imagine surviving the next morning, and end up taking extreme steps which include harm to self and occasionally, others. It deeply reflects the real-world problems arising out of the virtual cyberspace. No longer limited to schoolyards or street corners, it has now moved to WhatsApp, Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook, etc., where online polls are conducted to bodyshame the victim and groups are made to spread false rumours or share morphed pictures and videos, to a rather vast audience with the power of the Internet, which would not have been so easily possible in the physical world otherwise.

This study was conducted to address that knowledge gap, based on insights from a panel of TD experts. Methods: In 2020, six neurologists, three psychiatrists, and three psychiatric nurse practitioners participated in individual semistructured interviews about in-person and virtual TD assessment and management in their practices. Two virtual roundtables were then conducted to consolidate findings from these interviews. Results: The panel agreed that despite the challenges of virtual TD assessment (e.g., technology issues, difficulty observing entire body, inability to conduct thorough neurological examinations), telehealth can offer benefits (e.g., fewer missed appointments, reduced time/cost, easier access to family/caregiver feedback). The panel also agreed that telehealth should be combined with periodic in-person visits, and they recommended an in-person TD assessment within 6 months before the first virtual visit and at least one in-person assessment every 6 months thereafter. Additional best practices for TD telehealth included implementing video, involving family/caregivers, and providing preappointment instructions to help patients prepare their technology and environment. Conclusions: Telehealth is not a substitute for in-person visits but can be a helpful complement to in-person clinical care. Clinicians can optimize virtual visits in patients at risk of TD by using targeted questions to identify TD and evaluate its impact and by providing education about approved TD

An observational survey study, Real-World Tele-Health Evaluation of Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) Symptoms Communication/Observation Procedure Evaluation in Outpatient Clinical Settings (TeleSCOPE), was conducted to better understand how this shift affected the evaluation of drug-induced movement disorders (DIMDs), including TD. Methods Twenty-minute online quantitative surveys were conducted with neurology and psychiatry specialists (physicians and advanced practice providers) who met the following criteria: ≥3 years of practice with ≥70% of time spent in a clinic; prescribed a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor or benztropine for DIMD at least once in the past 6 months; and conducted telehealth visits with ≥15% of their patients from December 2020 to January 2021. Results Respondents included 277 clinicians (neurology = 109, psychiatry = 168). Telehealth visits increased after COVID-19, with significantly greater increases in psychiatry vs neurology: phone (38% vs 21%); video (49% vs 42%). Across both specialties, top drivers/prompts for further DIMD evaluation were as follows: mention of tics or movements by family members or others (86%); trouble with gait, falls, walking, or standing (82%); difficulty swallowing or eating (74%); and difficulty writing, using phone, computer (71%). However, in the 6 months prior to June 2021, virtual evaluation, diagnosis, and monitoring of patients were challenging. For both specialties, many at-risk patients (ie, taking a dopamine receptor blocking agent) were not evaluated for DIMDs via video-based visits (psychiatry = 45%, neurology = 70%) or phone-only visits (psychiatry = 76%, neurology = 91%). Clinicians listed evaluation of gait/falls/walking/standing as the most challenging aspect of virtual assessment for phone-only visits (psychiatry = 53%, neurology = 57%) and video-based visits (psychiatry = 26%, neurology = 31%). Additional challenges included limited access to computers, insufficient training for clinicians and staff, and greater difficulty obtaining reimbursements (especially for complex telehealth visits). Patients without a participating caregiver, along with lower functioning patients, were at the highest risk of a missed DIMD diagnosis. Conclusions During the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth significantly reduced clinicians’ ability or willingness to evaluate, diagnose, and monitor DIMDs. Clinicians stated multiple factors increased the risk of a missed or incorrect diagnosis. Challenges to optimal telehealth effectiveness included lack of patient access to computers, need for more clinician/staff training, lack of awareness of coverage, need for sufficient fee reimbursement. In-person evaluation continues to be the gold standard for assessing and treating DIMDs. However, if telehealth is necessary, the use of specific questions and directions is recommended for better communication and more accurate assessments.

Background: Under emergency coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic regulations, Medicare granted temporary payment parity with in-person visits for audio-only (telephone) telemedicine visits. This policy was designed to expand telemedicine to patients without camera-equipped devices and broadband internet. However, audio-only telemedicine use has been substantial. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore whether the rate of audio-only telemedicine during the pandemic is related to patient access to technology or provider behavior. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of the Summer and Fall 2020 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey coronavirus disease 2019 supplements, using multivariable logistic models and accounting for complex survey design. Subjects: A total of 3375 participants in the summer survey and 2633 participants in the fall 2020 were offered a telemedicine visit to replace a scheduled in-person visit by their usual care provider. Measures: We compared beneficiaries who were exclusively offered audio-only telemedicine to beneficiaries who were offered video telemedicine or both audio and video. Results: We found that among Medicare beneficiaries who were offered telemedicine to replace a scheduled in-person appointment, ~35% were exclusively offered audio-only. 65.8% of beneficiaries exclusively offered audio-only reported having a smartphone/tablet and home internet. After controlling for personal access to technology, Hispanic [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=2.09, P<0.001], dually eligible (AOR=1.63, P=0.002), nonprimary English speaking (AOR=1.64, P<0.001), and nonmetro beneficiaries (AOR=1.71, P=0.003) were more likely to be offered audio-only during July−November 2020. Conclusions: These findings suggest audio-only telemedicine use during the pandemic is only partially related to patient access to technology.

Aims: To capture the experiences of caregivers who assisted individuals with abnormal involuntary movements that were confirmed by clinicians as being consistent with TD. Methods: Qualified (nonpaid) caregivers were invited to complete a questionnaire that included the following: caregivers’ sociodemographic characteristics, their perceptions about the impact of abnormal involuntary movements on patients, and the impact of these movements on themselves (caregivers). Results: Of the 41 participating caregivers, 25 (61.0%) were women, 20 (48.8%) were employed full time or part time, and 35 (85.4%) were family members or friends. Based on responses from caregivers who noticed patients’ abnormal involuntary movements and were caring for individuals who also noticed those movements, 48.0% of patients had “a lot” of severity in ≥1 body region and 76.0% had abnormal involuntary movements in ≥2 regions. Caregiver ratings were significantly correlated with patient ratings (but not with clinician ratings) for maximum severity of abnormal involuntary movements and the number of affected regions (both p <.05).

The goal of the symposium was to explore future trends in these domains. We also discussed how the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic accelerated ongoing changes in healthcare. We explored what is on the horizon in these fields and how these changes might affect care delivery in the future. Specifically, we discussed the “Clinic of the Future” with clinical teams from genetics and metabolism, orthopedic surgery, and primary care while our telehealth discussion involved genetics and metabolism, psychiatry, and telerehabilitation. As one example, wearable technology could be adopted among primary care practices and drive a shift in outpatient care from center-based care to patient-based care. We also examined technological innovations in physical exam instruments, gait analysis, imaging integration, and cast technology that could modernize the orthopedic surgery clinic. Telemedicine has rapidly expanded among all fields of medicine, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, and has spurred innovation to improve the effectiveness of virtual physician visits. The development of technology to improve the virtual physical exam, during a telemedicine visit, further increases the utility of online appointments and increases access to care in all specialties. The incorporation of photogrammetry technology, in genetics and metabolism dysmorphology exams, will offer standardized tracking of patients that could improve diagnosis and treatment. Psychiatry has found nearly equal efficacy in diagnosis and treatment with telehealth visits and the additional benefit of gaining insight in the setting of the patients’ home. Robotics has become increasingly common in rehabilitation, which can now incorporate a gaming experience that can be remotely updated and increase engagement and adherence in pediatric patients.

Use of measures to assess the functional impact of TD in routine clinical practice is lacking. To address this gap, an advisory panel of experts in psychiatry and movement disorder neurology was convened to develop consensus recommendations on assessment of the impact of TD on patients’ functioning that can be used in clinical practice. Methods An advisory panel provided recommendations using an iterative process, beginning with a narrative literature review regarding current practices for assessing the impact of TD in clinical settings. A detailed summary was generated, and the advisory panel provided comments about the content and answered questions about assessing TD impact in clinical practice. The panelists’ responses were discussed during a virtual meeting held on August 28, 2020. A second meeting on September 25, 2020, focused on developing and refining recommendations for assessment of the impact of TD in clinical practice. At the conclusion of the second meeting, general consensus was reached on all recommendation statements. Results As part of routine clinical practice, it is imperative to assess the impact of TD on the patient’s life to help guide treatment decisions. Key domains for assessing the overall impact of TD include social, physical, vocational, and psychological functioning and the impact of TD on the underlying psychiatric disorder. Assessment of TD impact should be performed at every patient visit. Impact assessments should include consultation with patients, caregivers, and family members. Shared decision-making to initiate TD treatment should consider impact.

Misdiagnosis can lead to incorrect interventions with suboptimal or even deleterious results. To aid in the identification and differentiation of TD in the psychiatric practice setting, we review its clinical features and movement phenomenology, as well as those of other antipsychotic-induced movement disorders, with accompanying links to illustrative videos. Exposure to dopamine receptor blocking agents (DRBAs) such as antipsychotics or antiemetics is associated with a spectrum of movement disorders including TD. The differential diagnosis of TD is based on history of DRBA exposure, recent discontinuation or dose reduction of a DRBA, and movement phenomenology. Common diagnostic challenges are the abnormal behaviors and dyskinesias associated with advanced age or chronic mental illness, and other movement disorders associated with DRBA therapy, such as akathisia, parkinsonian tremor, and tremor related to use of mood stabilizing agents (eg, lithium, divalproex). Duration of exposure may help rule out acute drug-induced syndromes such as acute dystonia or acute/subacute akathisia. Another important consideration is the potential for TD to present together with other drug-induced movement disorders (eg, parkinsonism, parkinsonian tremor, and postural tremor from mood stabilizers) in the same patient, which can complicate both diagnosis and management. After documentation of the phenomenology, severity, and distribution of TD movements, treatment options should be reviewed with the patient and caregivers.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 85, 'citationCount': 16, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5772802', 'name': 'R.

In response to the virus, many clinics across the world abruptly closed their doors to persons with Parkinson's disease. Fortunately, a niche care model, telemedicine—first described in this journal a generation ago—emerged as the dominant means of providing care. As we adjust to a new normal, we should focus future care not on clinics but on patients. Their needs, guided by clinicians, should determine how care is delivered, whether in the clinic, at home, remotely, or by some combination. Within this patient‐centered approach, telemedicine is an attractive care option but not a complete replacement for in‐person consultations, which are valuable for specific problems and for those who have access. Now that many clinicians and patients have gained exposure to telemedicine, we can better appreciate its advantages (eg, convenience) and disadvantages (eg, restricted examination). We can also create a new future that utilizes the Internet, video conferencing, smartphones, and sensors. This future will bring many clinicians to one patient, connect individual experts to countless patients, use widely available devices to facilitate diagnosis, and apply novel technologies to measure the disease in new ways.

Because of the serious and potentially irreversible nature of TD, accurate diagnosis is crucial. However, diagnosing TD can be challenging, since the subtle and often fluctuating symptoms can be easily mistaken for symptoms of mental illness or other side effects. Although the risk of developing TD in relation to treatment with second-generation antipsychotics is lower than that associated with first-generation antipsychotics, the risk still exists and may be greater than once believed. Clinicians prescribe antipsychotics for a variety of illnesses and may underestimate the possibility of a patient developing TD, thus missing early signs of the disorder.

This is the first report of long-term effects in adults with tardive dyskinesia.\n\n\nMETHODS\nParticipants with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or a mood disorder who completed the 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled period of KINECT 3 were eligible to enter the 42-week valbenazine extension (VE) period and subsequent 4-week washout period. The extension phase was conducted from December 16, 2014, to August 3, 2016. Participants who received placebo and entered the VE period were re-randomized 1:1 to valbenazine 80 or 40 mg while others continued valbenazine at the KINECT 3 dose. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and scales for suicidal ideation/behavior, treatment-emergent akathisia or parkinsonism, and psychiatric symptoms. Efficacy assessments included the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and Clinical Global Impression of Change-Tardive Dyskinesia (CGI-TD).\n\n\nRESULTS\n198 participants entered the VE period, 124 (62.6%) completed treatment (week 48), and 121 (61.1%) completed the follow-up visit after washout (week 52). During the VE period, 69.2% of participants had ≥ 1 TEAE, 14.6% had a serious TEAE, and 15.7% discontinued due to a TEAE. During washout, 13.1% of participants experienced a TEAE. No apparent risk for suicidal ideation or behavior was found. Long-term valbenazine treatment did not appear to induce or worsen akathisia or parkinsonism. Participants generally remained psychiatrically stable during the study. AIMS and CGI-TD measures indicated sustained tardive dyskinesia improvement, with scores returning toward baseline after 4 weeks of valbenazine washout.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe long-term safety and tolerability of valbenazine were generally favorable, and maintenance of treatment effect was apparent with both doses during this long-term study.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02274558.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 20, 'citationCount': 73, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144874642', 'name': 'S.

We assessed the feasibility and benefits of a one-time consultation between a remote Parkinson Disease (PD) specialist and an individual with PD at home on a larger scale. Methods: We conducted a multicenter noncontrolled cohort of virtual visits administered over videoconferencing between remote PD specialists and individuals with PD in their home. Specialists performed a patient history and a PD-specific physical examination and provided recommendations to patients and their local physicians. The primary outcome measures were feasibility, as measured by the proportion of visits completed as scheduled, and the 6-month change in quality of life, as measured by the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire 39. Additional outcomes included satisfaction with visits and interest in future virtual visits. Results: A total of 277 participants from 5 states enrolled, 258 participants completed virtual visits with 14 different physicians, and 91% of visits were completed as scheduled. No improvement in quality of life was observed at 6 months (0.4-point improvement; 95% confidence interval −1.5 to 0.6; p = 0.39). Overall satisfaction with virtual visits was high among physicians (94% satisfied or very satisfied) and patients (94% satisfied or very satisfied), and 74% of participants were interested in receiving future care via virtual visits. Conclusions: Providing specialty care remotely into the homes of individuals with PD is feasible, but a one-time visit did not improve quality of life. Satisfaction with the visits was high among physicians and patients, who were interested in receiving such care in the future.

Valbenazine (NBI-98854) is a novel, highly selective vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitor that demonstrated favorable efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in phase 2 studies. This phase 3 study further evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of valbenazine as a treatment for tardive dyskinesia.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThis 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or a mood disorder who had moderate or severe tardive dyskinesia. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to once-daily placebo, valbenazine at 40 mg/day, or valbenazine at 80 mg/day. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline to week 6 in the 80 mg/day group compared with the placebo group on the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) dyskinesia score (items 1-7), as assessed by blinded central AIMS video raters. Safety assessments included adverse event monitoring, laboratory tests, ECG, and psychiatric measures.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe intent-to-treat population included 225 participants, of whom 205 completed the study. Approximately 65% of participants had schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and 85.5% were receiving concomitant antipsychotics. Least squares mean change from baseline to week 6 in AIMS dyskinesia score was -3.2 for the 80 mg/day group, compared with -0.1 for the placebo group, a significant difference. AIMS dyskinesia score was also reduced in the 40 mg/day group (-1.9 compared with -0.1). The incidence of adverse events was consistent with previous studies.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOnce-daily valbenazine significantly improved tardive dyskinesia in participants with underlying schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or mood disorder.

Methods: A cohort of 16 patients with Parkinson’s disease residing at one of 2 locations of a multi-facility continuous care retirement organization were seen virtually in follow-up over a 3-year period by Telehealth Services at a large, academic, tertiary care hospital in southeastern Pennsylvania. The data collected during that period, studied retrospectively, included demographic information, number of telehealth visits, and UPDRS scores obtained at each visit. Satisfaction and potential cost savings were also reviewed. Results: UPDRS scores declined over the period of observation, from a range of 18-60 at study start to 28-72 at study end. Actual cost savings are difficult to define; however, the cost per telehealth visit at $117.30 was often lower than the facility’s average cost for transporting patients to a visit in the neurologist’s office. Patients, families, subspecialists, and the nursing staff expressed uniformly high satisfaction with telehealth.

Methods Two residents and a medical student were trained in the use of the BPRS and the AIMS. These “key raters” then rated 21 patients before and 28 patients after the ward psychiatrists had one retraining session on the BPRS. These raters' results were compared with the ward psychiatrists' results before and after the BPRS retraining as well as with the ward psychiatrists' annual AIMS ratings. Results The key raters had high correlations among themselves (0.85 for total BPRS and a mean of 0.83 for individual BPRS items), but the correlations with the ward psychiatrists' ratings were very low (0.17 for total BPRS and a mean of 0.37 for individual BPRS items), and those correlations improved only slightly after the retraining of the ward psychiatrists (0.33 for total BPRS and a mean of 0.41 for individual BPRS items). Ward psychiatrists both missed tardive dyskinesia and labelled parkinsonism as tardive dyskinesia. Conclusions The BPRS and AIMS are useful, practical rating scales, but if they are to be used routinely in clinical care, users must be regularly trained and retrained and rating performance evaluated.

To date, there is little research to document the effect of telemedicine (TM) on physician-patient communication. Objective The objectives of this study are to measure and describe verbal and nonverbal communication during clinical TM consultations and to compare TM with in-person (IP) consultations in terms of the quality of physician-patient communication. Methods Veteran patients (n = 19) requiring pulmonary medicine consultations were enrolled into the study. The study group included 11 patients from the Iron Mountain Veterans Affairs Hospital (VAMC) remote site. Patients had individual TM consultations with a pulmonary physician at the Milwaukee VAMC hub site. A control group of 8 patients had IP consultations with a pulmonary physician at the Milwaukee VAMC. Video recordings of medical consultations were coded for patient-physician verbal and nonverbal communication patterns using the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS). Results There were no differences in the length of TM consultations (22.2 minutes) and IP consultations (21.9 minutes). Analysis of visit dialogue indicated that the ratio of physician to patient talk was 1.45 for TM and 1.13 for IP consultations, indicating physician verbal dominance. Physicians were more likely to use orientation statements during IP consultations (P = .047). There were greater requests for repetition from patients during TM consultations (P = .034), indicating perceptual difficulties. Conclusions The study findings indicate differences between TM and IP consultations in terms of physician-patient communication style. Results suggest that, when comparing TM and IP consultations in terms of physician-patient communication, TM visits are more physician centered, with the physician controlling the dialogue and the patient taking a relatively passive role. Further research is needed to determine whether these differences are significant and whether they have relevance in terms of health outcomes and patient satisfaction with care.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 17, 'citationCount': 96, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1716190', 'name': 'Z.

The Veterans Health Administration is in a unique position to deliver specialty care to rural Veterans because it is mandated to deliver medical care to all eligible Veterans regardless of residence. To accomplish this, the VHA developed large national telehealth networks that provided over 1 million episodes of care in 2012. We investigated whether clinical video telehealth technologies can provide quality efficient neurologic follow-up care to Veterans living in the rural southwest United States.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nVeterans with chronic neurologic conditions living remotely in New Mexico, southern Colorado, eastern Arizona, and western Texas were offered follow-up teleneurology care at 11 rural community-based outpatient clinics following initial evaluation at the Albuquerque, NM, neurology outpatient clinic.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOver a 2-year period, 87% of 354 consecutive patients returned a performance improvement satisfaction questionnaire. Ninety percent of the patients were fully satisfied with their visit, and 92% felt teleneurology saved them time and money. We calculated an average time savings of 5\u2009h and 325 miles driven, plus at least $48,000 total cost savings. Ninety-five percent reported they wanted to continue their neurologic care by teleneurology.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study confirms earlier pilot studies of successful follow-up care through telemedicine. Our patients were highly satisfied with the convenience and quality of their teleneurology visit, and the neurology providers were convinced that neurologic care to both teleneurology and clinic follow-up patients was equivalent. Teleneurology to rural Veterans can provide quality neurologic care and overwhelming patient satisfaction and save considerable time and money.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 57, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2636535', 'name': 'L.

A variety of animal species, including peridomestic rodents and dogs, can be infected with different strains of leptospirosis. Humans contract leptospirosis via exposure to water or soil contaminated with the urine of infected animals. Due to the unavailability of safe and effective vaccines, preventive strategies mainly focus on minimizing human exposure to contaminated environment. In marginalized communities, this approach is ineffective due to infrastructure deficiencies and the difficulties in implementing sanitation and hygiene practices. Moreover, continuing expansion of urban slums worldwide will likely contribute to the increase in outbreaks of leptospirosis. Effective prevention of leptospirosis outbreaks will therefore require a thorough understanding of Leptospira transmission dynamics in impoverished, high-density settings. We developed the agent-based model MHMSLeptoDy to investigate Leptospira dynamics in a realistic, in silico high-density community of rodents, dogs, and human hosts, and two host-adapted Leptospira strains. Virtual explorations using MHMSLeptoDy were undertaken to evaluate alternate interventions and to assess the zoonotic transmission risk of leptospirosis. A key finding from model explorations is that rodents are the main contributors of rodent-adapted as well as dog-adapted strains in the environment, while dogs play an important role in distributing the rodent-adapted strain. Assessment of alternate leptospirosis control strategies using model iterations revealed that dog vaccination and rodent control interventions had the most impact on lowering human outbreak probability. Our open-source, customizable agent-based model provides a sophisticated mechanism to quantitatively evaluate nuanced intervention strategies and inform the design of rational, locally relevant leptospirosis control programs.",2022,28,0,{'name': 'bioRxiv'},"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-4.539600849151611, -6.080910682678223, 0.4666585922241211, 10.589689254760742, -2.082308530807495,

Effective prevention is urgently needed as the drivers of disease transmission continue to intensify. The key challenge has been developing a widely applicable vaccine that protects against the >300 serovars that can cause leptospirosis. Live attenuated mutants are enticing vaccine candidates and poorly explored in the field. We evaluated a recently characterized motility-deficient mutant lacking the expression of a flagellar protein, FcpA. Although the fcpA- mutant has lost its ability to cause disease, transient bacteremia was observed. In two animal models, immunization with a single dose of the fcpA- mutant was sufficient to induce a robust anti-protein antibodies response that promoted protection against infection with different pathogenic Leptospira species.

Nevertheless, scepticism about the safety and importance of vaccines is increasing in human and in veterinary medicine. Although owner attitudes towards vaccination have been investigated in cats, there are no similar studies in dogs. The goals of this study were therefore to investigate the vaccination status of dogs in Germany, to determine owner compliance with vaccination and to identify factors that play a role in owners’ decisions to have their dogs vaccinated. Methods Data were collected from August 2018 to February 2019 using an online survey targeting dog owners in Germany. A total of 3,881 questionnaires were evaluated, and factors associated with the vaccination status of dogs were determined by a linear logistic regression model using Akaike information criterion. Cohen's kappa statistic was used to evaluate agreement between questionnaire and 340 vaccination passports submitted voluntarily by owners. Results A total of 46.8% (n = 1,818/3,881) of dogs were vaccinated with core vaccines according to current guidelines with the lowest vaccination rate for leptospirosis (50.1%; n = 1,941/3,874). Dog’s age (16 weeks to 15 months) (odds ratio (OR): 3.08; 95% CI: 2.05–4.68), type (working dog) (OR: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.22–3.53) and travelling abroad within previous 36 months (OR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.12–2.96) had the strongest ‘positive’ association with the vaccination status. Recommendation from a veterinarian not to vaccinate against leptospirosis had the strongest ‘negative’ association (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.04–0.18). Conclusion The study revealed a need for improvement in vaccination compliance because of inadequate vaccination coverage, especially for leptospirosis, in dogs. Factors influencing owner compliance were numerous. Vaccination recommendations made by the veterinarian had a strong association with the vaccination status and should be used to increase canine vaccination rates."", 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 53, 'citationCount': 15, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1914551892', 'name': 'Simone Eschle'}, {'authorId': '143707169', 'name': 'K.

Rain and floods are considered the main risk factors for leptospirosis and several outbreaks have been reported following extreme weather events. In such situations, one possible intervention to prevent leptospirosis cases in high-risk groups is the use of chemoprophylaxis. However, not enough evidence of its effect is available. The objectives of this study were to review the literature on the current practices of chemoprophylaxis for leptospirosis and to explore, using a mathematical model, how various chemoprophylaxis scenarios may affect the progression of a leptospirosis outbreak. Twenty-six peer-reviewed publications were selected (10 quantitative studies, two systematic reviews and 14 articles of other types). Oral doxycycline was the most used antibiotic for chemoprophylaxis of leptospirosis. Post-exposure prophylaxis was assessed in four studies following a natural disaster. Although evidence of the effectiveness of post-exposure prophylaxis is inconsistent, the direction of association supported a protective effect for morbidity and mortality. The theoretical model showed how the assumed benefit of chemoprophylaxis was influenced by the time and rate of administration. Future models should consider the heterogeneity of affected communities, improved estimates of the effect of chemoprophylaxis on leptospirosis infection and disease, as well as potential detrimental impacts. Additional research is critical to provide clear evidence-based recommendations for leptospirosis control during an outbreak. The results of this study suggest that chemoprophylaxis may provide some protection in reducing the number of leptospirosis cases after a high-risk exposure; however, the effective benefit may depend on a variety of factors such as the timing and coverage of prophylaxis.

Furthermore, the relative importance of different host species and modes can itself be dynamic, with potential for switches and shifts in host range and/or transmission mode in response to changing selective pressures, such as those imposed by disease control interventions. The epidemiology of such multi-host, multi-mode infectious agents thereby can involve a multi-faceted community of definitive and intermediate/secondary hosts or vectors, often together with infectious stages in the environment, all of which may represent potential targets, as well as specific challenges, particularly where disease elimination is proposed. Here, we explore, focusing on examples from both human and animal pathogen systems, why and how we should aim to disentangle and quantify the relative importance of multi-host multi-mode infectious agent transmission dynamics under contrasting conditions, and ultimately, how this can be used to help achieve efficient and effective disease control.

Methodology/Principal Findings Our study, conducted in Salvador, Brazil, established the average load of leptospires in positive kidneys to be 5.9 x 106 per mL (range 3.1-8.2 x106) genome equivalents (GEq), similar to the 6.1 x 106 per ml (range 2.2-9.4 x106) average obtained from paired urines, with a significant positive correlation (R2=0.78) between the two. Based on bivariate and multivariate modeling, we found with both kidney and urine samples that leptospiral loads increased with the age of rats (based on the index of body length to mass), MAT titer and the presence of wounding/scars, and varied with site of capture. Some associations were modified by sex but trends were apparent. Combining with data on the demographic properties and prevalence of leptospiral carriage in rat populations in Salvador, we estimated that daily leptospiral loads shed in the urine of a population of 82 individuals exceeded 9.1 x 1010 leptospires.

The secondary infection rate was 2.3 times higher than that of primary infection rate (71.7 and 31.1 infections per 1,000 person-years, respectively). Male gender (OR 2.88; 95% CI 1.40–5.91) and lower per capita household income (OR 0.54; 95% CI, 0.30–0.98 for an increase of $1 per person per day) were independent risk factors for primary infection. In contrast, the 15–34 year age group (OR 10.82, 95% CI 1.38–85.08), and proximity of residence to an open sewer (OR 0.95; 0.91–0.99 for an increase of 1 m distance) were significant risk factors for secondary infection. Conclusions/Significance This study found that slum residents had high risk (>3% per year) for acquiring a Leptospira infection. Re-infection is a frequent event and occurs in regions of slum settlements that are in proximity to open sewers. Effective prevention of leptospirosis will therefore require interventions that address the infrastructure deficiencies that contribute to repeated exposures among slum inhabitants.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 50, 'citationCount': 144, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2092945343', 'name': 'R.

However, few multidisciplinary studies addressing the zoonotic pattern of this disease were conducted so far. Here, pig, deer and dog samples were collected. Analyses were performed using molecular detection and genotyping. Serological analyses were also performed for dogs. Our results suggest that deer are a reservoir of L. borgpetersenii Hardjobovis and pigs a reservoir of L. interrogans Pomona. Interestingly, 4.4% of dogs were renal carriers of Leptospira. In dog populations, MAT results confirmed the circulation of the same Leptospira serogroups involved in human cases. Even if not reservoirs, dogs might be of significance in human contamination by making an epidemiological link between wild or feral reservoirs and humans. Dogs could bring pathogens back home, shedding Leptospira via their urine and in turn increasing the risk of human contamination. We propose to consider dog as a vector, particularly in rural areas where seroprevalence is significantly higher than urban areas.

 Since the mid-1990s, a significant scientific literature has evolved regarding the mental/physical health outcomes from the use of what we now refer to as Clinical Virtual Reality (VR). While the preponderance of clinical work with VR has focused on building immersive virtual worlds for treating anxiety disorders with exposure therapy, providing distracting immersive experiences for acute pain management, and supporting physical rehabilitation with game-based interactive content, there are other emerging areas that have extended the impact of VR in healthcare. One such area involves the recent technological advances that have led to the evolution of intelligent virtual human (VH) agents. VH representations can now be designed to perceive and act in a 3D virtual world, engage in face-to-face spoken dialogues with real users, and in some cases, can exhibit human-like emotional reactions. We have reported positive outcomes from studies using VHs in the role of virtual patients for training novice clinicians, as job interview/social skill trainers for persons on the autism spectrum, and as online health care support agents with university students and military veterans. The computational capacity now exists to deliver similar VH interactions by way of mobile device technology. This capability can support the “anywhere/anytime” availability of VH characters as agents for engaging users with clinical care information and could provide opportunities for improving access to care and emotional support for childhood cancer survivors (CCS). With a survivorship rate of over 83%, CCS are living longer, with estimates indicating that there will be over 500,000 CCS in the United States by 2020. However, CCS are at high risk for late effects of treatment, including recurring or secondary cancers, unhealthy lifestyle, disengagement from care, and the lack of the social support that has been shown to be vital for health and well-being. The majority of CCS will have at least one chronic condition by age 40. Moreover, existing initiatives to serve the needs of CCS have had limited success as these populations can be hard to reach and difficult to engage. We conducted two preliminary studies to inform development and evaluate the usefulness of a mobile app that included VH interaction and guidance to help CCS navigate survivorship and maintain health. In Study 1, two rounds of focus group interviews were conducted with 15 CCS aged 13-30 years. In Study 2, a pilot VH-driven app was developed using the information collected in Study 1. The app was downloaded, tested, and evaluated for one week by 60 CCS between the ages of 13-29 years. The results indicated that dynamic, accessible, engaging and survivor-focused VH approaches could address the needs of young, “digitally native” CCS. We will present a brief introduction to the clinical use of VHs within the VR context (Rizzo), followed by a discussion of a new mobile-enabled VH project designed to promote access to health care information and emotional support in young adult CCS (Spruijt-Metz).

43,77,9b29230de6d01cfa5824da093a778ce3f196d836,Virtual Reality: A New Treatment Paradigm for Disorders of Gut-Brain Interaction?,"Disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBIs), previously called functional bowel disorders, are prevalent, reduce patients' quality of life, and impose a significant negative economic impact on the health care system. Functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are 2 of the most common DGBIs. An overlying, and in many cases unifying, symptom for many of these disorders is the presence of abdominal pain. Chronic abdominal pain can be difficult to treat, as many antinociceptive agents are associated with side effects that limit their use and other agents may only partially improve, but not completely relieve, all aspects of the pain. Novel therapies to alleviate chronic pain and the other symptoms that characterize DGBIs are thus needed. Virtual reality (VR), a technology that immerses patients in a multisensory experience, has been shown to relieve pain in burn victims and other instances of somatic pain. Two recent novel studies have demonstrated that VR has the potential to play an important role in the treatment of functional dyspepsia and IBS. This article examines the development of VR, its role in the treatment of somatic and visceral pain, and its potential position in the treatment of DGBIs.",2023,0,2,"{'name': 'Gastroenterology &

44,78,82c9907caeac902030ceff7dd6de83547665bcb2,Disparities in Use of Virtual Primary Care During the Early COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic increased the use of virtual health care. However, certain factors may disparately affect some patients' utilization of virtual care. Associations between age, racial categories (White or Black), and socioeconomic disadvantage were evaluated during the early COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional retrospective study included adult patients with virtual or in-person primary care encounters at a large, midwestern hospital system with widespread urban and suburban offices between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. Virtual visits included synchronous video and telephone visits and asynchronous patient portal E-visits. Chi-squared tests and multivariable logistic analysis assessed the associations between ages and racial categories, and area deprivation index with the use of virtual versus in-person primary care. Results: Of 72,153 patient encounters, 43.0% were virtual visits, 54.6% were White patients, and 45.4% were Black. Across equivalent age ranges, black patients were slightly less likely to utilize virtual care than similarly aged White patients, but not consistently across virtual modalities. Women were more likely to use virtual care across all modalities, and individuals >65 years were more likely to use telephone visits and less likely to use video and E-visits, regardless of race. Patients residing in areas with the greatest socioeconomic advantage were more likely to utilize video and E-visits. Conclusions: Differential patterns of utilization emerged across racial categories and age ranges, suggesting that racial disparities are exacerbated depending upon patient age and mode of utilization.",2023,17,2,{'name': 'Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association'},"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-5.57688570022583,

Dispositional risk tolerance was measured at Wave 1 and participants' anxiety level and self-report implementation of 10 COVID actions was assessed in each wave. Autoregressive multinomial regression models were estimated to assess the unique contribution of risk tolerance to the longitudinal change of participants' implementation of COVID actions.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results revealed a high implementation rate for protective actions when Australia had a peak in the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequently declined with the easing threat of the pandemic. Individuals' dispositional risk tolerance significantly predicted transition to, and endorsement of, protective actions. Participants who had low risk tolerance were more likely to remain at the state of implementing COVID-19 measures than being in, or transitioning to, other states.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe findings suggest that when encouraging protective actions, governments and public authorities should acknowledge variability in the community in responding to risk and consider measures in addition to risk messaging to encourage protective actions among individuals with a high level of risk tolerance.

We used multivariate logistic regression to examine the association between the choice of video versus telephone and patient sociodemographic characteristics and technology access among patient-initiated primary care telemedicine visits scheduled online from March to October 2020. Among 978 272 patient-scheduled primary care telemedicine visits, 39% were video visits. Patients of Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity, or living in low socioeconomic status or low internet access neighborhoods were less likely to schedule video visits. Patients 65 years or older, with prior video visit experience or mobile portal access, or visiting their own personal provider were more likely to schedule video visits. While video adoption was substantial in all patient groups examined, differences in telemedicine choice suggest the persistence of a digital divide, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a telephone telemedicine option.', 'year': 2022, 'referenceCount': 16, 'citationCount': 9, 'authors': [{'authorId': '78871858', 'name': 'Jie Huang'}, {'authorId': '2624738', 'name': 'I.

The aim of this rapid review was to identify how this ‘digital divide’ was manifest during the first wave of the pandemic and highlight any areas which might be usefully addressed for the remainder of the pandemic and beyond. Design Rapid review and narrative synthesis. Data sources The major medical databases including PubMed and Embase and Google Scholar were searched alongside a hand search of bibliographies. Eligibility criteria Original research papers available in English which described studies conducted during wave 1 of the COVID pandemic and reported between 1 March 2020 and 31 July 2021. Results The search was described using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and identified nine studies. The results are presented within a refined framework describing the three key domains of the digital divide: (1) digital access, within which one study described continuing issues with internet connectivity among vulnerable patients in the UK; (2) digital literacy, where seven studies described how ethnic minorities and the elderly were less likely to use digital technologies in accessing care; (3) digital assimilation, where one study described how video technologies can reduce feelings of isolation and another how elderly black males were the most likely group to share information about COVID-19 on social media platforms. Conclusions During the early phase of the pandemic in the developed world, familiar difficulties in utilisation of digital healthcare among the elderly and ethnic minorities continued to be observed. This is a further reminder that the digital divide is a persistent challenge that needs to be urgently addressed when considering the likelihood that in many instances these digital technologies are likely to remain at the centre of healthcare delivery.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 127, 'citationCount': 73, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4266094', 'name': 'I.

Objective To evaluate the impact of telephone or video consultations compared to those conducted face-to-face on key patient-relevant outcomes and healthcare utilisation in primary care, mental health and allied health services, which have had a critical role in the management of the wider and longer-term consequences of COVID-19. Methods A systematic review of primary studies comparing telephone or video consultations versus face-to-face visits, following the PRISMA guidelines. Results Overall, consultations delivered by telephone and videoconference were as effective as face-to-face in-person visits to improve clinical outcomes in adults with mental health conditions and those attending primary care services. Patient satisfaction with telephone and video consultations and the therapeutic alliance was high across the studies. However, high discontinuation rates in patients receiving teleconsultations indicate this may not be a suitable modality of healthcare delivery for all patients. Teleconsultations offer significant patient time savings in primary care, but appropriate implementation, including training of healthcare professionals and management of technical issues, is essential to ensure effective and valuable clinical interventions. Conclusions Teleconsultations via telephone or videoconference are an effective alternative to face-to-face consultations for many patients attending primary care and mental health services. Teleconsultations have the potential to deliver time-efficient and lower-cost interventions at a distance while improving access to healthcare.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 64, 'citationCount': 57, 'authors': [{'authorId': '13271652', 'name': 'Sara Carrillo de Albornoz'}, {'authorId': '27335774', 'name': 'K.

Regional variation in internet access and telehealth use are well-documented, but the effect of neighborhood factors, including the pervasiveness of broadband internet, on older adults’ telehealth usage in the context of internet access is not known. Objective This study aimed to investigate how individual and neighborhood characteristics, including the pervasiveness of neighborhood broadband internet subscription, are associated with engagement in telehealth among older adults with internet access. Methods In this cross-sectional study, we included 5117 community-living older adults aged ≥65 years, who participated in the 2017 National Health and Aging Trends Study with census tract–level data for participants’ places of residence from the American Community Survey. Results Of an estimated 35.3 million community-living older adults, 21.1 million (59.7%) were internet users, and of this group, more than one-third (35.8%) engaged in telehealth. In a multivariable regression model adjusted for individual- and neighborhood-level factors, age, education, income, and the pervasiveness of neighborhood broadband internet subscription were associated with engagement in telehealth, while race, health, county metropolitan status, and neighborhood social deprivation were not. Among internet users, living in a neighborhood at the lowest (versus highest) tertile of broadband internet subscription was associated with being 40% less likely to engage in telehealth (adjusted odds ratio 0.61, 95% CI 0.42-0.87), all else equal.

Specifically, participants completed the incentive-compatible Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) and the Binswanger-Eckel-Grossman (BEG) multiple lotteries task, as well as the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking Task (DOSPERT) and the self-reported questions for risk-taking used in the German Socio-economic Panel (SOEP) study. In addition, participants in the UK representative sample answered a range of questions about COVID-19-related risky behaviors selected from the UCL COVID-19 Social Survey and the ICL-YouGov survey on COVID-19 behaviors. Consistently with pre-COVID-19 times, we find that risk tolerance during the UK lockdown (i) was higher in men than in women and (ii) decreased with age. Undocumented in pre-COVID-19 times, we find some evidence for healthier participants displaying significantly higher risk-tolerance for self-reported risk measures. We find no systematic nor robust patterns of association between the COVID-19 risky behaviors and the four risk-taking tasks in our study.

Although video visits offer some benefits compared with telephone visits, they require complex setup, which may disadvantage some patients due to the ""digital divide."" Our objective was to determine patient and neighborhood characteristics associated with visit modality.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nThis was a cross-sectional study across 1652 primary care and specialty care practices of adult patients at an integrated health system from April 23 to June 1, 2020.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe used electronic health record and administrative data. Our primary outcome was visit modality (in-person, video, or telephone), which was captured using billing codes. We assessed predictors of using video vs telephone using multivariable logistic regression. We used hierarchical logistic regression to determine the contribution of patient-, physician-, and practice-level components of variance in the choice of video or telephone visits.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe analyzed 231,596 visits by 162,102 patients. Sixty-five percent of the visits were virtual (31.7% telephone, 33.5% video). Patients who were older than 65 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.41; 95% CI, 0.40-0.43), Black (AOR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.57-0.63), Hispanic (AOR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.73-0.80), Spanish-speaking (AOR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.52-0.61), and from areas with low broadband access (AOR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88-0.98) were less likely to use video visits. Practices (38%) and clinicians (26%) drove more of the variation in video visit use than patients (9%).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTelemedicine access differences may compound disparities in chronic disease and COVID-19 outcomes.

Objective The aim of this study was to use the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) to benchmark progress toward HP2020 goals related to increasing internet access using broadband, and to assess the state of the digital divide for various sociodemographic groups. Methods We merged and analyzed data from 8 administrations of HINTS (2003-2017). Descriptive statistics were generated, and predicted marginals were calculated using interaction terms between survey year and selected sociodemographic variables of interest, including age, sex, race and ethnicity, income, education, and geography (rural versus urban), to test for differential change over time. Results The number of users having access to the internet increased between 2003 and 2014 (63.15% [3982/6358] to 83.41% [2802/3629]); it remained relatively steady from 2014 to 2017 (81.15% [2533/3283]). Broadband access increased between 2003 and 2011 (from 32.83% [1031/3352] to 77.87% [3375/4405]), but has been declining since (55.93% [1364/2487] in 2017).

No vaccine is available to prevent the disease, and available medical treatments cause serious side effects. Additionally, treatment failure and parasite resistance have made the development of new drugs against CL necessary. In this work, a virtual screening of natural products from the BIOFACQUIM and Selleckchem databases was performed using the method of molecular docking at the triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) enzyme interface of Leishmania mexicana (L. mexicana). Finally, the in vitro leishmanicidal activity of selected compounds against two strains of L. mexicana, their cytotoxicity, and selectivity index were determined. The top ten compounds were obtained based on the docking results. Four were selected for further in silico analysis. The ADME-Tox analysis of the selected compounds predicted favorable physicochemical and toxicological properties. Among these four compounds, S-8 (IC50 = 55 µM) demonstrated a two-fold higher activity against the promastigote of both L. mexicana strains than the reference drug glucantime (IC50 = 133 µM).

Benzimidazole is a scaffold used to develop antiparasitic drugs; therefore, it is interesting molecule against L. mexicana. In this work, a ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) of the ZINC15 database was performed. Subsequently, molecular docking was used to predict the compounds with potential binding at the dimer interface of triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) of L. mexicana (LmTIM). Compounds were selected on binding patterns, cost, and commercial availability for in vitro assays against L. mexicana blood promastigotes. The compounds were analyzed by molecular dynamics simulation on LmTIM and its homologous human TIM. Finally, the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties were determined in silico. A total of 175 molecules with docking scores between −10.8 and −9.0 Kcal/mol were obtained. Compound E2 showed the best leishmanicidal activity (IC50 = 4.04 µM) with a value similar to the reference drug pentamidine (IC50 = 2.23 µM). Molecular dynamics analysis predicted low affinity for human TIM. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of the compounds were suitable for developing new leishmanicidal agents.', 'year': 2023, 'referenceCount': 66, 'citationCount': 2, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1417251864', 'name': 'Lenci K.

H. Rob (Asteraceae)', 'abstract': 'Vernonanthura brasiliana (L.) H. Rob is a medicinal plant used for the treatment of several infections. This study aimed to evaluate the antileishmanial activity of V. brasiliana leaves using in vitro and in silico approaches. The chemical composition of V. brasiliana leaf extract was determined through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The inhibitory activity against Leishmania amazonensis promastigote was evaluated by the MTT method. In silico analysis was performed using Lanosterol 14alpha-demethylase (CYP51) as the target. The toxicity analysis was performed in RAW 264.7 cells and Tenebrio molitor larvae. LC-MS revealed the presence of 14 compounds in V. brasiliana crude extract, including flavonoids, flavones, sesquiterpene lactones, and quinic acids. Eriodictol (ΔGbind = −9.0), luteolin (ΔGbind = −8.7), and apigenin (ΔGbind = −8.6) obtained greater strength of molecular interaction with lanosterol demethylase in the molecular docking study. The hexane fraction of V. brasiliana showed the best leishmanicidal activity against L. amazonensis in vitro (IC50 12.44 ± 0.875 µg·mL−1) and low cytotoxicity in RAW 264.7 cells (CC50 314.89 µg·mL−1, SI = 25.30) and T. molitor larvae. However, the hexane fraction and Amphotericin-B had antagonistic interaction (FICI index ≥ 4.0).

Here, fourteen independent lines of Leishmania mexicana and one L. infantum line were selected for resistance to either amphotericin B or the related polyene antimicrobial, nystatin. Sterol profiling revealed that, in each resistant line, the predominant wild-type sterol, ergosta-5,7,24-trienol, was replaced by other sterol intermediates. Broadly, two different profiles emerged among the resistant lines. Whole genome sequencing then showed that these distinct profiles were due either to mutations in the sterol methyl transferase (C24SMT) gene locus or the sterol C5 desaturase (C5DS) gene. In three lines an additional deletion of the miltefosine transporter gene was found. Differences in sensitivity to amphotericin B were apparent, depending on whether cells were grown in HOMEM, supplemented with foetal bovine serum, or a serum free defined medium (DM). Metabolomic analysis after exposure to AmB showed that a large increase in glucose flux via the pentose phosphate pathway preceded cell death in cells sustained in HOMEM but not DM, indicating the oxidative stress was more significantly induced under HOMEM conditions. Several of the lines were tested for their ability to infect macrophages and replicate as amastigote forms, alongside their ability to establish infections in mice.

The applications of currently available chemotherapy (amphotericin B, miltefosine, and others) in VL treatment have been limited due to their poor bioavailability, unfavorable toxicity profile, and prolonged parenteral dosing. Quercetin (QT), a potent natural antioxidant, is a prominent target when conducting investigations on alternative therapies against L. donovani infections. However, the therapeutic applications of QT have been restricted due to its low solubility and bioavailability. In the present study, we developed and evaluated the antileishmanial activity (ALA) of quercetin-loaded nanoemulsion (QTNE) against L. donovani clinical strains. In vitro anti-promastigote assay results demonstrated that QTNE (IC50 6.6 μM, 48 h) significantly inhibited the growth of parasites more efficiently than the pure QT suspension in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Results of the anti-amastigote assay revealed that the infected macrophages (%) of QTNE were significantly more than those of the pure QT suspension at all concentrations (6.6, 26.4, and 52.8 μM; p < 0.05, p < 0.01 compared to the control). Moreover, the results of in vitro and ex vivo studies assisted in determining the mechanistic insights associated with the ALA of QTNE. The overall findings suggested that QTNE exhibited potential ALA by enhancing the intracellular ROS and nitric oxide levels, inducing distortion of membrane integrity and phosphatidylserine release (AV/PI), rupturing the parasite DNA (late apoptosis/necrosis process), and upregulating the immunomodulatory effects (IFN-γ and IL-10 levels). Additionally, QTNE showed superior biocompatibility against all of the treated healthy cells (PBMCs, PECs, and BMCs) as compared to the control. In conclusion, QTNE acts as a potential antileishmanial agent targeting both promastigote and intracellular amastigote forms of L. donovani, which thus opens a new avenue for the use of QTNE in VL therapy.', 'year': 2022, 'referenceCount': 59, 'citationCount': 7, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3379509', 'name': 'S.

Drug-resistance among parasites justifies the search for new therapeutic drugs and the identification of new targets becomes a valuable approach. In this scenario, glycolysis pathway which consists of the conversion of glucose into pyruvate plays an important role in the protozoa energy supply and it is therefore considered as a promising target. In this pathway, triose phosphate isomerase (TIM) plays an essential role in efficient energy production. Furthermore, protozoa TIM show structural differences with human enzyme counterparts suggesting the possibility of obtaining selective inhibitors. Therefore, TIM is considered a valid approach to develop new antiprotozoal agents, inhibiting the glycolysis in the parasite.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nIn this review, we discuss the drug design strategies, structure-activity relationship, and binding modes of outstanding TIM inhibitors against Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei, Plasmodium falciparum, Giardia lamblia, Leishmania mexicana, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Entamoeba histolytica.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTIM inhibitors showed mainly aromatic systems and symmetrical structure, where the size and type of heteroatom are important for enzyme inhibition. This inhibition is mainly based on the interaction with i) the interfacial region of TIM inducing changes on the quaternary and tertiary structure or ii) with the TIM catalytic region were the main pathways that disabled the catalytic activity of the enzyme.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBenzothiazole, benzoxazole, benzimidazole, and sulfhydryl derivatives stand out as TIM inhibitors. In silico and in vitro studies demonstrate that the inhibitors bind mainly at the TIM dimer interface. In this review, the development of new TIM inhibitors as antiprotozoal drugs is demonstrated as an important pharmaceutical strategy that may lead to new therapies for these ancient parasitic diseases.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 6, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1417251864', 'name': 'Lenci K.

Leading to the use of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies, which relates the structures of Azetidine-2-carbonitriles with their activities to generate predictive models. The structures were optimized using density functional theory (DFT) DFT/B3LYP/6-31G* basis set to generate their molecular descriptors, where five predictive models were constructed using the generated descriptors. The models were constructed using the genetic function algorithm component of a material studio, where the model with good statistical parameters, high coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.9465, cross-validated R2 (Q2cv) = 0.8981, Q2 (L4O)cv = 0.9272, and highest external validated R2 (R2pred) = 0.6915 was selected as the best model. These statistical results show the robustness, excellent power of prediction, and validity of the selected model. The descriptor, SpMax2_Bhp (the maximum absolute eigenvalue of Barysz matrix for n = 2 was weighted by polarizability), was revealed to be the most influential in the model due to its highest mean effect. The descriptor played a role in the design of sixteen (16) theoretical derivatives of Azetidine-2-carbonitriles using compound 25 as the design template by increasing polarizability of the compounds through substitution of the various group with electron deactivating groups (F, I, Cl, SO3H, CN, NO2, etc.) at different position of the template.

According to WHO, one billion people are at risk of Leishmania infection as they live in endemic areas while there are 12 million infected people worldwide. Annually, 0.9–1.6 million new infections are reported and 20–50 thousand deaths occur due to Leishmania infection. As current chemotherapy for treating leishmaniasis exhibits numerous drawbacks and due to the lack of effective human vaccine, there is an urgent need to develop new antileishmanial therapy treatment. To this end, eukaryotic protein kinases can be ideal target candidates for rational drug design against leishmaniasis. Eukaryotic protein kinases mediate signal transduction through protein phosphorylation and their inhibition is anticipated to be disease modifying as they regulate all essential processes for Leishmania viability and completion of the parasitic life cycle including cell-cycle progression, differentiation and virulence. This review highlights existing knowledge concerning the exploitation of Leishmania protein kinases as molecular targets to treat leishmaniasis and the current knowledge of their role in the biology of Leishmania spp. and in the regulation of signalling events that promote parasite survival in the insect vector or the mammalian host.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 169, 'citationCount': 23, 'authors': [{'authorId': '47399498', 'name': 'A.

The current treatments are limited, have severe side effects, and are only partially effective. Drug repositioning, defined as finding new indications for already approved drugs, has the potential to provide new therapeutic options for Chagas. In this work, we conducted a structure-based drug repositioning approach with over 130,000 3D protein structures to identify drugs that bind therapeutic Chagas targets and thus represent potential new Chagas treatments. The screening yielded over 500 molecules as hits, out of which 38 drugs were prioritized following a rigorous filtering process. About half of the latter were already known to have trypanocidal activity, while the others are novel to Chagas disease. Three of the new drug candidates—ciprofloxacin, naproxen, and folic acid—showed a growth inhibitory activity in the micromolar range when tested ex vivo on T. cruzi trypomastigotes, validating the prediction. We show that our drug repositioning approach is able to pinpoint relevant drug candidates at a fraction of the time and cost of a conventional screening.

There are currently only limited treatment options, which cause several side effects and have drug resistance. Thus, there is a great need for a novel, improved Chagas treatment. Bifunctional enzyme dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS) has emerged as a promising pharmacological target. Moreover, some human dihydrofolate reductase (HsDHFR) inhibitors such as trimetrexate also inhibit T. cruzi DHFR-TS (TcDHFR-TS). These compounds serve as a starting point and a reference in a screening campaign to search for new TcDHFR-TS inhibitors. In this paper, a novel virtual screening approach was developed that combines classical docking with protein-ligand interaction profiling to identify drug repositioning opportunities against T. cruzi infection. In this approach, some food and drug administration (FDA)-approved drugs that were predicted to bind with high affinity to TcDHFR-TS and whose predicted molecular interactions are conserved among known inhibitors were selected. Overall, ten putative TcDHFR-TS inhibitors were identified. These exhibited a similar interaction profile and a higher computed binding affinity, compared to trimetrexate.

In this study we have aimed Ld-PriS for the first time as a prospective target for the application of drug against Leishmania parasite. 3-D structures of Ld-PriS were built and ligand-based virtual screening was performed using hybrid similarity recognition techniques. Ligands from the ZINC database were used for the screening purposes based on known DNA primase inhibitor Sphingosine as a query. Top 150 ligands were taken into consideration for molecular docking against the query protein (Ld-PriS) using PyRx and iGEMDOCK softwares. Top five compounds with the best docking score were selected for pharmacokinetic investigation and molecular dynamic simulation. These top five screened inhibitors showed very poor binding affinity toward the catalytic subunit of human primase indicating their safety toward the host normal replication mechanism. The top five compounds showed good pharmacokinetic profiles and ADMET predictions revealed good absorption, solubility, permeability, uniform distribution, proper metabolism, minimal toxicity and good bioavailability.

It is involved in the inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion by preventing acidification. Targeting GS can be helpful to control the infection of Mtb. In order to identify potential inhibitors, we screened chemical libraries (56,400 compounds of ChEMBL anti-mycobacterial, 1596 FDA approved drugs, 419 Natural product and 916 phytochemical) against this target using the virtual screening approach. Screening by molecular docking identified ten top-ranked compounds as GSMtb inhibitors and they were compared with known inhibitors (as control). Since GS enzyme (GSHs) is also present in human. We have compared the protein sequence of GS from Mtb and human using the P-BLAST in NCBI. We found ∼27% identity in between these two sequences, so we also compared the binding affinity of inhibitor between Mtb and human. Finally, we identified top two compounds namely CHEMBL387509, CHEMBL226198 from ChEMBL anti-mycobacterial dataset, and Eriocitrin and Malvidin from phytochemical dataset which showed lees binding affinity towards GSHs whereas Pamidronate, and Phentermine from FDA approved drugs and (-)-Quinic Acid, Hexopyranuronic acid, Quebrachit, and Castanospermine from natural product showed protein-ligand interaction with Mtb protein while no interaction with GSHs. The top two docked complexes were subjected to molecular dynamic simulation to understand the stability of the molecule. Further, we calculated the binding free energy of the docked complex and analyzed hydrogen bond, salt bridge, pie stacking, and hydrophobic interaction in the docking region. These ligands exhibited very good binding affinity GSMtb enzymes. Therefore, these ligands are novel and drug-likeness compounds, and they may be potential inhibitors of M tuberculosis.

In part, increases in out-ofpocket expenses and higher attrition rates for drugs tested in humans have accounted for the rising drug development costs with seven out of eight compounds that enter clinical testing failing in development [1]. Efficacy and toxicity have become major contributors to the overall compound related attrition. As a result, many companies are focusing on compound properties early in preclinical development as a way to mitigate more expensive clinical failures at a later stage. The idea that greater in vitro potency will lead to a more effective therapeutic is often embedded in early drug discovery schemes; however, to be a successful drug candidate careful attention to physicochemical properties can improve the likelihood for efficient delivery and therapeutic success [2]. Lipophilicity, expressed as the logarithm of n-octanol partition coefficient (log P), has long been recognized as a predictor of a drug’s successful passage through clinical development to the marketplace. Lipophilicity contributes to the ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) characteristics of drugs by influencing their pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicological profiles.

ABSTRACT The available treatments for leishmaniasis are less than optimal due to inadequate efficacy, toxic side effects, and the emergence of resistant strains, clearly endorsing the urgent need for discovery and development of novel drug candidates. Ideally, these should act via an alternative mechanism of action to avoid cross-resistance with the current drugs. As cyclic nucleotide-specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs) of Leishmania major have been postulated as putative drug targets, a series of potential inhibitors of Leishmania PDEs were explored. Several displayed potent and selective in vitro activity against L. infantum intracellular amastigotes. One imidazole derivative, compound 35, was shown to reduce the parasite loads in vivo and to increase the cellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) level at in a dose-dependent manner at just 2× and 5× the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50), indicating a correlation between antileishmanial activity and increased cellular cAMP levels. Docking studies and molecular dynamics simulations pointed to imidazole 35 exerting its activity through PDE inhibition. This study establishes for the first time that inhibition of cAMP PDEs can potentially be exploited for new antileishmanial chemotherapy.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 46, 'citationCount': 17, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1399422374', 'name': 'V.

Detailed analysis of binding sites and specific interactions are carried out based on ensemble dockings to multiple receptor conformers obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. In TcTIM dimer dockings, the inhibitors preferentially bind to the tunnel‐shaped cavity formed at the interface of the subunits, whereas non‐inhibitors mostly choose other sites. In contrast, TcTIM monomer binding interface and hTIM dimer interface do not present a specific binding site for the inhibitors. These findings point to the importance of the tunnel and of the dimeric form for inhibition of TcTIM. Specific interactions of the inhibitors and their sulfonate‐free derivatives with the receptor residues indicate the significance of sulfonate group for binding affinity and positioning on the TcTIM dimer interface. One of the inhibitors also binds to the active site, which may explain its relatively higher inhibition effect on hTIM.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 43, 'citationCount': 11, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1995925092', 'name': 'Zeynep Kurkcuoglu\u2009'}, {'authorId': '1996003353', 'name': 'Gulgun Ural\u2009'}, {'authorId': '1995952669', 'name': 'E.

Unfortunately, there is no satisfactory treatment for the disease. The drugs currently used are not specific and exert serious toxic effects. Thus, there is an urgent need for drugs that are effective. Looking for molecules to eliminate the parasite, we have targeted a central enzyme of the glycolytic pathway: triosephosphate isomerase (TIM). The homodimeric enzyme is catalytically active only as a dimer. Because there are significant differences in the interface of the enzymes from the parasite and humans, we searched for small molecules that specifically disrupt contact between the two subunits of the enzyme from Trypanosoma cruzi but not those of TIM from Homo sapiens (HTIM), and tested if they kill the parasite. Methodology/Principal Findings Dithiodianiline (DTDA) at nanomolar concentrations completely inactivates recombinant TIM of T. cruzi (TcTIM). It also inactivated HTIM, but at concentrations around 400 times higher. DTDA was also tested on four TcTIM mutants with each of its four cysteines replaced with either valine or alanine. The sensitivity of the mutants to DTDA was markedly similar to that of the wild type. The crystal structure of the TcTIM soaked in DTDA at 2.15 Å resolution, and the data on the mutants showed that inactivation resulted from alterations of the dimer interface. DTDA also prevented the growth of Escherichia coli cells transformed with TcTIM, had no effect on normal E. coli, and also killed T. cruzi epimastigotes in culture. Conclusions/Significance By targeting on the dimer interface of oligomeric enzymes from parasites, it is possible to discover small molecules that selectively thwart the life of the parasite. Also, the conformational changes that DTDA induces in the dimer interface of the trypanosomal enzyme are unique and identify a region of the interface that could be targeted for drug discovery.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 56, 'citationCount': 44, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1388881386', 'name': 'V.

Since this interfacial region is central in the stability of TcTIM, we hypothesized that it would be possible to find agents that selectively affect the stability of TIMs from the three trypanosomatids. We found that 6,6'-bisbenzothiazole-2,2' diamine in the low micromolar range causes a desirable irreversible inactivation of the enzymes from the three trypanosomatids and has no effect on the other five TIMs. Thus, the data indicate that it is possible to find compounds that induce selective inactivation of the enzymes from three different trypanosomatids."", 'year': 2006, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 55, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1388881386', 'name': 'V.

46,80,ddeb421ec7ca6cedd32209b8212ab03c637e4303,Virtual avatars as a new tool for human immunodeficiency virus prevention among men who have sex with men: a narrative review,"Background and Objective Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to affect sexual and gender minorities, predominantly men who have sex with men (MSM). Stigma, medical mistrust, and apprehension towards discussing sexual health with one’s medical provider are significant barriers in seeking or accessing preventive services. Those obstacles could be surpassed through novel digital and electronic health interventions, specifically with virtual avatar technology. Avatars are digital self-representative agents that are controlled with an interactive electronic device. Avatars allow for virtual self-immersion within infinitely customizable environments to practice skill building, fostering relationships and more, through an optional incognito approach. The objective of this narrative review is to examine recent uses of and developments in avatar technology, highlight the personalization attribute of this technology, and evaluate its strengths and limitations as a tool for HIV prevention among MSM. Methods We reviewed recent scientific literature generated by PubMed that use virtual avatar technology in HIV prevention and treatment among populations put at risk. Articles that met the inclusion criteria were then categorized on how the avatar technology was used. Key Content and Findings We identified eleven studies that met inclusion criteria. Avatar technology was found to create a comfortable environment for participants to address and discuss their sexual behaviors with less hesitation. Avatars can build rapport with populations put at high risk, creating an opportunity for reevaluation of their sexual behavior while assisting them in being able seek information, preventive services, or treatment for HIV or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Conclusions Given the increased use of digital technology in health and prevention, avatars might be useful in sexual health education and HIV prevention among populations put at risk. The benefits and potential in utilizing this technology for HIV prevention are highlighted.",2023,79,0,"{'name': 'mHealth', 'volume': '9'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-4.006437301635742,

The rapid proliferation of smart phones in SSA provides an opportunity to leverage novel approaches to promote adherence to life-saving antiretroviral therapy (ART) for adolescents and young adults living with HIV (AYA-HIV) that go beyond simple medication reminders. Methods: Guided by the Integrate, Design, Assess and Share (IDEAS) framework, our multidisciplinary team developed a peer-based mHealth ART adherence intervention—PEERNaija. Grounded in Social Cognitive Theory, and principles of contingency management and supportive accountability, PEERNaija delivers a multi-faceted behavioral intervention within a smartphone application to address important obstacles to adherence. Results: PEERNaija was developed as a gamified Android-based mHealth application to support the behavioral change goal of improving ART adherence among AYA-HIV within Nigeria, a low- and middle- income country (LMIC). Identified via foundational interviews with the target population and review of the literature, key individual (forgetfulness and poor executive functioning), environmental (poor social support) and structural (indirect cost of clinic-based interventions) barriers to ART adherence for AYA-HIV informed application features. Further informed by established behavioral theories and principles, the intervention aimed to improve self-efficacy and self-regulation of AYA-HIV, leverage peer relationships among AYA to incentivize medication adherence (via contingency management, social accountability), provide peer social support through an app-based chat group, and allow for outreach of the provider team through the incorporation of a provider application. Gamification mechanics incorporated within PEERNaija include: points, progress bar, leaderboard with levels, achievements, badges, avatars and targeted behavior change messages. PEERNaija was designed as a tethered mobile personal health record application, sharing data to the widely deployed OpenMRS electronic health record application. It also uses the secure opensource Nakama gamification platform, in line with Principles of Digital Development that emphasize use of opensource systems within LMICs. Conclusions: Theory-based gamified mHealth applications that incorporate social incentives have the potential to improve adherence to AYA-HIV. Ongoing evaluations of PEERNaija will provide important data for the potential role for a gamified, smartphones application to deliver multifaceted adherence interventions for vulnerable AYA-HIV in SSA.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 101, 'citationCount': 4, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5692132', 'name': 'A.

Objective This study aims to investigate HIV information acquisition and use among YBMSM who use the internet. Methods A web-based self-administered survey and semistructured interviews were conducted. The survey findings informed the development of the interview guide. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the survey sample, and interview data were analyzed thematically using modified grounded theory methodologies. Results Among the internet sample (N=83), the average age was 29.2 (SD 3.5) years, 41% (n=34) of participants self-reported living with HIV, 43% (n=36) were HIV-negative, and 15% (n=13) were unsure of their HIV status. Most participants (n=79, 95%) acquired HIV information through the internet while using a mobile phone. Web-based HIV information was intentionally sought from consumer health information websites (n=31, 37%), government health information websites (n=25, 30%), and social media (n=14, 17%). Most men incidentally acquired HIV information via advertisements on social media sites and geospatial dating apps (n=54, 65%), posts on social media sites from their web-based social ties (n=44, 53%), and advertisements while browsing the internet (n=40, 48%). Although the internet is the top source of HIV information, health care providers were the most preferred (n=42, 50%) and trusted (n=80, 96%) source of HIV information. HIV information was used to facilitate the use of HIV prevention and care services. The qualitative sample included YBMSM across a range of ages and at different points of engagement in HIV prevention and care. Qualitative findings included the importance of the internet as a primary source of HIV information. The internet was used because of its ease of accessibility, because of its ability to maintain anonymity while searching for sensitive information, and to mitigate intersecting stigmas in health care settings. Participants used HIV information to assess their risk for HIV and AIDS, support their skill building for HIV prevention, inform patient–doctor communication, and learn about HIV prevention and treatment options. Men expressed concerns about their diminishing access to online spaces for HIV information exchange among YBMSM because of censorship policies on social media sites and the stigmatizing framing and tone of mass media HIV-prevention advertisements encountered while using the internet. Conclusions YBMSM in this sample had high utilization of eHealth for HIV information acquisition and use but diminished access to their preferred and most trusted source of HIV information: health care providers. Future eHealth-based HIV interventions culturally tailored for YBMSM should aim to reduce intersectional stigma at the point of care and support patient–provider communication. The findings demonstrate the need for community-informed, culturally tailored HIV messaging and online spaces for informational support exchange among YBMSM.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 68, 'citationCount': 11, 'authors': [{'authorId': '66411732', 'name': 'Megan Threats'}, {'authorId': '2060029383', 'name': 'K.

In addition to providing essential medical services during the pandemic, telemedicine has the potential to expand health care access to underserved populations by eliminating traditional barriers to care such as transportation needs, distance from specialty providers, and approved time off from work. However, the literature regarding telehealth accessibility for low-income, non-English-speaking, and minority patients remains limited. Through a cross-sectional analysis comparing 2019 clinic visits with 2020 telehealth visits at the UMass Memorial Medical Center, we demonstrate specialty-specific changes in patient demographics, including a younger population, fewer non-English-speaking patients, and a relative preservation of minority, Medicaid, and Medicare patients among telehealth visits in comparison to clinic visits. We also demonstrate that nonsurgical specialties had significantly lower no-show rates and the greatest number of telehealth visits.

This systematic review assesses the effectiveness of interactive digital interventions (IDIs) for prevention of sexually transmitted HIV. Methods: We conducted a systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of IDIs for HIV prevention, defining ‘interactive’ as producing personally tailored material. We searched databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, grey literature, reference lists, and contacted authors if needed. Two authors screened abstracts, applied eligibility and quality criteria and extracted data. Meta-analyses used random-effects models with standardized mean differences (SMD) for continuous outcomes and odds ratios (OR) for binary outcomes, assessing heterogeneity using the I2 statistic. Results: We included 31 RCTs of IDIs for HIV prevention. Meta-analyses of 29 RCTs comparing IDIs with minimal interventions (e.g. leaflet, waiting list) showed a moderate increase in knowledge (SMD 0.56, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.80), no effect on self-efficacy (SMD 0.13, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.27), a small improvement in intention (SMD 0.16, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.26), improvement in HIV prevention behaviours (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.57) and a possible increase in viral load, but this finding is unreliable. We found no evidence of difference between IDIs and face-to-face interventions for knowledge, self-efficacy, intention, or HIV-related behaviours in meta-analyses of five small RCTs. We found no health economic studies. Conclusion: There is good evidence that IDIs have positive effects on knowledge, intention and HIV prevention behaviours. IDIs are appropriate for HIV prevention in a variety of settings.

Digital health interventions have been identified as a potential way to reduce these health disparities. Objective This review aims to summarize the characteristics of existing evidence-based digital health interventions for LGBTIQ+ young people and to describe the evidence for their effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted using internet databases and gray literature sources, and the results were screened for inclusion. The included studies were synthesized qualitatively. Results The search identified 38 studies of 24 unique interventions seeking to address mental, physical, or sexual health–related concerns in LGBTIQ+ young people. Substantially more evidence-based interventions existed for gay and bisexual men than for any other population group, and there were more interventions related to risk reduction of sexually transmitted infections than to any other health concern. There was some evidence for the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of these interventions overall; however, the quality of evidence is often lacking. Conclusions There is sufficient evidence to suggest that targeted digital health interventions are an important focus for future research aimed at addressing health difficulties in LGBTIQ+ young people. Additional digital health interventions are needed for a wider range of health difficulties, particularly in terms of mental and physical health concerns, as well as more targeted interventions for same gender–attracted women, trans and gender-diverse people, and people with intersex variations.

Despite the increasing utilization of electronic health (eHealth) technology in the delivery of HIV prevention interventions, few studies have systematically explored its effectiveness and association with various intervention characteristics. Objective This study aimed to conduct a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of eHealth technology–based interventions for promoting HIV-preventive behaviors among MSM and to determine effectiveness predictors within a framework integrating design and implementation features. Methods A systematic literature search using terms related to eHealth technology, HIV, the MSM population, and an experimental study design was performed using 5 databases (ie, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses) and other sources (eg, bibliographies of relevant reviews and JMIR Publications). First, primary meta-analyses were conducted to estimate the effectiveness of eHealth interventions (d+) in changing 3 HIV-preventive behaviors among MSM: unprotected anal intercourse (UAI), HIV testing, and multiple sex partnership (MSP). Moderation analyses were then conducted to examine a priori effectiveness predictors including behavioral treatment components (eg, theory use, tailoring strategy use, navigation style, and treatment duration), eHealth technology components (eg, operation mode and modality type), and intervention adherence. Results A total of 46 studies were included. The overall effect sizes at end point were small but significant for all outcomes (UAI: d+=−.21, P<.001; HIV testing: d+=.38, P<.001; MSP: d+=−.26, P=.02). The intervention effects on UAI were significantly larger when compared with preintervention groups than with concurrent groups. Greater UAI reductions were associated with the increased use of tailoring strategies, provision of feedback, and tunneling navigation in interventions with a concurrent group, whereas reductions were associated with the use of self-paced navigation in interventions with a preintervention group. Greater uptake of HIV testing was associated with longer treatment duration; computer-mediated communication; and the use of messaging, social media, or a combined technology modality. Higher intervention adherence consistently predicted larger effects on UAI and HIV testing. Conclusions This study provided empirical evidence for the effectiveness of eHealth interventions in promoting HIV-preventive behaviors among MSM. Features of treatment content and eHealth technology might best predict the intervention effects on UAI and HIV testing, respectively. Most importantly, intervention adherence tended to play an important role in achieving better effectiveness.

Male Youth Pursuing Empowerment, Education and Prevention around Sexuality (MyPEEPS) Mobile is a comprehensive HIV prevention and sexual health education smartphone app initially created to promote sexual health and HIV prevention among adolescent sexual minority young men aged 13 to 18 years. Objective The objective of this study was to critically appraise the acceptability and usability of MyPEEPS Mobile for young adult MSM aged 19 to 25 years. Methods Study participants used the mobile app, completed usability questionnaires and in-depth interviews, and reported their experience using the app. Analysis of interview data was guided by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) to better understand the usability and acceptability of this intervention for young adults. Interview data were coded using the following constructs from the UTAUT model: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence. Results A total of 20 young adult MSM (n=10 in Chicago, Illinois, and n=10 in New York, New York) were enrolled in the study. Participants reported that MyPEEPS Mobile was free of functional problems (Health Information Technology Usability Evaluation Scale scores and Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire scores consistent with high usability), easy to use, and useful, with an engaging approach that increased acceptability, including the use of avatars and animation, and inclusive representation of the diverse identities by race and ethnicity, gender identity, and sexual orientation. Recommended areas for improving MyPEEPS Mobile for the target demographic included more adult-oriented graphics, advanced educational content, scenarios for youth with more sexual experience, and search function to increase accessibility of key content.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a medication that mitigates risk of HIV acquisition and requires regular STI testing and prescription refills with PrEP providers. Because PrEP care monitors sexual behavior, there is a need to understand how PrEP providers approach sexual health care for MSM patients. In this study, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 20 MSM in Atlanta, Georgia with current or past prescriptions for PrEP. Data were analyzed with thematic analysis using four major steps: (1) code and codebook development, (2) assigning codes to segments of interviews, (3) code-based and comparative analysis methods, and (4) developing thematic findings. Findings from interviews about changes in sexuality while using PrEP include decreased anxiety surrounding sex, increased feelings of control over personal health, and experiencing less stigma towards sexual partners with HIV. Participants indicated needs for tailored health advice based on individual sexual preferences, sexual health care free from stereotypical assumptions, and improved access to PrEP providers identifying as gay men or who practice in LGBT-friendly settings.

During 2010-2015, racial/ethnic disparities in HIV incidence increased among MSM; in 2015, rates among black and Hispanic MSM were 10.5 and 4.9 times as high, respectively, as the rate among white MSM (compared with 9.2 and 3.8 times as high, respectively, in 2010) (2).

Although PrEP use has increased among all MSM since 2014 (4), racial/ethnic disparities in PrEP use could increase existing disparities in HIV incidence among MSM (5). To understand racial/ethnic disparities in PrEP awareness, discussion with a health care provider, and use (steps in the HIV PrEP continuum of care) (6), CDC analyzed 2017 National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) data. Black and Hispanic MSM were significantly less likely than were white MSM to be aware of PrEP, to have discussed PrEP with a health care provider, or to have used PrEP within the past year. Among those who had discussed PrEP with a health care provider within the past year, 68% of white MSM, 62% of Hispanic MSM, and 55% of black MSM, reported PrEP use.

Patients with chronic disease who engage in self-care and self-management of their illnesses have better health outcomes and fewer hospitalizations and complications. Currently, information and communication technologies are used to support self-care and improve health outcomes. Within the body of literature, research into avatar-based technology for patient education is growing rapidly. To date, the evidence has not been systematically reviewed to determine the effectiveness of patient education using avatar-based technology on patients' knowledge and self-care behaviors in chronic disease.\n\n\nINCLUSION CRITERIA\nThis review included studies of children and adults who have received avatar-based patient education interventions. The comparator was usual care or other forms of educational programs. The outcomes were knowledge, self-care behavior, self-efficacy, health-related quality of life, readmission and medication adherence. Experimental designs were eligible, including non-randomized controlled trials, and quasi-experimental, prospective and retrospective before and after studies.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSeven databases, including MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ProQuest, Web of Science, Scopus and three other trial registries, including the World Health Organization (WHO), ClinicalTrials.gov and Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, were systematically searched for studies published between January 2005 and March 2017. Papers selected for retrieval were assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using the standardized critical appraisal instrument from the Joanna Briggs Institute System for the Unified Management Assessment and Review of Information (JBI SUMARI). Data extracted from papers included specific details about the interventions, populations, study methods and outcomes significant to the review question and specific objectives using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI SUMARI. Due to heterogeneity among the included studies, statistical pooling and meta-analysis were not possible. The results were tabulated, and the data narratively synthesized.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNine publications from eight studies were included in this review (n\u200a=\u200a752). Three out of the eight studies were randomized controlled trials and five were non-randomized experimental studies. The overall quality of the included studies was moderate. There was a low risk of bias for the randomized controlled trial studies and moderate risk of bias for the quasi-experimental studies. Four of the eight studies showed that patients who participated in avatar-based education had a statistically significant improvement in knowledge (p\u200a<\u200a0.05). Three studies showed improvement in behaviors and self-efficacy. Only three of eight studies examined health-related quality of life and adherence to medication, but the results were not statistically significant (p\u200a>\u200a0.05). No studies identified the effectiveness of avatar-based patient education on readmission.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAvatar-based technology in patient education can have a positive effect on a wide range of healthcare outcomes. The intervention can improve knowledge, self-care behaviors and self-efficacy in patients with chronic diseases. However, there is limited evidence of improvement in health-related quality of life and adherence to medication, and no available research on readmission."", 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 48, 'citationCount': 22, 'authors': [{'authorId': '12508878', 'name': 'P.

In an effort to address this barrier and encourage uptake of PEP and PrEP, an electronic health (eHealth) video was created using an entertainment-education format. Objective The study aimed to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and preference of an avatar-led, eHealth video, PEP and PrEP for Women, to increase awareness and knowledge of PEP and PrEP for HIV in a sample of African American women. Methods A cross-sectional, Web-based study was conducted with 116 African American women aged 18 to 61 years to measure participants’ perceived acceptability of the video on a 5-point scale: poor, fair, good, very good, and excellent. Backward stepwise regression was used to the find the outcome variable of a higher rating of the PEP and PrEP for Women video. Thematic analysis was conducted to explore the reasons for recommending the video to others after watching the eHealth video. Results Overall, 89% of the participants rated the video as good or higher. A higher rating of the educational video was significantly predicted by: no current use of drugs/alcohol (beta=−.814; P=.004), not having unprotected sex in the last 3 months (beta=−.488; P=.03), higher income (beta=.149; P=.03), lower level of education (beta=−.267; P=.005), and lower exposure to sexual assault since the age of 18 years (beta=−.313; P=.004). After watching the eHealth video, reasons for recommending the video included the video being educational, entertaining, and suitable for women. Conclusions Utilization of an avatar-led eHealth video fostered education about PEP and PrEP among African American women who have experienced insufficient outreach for biomedical HIV strategies. This approach can be leveraged to increase awareness and usage among African American women.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 67, 'citationCount': 34, 'authors': [{'authorId': '15840455', 'name': 'Keosha Bond'}, {'authorId': '145208623', 'name': 'S.

We developed and assessed the feasibility and acceptability of an ICBI for promoting adolescent and young adult sexual health, and the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing unprotected sex, STIs, and unintended pregnancy. Methods This pilot randomized controlled trial enrolled STI Clinic patients, in Seattle, Washington, who were 14–24 years old and reported unprotected vaginal sex during the last 2 months. Both the control and intervention group used a computerized survey to enter their sexual health and only the intervention group received the ICBI. The ICBI included personalized sexual health feedback from a physician avatar; instructive video modules advocating sexual health; and identification of one behavior to change. At 3-month follow-up, participants reported on interim sexual and pregnancy histories and underwent repeat STI testing. We assessed intervention impact on unprotected vaginal sex, number of sexual partners, incident STIs, and unintended pregnancy. Results Of 272 participants, 242 (89%) completed the study, of whom 65% were female. While these findings did not reach statistical significance, at 3-month follow-up, the intervention group reported a 33% lower rate of unprotected vaginal sex (no condom use) [IRR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.44–1.02]; 29% fewer sex partners [IRR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.50–1.03]; and 48% fewer STIs [IRR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.25–1.08] when compared to the control group. Similarly, as compared to the control group, intervention females reported a lower rate of unprotected vaginal sex (no birth control) [IRR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.47–1.35] and half as many unintended pregnancies (n = 5) versus control females (n = 10) [IRR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.17–1.58].

All participants completed a survey on behavioral mediators, delivered via an audio computer-assisted self-interview system at baseline (T1), post intervention (T2), and at 6 weeks postintervention (T3). The postintervention survey for intervention arm participants included questions eliciting feedback on the game. Intervention arm participants and their parents participated in 8 postintervention focus group discussions. Game log files were analyzed to calculate the length of exposure to the game. Behavioral survey data were analyzed using two-sample t tests to compare mean change from T1 to T2 and to T3 for intervention versus control arm participants. Descriptive statistics on game feedback questions were computed. Focus group transcripts were uploaded to MAXQDA software, where they were labeled with deductive and inductive codes. Data were analyzed thematically and compared across demographics. Results Intervention arm participants played Tumaini for a mean of approximately 27 hours. The intervention arm showed significant gains in sexual health-related knowledge and self-efficacy (both P<.001), behavioral intention for risk-avoidance strategies and sexual risk communication (P=.006), and overall survey scores (P<.001) compared with the control arm at T3. The postintervention survey revealed high subjective measures of the game’s value, relevance, and appeal. Focus groups identified a wide range of knowledge and skills the participants had gained, including setting goals and planning how to achieve them, which was perceived as a key motivator for avoiding or reducing risk. Conclusions The study supports the need for further research to assess the efficacy of the game-based intervention. If proven efficacious, smartphone games have the potential to dramatically increase the reach of culturally adapted behavioral interventions while ensuring fidelity to intervention design.

Objective This study aimed to develop a theory-driven talking avatar-like embodied agent mobile phone intervention guided by the information-motivation-behavioral skills model to promote HIV medication adherence and retention in care in young African American men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods We performed 5 iterative focus groups in Chicago with HIV-positive African American MSM aged 18-34 years to inform the ongoing development of a mobile phone app. Participants for the focus groups were recruited from 4 University of Illinois at Chicago Community Outreach Intervention Project sites located in different high HIV incidence areas of the city and the University of Illinois at Chicago HIV clinic using fliers and word of mouth. The focus group data analysis included developing an ongoing list of priorities for app changes and discussion between two of the investigators based on the project timeline, resources, and to what extent they served the app’s objectives. Results In this study, 16 men participated, including 3 who participated in two groups. The acceptability for an embodied agent app was universal in all 5 focus groups. The app included the embodied agent response to questions and antiretroviral regimen information, adherence tracking, CD4 count and viral load tracking, motivational spoken messages, and customizability. Concerns that were identified and responded to in the development process included privacy, stigma, avoiding the harsh or commanding tone of voice, avoiding negative motivational statements, and making reminder functions for a variety of health care interactions. Conclusions An avatar-like embodied agent mHealth approach was acceptable to young HIV-positive African American MSM. Its relational nature may make it an effective method of informing, motivating, and promoting health behavioral skills. Furthermore, the app’s ease of access, stigma-free environment, and audiovisual format may help overcome some adherence barriers reported in this population.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 30, 'citationCount': 26, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2814526', 'name': 'M.

An estimated 66% of the adults reportedly use the Internet to obtain health information related to a specific disease (ie, human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, HIV/AIDS). Previous research has demonstrated that health information seekers use the Internet to seek answers to stigma-laden questions from health avatars. Objective The objective of this study was to identify patterns in the choice of avatar among health information seekers (patients or public health workers) using the Internet to obtain HIV/AIDS information and to describe the demographic characteristics (age, gender, and ethnicity) of health information seekers to determine whether they preferred an avatar that was similar to their own gender and ethnicity. Methods The Rural South Public Health Training Center (RSPHTC) partnered with the New York State Department of Health to create the HIV/AIDS Avatar project. The avatar project was created to serve as an educational resource for public health workers by providing relevant and accurate information about HIV/AIDS. First, the user was instructed to choose one of the 8 avatars that voiced responses to 100 common questions and answers about HIV/AIDS. Next, the website gave users the option to complete a brief 3-question demographic survey. Finally, the demographic characteristics of each user were compared with the chosen avatar to determine whether they preferred an avatar that was similar to their own gender and ethnicity. Results The avatar project website was loaded with 800 videos that included the answers to the top 100 questions about HIV/AIDS voiced by 8 avatars. A total of 1119 Web-based health information seekers completed the demographic survey upon accessing the website. Of these, 55.14% (617/1119) users were female. A total of 49.96% (559/1119) users were aged between 30 and 49 years. The ethnicity of the user and the avatar was found to have the strongest connection. All the users choose the female avatar matching their own ethnicity, followed by the male avatar. Additionally, the white female avatar was chosen the most by all users regardless of the age group or gender. Conclusions Web-based health information seekers using the Internet to access medical research information may feel more comfortable receiving the answers to HIV stigma-laden questions from avatars, rather than receiving information directly from a health care provider. Additionally, providers seeking to utilize avatars to deliver interventions in health care settings may benefit from offering individuals choices in how they receive health information. Having the ability to choose whom you seek information from may lead to an increase in knowledge and awareness and could motivate HIV-positive individuals to seek care.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 10, 'citationCount': 12, 'authors': [{'authorId': '15839259', 'name': 'Shantrel S.

Setting/participants All settings/all participants. Intervention We classified digital innovations into (1) mobile health-based (mHealth: SMS (short message service)/phone calls), (2) internet-based mobile and/or electronic health (mHealth/eHealth: social media, avatar-guided computer programs, websites, mobile applications, streamed soap opera videos) and (3) combined innovations (included both SMS/phone calls and internet-based mHealth/eHealth). Primary and secondary outcome measures Feasibility, acceptability, impact. Methods We searched databases MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and Web of Science, abstracted data, explored heterogeneity, performed a random effects subgroup analysis. Results We reviewed 99 studies, 63 (64%) were from America/Europe, 36 (36%) from Africa/Asia; 79% (79/99) were clinical trials; 84% (83/99) evaluated impact. Of innovations, mHealth based: 70% (69/99); internet based: 21% (21/99); combined: 9% (9/99). All digital innovations were highly accepted (26/31; 84%), and feasible (20/31; 65%). Regarding impacted measures, mHealth-based innovations (SMS) significantly improved antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence (pooled OR=2.15(95%CI: 1.18 to 3.91)) and clinic attendance rates (pooled OR=1.76(95%CI: 1.28, 2.42)); internet-based innovations improved clinic attendance (6/6), ART adherence (4/4), self-care (1/1), while reducing risk (5/5); combined innovations increased clinic attendance, ART adherence, partner notifications and self-care. Confounding (68%) and selection bias (66%) were observed in observational studies and attrition bias in 31% of clinical trials. Conclusion Digital innovations were acceptable, feasible and generated impact. A trend towards the use of internet-based and combined (internet and mobile) innovations was noted.

Perceived stigma prevents many from reporting their symptoms. Stigma is a particularly pervasive problem among military service members, preventing them from reporting symptoms of combat-related conditions like posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, research shows increased reporting by service members when anonymous assessments are used. For example, service members report more symptoms of PTSD when they anonymously answer the Post-Deployment Health Assessment (PDHA) symptom checklist compared to the official PDHA, which is identifiable and linked to their military records. To investigate the factors that influence reporting of psychological symptoms by service members, we used a transformative technology: automated virtual humans that interview people about their symptoms. Such virtual human interviewers allow simultaneous use of two techniques for eliciting disclosure that would otherwise be incompatible; they afford anonymity while also building rapport. We examined whether virtual human interviewers could increase disclosure of mental health symptoms among active-duty service members that just returned from a year-long deployment in Afghanistan. Service members reported more symptoms during a conversation with a virtual human interviewer than on the official PDHA. They also reported more to a virtual human interviewer than on an anonymized PDHA. A second, larger sample of active-duty and former service members found a similar effect that approached statistical significance. Because respondents in both studies shared more with virtual human interviewers than an anonymized PDHA -even though both conditions control for stigma and ramifications for service members’ military records- virtual human interviewers that build rapport may provide a superior option to encourage reporting.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 71, 'citationCount': 160, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2419453', 'name': 'Gale M.

Objective The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the use of eHealth interventions for HIV prevention in high-risk MSM. Methods We systematically searched PubMed, OVID, ISI Web of Knowledge, Google Scholar, and Google for articles and grey literature reporting the original results of any studies related to HIV prevention in MSM and developed a standard data collection form to extract information on study characteristics and outcome data. Results In total, 13 articles met the inclusion criteria, of which five articles targeted HIV testing behaviors and eight focused on decreasing HIV risk behaviors. Interventions included Web-based education modules, text messaging (SMS, short message service), chat rooms, and social networking. The methodological quality of articles ranged from 49.4-94.6%. Wide variation in the interventions meant synthesis of the results using meta-analysis would not be appropriate. Conclusions This review shows evidence that eHealth for HIV prevention in high-risk MSM has the potential to be effective in the short term for reducing HIV risk behaviors and increasing testing rates.

RESULTS.: Findings presented at the summit demonstrate that the United States and Canada have high rates of poor sexual health outcomes and that sexual health education in medical schools is variable and in some settings diminished. To address these issues, government, professional, and student organizations are working on efforts to promote sexual health. Several universities already have sexual health curricula in place. Evaluation mechanisms will be essential for developing and refining sexual health education. CONCLUSIONS.: To be effective, sexual health curricula need to be integrated longitudinally throughout medical training. Identifying faculty champions and supporting student efforts are strategies to increase sexual health education. Sexual health requires a multidisciplinary approach, and cross-sector interaction between various public and private entities can help facilitate change. Areas important to address include: core content and placement in the curriculum; interprofessional education and training for integrated care; evaluation mechanisms; faculty development and cooperative strategies.

A Diffusion of Innovation Analysis', 'abstract': 'Introduction. Telemedicine is promoted as a means to increase access to specialty medical care among the urban underserved, yet little is known about its acceptability among these populations. We used components of a diffusion of innovation conceptual framework to analyze preexperience perceptions about telemedicine to assess its appeal among urban underserved African Americans and Latinos. Methods. Ten focus groups were conducted with African American (n = 43) and Latino participants (n = 44) in both English and Spanish and analyzed for key themes. Results. Both groups perceived increased and immediate access to multiple medical opinions and reduced wait time as relative advantages of telemedicine. However, African Americans expressed more concerns than Latinos about confidentiality, privacy, and the physical absence of the specialist. This difference may reflect lower levels of trust in new health care innovations among African Americans resulting from a legacy of past abuses in the US medical system as compared to immigrant Latinos who do not have this particular historical backdrop. Conclusions. These findings have implications for important issues such as adoption of telemedicine, patient satisfaction, doctor-patient interactions, and the development and tailoring of strategies targeted to each of these populations for the introduction, marketing, and implementation of telemedicine.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 55, 'citationCount': 86, 'authors': [{'authorId': '36192750', 'name': 'Sheba M.

This analysis was designed to explore the frequency of testing, as well as health system and personal barriers to testing, among a community-recruited sample of Black men who have sex with men (MSM) at risk for HIV and STDs. Black MSM (n = 197) recruited via modified respondent-driven sampling between January and July 2008 completed an interviewer-administered assessment, with optional voluntary HIV counseling and testing. Logistic regression procedures examined factors associated with not having tested in the 2 years prior to study enrollment for: (1) HIV (among HIV-uninfected participants, n = 145) and (2) STDs (among the entire mixed serostatus sample, n = 197). The odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals obtained from this analysis were converted to relative risks. (1) HIV: Overall, 33% of HIV-uninfected Black MSM had not been tested for HIV in the 2 years prior to study enrollment. Factors uniquely associated with not having a recent HIV test included: being less educated; engaging in serodiscordant unprotected sex; and never having been HIV tested at a community health clinic, STD clinic, or jail. (2) STDs: Sixty percent had not been tested for STDs in the 2 years prior to study enrollment, and 24% of the sample had never been tested for STDs. Factors uniquely associated with not having a recent STD test included: older age; having had a prior STD; and never having been tested at an emergency department or urgent care clinic. Overlapping factors associated with both not having had a recent HIV or STD test included: substance use during sex; feeling that using a condom during sex is ""very difficult""; less frequent contact with other MSM; not visiting a health care provider (HCP) in the past 12 months; having a HCP not recommend HIV or STD testing at their last visit; not having a primary care provider (PCP); current PCP never recommending they get tested for HIV or STDs. In multivariable models adjusting for relevant demographic and behavioral factors, Black MSM who reported that a HCP recommended getting an HIV test (adjusted relative risk [ARR] = 0.26; p = 0.01) or STD test (ARR = 0.11; p = 0.0004) at their last visit in the past 12 months were significantly less likely to have not been tested for HIV or STDs in the past 2 years. Many sexually active Black MSM do not regularly test for HIV or STDs. HCPs play a pivotal role in encouraging testing for Black MSM. Additional provider training is warranted to educate HCPs about the specific health care needs of Black MSM, in order to facilitate access to timely, culturally competent HIV and STD testing and treatment services for this population.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 73, 'citationCount': 130, 'authors': [{'authorId': '6240862', 'name': 'M.

Methods:We conducted a telephone survey with a random sample of 500 African Americans aged 15 to 44 years and living in the contiguous United States. Results:A significant proportion of respondents endorsed HIV/AIDS conspiracy beliefs. Among men, stronger conspiracy beliefs were significantly associated with more negative condom attitudes and inconsistent condom use independent of selected sociode-mographic characteristics, partner variables, sexually transmitted disease history, perceived risk, and psychosocial factors. In secondary follow-up analyses, men's attitudes about condom use partially mediated the effects of HIV/AIDS conspiracy beliefs on condom use behavior. Conclusions:HIV/AIDS conspiracy beliefs are a barrier to HIV prevention among African Americans and may represent a facet of negative attitudes about condoms among black men.

Avatar animation and control is difficult, however, because a large repertoire of avatar behaviors must be made available, and the user must be able to select from this set of behaviors, possibly with a low-dimensional input device. One appealing approach to obtaining a rich set of avatar behaviors is to collect an extended, unlabeled sequence of motion data appropriate to the application. In this paper, we show that such a motion database can be preprocessed for flexibility in behavior and efficient search and exploited for real-time avatar control. Flexibility is created by identifying plausible transitions between motion segments, and efficient search through the resulting graph structure is obtained through clustering. Three interface techniques are demonstrated for controlling avatar motion using this data structure: the user selects from a set of available choices, sketches a path through an environment, or acts out a desired motion in front of a video camera. We demonstrate the flexibility of the approach through four different applications and compare the avatar motion to directly recorded human motion.', 'year': 2002, 'referenceCount': 49, 'citationCount': 1055, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2118476745', 'name': 'Jehee Lee'}, {'authorId': '1759700', 'name': 'Jinxiang Chai'}, {'authorId': '2550962', 'name': 'Paul S.

DEVELOPING A VIRTUAL REALITY PROGRAM TO SUPPORT HIV-STATUS DISCLOSURE DECISIONS.', 'abstract': 'HIV status disclosure is associated with increased sorcial support and protective behaviors against HIV transmission. Yet disclosure poses significant challenges in the face of persistent societal stigma. Few interventions focus on decision-making self-efficacy, and communication skills to support disclosing HIV status to an intimate partner. Virtual reality (VR) and artifcial intelligence (AI) technologies offer poweful tools to address this gap. Informed by Social Cognitive Theory, we created the Tough Talks VR program for HIV-positive young men who have sex with men (YMSM) to practice status disclosure safely and confidentially. Fifty-eight YMSM (ages 18 - 30, 88% HIV-positive) contributed 132 disclosure dialogues to develop the prototype through focus groups, usability testing, and a technical pilot. The prototype includes three disclosure scenarios (neutral, sympathetic, and negative response) and a database of 125 virtual character utterances. Participants select a VR scenario and realistic virtual character with whom to practice. In a pilot test of the fully automated neutral response scenario, the AI system responded appropriately to 71% of participant utterances. Most pilot study participants agreed Tough Talks was easy to use (9/11) and that they would like to use the system frequently (9/11). Tough Talks demonstrates that VR can be used to practice HIV status disclosure and lessons learned from program development offer insights for the use of AI systems for other areas of health and education.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 54, 'citationCount': 23, 'authors': [{'authorId': '31780266', 'name': 'K.

The rapid spread of mobile technology creates an opportunity to use innovative methods to reduce the burden of STIs. This systematic review identified recent randomised controlled trials that employed mobile technology to improve sexual health outcomes. Methods: The following databases were searched for randomised controlled trials of mobile technology based sexual health interventions with any outcome measures and all patient populations: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Global Health, The Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Methodology Register, NHS Health Technology Assessment Database, and Web of Science (science and social science citation index) (Jan 1999–July 2014). Interventions designed to increase adherence to HIV medication were not included. Two authors independently extracted data on the following elements: interventions, allocation concealment, allocation sequence, blinding, completeness of follow-up, and measures of effect. Trials were assessed for methodological quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We calculated effect estimates using intention to treat analysis. Results: A total of ten randomised trials were identified with nine separate study groups. No trials had a low risk of bias. The trials targeted: 1) promotion of uptake of sexual health services, 2) reduction of risky sexual behaviours and 3) reduction of recall bias in reporting sexual activity. Interventions employed up to five behaviour change techniques. Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity in trial assessment and reporting. Two trials reported statistically significant improvements in the uptake of sexual health services using SMS reminders compared to controls. One trial increased knowledge. One trial reported promising results in increasing condom use but no trial reported statistically significant increases in condom use. Finally, one trial showed that collection of sexual health information using mobile technology was acceptable. Conclusions: The findings suggest interventions delivered by SMS interventions can increase uptake of sexual health services and STI testing. High quality trials of interventions using standardised objective measures and employing a wider range of behavioural change techniques are needed to assess if interventions delivered by mobile phone can alter safer sex behaviours carried out between couples and reduce STIs.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 35, 'citationCount': 71, 'authors': [{'authorId': '39175482', 'name': 'K.

47,81,c172e1c7408bcc30aeacff74e115f0e08804c73b,The Impact of Virtual Humans on Psychosomatic Medicine,"ABSTRACT Objective Virtual humans are likely to enhance the delivery of health care over the next decade. Virtual humans are artificially intelligent computer agents with hyperrealistic, autonomously animated embodiments based on affective computing techniques. Virtual humans could be programmed to screen for health conditions, triage patients, and deliver health interventions, with appropriate facial expressions and body gestures, functioning as a supplement to human care. This article provides a perspective on the implications of virtual humans for behavioral and psychosomatic medicine, and health psychology. Methods A narrative review was conducted to integrate observations and findings from research on virtual humans from 91 articles in this multidisciplinary area. Results Virtual humans can be used for multimodal behavior analysis of patients, individualized tailoring of interventions, and detection of changes of psychological and behavioral measures over time. Virtual humans can also pair the scalability of a website with the interactivity and relational skills of a human tele-therapist. Research is beginning to show the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of virtual humans in a range of populations. Virtual humans can be easily tailored in terms of their appearance, voice, and language, and may be adapted to fit the characteristics of a patient population or hard-to-reach groups. If co-designed with these communities, virtual humans may help to promote health care engagement and improve outcomes. Conclusions Virtual humans can engage and motivate patients, and deliver personalized psychological and behavioral health care. This article provides an overview of the potential impact of virtual humans on psychosomatic medicine and discusses ethical implications.",2023,98,0,"{'name': 'Psychosomatic Medicine', 'pages': '619 -

However, issues with engagement can reduce intervention effectiveness. Technologies with highly social interfaces, such as virtual humans (VH), may offer advantages in this space. However, it is unclear how VH compare to telehealth and e-manuals at delivering psychological interventions. This experiment compared the effects of single laboratory session of Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM) delivered by a VH (VH-CBSM), human telehealth (T-CBSM), and an e-manual (E-CBSM) on psychological and physiological outcomes in a community sample of stressed adult women. A pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a parallel, mixed design was conducted. Adult women (M age =43.21, SD = 10.70) who self-identified as stressed were randomly allocated to VH-CBSM, T-CBSM, or E-CBSM involving one 90 min session and homework. Perceived stress, stress management skills, negative affect, optimism, relaxation, and physiological stress were measured. Mixed factorial ANOVAs and pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction investigated main and interaction effects of time and condition. Participants’ data (N = 38) were analysed (12 = VH-CBSM; 12 = T-CBSM; 14 = E-CBSM). Each condition significantly improved stress, negative affect, optimism, relaxation, and physiological stress over time with large effect sizes.

However, there is limited research on how these technologies compare in terms of their feasibility and acceptability in delivering stress management interventions. Objective We conducted a preliminary comparison of the feasibility and acceptability of a VH, teletherapy, and an e-manual at delivering 1 module of cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM) to evaluate the feasibility of the trial methodology in preparation for a future randomized controlled trial (RCT). Methods A pilot RCT was conducted with a parallel, mixed design. A community sample of distressed adult women were randomly allocated to receive 1 session of CBSM involving training in cognitive and behavioral techniques by a VH, teletherapy, or an e-manual plus homework over 2 weeks. Data were collected on the feasibility of the intervention technologies (technical support and homework access), trial methods (recruitment methods, questionnaire completion, and methodological difficulty observations), intervention acceptability (intervention completion, self-report ratings, therapist rapport, and trust), and acceptability of the trial methods (self-report ratings and observations). Qualitative data in the form of written responses to open-ended questions were collected to enrich and clarify the findings on intervention acceptability. Results Overall, 38 participants’ data were analyzed. A VH (n=12), teletherapy (n=12), and an e-manual (n=14) were found to be feasible and acceptable for delivering 1 session of CBSM to distressed adult women based on the overall quantitative and qualitative findings. Technical difficulties were minimal and did not affect intervention completion, and no significant differences were found between the conditions (P=.31). The methodology was feasible, although improvements were identified for a future trial. All conditions achieved good satisfaction and perceived engagement ratings, and no significant group differences were found (P>.40). Participants had similar willingness to recommend each technology (P=.64). There was a nonsignificant trend toward participants feeling more open to using the VH and e-manual from home than teletherapy (P=.10). Rapport (P<.001) and trust (P=.048) were greater with the human teletherapist than with the VH. The qualitative findings enriched the quantitative results by revealing the unique strengths and limitations of each technology that may have influenced acceptability. Conclusions A VH, teletherapy, and a self-guided e-manual were found to be feasible and acceptable methods of delivering 1 session of a stress management intervention to a community sample of adult women. The technologies were found to have unique strengths and limitations that may affect which works best for whom and in what circumstances. Future research should test additional CBSM modules for delivery by these technologies and conduct a larger RCT to compare their feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness when delivering a longer home-based stress management program.

Computer agents are capable of delivering psychological therapies through the internet, however, there is little research on their acceptability to date.\n \n \n OBJECTIVE\n The objectives of this study were to evaluate: (1) the feasibility and acceptability of a remote loneliness and stress intervention with digital human delivery to at-risk adults; and (2) the feasibility of the trial methods in preparation for a randomised controlled trial.\n \n \n METHODS\n A parallel, randomised pilot trial with a mixed design was conducted. Participants were adults aged 18–69 years with an underlying medical condition, or aged 70 years or older with a >24 MMSE score (i.e., at greater risk of developing severe COVID-19). Participants took part from their place of residence (20= independent living retirement village, 7= community dwelling, 3= nursing home). Participants were randomly allocated to the intervention or waitlist control group, who received the intervention one week later. The intervention involved completing cognitive behavioural (e.g., psychoeducation on stress awareness, deep breathing) and positive psychology exercises with a digital human facilitator on a website for at least 15-minutes per day over one week. The exercises used evidence-based strategies to improve loneliness, stress, and psychological well-being. Feasibility was evaluated using dropout rates and behavioural observation data. Acceptability was evaluated using behavioural engagement data, the Friendship Questionnaire (adapted), self-report items and qualitative questions. Psychological outcomes were measured to evaluate feasibility of trial methods and included loneliness (UCLA Loneliness Scale), stress (Perceived Stress Scale), COVID-19 distress, well-being (Flourishing Scale), and affect (Scale of Positive and Negative Experiences).\n \n \n RESULTS\n 30 participants (15 per group) were recruited. Participants were 22 older adults, and 8 younger adults with a health condition. 6 participants dropped out of the study. 24 participants’ data were analysed (12= intervention group; 12= waitlist group). The digital human intervention and trial methods were generally found to be feasible and acceptable in younger and older adults living independently. Slow internet speed reduced intervention feasibility for some participants. Suggestions for improvement included: additional content, tailoring to the population, and changes for the digital human’s design. The intervention and trial methods were less feasible to nursing home residents who required caregiver assistance.\n \n \n CONCLUSIONS\n The digital human was a feasible and acceptable way of delivering a remote loneliness and stress intervention to at-risk adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. The intervention and trial methods were most feasible for people living independently. Support was found for further testing of digital humans to deliver remote psychological interventions. Findings will inform expansion of intervention content and the design of a randomised controlled trial to evaluate intervention effectiveness.\n \n \n CLINICALTRIAL\n Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR): ACTRN12620000786998\n', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 15, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2138034739', 'name': 'Kate Loveys'}, {'authorId': '143959147', 'name': 'Mark Sagar'}, {'authorId': '2130291550', 'name': 'I.

However, user engagement varies, with regard to a user’s uptake and sustained interactions with these interventions. Objective This systematic review aims to identify common barriers and facilitators that influence user engagement with DMHIs. Methods A systematic search was conducted in the SCOPUS, PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. Empirical studies that report qualitative and/or quantitative data were included. Results A total of 208 articles met the inclusion criteria. The included articles used a variety of methodologies, including interviews, surveys, focus groups, workshops, field studies, and analysis of user reviews. Factors extracted for coding were related to the end user, the program or content offered by the intervention, and the technology and implementation environment. Common barriers included severe mental health issues that hampered engagement, technical issues, and a lack of personalization. Common facilitators were social connectedness facilitated by the intervention, increased insight into health, and a feeling of being in control of one’s own health. Conclusions Although previous research suggests that DMHIs can be useful in supporting mental health, contextual factors are important determinants of whether users actually engage with these interventions. The factors identified in this review can provide guidance when evaluating DMHIs to help explain and understand user engagement and can inform the design and development of new digital interventions.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 256, 'citationCount': 205, 'authors': [{'authorId': '40975562', 'name': 'J.

Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common perinatal mood disorder with an annual estimated cost of $14.2 billion. Only a small percentage of PPD patients seek care due to lack of screening and insufficient knowledge of the disease, and this is, therefore, a prime candidate for a VA-based digital health intervention. Objective In order to understand the capability of VAs, our aim was to assess VA responses to PPD questions in terms of accuracy, verbal response, and clinically appropriate advice given. Methods This cross-sectional study examined four VAs (Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Microsoft Cortana) installed on two mobile devices in early 2020. We posed 14 questions to each VA that were retrieved from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) patient-focused Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on PPD. We scored the VA responses according to accuracy of speech recognition, presence of a verbal response, and clinically appropriate advice in accordance with ACOG FAQ, which were assessed by two board-certified physicians. Results Accurate recognition of the query ranged from 79% to 100%. Verbal response ranged from 36% to 79%. If no verbal response was given, queries were treated like a web search between 33% and 89% of the time. Clinically appropriate advice given by VA ranged from 14% to 29%. We compared the category proportions using the Fisher exact test. No single VA statistically outperformed other VAs in the three performance categories. Additional observations showed that two VAs (Google Assistant and Microsoft Cortana) included advertisements in their responses. Conclusions While the best performing VA gave clinically appropriate advice to 29% of the PPD questions, all four VAs taken together achieved 64% clinically appropriate advice. All four VAs performed well in accurately recognizing a PPD query, but no VA achieved even a 30% threshold for providing clinically appropriate PPD information.

This guidance has been instrumental in promoting transparent evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate their impact on health outcomes. The SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials–Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trial protocols evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for trial reports: CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials–Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 26 candidate items, which were consulted upon by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The SPIRIT-AI extension includes 15 new items that were considered sufficiently important for clinical trial protocols of AI interventions. These new items should be routinely reported in addition to the core SPIRIT 2013 items. SPIRIT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention will be integrated, considerations for the handling of input and output data, the human–AI interaction and analysis of error cases. SPIRIT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness for clinical trial protocols for AI interventions. Its use will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the design and risk of bias for a planned clinical trial. The CONSORT-AI and SPIRIT-AI extensions improve the transparency of clinical trial design and trial protocol reporting for artificial intelligence interventions.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 91, 'citationCount': 554, 'authors': [{'authorId': '22447999', 'name': 'S.

Unlike formless conversational agents, like smart speakers or chatbots, VH bring together the capabilities of both a conversational agent and an interactive avatar (computer-represented digital characters). Although their use in patient-facing systems has garnered substantial interest, it is unknown to what extent VH are effective in health applications. Objective The purpose of this review was to examine the effectiveness of VH in patient-facing systems. The design and implementation characteristics of these systems were also examined. Methods Electronic bibliographic databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles with relevant key terms. Studies were included in the systematic review if they designed or evaluated VH in patient-facing systems. Of the included studies, studies that used a randomized controlled trial to evaluate VH were included in the meta-analysis; they were then summarized using the PICOTS framework (population, intervention, comparison group, outcomes, time frame, setting). Summary effect sizes, using random-effects models, were calculated, and the risk of bias was assessed. Results Among the 8,125 unique records identified, 53 articles describing 33 unique systems, were qualitatively, systematically reviewed. Two distinct design categories emerged — simple VH and VH augmented with health sensors and trackers. Of the 53 articles, 16 (26 studies) with 44 primary and 22 secondary outcomes were included in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of the 44 primary outcome measures revealed a significant difference between intervention and control conditions, favoring the VH intervention (SMD = .166, 95% CI .039-.292, P=.012), but with evidence of some heterogeneity, I2=49.3%. There were more cross-sectional (k=15) than longitudinal studies (k=11). The intervention was delivered using a personal computer in most studies (k=18), followed by a tablet (k=4), mobile kiosk (k=2), head-mounted display (k=1), and a desktop computer in a community center (k=1). Conclusions We offer evidence for the efficacy of VH in patient-facing systems. Considering that studies included different population and outcome types, more focused analysis is needed in the future.

Big data methodologies can augment this endeavour by allowing for the collection of naturalistic and personality–relevant digital traces from online environments. Whereas big data methods have primarily been used to catalogue static personality dimensions, here we present a case study in how they can be used to track dynamic fluctuations in psychological states. We apply a text–based, machine learning prediction model to Facebook status updates to compute weekly trajectories of emotional valence and arousal. We train this model on 2895 human–annotated Facebook statuses and apply the resulting model to 303 575 Facebook statuses posted by 640 US Facebook users who had previously self–reported their Big Five traits, yielding an average of 28 weekly estimates per user. We examine the correlations between model–predicted emotion and self–reported personality, providing a test of the robustness of these links when using weekly aggregated data, rather than momentary data as in prior work. We further present dynamic visualizations of weekly valence and arousal for every user, while making the final data set of 17 937 weeks openly available.

Aims were to assess the acceptability of a preconception VPA in women living in Australia and document the changes required to adapt Gabby to suit an Australian context. Taking a descriptive qualitative approach, nonpregnant female participants (n = 31), aged 18–45 years, living in metropolitan and regional Victoria, Australia interacted with Gabby. Focus groups (n = 7) that gathered participants’ perspectives of their experience with Gabby ran in July–August 2019 before being transcribed verbatim and thematically analyzed. Six interrelated themes and 12 subthemes were identified. Participants found VPAs to be an acceptable provider of health information with potential to increase women’s access preconception health advice. Gabby was considered to be trustworthy and was able to develop rapport with participants in a relatively short time. Context-specific, relevant, tailored and trustworthy information and advice were considered more important that Gabby’s physical appearance. Participants had strong opinions about potential technological advancements (e.g., reminders and rewards) and addressing navigation issues to increase Gabby’s acceptability. Participants envisaged that they would use Gabby for readily available and evidence-based information before seeking advice from a health professional if required.

Design: A mixed-methods approach consisting of a single group, before and after quasi-experimental design, and individual interview. Participants: Twenty older adults with depression from four LTC facilities in Taiwan were recruited. Intervention: Each participant participated in 8 weeks of observation and 8 weeks of intervention. In the observation stage, participants received usual care or activities without any research intervention. In the intervention stage, each participant was given a Paro (Personal Assistive RobOt) to keep for 24 hours, 7 days a week. Measurements: The Geriatric Depression Scale, the UCLA Loneliness Scale Version 3, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire for older adults were administered at four time points. Individual qualitative interviews with thematic analysis followed. Results: A repeated multivariate analysis of variance and Friedmanʼs test showed no significant changes during the observation stage between T1 and T2 for depression and quality of life (p >.5). For the intervention stage, statistically significant changes in decreasing depression and loneliness and improving quality of life over time were identified. Three themes emerged from the interviews: (i) humanizing Paro through referring to personal experiences and engagement; (ii) increased social interaction with other people; and (iii) companionship resulting in improved mental well-being. Conclusions: There were significant improvements in mental well-being in using Paro.

Methods We searched on PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and ACM Digital Library using a predefined search strategy. The studies were included if they: (1) were primary research studies that focused on consumers, caregivers, or health care professionals; (2) involved a conversational agent with an unconstrained natural language interface; (3) tested the system with human subjects; and (4) implemented personalization features. Results The search found 1958 publications. After abstract and full-text screening, 13 studies were included in the review. Common examples of personalized content included feedback, daily health reports, alerts, warnings, and recommendations. The personalization features were implemented without a theoretical framework of customization and with limited evaluation of its impact. While conversational agents with personalization features were reported to improve user satisfaction, user engagement and dialogue quality, the role of personalization in improving health outcomes was not assessed directly. Conclusions Most of the studies in our review implemented the personalization features without theoretical or evidence-based support for them and did not leverage the recent developments in other domains of personalization.

Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are technological entities that can interact with people through spoken conversation. Some ECAs are also relational agents, which build and maintain socioemotional relationships with people across multiple interactions. This study utilized a novel form of relational ECA, provided by Care Coach (care.coach, inc): an animated animal avatar on a tablet device, monitored and controlled by live health advocates. The ECA implemented algorithm-based clinical protocols for hospitalized older adults, such as reorienting patients to mitigate delirium risk, eliciting toileting needs to prevent falls, and engaging patients in social interaction to facilitate social engagement. Previous pilot studies of the Care Coach avatar have demonstrated the ECA’s usability and efficacy in home-dwelling older adults. Further study among hospitalized older adults in a larger experimental trial is needed to demonstrate its effectiveness. Objective The aim of the study was to examine the effect of a human-in-the-loop, protocol-driven relational ECA on loneliness, depression, delirium, and falls among diverse hospitalized older adults. Methods This was a clinical trial of 95 adults over the age of 65 years, hospitalized at an inner-city community hospital. Intervention participants received an avatar for the duration of their hospital stay; participants on a control unit received a daily 15-min visit from a nursing student. Measures of loneliness (3-item University of California, Los Angeles Loneliness Scale), depression (15-item Geriatric Depression Scale), and delirium (confusion assessment method) were administered upon study enrollment and before discharge. Results Participants who received the avatar during hospitalization had lower frequency of delirium at discharge (P<.001), reported fewer symptoms of loneliness (P=.01), and experienced fewer falls than control participants.

Due to the abundance of devices and ease of access they subsequently allow, the utility of mobile health (mHealth) has never been more endemic. A substantial amount of interactive and psychoeducational apps are readily available to download concerning a wide range of health issues. mHealth has the potential to reduce waiting times for appointments; eradicate the need to meet in person with a clinician, successively diminishing the workload of mental health professionals; be more cost effective to practices; and encourage self-care tactics. Previous research has given valid evidence with empirical studies proving the effectiveness of physical and mental health interventions using mobile apps. Alongside apps, there is evidence to show that receiving short message service (SMS) messages, which entail psychoeducation, medication reminders, and links to useful informative Web pages can also be advantageous to a patient’s mental and physical well-being. Available mHealth apps and SMS services and their ever improving quality necessitates a systematic review in the area in reference to reduction of symptomology, adherence to intervention, and usability. Objective The aim of this review was to study the efficacy, usability, and feasibility of mobile apps and SMS messages as mHealth interventions for self-guided care. Methods A systematic literature search was carried out in JMIR, PubMed, PsychINFO, PsychARTICLES, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, and SAGE. The search spanned from January 2008 to January 2017. The primary outcome measures consisted of weight management, (pregnancy) smoking cessation, medication adherence, depression, anxiety and stress. Where possible, adherence, feasibility, and usability outcomes of the apps or SMS services were evaluated. Between-group and within-group effect sizes (Cohen d) for the mHealth intervention method group were determined. Results A total of 27 studies, inclusive of 4658 participants were reviewed. The papers included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n=19), within-group studies (n=7), and 1 within-group study with qualitative aspect. Studies show improvement in physical health and significant reductions of anxiety, stress, and depression. Within-group and between-group effect sizes ranged from 0.05-3.37 (immediately posttest), 0.05-3.25 (1-month follow-up), 0.08-3.08 (2-month follow-up), 0.00-3.10 (3-month follow-up), and 0.02-0.27 (6-month follow-up). Usability and feasibility of mHealth interventions, where reported, also gave promising, significant results.

These findings have served to motivate research on how to better develop and disseminate evidence-based treatments for PTSD. The current article presents the use of Virtual Reality (VR) as a clinical tool to address the assessment, prevention, and treatment of PTSD, based on the VR projects that were evolved at the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies since 2004. A brief discussion of the definition and rationale for the clinical use of VR is followed by a description of a VR application designed for the delivery of prolonged exposure (PE) for treating Service Members (SMs) and Veterans with combat- and sexual assault-related PTSD. The expansion of the virtual treatment simulations of Iraq and Afghanistan for PTSD assessment and prevention is then presented. This is followed by a forward-looking discussion that details early efforts to develop virtual human agent systems that serve the role of virtual patients for training the next generation of clinical providers, as healthcare guides that can be used to support anonymous access to trauma-relevant behavioural healthcare information, and as clinical interviewers capable of automated behaviour analysis of users to infer psychological state.

Help4Mood supports self-report and biometric monitoring and includes elements of cognitive behavioural therapy. We aimed to evaluate system use and acceptability, to explore likely recruitment and retention rates in a clinical trial and to obtain an estimate of potential treatment response with a view to conducting a future randomised controlled trial (RCT). Methods We conducted a pilot RCT of Help4Mood in three centres, in Romania, Spain and Scotland, UK. Patients with diagnosed depression (major depressive disorder) and current mild/moderate depressive symptoms were randomised to use the system for four weeks in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) or to TAU alone. Results Twenty-seven individuals were randomised and follow-up data were obtained from 21 participants (12/13 Help4Mood, 9/14 TAU). Half of participants randomised to Help4Mood used it regularly (more than 10 times); none used it every day. Acceptability varied between users. Some valued the emotional responsiveness of the system, while others found it too repetitive. Intention to treat analysis showed a small difference in change of Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-2) scores (Help4Mood –5.7 points, TAU –4.2). Post-hoc on-treatment analysis suggested that participants who used Help4Mood regularly experienced a median change in BDI-2 of –8 points.

Photographic images have traditionally been used to explore emotion recognition impairments in schizophrenia patients, but they lack of the dynamism that is inherent to facial expressiveness. In order to overcome those inconveniences, over the last years different authors have proposed the use of virtual avatars. In this work, we present the results of a pilot study that explored the possibilities of using a realistic-looking avatar for the assessment of emotion recognition deficits in patients who suffer from schizophrenia. In the study, 20 subjects with schizophrenia of long evolution and 20 control subjects were invited to recognize a set of facial expressions of emotions showed by both the said virtual avatar and static images. Our results show that schizophrenic patients exhibit recognition deficits in emotion recognition from facial expressions regardless the type of stimuli (avatar or images), and that those deficits are related with the psychopathology. Finally, some improvements in recognition rates (RRs) for the patient group when using the avatar were observed for sadness or surprise expressions, and they even outperform the control group in the recognition of the happiness expression. This leads to conclude that, apart from the dynamism of the shown expression, the RRs for schizophrenia patients when employing animated avatars may depend on other factors which need to be further explored.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 62, 'citationCount': 21, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1403618495', 'name': 'Samuel Marcos-Pablos'}, {'authorId': '82496356', 'name': 'E.

One of these barriers might be the stigma associated with Medicaid or poverty.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOur mixed-methods study involved 574 low-income adults and included data from an in-person survey and follow-up interviews. Our analysis of the interviews showed that many participants who were on Medicaid or uninsured described a perception or fear of being treated poorly in the health care setting. We defined this experience as stigma and merged our qualitative interviews coded for stigma with our quantitative survey data to see whether stigma was related to other sociodemographic characteristics. We also examined whether stigma was associated with access to care, quality of care, and self-reported health.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nWe were unable to identify other sociodemographic characteristics associated with stigma in this low-income sample. The qualitative interviews suggested that stigma was most often the result of a provider-patient interaction that felt demeaning, rather than an internalized sense of shame related to receiving public insurance or charity care. An experience of stigma was associated with unmet health needs, poorer perceptions of quality of care, and worse health across several self-reported measures.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBecause a stigmatizing experience in the health system might interfere with the delivery of high-quality care to new Medicaid enrollees, further research and policy interventions that target stigma are warranted."", 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 37, 'citationCount': 111, 'authors': [{'authorId': '38466918', 'name': 'Heidi L.

Forty inactive adults (92.5% Latino) 55 years of age and older were randomized to a 4-month virtual advisor walking intervention or a waitlist control. Four-month increases in reported minutes of walking/week were greater in the virtual advisor arm (mean increase = 253.5 ± 248.7 minutes/week) relative to the control (mean increase = 26.8 ± 67.0 minutes/week; p = .0008).

The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of a virtual exercise coach to promote daily walking in community-dwelling persons with Parkinson disease. DesignTwenty subjects with Parkinson disease participated in this phase 1, single-group, nonrandomized clinical trial. The subjects were instructed to interact with the virtual exercise coach for 5 mins, wear a pedometer, and walk daily for 1 mo. Retention rate, satisfaction, and interaction history were assessed at 1 mo. Six-minute walk and gait speed were assessed at baseline and after the intervention. ResultsFifty-five percent of the participants were women, and the mean age was 65.6 yrs. At the study completion, there was 100% retention rate. The subjects had a mean satisfaction score of 5.6/7 (with 7 indicating maximal satisfaction) with the virtual exercise coach. Interaction history revealed that the participants logged in for a mean (SD) of 25.4 (7) days of the recommended 30 days. The mean adherence to daily walking was 85%. Both gait speed and the 6-min walk test significantly improved (P < 0.05). No adverse events were reported.

Their results were consistent with previous findings: Depressed EAs showed a pattern of diminished reactivity to the sad film (less crying, less intense reports of sadness) compared with nondepressed participants. In contrast, depressed AAs showed a pattern of heightened emotional reactivity (greater crying) compared with nondepressed participants.

Patient: You know, when you discover a lump in your breast, you kind of feelwell, kind of(her speech tapers off; she looks down; tears form in her eyes). Dr. A: When did you actually discover the lump? Patient: (absently) I don't know. It's been a while. 2. Patient: (same as above) Dr. B: That sounds frightening. Patient: Well, yeah, sort of. Dr. B: Sort of frightening? Patient: Yeah and I guess I'm feeling like my life is over. Dr. B: I see. Worried and sad too. Patient: That's it, Doctor. Dr. A's patient may well go home feeling unheard and misunderstood. Dr. B's patient, while equally distressed about the possibility of having breast cancer, may leave the office believing that her doctor understands her. One of the most widespread and persistent complaints of patients today is that their physicians don't listen. For their part, physicians complain that they no longer have sufficient time to spend with patients, and they often blame economic pressures imposed by managed care (1, 2). Nonetheless, they acknowledge that personal encounters with patients constitute the most satisfying aspect of their professional lives. They recognize that empathy, the ability to connect with patientsin a deep sense, to listen, to pay attentionlies at the heart of medical practice (1, 3, 4). In clinical medicine, empathy is the ability to understand the patient's situation, perspective, and feelings and to communicate that understanding to the patient. The effective use of empathy promotes diagnostic accuracy, therapeutic adherence, and patient satisfaction, while remaining time-efficient (5-11). Empathy also enhances physician satisfaction (12). As with any other tool, clinical empathy requires systematic practice to achieve mastery (13, 14). Certain well-timed words and sentences facilitate empathy during the clinical encounter. These words that work are the subject of this paper. Empathy in Theory Tichener coined the term empathy in 1909 from two Greek roots, em and pathos (feeling into) (15). For some 50 years thereafter, empathy was discussed in the psychological and psychoanalytic literature as a type of vicarious emotional response (16-23). For example, Katz (24) wrote when we experience empathy, [it is] as if we were experiencing someone else's feelings as our own. We see, we feel, we respond, and we understand as if we were, in fact, the other person. Lief and Fox (25) diluted this strong sense of identification when they used the word to designate the vector for detached concern. They wrote that empathy involves an emotional understanding of the patient, while maintaining sufficient separation so that expert medical skills can be rationally applied to the patient's problem (25). In practice, emotional understanding has to be tested by checking back with the patient, and its accuracy is enhanced through iteration. The concept of empathy has three important implications. First, empathy has a cognitive focus. The clinician enters into the perspective and experience of the other person by using verbal and nonverbal cues, but she neither loses her own perspective nor collapses clinical distance. Second, empathy also has an affective or emotional focus. The clinician's ability to put herself in the patient's placeor walk a mile in his moccasinsrequires the experience of surrogate or resonant feelings (26). Finally, the definition requires that clinical empathy have an action component. One cannot know without feedback. The practitioner communicates understanding by checking back with the patient, using, for example, statements such as Let me see if I have this right or I want to be sure I understand what you mean. This gives the patient opportunities to correct or modulate the physician's formulation. At the same time it expresses the physician's desire to listen deeply, thereby reinforcing a bond or connection between clinician and patient. Empathy is sometimes confused with sympathy, or emotional identification with the patient's plight. Sympathetic responses include a physician's feeling sad and becoming teary eyed when his patient starts crying, or a physician's experiencing righteous anger when her patient recounts an injustice. Sympathy also applies to feelings of loss that people experience in response to another's loss. When present, sympathy often contributes to the physicianpatient relationship, yet physicians may not always exhibit sympathy because some patients are disagreeable, culpable, or unlikable. Empathy, by contrast, does not depend on having congruent feelings and thus may be more versatile. A physician can be empathic even when he or she cannot be sympathetic (27, 28). Numerous investigators have demonstrated the importance of empathy in the medical encounter. Empathy allows the patient to feel understood, respected, and validated. This promotes patient satisfaction, enhances the quantity and quality of clinical data, improves adherence, and generates a more therapeutic physicianpatient relationship (5-11, 29-31). To achieve these goals, medical educators conceptualized empathy as a set of teachable and learnable skills and developed a new focus on communication skills in the medical curriculum (13, 14, 32-36). More recently, some educators have explored the roles of narrative and literature in teaching clinical empathy (37-39), and others have emphasized the importance of reflection and self-awareness in maintaining one's empathic skills (40-44). Empathy in Practice Clinical empathy can be visualized as a positive feedback loop, or a neurologic track with afferent and efferent components (45, 46). The afferent arm includes verbal and nonverbal cues that lead to the practitioner's initial appraisal or understanding of the patient's message. The efferent arm includes the practitioner's responsesqueries such as Tell me more or statements such as I can imagine how difficult it is. Such responses elicit additional information. While it is impossible for the clinician to understand exactly how the patient feels, in clinical empathy successive cycles may lead to a clearer, more accurate fix on the patient's perspective and feelings. Thus, empathic communication includes the following components. Active Listening This requires nonverbal and paralanguage skills, such as appropriate position and posture; good eye contact; mirroring of facial expression; and facilitative responses, such as nodding and minimal expressions (for example, Hmmm and Uh-huh). It also demands that the physician remain silent and focus her attention on the patient's story (47, 48). Framing or Sign Posting Clinicians often initiate an empathic response when they pick up a suggestion or indication that the patient is experiencing concern, conflict, or emotion. Because accurate understanding is not commonly attempted in ordinary conversation, patients may be unaccustomed to empathic responses. Clinicians may need to disclose their intent, providing a frame or signpost for the patient (35). Lengthy warning may be inefficient and exhausting, so we usually abbreviate it in these ways: Let's see if I have this right. Sounds like what you're telling me is Or simply Sounds like Reflecting the Content An empathic response accurately identifies the factual content of the patient's statement, as well as the nature and intensity of the patient's feelings, concerns, or quandaries. A reflection of content (symptoms or ideas) might sound like the following: So you were fine until this morning when you woke up with pain in your belly, and it's been growing more severe ever since. Sounds like you think that you have appendicitis and that you might need to go into the hospital. The physician may also mirror the patient's interests and values: So, if I'm hearing you right, what you really enjoy is going out at night with your friends and having a few drinks. Identifying and Calibrating the Emotion Clinical empathy often entails responding to the patients' expressed (or suggested) feelings. This means identifying the emotion and calibrating its intensity. Sometimes emotional content is evident, but the nature of the emotion is unclear. In such cases the patient will often reveal the feeling, if given an opportunity. Tell me how you're feeling about this. I have the sense that you feel strongly, but I'm not sure I understand exactly what the feeling is. Can you tell me? The following are examples of empathic responses to patient statements that express sadness, fear, anger, distrust, and ambivalence. Sadness: That must have been a pretty painful experience for you, you sound like it was very sad. Fear: Sounds like you were really frightened when you discovered that lump. Anger: That situation really got to you, didn't it? I can imagine how angry I'd feel if that happened to me. Distrust: It seems you're not sure whether you should trust me further after I didn't get that test result back to you last week. Ambivalence: It seems to me that you're caught in a bind about whether to stop smoking or not. Feelings vary markedly in intensity; often, clinicians tend to sanitize or dilute them. Consider this example: Patient: Most days the pain is so terrible that I just want to stay in bed. I just stare at the ceiling what's the point of it all? Doctor: So you're frustrated about the pain? In this case, the physician identified an emotion (frustration) but failed to capture the patient's profound sense of helplessness. Weak affective words such as bother, annoy, upset, uneasy, and apprehensive are sometimes appropriate. At other times, red-blooded adjectives such as infuriated, enraged, tormented, overwhelmed, and terrified are more in order. This patient feels so depressed and helpless that he asks, What's the point of it all? By hearing only annoyance or frustration in the statement, the physician missed a diagnostic cue and perhaps a useful path of inquiry and has distanced herself from the patient.

We randomized 28 people on ART to either a standard or augmented version of the smartphone application. The augmented version contained components that illustrated participants' current estimated plasma concentrations of antiretroviral drugs and the immune protection provided by ART. Adherence to ART was assessed at baseline and at 3 months using self-reported adherence, pharmacy dispensing records, and HIV viral load. Information was also collected on illness and medication beliefs and use of the application. Participants who received the augmented application showed a significantly higher level of self-reported adherence to ART at 3 months (p=0.03) and decreased viral load (p=0.023) as compared to individuals using the standard version.

Realistically, there exists a complex interplay of design, implementation, politics, and learning needs in the development and integration of software for education, each of which may be further amplified by the somewhat siloed roles of programmers, faculty, and students. LINDSAY Presenter is newly designed software that permits faculty and students to model and manipulate three‐dimensional anatomy presentations and images, while including embedded quizzes, links, and text‐based content. A validated tool measuring impact across pedagogy, resources, interactivity, freedom, granularity, and factors outside the immediate learning event was used in conjunction with observation, field notes, and focus groups to critically examine the impact of attitudes and perceptions of all stakeholders in the early implementation of LINDSAY Presenter before and after a three‐week trial period with the software. Results demonstrate that external, personal media usage, along with students' awareness of the need to apply anatomy to clinical professional situations drove expectations of LINDSAY Presenter. A focus on the software over learning, which can be expected during initial orientation, surprisingly remained after three weeks of use. The time‐intensive investment required to create learning content is a detractor from user‐generated content and may reflect the consumption nature of other forms of digital learning. Early excitement over new technologies needs to be tempered with clear understanding of what learning is afforded, and how these constructively support future application and integration into professional practice.
