0,38155bff1ff6c2ee9d21972f950b0ebfb2b9eaab,Teaching Emotional Regulation and Awareness Through a Virtual Reality Rhythm Game,"Programs designed to promote social-emotional learning (SEL) in high-school students are increasingly being used in schools to facilitate academic and life success, including teaching how to identify and manage emotions. This paper explores the use of VR and drumming in emotional regulation through the development of HeartTune, a VR rhythm game that complements self-awareness and self-management learning. The game is developed with the participation of Coschool, a program in Colombia that uses culturally-appropriate experiences to teach emotional-regulation skills to at-risk youth, and seeks to help students develop skills such as relaxation techniques, emotional expression, and emotional literacy through culturally-situated rhythm gaming.",2022,29,0,"{'name': '2022 IEEE Games, Entertainment,

Anxiety leads to substantial long-term problems and may underlie disruptive behaviors in the classroom as a result of the individual’s inability to tolerate anxiety-provoking situations. Thus, interventions in special needs schools that help adolescents cope with anxiety and, in turn, diminish disruptive classroom behaviors are needed. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a virtual reality biofeedback game, DEEP, on daily levels of state-anxiety and disruptive classroom behavior in a clinical sample. In addition, the study also aimed to examine the duration of the calm or relaxed state after playing DEEP. Methods A total of 8 adolescents attending a special secondary school for students with behavioral and psychiatric problems participated in a single-case experimental ABAB study. Over a 4-week period, participants completed 6 DEEP sessions. In addition, momentary assessments (ie, 3 times a day) of self-reported state-anxiety and teacher-reported classroom behavior were collected throughout all A and B phases. Results From analyzing the individual profiles, it was found that 6 participants showed reductions in anxiety, and 5 participants showed reductions in disruptive classroom behaviors after the introduction of DEEP. On a group level, results showed a small but significant reduction of anxiety (d=–0.29) and a small, nonsignificant reduction of disruptive classroom behavior (d=−0.16) on days when participants played DEEP. Moreover, it was found that the calm or relaxed state of participants after playing DEEP lasted for about 2 hours on average. Conclusions This study demonstrates the potential of the game, DEEP, as an intervention for anxiety and disruptive classroom behavior in a special school setting. Future research is needed to fully optimize and personalize DEEP as an intervention for the heterogeneous special school population.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 85, 'citationCount': 37, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1589467497', 'name': 'Rineke Bossenbroek'}, {'authorId': '5712457', 'name': 'A.

The aim of this study was to examine pre-service teachers’ (PST) perceptions about VR, inclusive of their beliefs about its capacity to be used as a teaching and learning tool. A case-study, conducted at an urban university in Australia involved a sample of n = 41. Participants’ positive perceptions of VR in their teaching relate to its potential to engage learners, the immersive potential of the platform and the scope of VR to offer students experiences they might otherwise not have with other learning tools. Concerns expressed by PSTs include their relatively low self-efficacy to use VR in their teaching, monitoring-related matters, financial cost and implementing the technology in a safe and supportive way. There was a significant difference in PSTs’ amount of self-efficacy to teach using VR when compared to their overall confidence to use digital technologies. PSTs typically had greater awareness of the immersive and engagement potential of VR and less awareness about its potential to foster and promote collaborative learning.

They're learning how to handle new demands in school and social life while dealing with new, intense emotions (both positive and negative), and they're increasingly feeling that they should do so without adult guidance. Social and emotional learning (SEL) programs are one way to help them navigate these difficulties.SEL programs try to help adolescents cope with their difficulties more successfully by improving skills and mindsets, and they try to create respectful school environments that young people want to be a part of by changing the school's climate. In this article, David Yeager defines those terms and explains the changes that adolescents experience with the onset of puberty. Then he reviews a variety of SEL programs to see what works best with this age group.On the positive side, Yeager finds that effective universal SEL can transform adolescents' lives for the better. Less encouragingly, typical SEL programs—which directly teach skills and invite participants to rehearse those skills over the course of many classroom lessons—have a poor track record with middle adolescents (roughly age 14 to 17), even though they work well with children.But some programs stand out for their effectiveness with adolescents. Rather than teaching them skills, Yeager finds, effective programs for adolescents focus on mindsets and climate. Harnessing adolescents' developmental motivations, such programs aim to make them feel respected by adults and peers and offer them the chance to gain status and admiration in the eyes of people whose opinions they value."", 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 74, 'citationCount': 115, 'authors': [{'authorId': '34677298', 'name': 'D.

A randomized controlled trial (n = 138) was conducted to test the effectiveness of a biofeedback video game (Dojo) for adolescents with elevated levels of anxiety. Adolescents (11–15 years old) were randomly assigned to play Dojo or a control game (Rayman 2: The Great Escape). Initial screening for anxiety was done on 1,347 adolescents in five high schools; only adolescents who scored above the “at-risk” cut-off on the Spence Children Anxiety Survey were eligible. Adolescents’ anxiety levels were assessed at pre-test, post-test, and at three month follow-up to examine the extent to which playing Dojo decreased adolescents’ anxiety. The present study revealed equal improvements in anxiety symptoms in both conditions at follow-up and no differences between Dojo and the closely matched control game condition. Latent growth curve models did reveal a steeper decrease of personalized anxiety symptoms (not of total anxiety symptoms) in the Dojo condition compared to the control condition. Moderation analyses did not show any differences in outcomes between boys and girls nor did age differentiate outcomes. The present results are of importance for prevention science, as this was the first full-scale randomized controlled trial testing indicated prevention effects of a video game aimed at reducing anxiety.

In doing so, the primary aim of this article is to provide a foundation and set an agenda for future research on the design of technology that would support, and help teach, social and emotional skills. We identify the key challenges to successful learning shared by SEL programs in education—such as embedding skills learned in class also into everyday situations, promoting reflection, and providing additional opportunities for practice—and outline how these could be addressed by digital technology. Overall, our key argument is that much existing HCI work could be used in support of social and emotional skills learning in education, and possibly other domains, but that the topic has not been explored so far.

This is useful technology and makes our lives easier. However, existing virtual assistants have provided generic information, not domain-specific information. For examples, if you ask Siri a very specific question about events in your company, Siri will most likely not able to return a correct answer because it relies on a result of Google search and in many cases, Google does not know domain-specific information. To address this issue, we develop Slemp, a virtual assistant for regulation-dense organizations that possess a large quantity of specific and unique rules or guidelines. Using Slemp, users can easily feed domain-specific information and use their own virtual assistant to provide specific answers to users in their organizations. In this paper, we demonstrate the design and development of Slemp for our institute, Virginia Military Institute, and our work cannot be easily adopted by other similar organizations.",2021,10,0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Information Science and Systems'},"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-6.381869792938232, -3.1195974349975586,

Voice-controlled and Internet-connected devices allow intuitive device controlling and monitoring from all around the globe and define a new era of human–machine interaction. Although VAs are especially successful in home automation, they also show great potential as artificial intelligence-driven laboratory assistants. Possible applications include stepwise reading of standard operating procedures (SOPs) and recipes, recitation of chemical substance or reaction parameters to a control, and readout of laboratory devices and sensors. In this study, we present a retrofitting approach to make standard laboratory instruments part of the Internet of Things (IoT). We established a voice user interface (VUI) for controlling those devices and reading out specific device data. A benchmark of the established infrastructure showed a high mean accuracy (95% ± 3.62) of speech command recognition and reveals high potential for future applications of a VUI within the laboratory. Our approach shows the general applicability of commercially available VAs as laboratory assistants and might be of special interest to researchers with physical impairments or low vision. The developed solution enables a hands-free device control, which is a crucial advantage within the daily laboratory routine.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 30, 'citationCount': 43, 'authors': [{'authorId': '51093064', 'name': 'J.

The use of mobile technology to improve patient flow and quality of care could be facilitated if such voice recognition technology could be made robust. The goal of this experiment was to allow the Periop staff to provide care without being interrupted with data entry and querying tasks. However, the results are generalizable to other situations where an engineering manager attempts to improve communication performance using mobile technology. This study enhanced Google’s voice recognition capability by using post-processing classifiers (i.e., bag-of-sentences, support vector machine, and maximum entropy). The experiments investigated three factors (original phrasing, reduced phrasing, and personalized phrasing) at three levels (zero training repetition, 5 training repetitions, and 10 training repetitions). Results indicated that personal phrasing yielded the highest correctness and that training the device to recognize an individual’s voice improved correctness as well. Although simplistic, the bag-of-sentences classifier significantly improved voice recognition correctness. The classification efficiency of the maximum entropy and support vector machine algorithms was found to be nearly identical. These results suggest that engineering managers could significantly enhance Google’s voice recognition technology by using post-processing techniques, which would facilitate its use in health care and other applications.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 51, 'citationCount': 11, 'authors': [{'authorId': '47465516', 'name': 'M.

It can be used as a replacement for statistical procedures to find data, to extract text, to find missing data in a class, to improve search engines and it also finds various applications in medical fields. Many Decision tree algorithms have been formulated. They have different accuracy and cost effectiveness. It is also very important for us to know which algorithm is best to use. The ID3 is one of the oldest Decision tree algorithms. It is very useful while making simple decision trees but as the complications increases its accuracy to make good Decision trees decreases.

A generalization of the Levenshtein distance (Damerau?Levenshtein distance) allows the transposition of two characters as an operation. Some Translation Environment Tools, such as translation memory leveraging applications, use the Levenhstein algorithm to measure the edit distance between two fuzzy matching content segments.The metric is named after Vladimir Levenshtein, who considered this distance in 1965.

3,775b12be79d691c8ef4a7e0216a7f2a91a425d12,The feasibility of a emotional regulation group conducted with virtual adaptations within an adult community learning disability service,"Group-based interventions may be helpful for reducing psychological distress for adults with learning disabilities. The aim was to evaluate the group in terms of its feasibility and online adaptations from a service user and group facilitator perspective. A six-session group intervention was undertaken on three occasions. Thematic analysis of participant’s qualitative feedback identified two themes, ‘Enjoying attending the group’ and ‘Skills development’. Facilitators identified several positive aspects of the group. A paired-samples t-test identified no significant difference at post-intervention. The group demonstrated success in the overall feasibility of delivering a therapy group remotely.",2023,30,0,{'name': 'FPID Bulletin: The Bulletin of the Faculty for People with Intellectual

Our commentary adds to these discussions by considering COVID-19, lockdown and (disability) sport. This is especially pertinent given the positioning of disabled people as particularly “vulnerable” in relation to current political discourse. Four key points of discussion are focused upon. First, we explore how the media has attended to issues concerning (disability) sport during lockdown. Second, consideration is given to how sporting and physical activity opportunities have been promoted during lockdown. Third, we focus on the notion of inclusion and explore the ways in which this has thrived during lockdown. Fourth, attention is given to community (disability) sport post-lockdown and what this may mean for disability sport. We conclude by arguing that the future legacy of lockdown and COVID-19 will tell us much about how disabled people have really been embraced within sport.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 29, 'citationCount': 45, 'authors': [{'authorId': '96467479', 'name': 'H.

However, many clinicians feel ill equipped to deliver therapy via telehealth, while adhering to evidence‐based interventions. This article draws together clinician experiences of the issues that should be attended to, and how to address them within a telehealth framework. Method Seventy clinical colleagues of the authors were emailed and invited to share their concerns online about how to deliver cognitive‐behavioral therapy for eating disorders (CBT‐ED) via telehealth, and how to adapt clinical practice to deal with the problems that they and others had encountered. After 96\u2009hr, all the suggestions that had been shared by 22 clinicians were collated to provide timely advice for other clinicians. Results A range of themes emerged from the online discussion. A large proportion were general clinical and practical domains (patient and therapist concerns about telehealth; technical issues in implementing telehealth; changes in the environment), but there were also specific considerations and clinical recommendations about the delivery of CBT‐ED methods. Discussion Through interaction and sharing of ideas, clinicians across the world produced a substantial number of recommendations about how to use telehealth to work with people with eating disorders while remaining on track with evidence‐based practice. These are shared to assist clinicians over the period of changed practice.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 30, 'citationCount': 111, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144838563', 'name': 'G.

However, there are barriers that constrain group attendance, such as mobility, time, and distance. Using videoconferencing may overcome known barriers and improve the accessibility of group-based interventions. Objective The aim of this study was to review the literature to determine the feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, and implementation of health professional–led group videoconferencing to provide education or social support or both, into the home setting. Methods Electronic databases were searched using predefined search terms for primary interventions for patient education and/or social support. The quality of studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. We developed an analysis framework using hierarchical terms feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, and implementation, which were informed by subheadings. Results Of the 1634 records identified, 17 were included in this review. Home-based groups by videoconferencing are feasible even for those with limited digital literacy. Overall acceptability was high with access from the home highly valued and little concern of privacy issues. Some participants reported preferring face-to-face groups. Good information technology (IT) support and training is required for facilitators and participants. Communication can be adapted for the Web environment and would be enhanced by clear communication strategies and protocols. A range of improved outcomes were reported but because of the heterogeneity of studies, comparison of these across studies was not possible. There was a trend for improvement in mental health outcomes. Benefits highlighted in the qualitative data included engaging with others with similar problems; improved accessibility to groups; and development of health knowledge, insights, and skills. Videoconference groups were able to replicate group processes such as bonding and cohesiveness. Similar outcomes were reported for those comparing face-to-face groups and videoconference groups. Conclusions Groups delivered by videoconference are feasible and potentially can improve the accessibility of group interventions. This may be particularly useful for those who live in rural areas, have limited mobility, are socially isolated, or fear meeting new people.

However, what the added value is of client feedback specifically within cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), is not known. Therefore, the extent to which the outcome of CBT can be improved is investigated by providing feedback from clients to therapists using the Outcome Rating Scale (ORS) and Session Rating Scale (SRS). Method: Outpatients (n\u2009=\u20091006) of a Dutch mental health organization either participated in the “treatment as usual” (TAU) condition, or in Feedback condition of the study. Clients were invited to fill in the ORS and SRS and in the Feedback condition therapists were asked to frequently discuss client feedback. Results: Outcome on the SCL-90 was only improved specifically with mood disorders in the Feedback condition. Also, in the Feedback condition, in terms of process, the total number of required treatment sessions was on average two sessions fewer. Conclusion: Frequently asking feedback from clients using the ORS/SRS does not necessarily result in a better treatment outcome in CBT. However, for an equal treatment outcome significantly fewer sessions are needed within the Feedback condition, thus improving efficiency of CBT.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 62, 'citationCount': 58, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1817122280', 'name': 'P.

Literature suggests that the issues that are important in psychological therapy with the nonlearning disabled population should not lose significance with individuals with learning disabilities. Despite this, there exists a poor empirical and theoretical understanding of the complexities of the therapeutic relationship, when the individual has a learning disability. As a discipline, Counselling Psychology has a particular interest and skill base in understanding the therapeutic relationship and is therefore in a position to offer a valuable contribution to understanding the therapeutic relationship when an individual has a learning disability. Through eight semi-structured interviews, counselling psychologists currently working with individuals with learning disabilities were asked to share their experiences and understanding of the nature and role of the therapeutic relationship. A qualitative methodology guided by interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) enabled detailed exploration of the counselling psychologists' perspective. Themes emerged identifying the therapeutic relationship as fundamental yet difficult due to variables such as the client's experience in relationships, the need for multiple relationships, the experience of needing to facilitate reassurance and the necessary skills for therapeutic approaches. Themes also emerged relating to therapist's motivations, values and needs when working with this client group and tensions concerning individualisation and the setting culture.

High levels of self-efficacy help a person to confidently perform and achieve his goals. The positive moderating influence of self-efficacy has been studied in many contexts. The self-efficacy levels of a person are influenced by various factors like performance accomplishment, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion and physiological states. In this study, we have explored the relationship between self-efficacy, perceived stress and happiness among the students of Amrita School of Engineering, Coimbatore, which is known for a very high level of academic rigour in the programme. This rigour causes stress among the students. We wanted to see if higher level of self-efficacy helps to reduce the perceived stress thus enhancing the happiness level among the students. The data was collected using a survey instrument with the scales to measure self-efficacy, perceived stress and happiness borrowed from the literature. The sample size was 152. The results showed moderate to strong support for the conceptualized hypotheses. A moderate but inverse relationship was found between self-efficacy and perceived stress, as well as perceived stress and happiness.

Distress among medical students has serious professional ramifications, including damaging effects on empathy, ethical conduct, and professionalism, as well as personal consequences such as substance abuse, broken relationships, and suicidal ideation. Given the effect of physician distress on quality of care, self-care (including personal appraisal of well-being, wellness promotion, and recognition of when help is needed) should be recognized as a core competency for physicians. In this issue of Academic Medicine, investigators at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine explore the benefits of teaching students to employ a cognitive behavioral approach to improving self-care. Beyond its demonstrated short-term efficacy, the approach they propose also has potential to help students develop the skills necessary to assess and promote resilience throughout their careers. Medical schools' responsibility to promote student wellness, however, goes beyond teaching students self-care skills and includes establishing an appropriate organizational culture and learning environment to promote student health. Achieving competency in self-care is a shared responsibility of the individual physician/resident/medical student and the organizational environment in which he or she functions."", 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 20, 'citationCount': 102, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3616348', 'name': 'L.

The PSS showed adequate reliability and, as predicted, was correlated with life-event scores, depressive and physical symptomatology, utilization of health services, social anxiety, and smoking-reduction maintenance. In all comparisons, the PSS was a better predictor of the outcome in question than were life-event scores. When compared to a depressive symptomatology scale, the PSS was found to measure a different and independently predictive construct. Additional data indicate adequate reliability and validity of a four-item version of the PSS for telephone interviews. The PSS is suggested for examining the role of nonspecific appraised stress in the etiology of disease and behavioral disorders and as an outcome measure of experienced levels of stress.

One hundred thirty-three (76% females) completed at least 1 follow-up visit and were included in data analyses.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nParticipants learned a simple mantra-based meditation technique in 4, 1-hour small-group meetings, with instructions to practice for 15-20 minutes twice daily. Instruction was based on a psychophysiological model of meditation practice and its expected effects on stress.\n\n\nOUTCOME MEASURES\nBaseline and monthly follow-up measures of Profile of Mood States; Perceived Stress Scale; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI); and Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Practice frequency was indexed by monthly retrospective ratings. Neuroticism was evaluated as a potential moderator of treatment effects.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll 4 outcome measures improved significantly after instruction, with reductions from baseline that ranged from 14% (STAI) to 36% (BSI). More frequent practice was associated with better outcome. Higher baseline neuroticism scores were associated with greater improvement.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPreliminary evidence suggests that even brief instruction in a simple meditation technique can improve negative mood and perceived stress in healthy adults, which could yield long-term health benefits.

Emotional regulation represents a significant hallmark of cognitive development and an important achievement associated with social, behavioral, and academic competence; therefore, people with intellectual disabilities need to learn how to regulate their emotions appropriately. An approach to support the emotional regulation interventions of this population is interactive technology such as video games, interactive floors, and virtual reality. The literature includes some works on the design, development, and evaluation of technology for emotional regulation for populations that share some characteristics with people with intellectual disabilities, such as ASD and ADHD; however, the design of this technology does not consider some characteristics of people with intellectual disabilities.

In this context, it is increasingly common for preschool schools to incorporate students with special educational needs, including those with Down syndrome. These inclusion cases have been sparsely documented, so an investigation was proposed whose main objective was to know the characteristics of the teaching practice of those who work with these students. This approach was generated from four dimensions: personal, interpersonal, institutional and didactic. A qualitative research perspective and case study method were adopted. Three educators with experience in inclusion to students with Down syndrome participated. The technique used was the semi-structured interview, the data were categorized inductively. It was identified that teachers: have conceptual clarity in inclusive education and barriers to learning and participation; are looking for continuous training spaces for a relevant practice; emphasize the leadership as favorable for an inclusive education; its didactic planning privileges learning for life with the use of teaching materials; emphasize the importance of taking care of the student's location in the classroom, as well as following work routines; develop a qualitative evaluation of learning and promote collaborative work with parents and regular classroom support services.

7,850ce84d97927da3180ebe99d511ed84b99520f8,A Virtual Hope Box: Randomized Controlled Trial of a Smartphone App for Emotional Regulation and Coping With Distress.,"OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the Virtual Hope Box (VHB), a smartphone app to improve stress coping skills, suicidal ideation, and perceived reasons for living among patients at elevated risk of suicide and self-harm.


METHODS
The authors conducted a parallel-group randomized controlled trial with two groups of U.S. service veterans in active mental health treatment who had recently expressed suicidal ideation. Between March 2014 and April 2015, 118 patients were enrolled in the study. Participants were assigned to use the VHB (N=58) or to a control group that received printed materials about coping with suicidality (N=60) to supplement treatment as usual over a 12-week period. Three measures-the Coping Self-Efficacy Scale, Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, and Brief Reasons for Living Inventory-were collected at baseline (before randomization) and three, six, and 12 weeks. Secondary measures-the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale, and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale-were collected at baseline and 12 weeks.


RESULTS
VHB users reported significantly greater ability to cope with unpleasant emotions and thoughts (Coping Self-Efficacy Scale) at three (b=2.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]=.29-4.55) and 12 weeks (b=2.99, 95% CI=.08-5.90) compared with the control group. No significant advantage was found on other outcome measures for treatment augmented by the VHB.


CONCLUSIONS
The VHB is a demonstrably useful accessory to treatment-an easily accessible tool that can increase stress coping skills. Because the app is easily disseminated across a large population, it is likely to have broad, positive utility in behavioral health care.",2017,26,85,"{'name': 'Psychiatric services', 'pages': '\n          330-336\n        ', 'volume': '68 4'}",,"[{'authorId': '40146228', 'name': 'N.

Information Technology can have an effect on quality and efficiency of care. Aims: The aim of this study is to gain the viewpoint of service users from a local mental health service in developing a mental health app. Method: A qualitative descriptive approach was used. Eight volunteers aged 18–49 years were interviewed with the aid of a semi-structured questionnaire. Results: Interviewees defined a good app by its ease of use. Common themes included availability of contact information, identifying triggers, the ability to rate mood/anxiety levels on a scale, guided relaxation techniques, and the option to personalise the app. The researchers will aim to produce an app that is easily accessible, highly personalisable and will include functions highlighted as important (i.e. contact information, etc.). Conclusions: This research will assist in the development of an easy-to-use app that could increase access to services, and allow service users to take an active role in their care. In previous studies, apps were developed without the involvement of service users.

We have introduced a state-of-the-art method for the current study for remote behavioral monitoring that transports assessment out of the clinic and into the environments in which individuals negotiate their daily lives. The objective of this study was to examine whether the information captured with multimodal smartphone sensors can serve as behavioral markers for one's mental health. We hypothesized that (a) unobtrusively collected smartphone sensor data would be associated with individuals' daily levels of stress, and (b) sensor data would be associated with changes in depression, stress, and subjective loneliness over time.\n\n\nMETHOD\nA total of 47 young adults (age range: 19-30 years) were recruited for the study. Individuals were enrolled as a single cohort and participated in the study over a 10-week period. Participants were provided with smartphones embedded with a range of sensors and software that enabled continuous tracking of their geospatial activity (using the Global Positioning System and wireless fidelity), kinesthetic activity (using multiaxial accelerometers), sleep duration (modeled using device-usage data, accelerometer inferences, ambient sound features, and ambient light levels), and time spent proximal to human speech (i.e., speech duration using microphone and speech detection algorithms). Participants completed daily ratings of stress, as well as pre- and postmeasures of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; Spitzer, Kroenke, & Williams, 1999), stress (Perceived Stress Scale; Cohen et al., 1983), and loneliness (Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale; Russell, Peplau, & Cutrona, 1980).\n\n\nRESULTS\nMixed-effects linear modeling showed that sensor-derived geospatial activity (p < .05), sleep duration (p < .05), and variability in geospatial activity (p < .05), were associated with daily stress levels. Penalized functional regression showed associations between changes in depression and sensor-derived speech duration (p < .05), geospatial activity (p < .05), and sleep duration (p < .05). Changes in loneliness were associated with sensor-derived kinesthetic activity (p < .01).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE\nSmartphones can be harnessed as instruments for unobtrusive monitoring of several behavioral indicators of mental health. Creative leveraging of smartphone sensing could provide novel opportunities for close-to-invisible psychiatric assessment at a scale and efficiency that far exceeds what is currently feasible with existing assessment technologies."", 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 47, 'citationCount': 311, 'authors': [{'authorId': '101333432', 'name': 'Dror Ben-Zeev'}, {'authorId': '47173776', 'name': 'E.

Assessment of incidence of suicide attempts during the follow-up period was conducted with the Suicide Attempt Self-Injury Interview. Inclusion criteria were the presence of suicidal ideation with intent to die during the past week and/or a suicide attempt within the past month. Soldiers were excluded if they had a medical or psychiatric condition that would prevent informed consent or participation in outpatient treatment, such as active psychosis or mania. To determine treatment efficacy with regard to incidence and time to suicide attempt, survival curve analyses were conducted. Differences in psychiatric symptoms were evaluated using longitudinal random-effects models.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFrom baseline to the 24-month follow-up assessment, eight participants in brief CBT (13.8%) and 18 participants in treatment as usual (40.2%) made at least one suicide attempt (hazard ratio=0.38, 95% CI=0.16-0.87, number needed to treat=3.88), suggesting that soldiers in brief CBT were approximately 60% less likely to make a suicide attempt during follow-up than soldiers in treatment as usual.

To optimize online assessment of suicidal patients, there is a need for short, good-quality tools to assess elevated risk of future suicidal behavior. Computer adaptive testing (CAT) can be used to reduce response burden and improve accuracy, and make the available pencil-and-paper tools more appropriate for online administration. Objective The aim was to test whether an item response–based computer adaptive simulation can be used to reduce the length of the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS). Methods The data used for our simulation was obtained from a large multicenter trial from The Netherlands: the Professionals in Training to STOP suicide (PITSTOP suicide) study. We applied a principal components analysis (PCA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), a graded response model (GRM), and simulated a CAT. Results The scores of 505 patients were analyzed. Psychometric analyses showed the questionnaire to be unidimensional with good internal consistency. The computer adaptive simulation showed that for the estimation of elevation of risk of future suicidal behavior 4 items (instead of the full 19) were sufficient, on average. Conclusions This study demonstrated that CAT can be applied successfully to reduce the length of the Dutch version of the BSS. We argue that the use of CAT can improve the accuracy and the response burden when assessing the risk of future suicidal behavior online. Because CAT can be daunting for clinicians and applied scientists, we offer a concrete example of our computer adaptive simulation of the Dutch version of the BSS at the end of the paper.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 40, 'citationCount': 56, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4453598', 'name': 'D.

There are several software options, including the use of native smartphone applications and text messages (short message service, SMS). Little is known about the strengths and limitations of these two approaches in monitoring symptoms in individuals with serious mental illness. Objective The objective of this study was to compare two different delivery modalities of the same diagnostic assessment for individuals with non-affective psychosis—a native smartphone application employing a graphical, touch user interface against an SMS text-only implementation. The overall hypothesis of the study was that patient participants with sewrious mental illness would find both delivery modalities feasible and acceptable to use, measured by the quantitative post-assessment feedback questionnaire scores, the number of data points completed, and the time taken to complete the assessment. It was also predicted that a native smartphone application would (1) yield a greater number of data points, (2) take less time, and (3) be more positively appraised by patient participant users than the text-based system. Methods A randomized repeated measures crossover design was employed. Participants with currently treated Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (Fourth Edition) schizophrenia or related disorders (n=24) were randomly allocated to completing 6 days of assessment (four sets of questions per day) with a native smartphone application or the SMS text-only implementation. There was then a 1-week break before completing a further 6 days with the alternative delivery modality. Quantitative feedback questionnaires were administered at the end of each period of sampling. Results A greater proportion of data points were completed with the native smartphone application in comparison to the SMS text-only implementation (β = -.25, SE=.11, P=.02), which also took significantly less time to complete (β =.78, SE= .09, P<.001). Although there were no significant differences in participants’ quantitative feedback for the two delivery modalities, most participants reported preferring the native smartphone application (67%; n=16) and found it easier to use (71%; n=16). 33% of participants reported that they would be willing to complete mobile phone assessment for 5 weeks or longer. Conclusions Native smartphone applications and SMS text are both valuable methods of delivering real-time assessment in individuals with schizophrenia. However, a more streamlined graphical user interface may lead to better compliance and shorter entry times. Further research is needed to test the efficacy of this technology within clinical services, to assess validity over longer periods of time and when delivered on patients’ own phones.', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 26, 'citationCount': 150, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145138477', 'name': 'J.

Effective face-to-face treatments are Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT) and Problem Solving Treatment (PST). However, about two-thirds of persons who die by suicide have not been in contact with mental health care services in the preceding year, and many have never been treated. Furthermore, many patients do not disclose their suicidal thoughts to their care provider. This may be out of shame, due to fear of stigma or due to lack of trust in (mental) health care. Since many suicidal individuals seek information online, the internet provides an opportunity to reach suicidal individuals who would not be contacted otherwise. By providing a self-help intervention online, persons can anonymously learn to gain control over their suicidal thoughts. There is convincing evidence that self-help is effective for a number of mental disorders. In this study the effectiveness for suicidal thoughts is examined.Methods/DesignIn this study, a recently developed self-help intervention will be evaluated in a Randomized Controlled Trial. The intervention is based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and is aimed at subjects who experience mild to moderate suicidal thoughts. This is defined as a score between 1 and 26 on the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSS). Higher and lower scores are excluded. In addition, severely depressed subjects are excluded. In total, 260 subjects will be randomly allocated to the intervention-condition (N = 130) or to the information-control condition (N = 130). Self-report questionnaires will be filled out at baseline, 6 weeks after baseline and 18 weeks after baseline. Primary outcome measure is the reduction in frequency and intensity of suicidal thoughts. Secondary outcome measures are the reduction of hopelessness, anxiety and depression, sleeplessness, worry and quality of life measures.DiscussionThis study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based self-help intervention for suicidal thoughts. Several limitations and strengths of the design are discussed.Trial RegistrationNetherlands Trial Register, NTR1689', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 92, 'citationCount': 77, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5362620', 'name': 'B.

PhD Student in General Psychology, Sari Branch, Islamic Azad University, Sari, Iran 2. Associate Professor, Department of Psychology, Shahr-e-Qods Branch, Islamic Azad University, Shahr-e-Qods, Tehran, Iran 3. Assistant Professor, Department of General Psychology, Sari Branch, Islamic Azad University, Sari, Iran Introduction: Obesity is one of the diseases whose prevalence has been accelerating over the past decades. It is estimated that about 1.2 billion people in the world are obese or overweight. In Iran, 5.5% of children and adolescents under 18 years of age and 21.5% of people over 18 are obese. Recently, mindfulness has attracted much attention in the field of obesity and overweight. The intervention, along with mindfulness meditation, to increase overall psychological and physiological self-regulation is perfectly commensurate with the cognitive, emotional, physiological, and behavioral dysregulations observed in eating disorders, especially in the case of impulsive overeating. Considering the effect of negative thoughts and beliefs on overeating behaviors and subsequent overweight, and on the other hand, the role of cognitive fusion as an essential and determining factor in the negative evaluation of disturbing thoughts, the role of cognitive fusion can be added Checked the weight. Recently, in line with health professionals’s efforts, one of the effective ways to prevent and treat obesity and reduce its psychological, social, and economic consequences is to consider psychological treatment programs and other medical and sports treatments. In recent years, there has been a great deal of discussion about mindfulness-based therapeutic interventions. These treatments are known as the third wave of behavioral therapy. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is one of the most common third-wave therapies for the behavioral therapy and aims to help clients achieve a rich, valuable, and satisfying life through psychological resilience. Emotion regulation training is one of the emotion-based therapies that can affect people’s psychological symptoms with obesity and has been less considered by researchers so far. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of group therapy based on ACT and emotional regulation on cognitive fusion, mindfulness, and emotional regulation in obese women. Methods: The present study was an interventional study with a pre-test/post-test design that was conducted in 2019 on obese patients referred to psychiatric and psychology clinics in the west of Tehran. The selection of the intervention group was as follows: The subjects were invited to participate in the study in coordination and consultation with the clinic officials and according to the inclusion criteria. Then, 45 patients were selected by purposive sampling method and randomly divided into three groups of 15 (acceptance and commitment based experimental group, emotion regulation training experimental group, and control group). First, the necessary information about the study’s objectives was provided to the patients, and they entered the study of their own free will. Finally, informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Criteria for entering this study include age over 16 years, being overweight, not having a psychological disorder, and not receiving any other psychological treatment. Exclusion criteria were unwillingness to continue cooperation and a maximum of two sessions of absence for the patient. Then, 12 120-minute sessions of emotion regulation training and acceptance and commitment therapy were performed in the experimental groups. Data were collected using the Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire, Mindfulness Questionnaire, and Emotion Regulation Difficulty Scale. Data were analyzed using analysis of covariance with SPSS-21 software. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test checked the normality of data distribution. Then, analysis of covariance was used to examine the differences between the two groups in terms of research variables. Results: The covariance analysis results showed that the difficulty in regulating emotion, mindfulness, and cognitive fusion after therapeutic interventions was significantly different between the three groups (P=0.0001). Then, the Fisher post hoc test was used to examine which of the two groups are different. These test results showed that the difference between each of the groups of emotion regulation training and treatment based on acceptance and commitment with the control group is significant, but the results of the two types of treatment are not significantly different. Conclusion: The research results showed that emotion regulation training and acceptance and commitment-based therapy effectively reduce cognitive fusion and improving emotion regulation and mindfulness in obese people. Therefore, considering the confirmation of the effect of emotion regulation training based on acceptance and commitment in the treatment of obesity, it is suggested that therapists consider these two therapies in reducing cognitive fusion and improving emotion regulation and mindfulness of overweight people. doi.org/10.30514/icss.23.1.62 Recieved: 20 Oct. 2020 Revised: 10 Nov. 2020 Accepted: 24

Methods: To do this study, 29 obese people with BMI < 29.9 were selected by purposeful sampling at the beginning, who completed demographic questionnaire and emotional cognitive regulation questionnaire. The participants’ body mass index (BMI) was measured at the first meeting and at the end of the treatment. Participants were assigned into the intervention and the control groups. The intervention group participated in acceptance and commitment group therapy sessions for five months and at the end of the treatment sessions, they completed the questionnaires again. Statistical methods included Chi-square test, t-test for comparing two independent groups and analysis of covariance (P<0.01). Results: The findings showed that the acceptance and commitment therapy can reduce BMI; it also reduces negative strategies and increases the positive strategies of emotional cognitive regulation (P<0.01). Conclusion: The present study showed that the acceptance and commitment group therapy resulted in weight loss and improved emotion regulation in people with obesity. Therefore, it is recommended to use this therapeutic approach for obese individuals.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 43, 'citationCount': 9, 'authors': [{'authorId': None, 'name': 'آزاده یراقچی'}, {'authorId': None, 'name': 'فرهاد جمهری'}, {'authorId': '2255132334', 'name': 'محمدرضا صیرفی'}, {'authorId': None, 'name': 'آدیس کراسکیان موجمباری'}, {'authorId': None, 'name': 'غلامرضا محمدی فارسانی'}]}, {'paperId': '17c72140bd1c7844e9307e7165ff3f7098d226a3', 'title': 'Compassion-Focused Therapy on Levels of Anxiety and Depression Among Women with Breast Cancer; A Randomized Pilot Trial', 'abstract': 'Background: Compassion can help people regulate their emotional responses to cancer-induced bodily changes. However, compassion effects on levels of anxiety and depression among breast cancer patients is largely unknown. Objectives: The present study aimed at investigating the effectiveness of compassion-focused interventions on anxiety and depression levels among patients with breast cancer in Ahvaz, Iran. Methods: This study was a randomized controlled trial with pre-and post-tests. Respondent-driven sampling was used to sample from women, who visited clinical oncology ward in Golestan Hospital in Ahvaz. The primary sample consisted of 30 patients with breast cancer. They, then, were randomly allocated to two experimental and control groups. Compassion-focused therapy (CFT) was provided to the experimental group for 8 weeks, and the control group only received motivational enhancement therapy (MET). The data were analyzed in two stages of pre-and post-test, using Chi-square test and covariance analysis through SPSS software. Results: After adjusting for pre-test scores, the primary outcomes showed that compassion-focused interventions had a significant effect on the reduction of depression symptoms; also, secondary outcomes showed that this intervention was associated with a significant decrease in anxiety levels (all < 0.001). However, according to the findings, the interventions had greater positive impacts on the anxiety levels. Conclusions: These findings can confirm the efficacy of psychological interventions in patients with cancer in planning future interventions and linking medical and psychiatric therapies. © 2018, Author(s).', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 33, 'citationCount': 20, 'authors': [{'authorId': '48442800', 'name': 'Z.

Therfore, this study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of acceptance and commitment therapy on cognitive emotion regulation in the addicted men under Methadone treatment. Method: The study population consisted of all the addicted men under Methadone treatment referring to an addiction treatment clinic in Isfahan in 2014-2015, out of which 24 addicted men were selected via convenience sampling method, and then were appointed randomly into two experimental and control groups (n= 12). Both groups filled Cognition Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. The therapeutic interventions based on aacceptance and commitment therapy were held for the experimental group for 8 sessions of one hour once a week. Ultimately, the collected data were analyzed applying SPSS software via ANCOVA method . Result: The findings of the present study demonstrated a significant positive impact of acceptance and commitment therapy on reduction of self blame, rumination, catastrophizing as well as blaming others. Moreover, a significant increase was observed in regard with the acceptance, positive refocus, refocus on planning, positive reappraisal and positive perspective.

MB-EAT is a group intervention that was developed for treatment of binge eating disorder (BED) and related issues. BED is marked by emotional, behavioral and physiological disregulation in relation to food intake and self-identity. MB-EAT involves training in mindfulness meditation and guided mindfulness practices that are designed to address the core issues of BED: controlling responses to varying emotional states; making conscious food choices; developing an awareness of hunger and satiety cues; and cultivating self-acceptance. Evidence to date supports the value of MB-EAT in decreasing binge episodes, improving one's sense of self-control with regard to eating, and diminishing depressive symptoms."", 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 36, 'citationCount': 479, 'authors': [{'authorId': '66741568', 'name': 'J.

Hierarchical confirmatory factor analyses suggested that at least four of the identified factors are components of an overall mindfulness construct and that the factor structure of mindfulness may vary with meditation experience.

It further aimed to replicate findings regarding eating disorder and general psychopathology among BF versus DF subtypes. Method One hundred fifty-five women with BED completed the Oxford Risk Factor Interview to retrospectively assess risk factors occurring before eating disturbance onset. Clinical interview assessed eating disorder and general psychopathology. Results Overall, no significant differences in risk factors emerged between the groups. The BF group had a significantly earlier onset of BED than the DF group. In contradistinction to previous studies, the DF group endorsed more eating disorder psychopathology and lifetime diagnosis of any substance use disorder. Conclusion Limited support was seen for different risk factors in BF versus DF women, suggesting similar etiologic pathways in both subtypes. © 2005 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.', 'year': 2005, 'referenceCount': 48, 'citationCount': 39, 'authors': [{'authorId': '39993286', 'name': 'J.

In ACT, ‘defusion’ interventions aim to ‘unhook’ thoughts from actions and to create psychological distance between a person and their thoughts, beliefs, memories and self-stories. A number of similar concepts have been described in the psychology literature (e.g. decentering, metacognition, mentalization and mindfulness) suggesting converging evidence that how we relate to mental events may be of critical importance. Whilst there are some good measures of these related processes, none of them provides an adequate operationalization of cognitive fusion. Despite the centrality of cognitive fusion in the ACT model, there is as yet no agreed measure of cognitive fusion. This paper presents the construction and development of a brief, self-report measure of cognitive fusion: The Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire (CFQ).

1-4 months old and their maternal attachment; as well as the relationship of maternal attachment and marital adjustment with sociodemographic characteristics.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThe research is descriptive and correlational. Its sample consists of 113 mothers. Maternal Attachment Index (MAI) and Marital Adjustment Scale (MAS) are used as data collection tools.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe found that, for mothers who participated in this research, the average level of maternal attachment is 92.17 ± 8.49, and the average level of marital adjustment is 43.06 ± 7.90. We discovered that the maternal attachment level is higher for mothers who have completed high school and university, those who breastfeed their babies exclusively and whose spouses help care for the baby. We also discovered that the Marital Adjustment Score is higher among mothers who are employed, get married by companionship (not arranged), continue attending pregnancy classes and whose duration of marriage is between 1-5 years and 10-15 years. There is weak positive relationship (r=0.38; p=0.00) between marital adjustment and maternal attachment; and the regression analysis that is run to explain this relationship is statistically significant (F=26.131; p<0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn our study, the level of maternal attachment was high, while the level of marital adjustment was liminal. There are many factors affecting sociodemographic characteristics, pregnancy and baby care. The level of marital adjustment for mothers increases the maternal attachment.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 9, 'citationCount': 21, 'authors': [{'authorId': '49265185', 'name': 'B.

Symptoms of this condition are associated with psychological distress. Evaluation of cognitive function of PCOS patients has yielded discrepant results. Given that cognitive function of these patients might be affected by depression and anxiety, this study aimed to evaluate the level of depression and anxiety in this group of women, investigate their association with cognitive function, and compare the results with those of healthy women. Materials and methods: This case-control study was conducted in 53 patients with PCOS, selected using the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria, and 50 healthy women as control group. Anxiety and depression levels were evaluated by Beck’s anxiety and depression inventories (second edition). Moreover, cognitive function of the participants was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Data analysis was performed in SPSS, version 21, using t-test, Chi-square and Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Results: In this study, the mean depression score was significantly higher than that of the control group (20.35±9.82 vs. 14.46±8.40; P=0.001). In addition, a significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of anxiety score, which was higher in the patient group (17.35±10.44 vs. 12.40±9.65; P=0.01). Frequencies of severe depression and anxiety in the patient group were 30.2% and 26.4%, respectively, while they were 6% and 12% in the control group, respectively; the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P=0.007 and P=0.02, respectively). However, no significant association was noted between cognitive function and levels of depression (r=-0.033, P=0.81) and anxiety (r=-0.15, P=0.26).

The purpose of this article is to discover the difference of the quality of love and sexual satisfaction among committed and uncommitted married men. Methods: This study was a descriptive-comparative research. As the sample of this research, two-hundred married men who were attended to counseling and social work clinics due to marital problems; were randomly selected and assigned to two loyal and unfaithful groups (each group hundred men) by cluster sampling method. Two questionnaires including; Larson Sexual Satisfaction Scale (twenty-five items) and Sternberg Quality of Love questionnaire (forty-five items) were used as data collecting tools. Results: The results indicated that there was a significant difference between the quality of love and sexual satisfaction in loyal and unfaithful married men.(P<0.05) Conclusions: Finding showed that men who benefit less from dimensions of love and have lower degree of sexual satisfaction, are more probable to had unfaithful relationship. The findings also revealed that the quality of love and sex satisfaction were playing key role in couples relationships. Therefore, it seems these variables are essential one to be investigate by marital counselors and therapists to help the couples with loyalty issue.

Method We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of cognitive function, assessed with a single neuropsychological test battery, the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), in patients with depression during symptomatic and remitted states. Inclusion of studies comparing patients remitted from depression and controls enabled us to investigate whether cognitive impairment persists beyond episodes of low mood in depression. Results Our meta-analysis revealed significant moderate cognitive deficits in executive function, memory and attention in patients with depression relative to controls (Cohen's d effect sizes ranging from −0.34 to −0.65). Significant moderate deficits in executive function and attention (Cohen's d ranging from −0.52 to −0.61) and non-significant small/moderate deficits in memory (Cohen's d ranging from −0.22 to −0.54) were found to persist in patients whose depressive symptoms had remitted, indicating that cognitive impairment occurs separately from episodes of low mood in depression. Conclusions Both low mood and cognitive impairment are associated with poor psychosocial functioning. Therefore, we argue that remediation of cognitive impairment and alleviation of depressive symptoms each play an important role in improving outcome for patients with depression.

Two hundred and eighty eight participants (218 males and 70 females) in the age range of 16 to 38 years (Mean age =20.78, SD= 2.95 years) were assessed on a measure of alexithymia, difficulties in emotion regulation, general mental health, and subjective well-being (assessed by Positive Negative Affect Schedule and Satisfaction with Life Scale). The results of the bi-variate correlation analysis revealed that difficulties in understanding and communicating as well as regulating emotions, in general, have a negative influence on health and wellbeing. However, the findings of step-wise multiple regression analysis indicated that some specific types of emotional deficits such as difficulties in identifying feelings, lack of emotional clarity and limited access to emotion regulation strategies were relatively more important in predicting the health status and well-being of an individual as compared to other emotional difficulties. Overall the findings imply that emotion regulation difficulties and alexithymia in general is associated with impaired mental health and lower level of happiness and life satisfaction, i.e., subjective well-being. The observed findings have been discussed in the light of the available empirical evidences. The role of emotions and emotional experiences in determining the health status of an individual, though, has been focus of psychological inquiry since long the last few decades have witnessed an invigorated interest in this area (see review by Pandey and Choubey, 2010). While emotions can be adaptive in many ways, emotions can also be maladaptive (Amstadter, 2008). For example, researchers have noted that while positive emotional experiences and emotional intelligence have a positive effect on mental health, suppression of emotions, inability or difficultly in understanding and communicating emotions (e.g. alexithymia), disposition to exaggerate emotional experiences may have health impairing effect (Pandey and Choubey, 2010). The functional role of emotions in mental health and subjective well being has been highlighted by several researchers (Quoidbach et al, 2010). The manner in which individuals are able to manage their emotional experiences to confirm adaptively to a given context appears to be important in mental health (Gross 1995).,', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 22, 'citationCount': 57, 'authors': [{'authorId': '6642439', 'name': 'P.

We hypothesized that people with particularly disagreeable spouses (i.e., those low on Agreeableness) and particularly unreliable spouses (i.e., those low on Conscientiousness) will be less satisfied with their marriage, leading them to estimate a higher probability of becoming extramaritally involved in the next year. Two hundred fourteen newlyweds comprising 107 couples completed measures assessing their personality, their marital satisfaction, and their likelihood of infidelity. The results provide some evidence that personality and marital satisfaction may help to account for which marriages are likely to include infidelities and which are likely to remain faithfully intact. Infidelity is a subject that confronts couple therapists regularly in their clinical practices. It can be a confusing and heart-wrenching experience for all involved, including the therapist who may have his or her own personal fears and values related to infidelity (Glass & Wright, 1997). Moreover, infidelity is a major cause of Shackelford et al. / Individual Differences Research, 200x, Vol. x, No. x, pp. xx-xx 2 divorce and spousal battering (see Buss, 2004; Daly & Wilson, 1988). Little is known, however, about which individuals are susceptible to infidelity. Personality psychologists seek, in part, to describe parsimoniously variation in human cognition, affect, and behavior. One approach to this descriptive effort is known as the “Five Factor Model” (FFM) of personality (see John, 1990, for a review of the FFM). The FFM is rooted in a lexical approach to understanding variation in human personality. A lexical approach holds that the most important variation in human cognition, affect, and behavior will have been encoded into the language. The pioneers of the FFM began by extracting all trait descriptive adjectives from the dictionary. These investigators then asked people to rate themselves and various target others along each of the trait terms. These ratings are then orthogonally factor-analyzed. Researchers analyzing different languages and working in different cultures find that these trait ratings tend to reduce to variation along five major factors (see John, 1990). In order of the percentage of total rating variation accounted for per factor, the first factor of the FFM (Surgency) captures variation along the Extraverted— Introverted dimension. The second factor (Agreeableness) captures variation along the Agreeable—Disagreeable dimension. The third factor (Conscientiousness) describes variation along the Reliable—Unreliable dimension. The fourth factor (Emotional Stability) describes variation along the Emotionally Stable—Neurotic dimension of personality. Finally, the fifth factor (variously labeled Openness to Experience, Intellect, or Culture) describes variation along social and intellectual acuity (John, 1990, and references therein). The FFM has been used to describe marital interactions as the interface between two personalities (Buss, 1989, 1991). One area of interest is whether the personalities of the married couple might predict various marital outcomes. What type of person, for example, is likely to divorce their spouse? Might they be significantly lower on Agreeableness than those who do not divorce? Or perhaps those who divorce are higher on Openness to Experience than are those who do not eventually divorce. Another notable marital outcome is infidelity. Can an individual’s standing along one or more of the five factors predict whether they might become romantically involved with someone outside of the marriage? And can a person’s standing along one or more of the major personality dimensions predict whether he or she might become the victim of marital infidelity? Atkins, Baucom, and Jacobson (2001) report that, “infidelity is a common phenomenon in marriages but is poorly understood"" (p. 735; and see Atkins, Dimidjian, & Jacobson, 2001; Blow & Hartnett, 2005; Glass & Wright, 1988, 1997; Thompson, 1983). Laumann, Gaugnon, Michael, and Michaels (1994) found that Shackelford et al. / Individual Differences Research, 200x, Vol. x, No. x, pp. xx-xx 3 77% of their participants believed that extramarital sex was always wrong. Such disapproval may stem from a general belief that infidelity is immoral (Blumstein & Schwartz, 1983; Prins, Buunk, & VanYperen, 1993). Infidelity and the desire for more than one partner are clearly important factors of sexual risk taking and strongly underpinned by individual differences. Meta-analysis of 45 studies examining personality factors underlying sexual risk behavior found high agreeableness and high conscientiousness reliably correlated with lower sexual risk taking (Hoyle, Fejfar, & Miller,2000). Low agreeableness correlated negatively with greater sexual risk taking, including multiple partners; for low conscientiousness, the strongest correlation was with unprotected sex. This study did not indicate that low conscientiousness is related to sexual promiscuity, although sensation seeking and impulsivity (sharing constructs with low conscientiousness) are strongly predictive of sexual risk taking. Miller, Lynam, Zimmerman, Logan, Leukefeld, and Clayton (2004) found that low straightforwardness [one facet of the agreeableness construct within Costa and McCrae’s ‘‘Big-Five’’ model (e.g., Costa & McCrae, 1992a, 1992b; McCrae & Costa, 1996), characterized by manipulative, deceitful behavior] also was a strong predictor of sexual promiscuity. Relationship infidelity is reliably associated with low Agreeableness and low Conscientiousness. Schmitt and Buss (2000), for example, found that those with high levels of Agreeableness and Conscientiousness were higher in relationship exclusivity—that is, are less likely to be unfaithful. And across 10 world regions and 52 nations of the International Sexuality Description Project, low Agreeableness (e.g., selfish) and low Conscientiousness were associated with relationship infidelity (Schmitt, 2004). Some studies support the idea that individuals engage in infidelity because there is something wrong in their primary relationship [i.e., as marital happiness or satisfaction decreases, the occurrence increases (Atkins, Baucom, & Jacobson, 2001; Glass & Wright, 1985)]. At the very least, suggest Prins et al. (1993), dissatisfaction in the primary relationship increases the desire for involvement in extradyadic relationships. Glass and Wright (1985) found the negative correlation between marital satisfaction and infidelity to be true for all types of extradyadic involvement (sexual, emotional, and combined sexual and emotional involvement), although they discovered that primary relationship dissatisfaction is particularly related to extradyadic emotional infidelity. Further, men and women who are extradyadic involved in both sexual and emotional infidelities are even more dissatisfied with their marriages than are those engaged in either sexual-only or emotional-only infidelities (Glass & Wright, 1985). Shackelford et al. / Individual Differences Research, 200x, Vol. x, No. x, pp. xx-xx 4 Although research has documented that Agreeableness and Conscientiousness are linked to the likelihood of marital infidelity, it is not known how these personality characteristics manifest themselves to become associated with marital infidelity. Here we present a causal model generated with reference to the FFM of personality to predict self-reported likelihood of becoming extramaritally involved. Specifically, we hypothesize that people with especially disagreeable partners (i.e., those low on Agreeableness) and particularly unreliable partners (i.e., low on Conscientiousness) will tend to be less satisfied with their marriage. This lower marital satisfaction will translate into higher estimates of the probability that the respondent will become extramaritally involved. In addition, attitudes toward infidelity (e.g., belief that infidelity is immoral) are important in that some research suggests that individuals with more permissive attitudes toward infidelity in relationships are more likely to engage in infidelity (Treas & Giesen, 2000), thus we hypothesize that the respondents’ own level of Conscientiousness will have a direct effect on their estimate of the likelihood that they will be unfaithful to their partner. That is, more conscientious respondents will report a lower probability that they will become extramaritally involved. In sum, the present research addresses three key questions: (a) Do people with especially disagreeable partners (i.e., those low on Agreeableness) and particularly unreliable partners (i.e., those low on conscientiousness) tend to be less satisfied with their marriage? (b) Does lower marital satisfaction translate into higher estimates of the probability that the respondent will become extramaritally involved? (c) Does the respondents’ own conscientiousness have a direct effect on their estimate of the likelihood that they will be unfaithful?', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 30, 'citationCount': 113, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5926998', 'name': 'T.

Then, Enrich marital satisfaction questionnaire and check list of mental health were implemented for them. The data were analyzed by statistical tests such as independent t-test, Pearson correlation and hierarchical multiple regression. Results: The results showed that there was no significant difference between marital satisfaction of males and females, but in this study females had poorer mental health than other one (P<0.05). Partnerâ��s mental health was partly mediated in the relationship between personâ��s mental health and marital satisfaction (both women and men).

A total of 506 men (M age = 32.86 years, SD = 10.60) and 412 women (M age = 27.66 years, SD = 8.93), who indicated they were in a monogamous sexual relationship, completed a series of questionnaires , including the Sexual Excitation/Inhibition (SES/SIS) scales and the Mood and Sexuality Questionnaire, and answered questions about, among others, religiosity, education, income, relationship and sexual satisfaction, and sexual compatibility. Almost one-quarter of men (23.2%) and 19.2% of women indicated that they had ''cheated'' during their current relationship (i.e., engaged in sexual interactions with someone other than their partner that could jeopardize, or hurt, their relationship). Among men, a logistic regression analysis, explaining 17% of the variance, revealed that a higher propensity of sexual excita-tion (SES) and sexual inhibition due to ''the threat of performance concerns'' (SIS1), a lower propensity for sexual inhibition due to''the threat of performance consequences''(SIS2), and an increased tendency to engage in regretful sexual behavior during negative affective states were all significant predictors of infidelity. In women, a similar regression analysis explained 21% of the variance in engaging in infidelity. In addition to SIS1 and SIS2, for which the same patterns were found as for men, low relationship happiness and low compatibility in terms of sexual attitudes and values were predictive of infidelity. The findings of this study suggest that, for both men and women, sexual personality characteristics and, for women, relationship factors are more relevant to the prediction of sexual infidelity than demographic variables such as marital status and religiosity."", 'year': None, 'referenceCount': 53, 'citationCount': 217, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2301976', 'name': 'K.

Having proper emotion regulation skills is critical to health, academic achievement, and work performance. In order to facilitate participants to manage emotions, we are developing a series of training programs by using HTC© ViveTM headset and Neuracle. The HTC Vive is to improve immersion in presence to lead to more effective training, and the Neuracle is using Electroencephalography (EEG) techniques for reading user's brainwave signals. In this paper, we focused on analyzing if emotion, which was reflected in brainwave signals, had changes when participants were exposed to positive/negative stimuli. The testing results indicated that there were noticeable changes in brainwave signals to stimuli. Therefore, it is reasonable to use brainwave signals as real-time input in our game development for improve emotion regulation skills in the future.",2018,28,0,"{'name': '2018 International Conference

To answer this question, a meta-review was conducted to assess the meta-analyses and systematic and narrative reviews published in this field in the last twenty-two months. Twenty-five different articles demonstrated the clinical potential of this technology in both the diagnosis and the treatment of mental health disorders: VR compares favorably to existing treatments in anxiety disorders, eating and weight disorders, and pain management, with long-term effects that generalize to the real world. But why is VR so effective? Here, the following answer is suggested: VR shares with the brain the same basic mechanism: embodied simulations. According to neuroscience, to regulate and control the body in the world effectively, the brain creates an embodied simulation of the body in the world used to represent and predict actions, concepts, and emotions. VR works in a similar way: the VR experience tries to predict the sensory consequences of an individual's movements, providing to him/her the same scene he/she will see in the real world. To achieve this, the VR system, like the brain, maintains a model (simulation) of the body and the space around it. If the presence in the body is the outcome of different embodied simulations, concepts are embodied simulations, and VR is an embodied technology, this suggests a new clinical approach discussed in this article: the possibility of altering the experience of the body and facilitating cognitive modeling/change by designing targeted virtual environments able to simulate both the external and the internal world/body."", 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 169, 'citationCount': 248, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144059813', 'name': 'G.

In the current study, we compared a brief nature-based mindfulness VR experience to a resting control condition on anxious participants. Self-reported anxiety symptoms and resting-state EEG were recorded across intervals containing quiet rest or the VR intervention. EEG activity was analyzed as a function of global power shifts in Alpha and Beta activity, and with sLORETA current source density estimates of cingulate cortex regions of interest. Results demonstrated that both a quiet rest control condition and the VR meditation significantly reduced subjective reports of anxiety and increased Alpha power. However, the VR intervention uniquely resulted in shifting proportional power from higher Beta frequencies into lower Beta frequencies, and significantly reduced broadband Beta activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. These effects are consistent with a physiological reduction of anxiety.

VR provides an immersive experience into a simulated environment. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterised by social communication deficits and repetitive behaviours. Children with ASD often require social skills training while VR provides a safe, controllable environment to practice skills repeatedly. The Centre for Innovative Applications of Internet and Multimedia Technologies (AIMTech Centre) at City University of Hong Kong developed a VR-enabled training program to examine its efficacy on emotional and social skills with six VR scenarios depicting the daily lives of typical children in Hong Kong. 94 children from mainstream primary schools in Hong Kong completed the study and 72 children were included in the analysis. Children from training group scored higher on emotion expression and regulation (M = 20.2, SD = 3.00) than before the training (M = 18.9, SD = 3.57, t(35) = −2.174, p = .037) and higher on social interaction and adaptation after the training (M = 21.8, SD = 2.99) than before training (M = 20.2, SD = 3.43, t(35) = −3.987, p < .0005). There was a statistically significant interaction between group and time on affective expressions, F(1, 70) = 5.223, p = .025, partial η2 = .069, and on social reciprocity, F(1, 70) = 7.769, p = .007, partial η2 = .100. Children were able to engage in VR training despite initial challenges with viewing goggles. Some children declined to participate due to scheduling reasons which may be minimised through the adoption of head-mounted displays as a portable, cost-effective device. VR seems to be a promising asset to traditional training and therapy while the importance trainers’ or therapists’ support has yet to be further investigated.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 7, 'citationCount': 79, 'authors': [{'authorId': '46262782', 'name': 'Sze Ngar Vanessa Yuan'}, {'authorId': '1687108', 'name': 'H.

Accurate timing is important for the interplay of neurons, neuronal circuitries, brain areas and human individuals. In the human brain, multiple temporal integration windows are hierarchically organized, with temporal scales ranging from microseconds to tens and hundreds of milliseconds for perceptual, motor and cognitive functions, and up to minutes, hours and even months for hormonal and mood changes. Accurate timing is impaired in several brain diseases. From the current repertoire of non-invasive brain imaging methods, only magnetoencephalography (MEG) and scalp electroencephalography (EEG) provide millisecond time-resolution; our focus in this paper is on MEG. Since the introduction of high-density whole-scalp MEG/EEG coverage in the 1990s, the instrumentation has not changed drastically; yet, novel data analyses are advancing the field rapidly by shifting the focus from the mere pinpointing of activity hotspots to seeking stimulus- or task-specific information and to characterizing functional networks. During the next decades, we can expect increased spatial resolution and accuracy of the time-resolved brain imaging and better understanding of brain function, especially its temporal constraints, with the development of novel instrumentation and finer-grained, physiologically inspired generative models of local and network activity. Merging both spatial and temporal information with increasing accuracy and carrying out recordings in naturalistic conditions, including social interaction, will bring much new information about human brain function.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 68, 'citationCount': 64, 'authors': [{'authorId': '143873866', 'name': 'R.

Methods:  Twenty adolescents with ASD participated in a six-session virtual reality driving simulator-based experiment, during which their electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded alongside driving events and a therapist's rating of their affective states and mental workload. Five feature generation approaches including statistical features, fractal dimension features, higher order crossings (HOC)-based features, power features from frequency bands, and power features from bins ($\\Delta \\boldsymbol{f} = 2\\;{\\rm{Hz}}$ ) were applied to extract relevant features. Individual differences were removed with a two-step feature calibration method. Finally, binary classification results based on the k-nearest neighbors algorithm and univariate feature selection method were evaluated by leave-one-subject-out nested cross-validation to compare feature types and identify discriminative features. Results: The best classification results were achieved using power features from bins for engagement (0.95) and boredom (0.78), and HOC-based features for enjoyment (0.90), frustration (0.88), and workload (0.86). Conclusion: Offline EEG-based group-level classification models are feasible for recognizing binary low and high intensity of affect and workload of individuals with ASD in the context of driving. However, while promising the applicability of the models in an online adaptive driving task requires further development.

Perhaps the cultural sector clamours for a role in the evolution of VR because the technology is finally interfacing with the human, rather than the human interfacing with the technology. Whatever the reasons, VR is more a convergence of previously disparate disciplines than a whole new branch of technology. It simply takes a fresh look at human interaction. Evolving from user interface design, flight and visual simulation, and telepresence technologies, VR is unique in its emphasis on the experience of the human participant.

11,c82c825c5ff7d38a9b02344f0837f4b143c6cdff,Search for an Appropriate Behavior within the Emotional Regulation in Virtual Creatures Using a Learning Classifier System,"Emotion regulation is a process by which human beings control emotional behaviors. From neuroscientific evidence, this mechanism is the product of conscious or unconscious processes. In particular, the mechanism generated by a conscious process needs a priori components to be computed. The behaviors generated by previous experiences are among these components. These behaviors need to be adapted to fulfill the objectives in a specific situation. The problem we address is how to endow virtual creatures with emotion regulation in order to compute an appropriate behavior in a specific emotional situation. This problem is clearly important and we have not identified ways to solve this problem in the current literature. In our proposal, we show a way to generate the appropriate behavior in an emotional situation using a learning classifier system (LCS). We illustrate the function of our proposal in unknown and known situations by means of two case studies. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to converge to the appropriate behavior even in the first case; that is, when the system does not have previous experiences and in situations where some previous information is available our proposal proves to be a very powerful tool.",2017,46,2,"{'name': 'Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience', 'volume': '2017'}",,"[{'authorId': '36478575', 'name': 'Jonathan-Hernando Rosales'}, {'authorId': '145956015', 'name': 'Félix F.

Moreover, some studies indicate that brain activity related to the subjective perception of chronic pain may be distinct from activity for acute pain. However, the latter are based on observations from cross-sectional studies. How brain activity reorganizes with transition from acute to chronic pain has remained unexplored. Here we study this transition by examining brain activity for rating fluctuations of back pain magnitude. First we compared back pain-related brain activity between subjects who have had the condition for ∼2 months with no prior history of back pain for 1 year (early, acute/subacute back pain group, n = 94), to subjects who have lived with back pain for >10 years (chronic back pain group, n = 59). In a subset of subacute back pain patients, we followed brain activity for back pain longitudinally over a 1-year period, and compared brain activity between those who recover (recovered acute/sub-acute back pain group, n = 19) and those in which the back pain persists (persistent acute/sub-acute back pain group, n = 20; based on a 20% decrease in intensity of back pain in 1 year). We report results in relation to meta-analytic probabilistic maps related to the terms pain, emotion, and reward (each map is based on >200 brain imaging studies, derived from neurosynth.org). We observed that brain activity for back pain in the early, acute/subacute back pain group is limited to regions involved in acute pain, whereas in the chronic back pain group, activity is confined to emotion-related circuitry. Reward circuitry was equally represented in both groups. In the recovered acute/subacute back pain group, brain activity diminished in time, whereas in the persistent acute/subacute back pain group, activity diminished in acute pain regions, increased in emotion-related circuitry, and remained unchanged in reward circuitry. The results demonstrate that brain representation for a constant percept, back pain, can undergo large-scale shifts in brain activity with the transition to chronic pain. These observations challenge long-standing theoretical concepts regarding brain and mind relationships, as well as provide important novel insights regarding definitions and mechanisms of chronic pain.', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 91, 'citationCount': 561, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1890170', 'name': 'J.

Neural activity in two areas of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), paracingulate cortex, and rostromedial prefrontal cortex (RMPFC) was predictive of whether each individual would be ultimately pursued for a romantic relationship or rejected. Activity in these areas was attributable to two distinct components of romantic evaluation: either consensus judgments about physical beauty (paracingulate cortex) or individualized preferences based on a partner's perceived personality (RMPFC).

Animals first learned to associate a fixed sequence of Pavlovian cues with sucrose reward. Subsequent intraaccumbens microinjections of an opioid-stimulating drug increased the hedonic liking impact of sucrose in behavior and firing signals of ventral pallidum neurons, and likewise, they increased incentive salience signals in firing to the reward-proximal incentive cue (but did not alter firing signals to the learned prediction value of a reward-distal cue). Microinjection of a dopamine-stimulating drug instead enhanced only the motivation component but did not alter hedonic impact or learned prediction signals. Different dedicated neuronal subpopulations in the ventral pallidum tracked signal enhancements for hedonic impact vs. incentive salience, and a faster firing pattern also distinguished incentive signals from slower hedonic signals, even for a third overlapping population.

In a combined positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging study of mood disorders, we demonstrated that the mean gray matter volume of this “subgenual” ACC (sgACC) cortex is abnormally reduced in subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder, irrespective of mood state. Neuropathological assessments of sgACC tissue acquired postmortem from subjects with MDD or bipolar disorder confirmed the decrement in gray matter volume, and revealed that this abnormality was associated with a reduction in glia, with no equivalent loss of neurons. In positron emission tomography studies, the metabolic activity was elevated in this region in the depressed relative to the remitted phases of the same MDD subjects, and effective antidepressant treatment was associated with a reduction in sgACC activity. Other laboratories replicated and extended these findings, and the clinical importance of this treatment effect was underscored by a study showing that deep brain stimulation of the sgACC ameliorates depressive symptoms in treatment-resistant MDD. This article discusses the functional significance of these findings within the context of the preclinical literature that implicates the putative homologue of this region in the regulation of emotional behavior and stress response. In experimental animals, this region participates in an extended “visceromotor network” of structures that modulates autonomic/neuroendocrine responses and neurotransmitter transmission during the neural processing of reward, fear, and stress. These data thus hold important implications for the development of neural models of depression that can account for the abnormal motivational, neuroendocrine, autonomic, and emotional manifestations evident in human mood disorders.', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 114, 'citationCount': 945, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2079241', 'name': 'W.

Patients have intact cognitive abilities but are impaired in making everyday decisions. Here we review anatomical, neuropsychological, and neurophysiological evidence to determine the neuronal mechanisms that might underlie these impairments. We suggest that OFC plays a key role in processing reward: It integrates multiple sources of information regarding the reward outcome to derive a value signal. In effect, OFC calculates how rewarding a reward is. This value signal can then be held in working memory where it can be used by lateral prefrontal cortex to plan and organize behavior toward obtaining the outcome, and by medial prefrontal cortex to evaluate the overall action in terms of its success and the effort that was required. Thus, acting together, these prefrontal areas can ensure that our behavior is most efficiently directed towards satisfying our needs.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 114, 'citationCount': 786, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3118611', 'name': 'J.

It is uncertain whether this heightened amygdala reactivity is specific to treatment-seeking patients with anxiety disorders or is a general feature of individuals with increased anxiety-related temperamental traits.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThirty-two physically healthy subjects 18-21 years old were recruited from a large pool of college students. Of these, 16 were chosen on the basis of scoring in the upper-15th percentile on a measure of trait anxiety (anxiety-prone group), and 16 were chosen on the basis of scoring in the normative range (40th-60th percentile). Subjects participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an emotion face assessment task that has been shown to reliably engage amygdala and associated limbic structures.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAnxiety-prone subjects had significantly greater bilateral amygdala and insula activation to emotional faces than did the anxiety-normative comparison subjects. Higher scores on several measures assessing anxiety proneness (e.g., neuroticism, trait anxiety, and anxiety sensitivity) were associated with greater activation of the amygdala (predominantly left-sided) and the anterior insula (bilateral).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIncreased amygdala and insula reactivity to certain types of emotional processing is seen in young adults with increased anxiety-related temperamental traits. Therefore, this brain emotion-processing profile may be a functional endophenotype for proneness to (certain kinds of) anxiety disorders.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 76, 'citationCount': 796, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2863415', 'name': 'M.

Do some emotion regulation strategies have more to recommend them than others? According to Gross's (1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271-299) process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners. This review concludes with a consideration of five important directions for future research on emotion regulation processes."", 'year': 2002, 'referenceCount': 78, 'citationCount': 3641, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

In this paper, we present a mechanism for an autonomous robot to regulate the intensity of its social interactions with a human. Similar to the feedback from infant to caregiver, the robot uses expressive displays to modulate the interaction intensity. This mechanism is integrated within a general framework that combines perception, attention, drives, emotions, behavior selection, and motor acts. We present a specific implementation of this architecture that enables the robot to react appropriately to both social stimuli (faces) and non-social stimuli (moving toys) while maintaining a suitable interaction intensity.

In the increasingly specialized discipline of psychology, the field of emotion regulation cuts across traditional boundaries and provides common ground.

How to reduce the data traffic of the smart campus network platform is an urgent problem to be solved. First, this paper discussed the key technologies of smart campus network teaching platform under the background of the 5G network, expounded the critical technologies of the transport layer of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, and analyzed from the development perspective of the IoT platform. Second, by investigating the online classroom data of five types of colleges and universities in China and comparing the advantages and disadvantages of online classroom teaching and traditional classroom teaching, it is found that the number of online courses in colleges and universities has exploded in the second half of 2017. Next, this paper analyzed the demand of smart campus online teaching platform under the background of the 5G network, thus established an online teaching platform based on the four initiatives operation model (government-led, college sponsor, teacher subject, and academic director). Finally, this paper adopted the improved VIRE localization algorithm to obtain the specific location information of the student users in the classroom and, then, compared with the error obtained by the VIRE algorithm, and the error of the improved VIRE algorithm is smaller.

The spectrogram carries comprehensive para-lingual information that are useful for emotion recognition. We tried to extract such information from spectrograms and accomplish the emotion recognition task by combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). To handle the variable-length speech segments, we proposed a specially designed neural network structure that accepts variable-length speech sentences directly as input. Compared to the traditional methods that split the sentence into smaller ﬁxed-length segments, our method can solve the problem of accuracy degradation introduced by the speech segmentation process. We evaluated the emotion recognition model on the IEMOCAP dataset over four emotions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the ﬁxed-length neural network on both weighted accuracy (WA) and unweighted accuracy (UA).', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 18, 'citationCount': 67, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2109077222', 'name': 'Xi Ma'}, {'authorId': '3860920', 'name': 'Zhiyong Wu'}, {'authorId': '144202060', 'name': 'Jia Jia'}, {'authorId': '9450377', 'name': 'Mingxing Xu'}, {'authorId': '145199941', 'name': 'H.

However, the reasons for this practical success and its precise domain of applicability are unknown. Learning a neural network from data requires solving a complex optimization problem with millions of variables. This is done by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms. We study the case of two-layer networks and derive a compact description of the SGD dynamics in terms of a limiting partial differential equation. Among other consequences, this shows that SGD dynamics does not become more complex when the network size increases. Multilayer neural networks are among the most powerful models in machine learning, yet the fundamental reasons for this success defy mathematical understanding. Learning a neural network requires optimizing a nonconvex high-dimensional objective (risk function), a problem that is usually attacked using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Does SGD converge to a global optimum of the risk or only to a local optimum? In the former case, does this happen because local minima are absent or because SGD somehow avoids them? In the latter, why do local minima reached by SGD have good generalization properties? In this paper, we consider a simple case, namely two-layer neural networks, and prove that—in a suitable scaling limit—SGD dynamics is captured by a certain nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) that we call distributional dynamics (DD). We then consider several specific examples and show how DD can be used to prove convergence of SGD to networks with nearly ideal generalization error. This description allows for “averaging out” some of the complexities of the landscape of neural networks and can be used to prove a general convergence result for noisy SGD.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 38, 'citationCount': 687, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2068869988', 'name': 'Song Mei'}, {'authorId': '145071265', 'name': 'A.

However, challenges of such blend learning model, for example, how to avoid the learners’ distraction from online games, triggered many concerns from software engineers and educators. This paper investigated the factors and driving mechanism to construct a learner’s technology engagement (TE) model towards ubiquitous game-based learning (UGL) in the smart campus context. Based on the technology acceptance model and the media system dependency theory, this paper identified the relationships among individual expectation (IE), facility environment, social environment (SE), and TE. A total of 168 participants, who were randomly assigned in the UGL settings, took part in the investigation. SPSS 19.0 was employed to analyze factorial validity, internal consistency reliability, correlation, and multiple regression analyses. The result shows that learners’ TE toward UGL was influenced directly by IE (including fragmented learning and infotainment learning) and SE (including peer coaching and parental supports). In addition, the ease of use significantly moderated the fragmented learning and TE in the context of smart campus, while it was an insignificant moderator of infotainment. Besides, the ease of use significantly moderated the coaching of peers and TE, while it failed to moderate the parental supports and TEs.

Brain–computer interfaces (BCI) enable direct communication with a computer, using neural activity as the control signal. This neural signal is generally chosen from a variety of well-studied electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. For a given BCI paradigm, feature extractors and classifiers are tailored to the distinct characteristics of its expected EEG control signal, limiting its application to that specific signal. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have been used in computer vision and speech recognition to perform automatic feature extraction and classification, have successfully been applied to EEG-based BCIs; however, they have mainly been applied to single BCI paradigms and thus it remains unclear how these architectures generalize to other paradigms. Here, we ask if we can design a single CNN architecture to accurately classify EEG signals from different BCI paradigms, while simultaneously being as compact as possible. Approach. In this work we introduce EEGNet, a compact convolutional neural network for EEG-based BCIs. We introduce the use of depthwise and separable convolutions to construct an EEG-specific model which encapsulates well-known EEG feature extraction concepts for BCI. We compare EEGNet, both for within-subject and cross-subject classification, to current state-of-the-art approaches across four BCI paradigms: P300 visual-evoked potentials, error-related negativity responses (ERN), movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP), and sensory motor rhythms (SMR). Main results. We show that EEGNet generalizes across paradigms better than, and achieves comparably high performance to, the reference algorithms when only limited training data is available across all tested paradigms. In addition, we demonstrate three different approaches to visualize the contents of a trained EEGNet model to enable interpretation of the learned features. Significance.

This paper uses two classification methods, the hidden Markov model (HMM) and the support vector machine (SVM), to classify five emotional states: anger, happiness, sadness, surprise and a neutral state. In the HMM method, 39 candidate instantaneous features were extracted, and the sequential forward selection (SFS) method was used to find the best feature subset. The classification performance of the selected feature subset was then compared with that of the Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC). Within the method based on SVM, a new vector measuring the difference between Mel frequency scale sub-bands energies is proposed. The performance of the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier using the proposed vector was also investigated.

This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.', 'year': 2003, 'referenceCount': 35, 'citationCount': 6928, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1751762', 'name': 'Yoshua Bengio'}, {'authorId': '36037226', 'name': 'Réjean Ducharme'}, {'authorId': '120247189', 'name': 'Pascal Vincent'}, {'authorId': '1909943744', 'name': 'Christian Janvin'}]}, {'paperId': '03de8578480c53677c484e1facfced74f4f5b045', 'title': 'Digital selection and analogue amplification coexist in a cortex-inspired silicon circuit', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2000, 'referenceCount': 33, 'citationCount': 1134, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2391278', 'name': 'Richard Hans Robert Hahnloser'}, {'authorId': '1994245', 'name': 'R.

Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster.

Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks.

These range from extreme localist theories in which each concept is represented by a single neural unit (Barlow 1972) to extreme distributed theories in which a concept corresponds to a pattern of activity over a large part of the cortex. These two extremes are the natural implementations of two different theories of semantics. In the structuralist approach, concepts are defined by their relationships to other concepts rather than by some internal essence. The natural expression of this approach in a neural net is to make each concept be a single unit with no internal structure and to use the connections between units to encode the relationships between concepts. In the componential approach each concept is simply a set offeatures and so a neural net can be made to implement a set of concepts by assigning a unit to each feature and setting the strengths of the connections between units so that each concept corresponds to a stable pattern of activity distributed over the whole network (Hopfield 1982; Kohonen 1977; Willshaw, Buneman, and Longuet-Higgins 1969). The network can then perform concept completion (i.e. retrieve the whole concept from a sufficient subset of its features). The problem with componential theories is that they have little to say about how concepts are used for structured reasoning. They are primarily concerned with the similarities between concepts or with pairwise associations. They provide no obvious way of representing articulated structures composed of a number of concepts playing different roles within the structure. Role-specific units One way of using neural nets to implement articulated structures of the kind shown in the semantic net formalism in Fig. 3.1 (a) is to assign a group of neural units to each possible role and to make the pattern of activity of the units in Learning distributed representations of concepts 47 that group represent the concept that fills the role (Hinton 1981). Each unit then represents the conjunction of a role with a feature of the concept filling that role (e.g. a unit might be active tffthe agent is male). A proposition can then be represented by a stable combination of role fillers as shown in Fig. 3.l(b).

This research looks into how to treat them with game therapy. In game therapy, the counsellor encourages the client to identify personal history that may have had an influence on the current circumstance, primarily through play but also through words, in a way that is consistent with the impacted role. Because it can help people communicate, uncover hidden ideas and feelings, confront unresolved trauma, and experience personal growth, game therapy is widely regarded as an important, effective, and developmentally appropriate mental health treatment. Here the environment is created by using a minified chess game with an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Virtual Assistant to assist the player (patient) in teaching the game and stimulating their cognitive skills. In order to prevent short-term oscillations from a moving target, the agent is trained using Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN) methods for reinforcement learning. With a replay memory, Given that it takes into account the unpredictability that would come from online learning, the first method more closely approaches a supervised learning issue. The goal of this Virtual AI agent is to only assist the player. It will not help the patient in winning the games, but rather to help the patient to learn chess faster and stimulate the cognitive ability. The agent is programmed to assist the patient in two ways, either to take an attacking approach or to play-safe. This agent will also provide more information on why the move was suggested or warned. Thus, by making the patient more involved in the game and resulting in an improvement in cognitive ability of the patient.', 'year': 2023, 'referenceCount': 19, 'citationCount': 1, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2216274071', 'name': 'Joypriyanka M'}, {'authorId': '2127202961', 'name': 'S.

In this work, we used these quantum advantages to enhance deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Our primary and foremost goal is to investigate and elucidate a way of representing and solving the frozen lake problems by using PennyLane which contains Xanadu’s back-end quantum processing unit. This paper specifically discusses how to enhance classical deep reinforcement learning algorithms with quantum computing technology, making quantum agents get a maximum reward after a fixed number of epochs and realizing the effect of a number of variational quantum layers on the trainability of enhanced framework. We have analyzed that, as the number of layers increases, the ability of the quantum agent to converge to the optimal state also increases. For this work, we have trained the framework agent with 2, 3, and 5 variational quantum layers. An agent with 2 layers converges to a total reward of 0.95 after the training episode of 526. The other agent with layers converges to a total reward of 0.95 after the training episode of 397 and the agent which uses 5 quantum variational layers converges to a total reward of 0.95 after the training episode of 72. From this, we can understand that the agent with a more variational layer exploits more and converges to the optimal state before the other agent. We also analyzed our work in terms of different learning rate hyperparameters. We recorded every single learning epoch to demonstrate the outcomes of enhanced DRL algorithms with selected 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 learning rates or alpha values. From this result, we can conclude that the greater the learning rate values in quantum deep reinforcement learning, the fewer timesteps it takes to move from the start point to the goal state.', 'year': 2023, 'referenceCount': 40, 'citationCount': 2, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2175518845', 'name': 'Getahun Fikadu Tilaye'}, {'authorId': '2150378402', 'name': 'Amit Pandey'}]}, {'paperId': '87cb54ebbb8e05a4d9c603b0eaadc02008a5bc33', 'title': 'Design of a Hyper-Casual Futsal Mobile Game Using a Machine-Learned AI Agent-Player', 'abstract': 'Mobile games continue to gain popularity, and their revenues are increasing accordingly. However, due to the inherent constraints of small screen sizes and restrictions of computing, it has been considered challenging to simulate the complex gameplay of soccer games. To this end, this paper aims to design and develop a simplified version of a five vs. five hyper-casual futsal game with only three player positions: goalkeeper, striker, and defender. It also tests a demo game to verify whether it is possible to implement an AI agent-player for each position to machine-learn and to run on a mobile device. A demo game with an AI agent-player was simulated using both PPO and SAC algorithms, and the feasibility and stability of the algorithms were compared.

The multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) method is applied in similar scenarios to help agents make decisions. In various situations, the agents of both sides may crash due to collisions. However, the existing algorithms cannot deal with the situation where the number of agents reduces. Based on the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm, we study a method to deal with a reduction in the number of agents in the training process without changing the structure of the neural network (NN), which is called the frozen agent method for the MADDPG (FA-MADDPG) algorithm. In addition, we design a distance–collision reward function to help agents learn strategies better. Through the experiments in four scenarios with different numbers of agents, it is verified that the algorithm we proposed can not only successfully deal with the problem of agent number reduction in the training stage but also show better performance and higher efficiency than the MADDPG algorithm in simulation.', 'year': 2023, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 2, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2200103588', 'name': 'Xilun Li'}, {'authorId': '2145304762', 'name': 'Zhanfeng Li'}, {'authorId': '2200197071', 'name': 'Xiaolong Zheng\xa0'}, {'authorId': '2200187986', 'name': 'Xuebo Yang\xa0'}, {'authorId': '2200196212', 'name': 'Xinghu Yu\xa0'}]}, {'paperId': 'be33823886361b68d27a33f7dfb0986a8414ac33', 'title': 'Techniques and Paradigms in Modern Game AI Systems', 'abstract': 'Games have long been benchmarks and test-beds for AI algorithms.

Therefore, even in a restricted game instance, the state-space of the game can still be unbounded, making it challenging for a computer program to excel.

Methods: This is a 24-week, single-blind, randomised pilot study conducted on 46 mildly impaired patients suspected of having Alzheimer’s disease receiving stable treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs). The patients were divided into three groups: (1) those who received 3 weekly, 20-min sessions of IMIS in addition to 8 h/day of an integrated psychostimulation program (IPP); (2) those who received only IPP sessions; and (3) those who received only ChEI treatment. The primary outcome measure was the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog). Secondary outcome measures were: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Syndrom Kurztest, Boston Naming Test, Verbal Fluency, and the Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test story recall subtest. Results: After 12 weeks, the patients treated with both IMIS and IPP had improved outcome scores on the ADAS-Cog and MMSE, which was maintained through 24 weeks of follow-up. The patients treated with IPP alone had better outcome than those treated with ChEIs alone, but the effects were attenuated after 24 weeks. All patients had improved scores in all of the IMIS individual tasks, attaining higher levels of difficulty in all cases.

This study aims to employ play therapy methods and Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents to aid children with Down syndrome and help them enhance their abilities like physical and mental skills by playing games with them. This Agent is designed to be smart enough to analyze each patient's lack of ability and provide a specific set of challenges in the game to improve that ability. Increasing the game's difficulty can help players develop these skills. The agent should be able to assess each player's skill gap and tailor the game to them accordingly. The agent's job is not to make the patient victorious but to boost their morale and skill sets in areas like physical activities, intelligence, and social interaction. The primary objective is to improve the player's physical activities such as muscle reflexes, motor controls and hand-eye coordination. Here, the study concentrates on the employment of several distinct techniques for training various models. This research focuses on comparing the reinforcement learning algorithms like the Deep Q-Learning Network, QR-DQN, A3C and PPO-Actor Critic.

Apart from the promising benefits of the IIoT networks, several challenging issues need to be resolved, such as network connectivity, security, privacy, heterogeneity, scheduling, and energy efficiency. Due to the large-scale deployment and heterogeneity of the nodes in IIoT networks, some energy-limited nodes have existed in the IIoT networks, resulting in reduced network lifetime. At the same time, security and privacy are also considered as the major issues that exist in the design of IIoT, which can be addressed using secure routing techniques. In this view, this study develops a trust-aware multiobjective metaheuristic optimization-based secure clustering with route planning (TAMOMO-SCRP) technique for cluster-based IIoT environment. The presented TAMOMO-SCRP technique mainly focuses on the design of bald eagle search (BES) algorithm for clustering and routing processes. The proposed TAMOMO-SCRP model derives a fitness function for accomplishing maximum energy efficiency and security. For an effective clustering process, the TAMOMO-SCRP model designs an objective function involving four parameters such as trust level (TL), communication cost (CC), residual energy (RE), and node degree (ND). Besides, the route selection process is based on the fitness function with two variables, namely, queue length and link quality. For assessing the enhanced performance of the TAMOMO-SCRP model, a wide range of experiments were carried out to get the outcomes of network life time(NLT) as 39451,half network die (HND) as 25950 and Stability period (SP) 8000 time calculated no. of alive nodes.

16,8e5fa85559251083b00306a302e1ea82ddcbdacf,EDRA – An Emotional Health Detection And Recognition Assistant,"Mental Health and Physical Health together are equally responsible for the overall well-being of an individual. We often give a preference to what we see (the body) rather than what we feel (the mind), resulting in negligence of our mental health. Moreover, getting treated for a mental illness is something considered as “negative”; hence with the stigma against mental issues, people do not openly talk about it. Over the years, therapy has proved quite effective in ameliorating one's mental state, but it fails to meet the expense of every pocket. Therefore, we propose EDRA - a chatbot created in order to communicate with the user and provide an environment just like in therapy. This virtual therapy works with the help of two principal models, the Emotion Recognition System and Deep Neural Network Model. The Emotion Recognition System helps to recognize the mood/emotion of the user with the text input it receives from the user, and with the help of this emotion, the Deep Neural Network Model yields a relevant response. On termination of the conversation, a report of the user's mental state is formed, and accordingly, specific remedies are suggested to lighten the user's mood.",2021,0,1,"{'name': '2021 Asian

17,e1fba6b928143132d85d7357962a044b176cd0c3,Virtual Audience Providing AI-Generated Emotional Reactions to Enhance Self-Disclosure in Self-Introduction,"Abstract The ambiguity of online text communication coming from the lack of audiences’ social cues often causes misunderstanding, which arouses a negative image of the message sender. Likewise, message senders feel social anxiety about whether their intentions are properly conveyed, or whether their messages may not sound offensive or impolite in communicating with text such as writing a self-introduction letter. In this paper, we design and develop a messaging assistant (Emoware) prototype which visualizes the audience’s predicted emotions to motivate the message sender to reveal more information. We conducted a user study comparing Emoware to plain text interface with 56 participants and found that Emoware positively affects writing by improving users’ self-disclosure intention, social support, and self-disclosure. This study contributes to overcoming the limitations of text modality in online communication.",2022,85,0,"{'name': 'International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction', 'pages': '2702 - 2713',

We conducted a 2 (perceived agency: chatbot vs. human) × 3 (affect elicitation: embarrassment, anger, neutral) between‐subject lab experiment with 142 participants, who were randomly assigned to interact with either a perceived chatbot or a human representative. Key findings from self‐reported and behavioral data highlight the complexity of consumer–chatbot communication. Specifically, participants reported lower interaction satisfaction with the chatbot than with the human representative when anger was evoked. However, participants were more likely to disclose concerns of HPV risks and provide more elaborate answers to the perceived human representative when embarrassment was elicited. Overall, the chatbot performed comparably to the human representative in terms of perceived usefulness and influence over participants' compliance intention in all emotional contexts. The findings complement the Computers as Social Actors paradigm and offer strategic guidelines to capitalize on the relative advantages of chatbot versus human representatives."", 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 163, 'citationCount': 26, 'authors': [{'authorId': '14542280', 'name': 'W.

He treats the group as a collection of persons bound together by some form of love relationship, and to the formation of the group ascribes what to many will appear to be an overweighted importance to the leader. His discussions of the phenomena of “identification,” and of the relations of “being in love and hypnosis,” are interesting in themselves; but his application of the results of his discussions to the explanation of social behaviour is not convincing.Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego.By Dr. Sigm.

Although previous research has explored self-disclosure in virtual communities, little is known about the impact of other users, particularly their online social support, on self-disclosure.

In this study, we focus on the effect of comment order (e.g., sorting comments by the number of likes or by the time of posting) on the formation of public opinion. We explore whether reading comments sorted by number of likes (a) induces more comments from users, (b) increases the expression of user opinions in response to others’ comments through the action of liking or disliking comments and (c) consolidates user opinion. For the empirical verification of the effects of popularity metrics, we chose a common topic (increasing minimum wage), collected actual data (reviewing 3,251 articles and the numbers of associated comments, likes, and dislikes), and compared news categories based on the existence of popularity metrics. Semantic network analysis was conducted with UCINET and python for K-means clustering, and cosine similarity.

One promising application for chatbots is to elicit people's self-disclosure of their personal experiences, thoughts, and feelings. As receiving one's deep self-disclosure is critical for mental health professionals to understand people's mental status, chatbots show great potential in the mental health domain. However, there is a lack of research addressing if and how people self-disclose sensitive topics to a real mental health professional (MHP) through a chatbot. In this work, we designed, implemented and evaluated a chatbot that offered three chatting styles; we also conducted a study with 47 participants who were randomly assigned into three groups where each group experienced the chatbot's self-disclosure at varying levels respectively. After using the chatbot for a few weeks, participants were introduced to a MHP and were asked if they would like to share their self-disclosed content with the MHP. If they chose to share, the participants had the option of changing (adding, deleting, and editing) the content they self-disclosed to the chatbot. Comparing participants' self-disclosure data the week before and the week after sharing with the MHP, our results showed that, within each group, the depth of participants' self-disclosure to the chatbot remained after sharing with the MHP; participants exhibited deeper self-disclosure to the MHP through a more self-disclosing chatbot; further, through conversation log analysis, we found that some participants made different edits on their self-disclosed content before sharing it with the MHP. Participants' interview and survey feedback suggested an interaction between participants' trust in the chatbot and their trust in the MHP, which further explained participants' self-disclosure behavior."", 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 87, 'citationCount': 60, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1666425161', 'name': 'Yi-Chieh Lee'}, {'authorId': '1696689', 'name': 'Naomi Yamashita'}, {'authorId': '2108831382', 'name': 'Yun Huang'}]}, {'paperId': '6b85b63579a916f705a8e10a49bd8d849d91b1fc', 'title': 'Language Models are Few-Shot Learners', 'abstract': ""Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general."", 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 143, 'citationCount': 16811, 'authors': [{'authorId': '31035595', 'name': 'Tom B.

Perceived stigma prevents many from reporting their symptoms. Stigma is a particularly pervasive problem among military service members, preventing them from reporting symptoms of combat-related conditions like posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, research shows increased reporting by service members when anonymous assessments are used. For example, service members report more symptoms of PTSD when they anonymously answer the Post-Deployment Health Assessment (PDHA) symptom checklist compared to the official PDHA, which is identifiable and linked to their military records. To investigate the factors that influence reporting of psychological symptoms by service members, we used a transformative technology: automated virtual humans that interview people about their symptoms. Such virtual human interviewers allow simultaneous use of two techniques for eliciting disclosure that would otherwise be incompatible; they afford anonymity while also building rapport. We examined whether virtual human interviewers could increase disclosure of mental health symptoms among active-duty service members that just returned from a year-long deployment in Afghanistan. Service members reported more symptoms during a conversation with a virtual human interviewer than on the official PDHA. They also reported more to a virtual human interviewer than on an anonymized PDHA. A second, larger sample of active-duty and former service members found a similar effect that approached statistical significance. Because respondents in both studies shared more with virtual human interviewers than an anonymized PDHA -even though both conditions control for stigma and ramifications for service members’ military records- virtual human interviewers that build rapport may provide a superior option to encourage reporting.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 68, 'citationCount': 161, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2419453', 'name': 'Gale M.

Objective The objective of the study was to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a fully automated conversational agent to deliver a self-help program for college students who self-identify as having symptoms of anxiety and depression. Methods In an unblinded trial, 70 individuals age 18-28 years were recruited online from a university community social media site and were randomized to receive either 2 weeks (up to 20 sessions) of self-help content derived from CBT principles in a conversational format with a text-based conversational agent (Woebot) (n=34) or were directed to the National Institute of Mental Health ebook, “Depression in College Students,” as an information-only control group (n=36). All participants completed Web-based versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale at baseline and 2-3 weeks later (T2). Results Participants were on average 22.2 years old (SD 2.33), 67% female (47/70), mostly non-Hispanic (93%, 54/58), and Caucasian (79%, 46/58). Participants in the Woebot group engaged with the conversational agent an average of 12.14 (SD 2.23) times over the study period. No significant differences existed between the groups at baseline, and 83% (58/70) of participants provided data at T2 (17% attrition). Intent-to-treat univariate analysis of covariance revealed a significant group difference on depression such that those in the Woebot group significantly reduced their symptoms of depression over the study period as measured by the PHQ-9 (F=6.47; P=.01) while those in the information control group did not. In an analysis of completers, participants in both groups significantly reduced anxiety as measured by the GAD-7 (F1,54= 9.24; P=.004).

Siblings are frequent companions during childhood (McHale & Crouter, 1996) and adolescence (Updegraff, McHale, Whiteman, Thayer, & Delgado, 2005), and they remain central to the lives of many adults (Gold, 1989; Spitze & Trent, 2006). Despite decreasing contact and proximity during adulthood (Carstensen, 1992; White, 2001), for many people siblings continue to play a particularly important role during major life events and transitions such as marriage, the birth of children, divorce, and the death of family members (Connidis, 1992). However, some sibling relationships are considerably apathetic and disconnected by the time adulthood arrives (Gold, 1989). Although this may stem from a continuation of relationships that were distant during childhood (McGuire, McHale, & Updegraff, 1996), there is some evidence that siblings may become less close during adulthood as a result of new sibling rivalries related to parental differential treatment (e.g., Suitor, Gilligan, & Pillemer, 2013). However, only in rare cases do siblings actually react negatively to parental differential treatment (Kowal, Krull, & Kramer, 2006). Thus, other important processes may contribute to siblings' abilities to maintain positive and involved relationships with one another through later stages of life.An investigation of sibling relationships during the initial transition out of the family home may be a particularly fruitful avenue by which to better understand why some siblings eventually driftapart while others remain close through old age. According to Erikson's (1968) theory of psychosocial development, a major task for late adolescents is the development of an integrated identity based on both prior familial relationships and individual exploration. This requires a recentering of close relationships, whereby peer and romantic relationships gain prominence as ties with parents (Tanner, 2006) and siblings (CongerL however, many different technologies are available to help siblings maintain communication, and college students who move away from the family home may be one group that relies heavily on these methods (Conger & Little, 2010). As Hertlein (2012) proposed in her multitheoretical model addressing the intersections between technology and family life, technology introduces additional avenues for family interaction, which may have important consequences for our interpretation of family relationship qualities as well as our methods of relationship maintenance. Sociotechnological theory (Lanigan, 2009) suggests that information and communication technologies (ICTs) may influence these aspects of family relationships to varying degrees based on ICT characteristics, individual traits, and family-wide factors. Specifically, ICTs allow for two possible types of communication (Hertlein, 2012; Rabby & Walther, 2003): synchronous and asynchronous. …"", 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 53, 'citationCount': 30, 'authors': [{'authorId': '36182926', 'name': 'Anna K.

It plays a crucial role in our everyday social life, having implications for the survival of the species. In the case of agents that inhabit virtual worlds and interact socially among each other and with humans, empathy has also been considered to be an important mechanism to promote engaging and believable interactions. However, creating empathic agents, until recently, has been accomplished mostly through the implementation of specific empathic behaviors or by using domain-dependent empirical models. In this article, we propose a generic computational model of empathy that is grounded on recent psychological theories about empathy. The proposed model treats empathy as a process in which the intensity of the empathic response is modulated by a set of factors that involve the relationship between the agents of the empathic interaction, namely, the similarity and affective link, as well as some characteristics of the empathizer agent, such as mood and personality. This model was implemented into an affective agent architecture, which was then used in an evaluation that had 77 participants. The results indicate that our empathy model, when used to simulate a social scenario with a small group of agents, significantly changed the way that the users perceived and described the interactions between those agents.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 54, 'citationCount': 31, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2997654', 'name': 'Sérgio Hortas Rodrigues'}, {'authorId': '145689493', 'name': 'S.

We manipulated postural mimicry by the virtual interaction partner during a conversation about a sensitive conflict issue. Mimicry increased empathy toward the Palestinians, irrespective of participants' feelings toward the Palestinians prior to the experiment. Further, mimicked participants who reported a priori negative feelings toward Palestinians expressed more sympathy toward their Palestinian virtual interaction partner, rated themselves as closer to him, and perceived the interaction as more harmonious compared to participants in a counter-mimicry condition. The results underscore the impact of mimicry on intergroup interactions, especially on individuals who harbor negative feelings toward the outgroup.

Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation.

In this paper, we combine survey and large-scale log data to examine how well users' perceptions of their audience match their actual audience on Facebook. We find that social media users consistently underestimate their audience size for their posts, guessing that their audience is just 27% of its true size. Qualitative coding of survey responses reveals folk theories that attempt to reverse-engineer audience size using feedback and friend count, though none of these approaches are particularly accurate. We analyze audience logs for 222,000 Facebook users' posts over the course of one month and find that publicly visible signals --- friend count, likes, and comments --- vary widely and do not strongly indicate the audience of a single post.

This paper makes two main contributions. First, an experiment demonstrates that an observer's perception of an interacting pair is affected by the time lags found in their actions and reactions in facial expressions and by whether their expressions are congruent or not. For example, a congruent but delayed reaction is unlikely to be perceived as empathy. Based on our findings, we propose a probabilistic model that relates the perceived empathy/antipathy of external observers to the actions and reactions of conversation participants.

Information obtained by the computer was not available to influence the use of blood components for transfusion.\n\n\nSETTING\nThe computer interview was administered to donors at an American Red Cross blood donor center and at a mobile blood drive at a hospital.\n\n\nSUBJECTS\nConsecutive sample of 294 male and female blood donors 18 to 75 years of age.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nSubjects' responses to the computer-based interview as well as responses to the standard Red Cross written questionnaires and face-to-face interviews were used for donor assessment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe interview took an average of 8 minutes to complete. From among 272 donors who provided complete data, the computer identified 12 donors who reported either behaviors associated with a risk of HIV acquisition or symptoms compatible with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome; none of these donors had been so identified either by routine written questionnaires or by face-to-face interviews used to screen potential blood donors. Only one of the 12 identified donors used the confidential unit exclusion procedure to prevent use of his donated unit. The rate of elicitation of HIV-related factors by the computer interview was 12 (4.4%) of 272 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3% to 7.6%), compared with two (0.13%) of 1536 (95% confidence upper bound, 0.28%) using the standard Red Cross procedure (P less than .0001). Tests for antibodies to HIV were negative in blood samples from all of the 272 subjects studied. The subjects enjoyed the computer interview and judged it to be more private than the standard donor assessment method. They also predicted that donors would be more honest with the computer interview than with a human interviewer.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nComputer-based screening elicits more HIV-related factors in the health histories of blood donors than do the standard questionnaire and interviewing methods currently in use.

This article describes some of the issues raised by electronic communication, illustrates one empirical approach for investigating its social psychological effects, and discusses why social psychological research might contribute to a deeper understanding of computer-mediated communication specifically and of computers and technological change in society more generally. One objective of our research is to explore how people participate in computer-mediated communication and how computerization affects group efforts to reach consensus. In experiments, we have shown differences in participation, decisions, and interaction among groups meeting face to face and in simultaneous computer-linked discourse and communication by electronic mail. We discuss these results and the design of subsequent research to highlight the many researchable social psychological issues raised by computing and technological change. Computer technologies are improving so swiftly these days that few of us comprehend even a small part of the change. Computers are transforming work and, in some cases, lives. Whether eager for this or resistant, many people believe the organizational, social, and personal effects of computers will be deeply felt (De Sola Poole, 1977; Hiltz & Turoff, 1978; Kling, 1980). Today, no one can predict in any detail the nature of the transformations that computers will bring, but one aspect of life that will certainly be affected is communication. The use of electronic mail and messages, long-distance blackboards, computer bulletin boards, instantaneously transferable data banks, and simultaneous computer conferences is reportedly advancing ""like an avalanche"" (Stockton, 1981; also see Kraemer, 1981). The U.S. federal judiciary, for example, is using electronic mail to speed the circulation of appellate opinion drafts among panels of judges (Weis, 1983). Computer conferences are being used for such legal proceedings as admission of evidence, trial scheduling, giving parties access to documents, and expert interrogation (Bentz & Potrykus, 1976; ""Party-Line Plea,"" 1981). Other government agencies, such as the Department of Defense, as well as private firms, such as Westinghouse Corporation and Xerox Corporation, and some universities, use computer-mediated communication extensively for both routine transfer of data and nonroutine interpersonal communication and project work (e.g., Licklider & Vezza, 1978; U.S. Department of Commerce, 1977; Wang Corporation, 1982). Computer-mediated communication was once confined to technical users and was considered somewhat arcane. This no longer holds true. Computer-mediated communication is a key component of the emerging technology of computer networks. In networks, people can exchange, store, edit, broadcast, and copy any written document. They can send data and messages instantaneously, easily, at low cost, and over long distances. Two or more people can look at a document and revise it together, consult with each other on critical matters without meeting together or setting up a telephone conference, or ask for and give assistance interactively (Hiltz & Turoff, 1978; Williams, 1977). Networks, and hence computer-mediated communications, are proliferating at a tremendous rate. In addition to the older long-distance networks that connect thousands of scientists, professionals, and managers (e.g., the Department of Defense\'s ARPANET, GTE\'s TELENET), there are more and more local-area networks that link up computers within a region, city, or organization (e.g., Nestar System\'s CLUSTERBUS, Xerox\'s ETHERNET, Ford Aerospace\'s FLASHNET, and Wang Laboratories\' WANGNET). Stimulating this growth are the decreasing costs and the advantages of networks over stand-alone systems, such as sharing high-speed printers and access to a common interface for otherwise incompatible equipment. The future of this technology cannot be foretold, but it is far from arcane. The functions and impact of computer-mediated communication are still poorly understood. Critical information (such as who uses it for what purposes) October 1984 • American Psychologist Copyright 1984 by the American Psychological Aisociation, Inc. Vol. 39, No. 10, 1123-1134 1123 is lacking, and the social psychological significance is controversial (see, e.g., Turoff, 1982). Computers could make communication easier, just as the canning of perishables and the development of can openers made food preparation easier, or they could have much more complex implications. For instance, access to electronic communication may change the flow of information within organizations, altering status relations and organizational hierarchy. When a manager can receive electronic mail from 10,000 employees, what happens to existing controls over participation and information? When people can publish and distribute their own electronic newspaper at no cost, does the distribution of power change too? When communication is rapid and purely textual, do working groups find it easier or harder to resolve conflict? These unanswered questions illustrate that, although the technology may be impressive, little systematic research exists on its psychological, social, and cultural significance. Given such conditions it seems sensible to try to understand the fundamental behavioral, social, and organizational processes that surround computer-mediated communication. We believe that ideas and approaches from social psychology and other areas of behavioral science can be applied to these questions. This article is meant to describe some of the issues raised by electronic communication; to illustrate, from our own work, one empirical approach for investigating them; and to show why social psychological research might contribute to a deeper understanding of electronic communication specifically and of computers and technological change in society more generally. We begin by citing some existing research on computer-mediated communication. Most of this research addresses the technical capabilities of the electronic technologies. Next, we consider the possible social psychological impact, and we discuss some hypotheses and some possible implications for the outcomes of communication. Finally, we describe some of our own experiments on social psychological aspects of computer-mediated communication, using these to indicate potential lines of future research.', 'year': 1984, 'referenceCount': 104, 'citationCount': 2645, 'authors': [{'authorId': '47198673', 'name': 'S.

In many online health communities, writing comprises a substantial portion of the user experience, yet little work has explored how writing itself affects user engagement. This paper explores user engagement on CaringBridge, a prominent online community for writing about personal health journeys. We build a survival analysis model, defining a new set of variables that operationalize expressive writing, and comparing these effects to those of social support, which are well-known to benefit user engagement. Furthermore, we use machine learning methods to estimate that approximately one third of community members who self-identify with a cancer condition cease engagement due to literal death. Finally, we provide quantitative evidence that: (1) receiving support, expressive writing, and giving support, in decreasing magnitude of relative impact, are associated with user engagement on CaringBridge, and (2) that considering deceased sites separately in our analysis significantly shifts our interpretations of user behavior.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 102, 'citationCount': 33, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2216293004', 'name': 'C.

Such advantages have helped to drive the growth of online surveys over recent years. In addition to the growth of online surveys, respondents are increasingly required to answer more personal and sensitive questions online. It is therefore important to investigate and understand the behaviour of respondents to sensitive questions in surveys in order to ensure the most effective methodology is employed. A salient issue in online survey research is the removal of an interviewer. This is particularly relevant when dealing with sensitive topics when the lack of interviewer presence can remove response bias. Much research has demonstrated that surveys administered online, without an interviewer being present, are characterised by higher levels of self disclosure (Weisband and Kiesler 1996), an increased willingness to answer sensitive questions (Tourangeau 2004) and reductions in socially desirable responding (Frick et al. 2001; Joinson 1999). Furthermore, survey methodologies that reduce the level of question administration by human interviewers (e.g. via computer-aided self interviews) also increase responses to sensitive personal questions and yield more honest, candid answers. As part of the ongoing experimental work at Ipsos MORI we are investigating the affect of different survey methodologies on respondents’ behaviour to sensitive questions. In the present paper we present a two part study. Part 1 searches evidence of survey mode effect on disclosure levels and examines data consisting of participants interviewed in one of three conditions. In condition one, 1,645 members of the Ipsos Online Panel completed an online survey. In condition two, 902 were interviewed offline, face-to-face using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) interviewing. Finally, in condition three, 1028 participants were again interviewed offline, using Computer Assisted Self Interviewing (CASI). Direct comparison were possible between the two offline samples. Allocation to the online sample, on the other hand, was not randomized thus propensity score adjustment was applied to control for possible confounding of online/offline comparisons. Respondents were asked more than 50 questions about a variety of topics from', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 18, 'citationCount': 21, 'authors': [{'authorId': '32534703', 'name': 'Yehuda Dayan'}, {'authorId': '66210657', 'name': 'Ipsos Mori'}, {'authorId': '49426410', 'name': 'Carina Paine'}]}, {'paperId': None, 'title': 'Emotional expressiveness in Asian - and European - Americans : Effects of implicit audience and ethnic identity', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': None, 'citationCount': None, 'authors': []}, {'paperId': '2a58ed7d2657a50b8764239469970fae40bae876', 'title': 'Mindfulness and Interpersonal Communication', 'abstract': 'Many social problems can be traced to interpersonal communication difficulties,just as many proposed interventions to solve social ills also depend on effectiveinterpersonal communication.

In this paper, we describe the design of Amy, a conversational agent that explains social situations to help guide a child in understanding when to use socially appropriate behavior. A breathing exercise feature for emotion regulation is activated when a negative emotion is detected from the child’s input. Interviews with parents and a child psychologist informed the design of Amy as well as the 12 social stories themes that Amy shares with children. Interview inputs and previous works suggested four design considerations for social-emotional learning companions to facilitate better interaction by including relevant social story themes, formulating open-domain conversation flow, incorporating appropriate and guided emotion regulation exercise, and using lively visual user interface.",2022,65,4,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 21st Annual

However, which of these “big three” health behaviors most strongly predicts mental health and well-being, and their higher-order relationships in predictive models, is less known. This study investigated the differential and higher-order associations between sleep, physical activity, and dietary factors as predictors of mental health and well-being in young adults. Method In a cross-sectional survey design, 1,111 young adults (28.4% men) ages 18–25 from New Zealand and the United States answered an online survey measuring typical sleep quantity and quality; physical activity; and consumption of raw and processed fruit and vegetables, fast food, sweets, and soda, along with extensive covariates (including demographics, socioeconomic status, body mass index, alcohol use, smoking, and health conditions) and the outcome measures of depressive symptoms [measured by the Center for Epidemiological Depression Scale (CES-D)] and well-being (measured by the Flourishing Scale). Results Controlling for covariates, sleep quality was the strongest predictor of depressive symptoms and well-being, followed by sleep quantity and physical activity. Only one dietary factor—raw fruit and vegetable consumption—predicted greater well-being but not depressive symptoms when controlling for covariates. There were some higher-order interactions among health behaviors in predicting the outcomes, but these did not survive cross-validation. Conclusion Sleep quality is an important predictor of mental health and well-being in young adults, whereas physical activity and diet are secondary but still significant factors. Although strictly correlational, these patterns suggest that future interventions could prioritize sleep quality to maximize mental health and well-being in young adults.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 70, 'citationCount': 51, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2034055971', 'name': 'Shay-Ruby Wickham'}, {'authorId': '1485669084', 'name': 'Natasha A.

With innovations ranging from ‘virtual psychotherapists’ to social robots in dementia care and autism disorder, to robots for sexual disorders, artificially intelligent virtual and robotic agents are increasingly taking on high-level therapeutic interventions that used to be offered exclusively by highly trained, skilled health professionals. In order to enable responsible clinical implementation, ethical and social implications of the increasing use of embodied AI in mental health need to be identified and addressed. Objective This paper assesses the ethical and social implications of translating embodied AI applications into mental health care across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology and Psychotherapy. Building on this analysis, it develops a set of preliminary recommendations on how to address ethical and social challenges in current and future applications of embodied AI. Methods Based on a thematic literature search and established principles of medical ethics, an analysis of the ethical and social aspects of currently embodied AI applications was conducted across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, the analysis was structured around the following three steps: assessment of potential benefits; analysis of overarching ethical issues and concerns; discussion of specific ethical and social issues of the interventions. Results From an ethical perspective, important benefits of embodied AI applications in mental health include new modes of treatment, opportunities to engage hard-to-reach populations, better patient response, and freeing up time for physicians. Overarching ethical issues and concerns include: harm prevention and various questions of data ethics; a lack of guidance on development of AI applications, their clinical integration and training of health professionals; ‘gaps’ in ethical and regulatory frameworks; the potential for misuse including using the technologies to replace established services, thereby potentially exacerbating existing health inequalities. Specific challenges identified and discussed in the application of embodied AI include: matters of risk-assessment, referrals, and supervision; the need to respect and protect patient autonomy; the role of non-human therapy; transparency in the use of algorithms; and specific concerns regarding long-term effects of these applications on understandings of illness and the human condition. Conclusions We argue that embodied AI is a promising approach across the field of mental health; however, further research is needed to address the broader ethical and societal concerns of these technologies to negotiate best research and medical practices in innovative mental health care. We conclude by indicating areas of future research and developing recommendations for high-priority areas in need of concrete ethical guidance.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 102, 'citationCount': 213, 'authors': [{'authorId': '46217950', 'name': 'A.

Using the data from 47 individuals, feedback and dialogue generation were automated using a hidden Markov model and a schema-driven dialogue manager capable of handling multi-topic conversations. We conducted a study with nine high-functioning ASD teenagers. Through a thematic analysis of post-experiment interviews, identified several key design considerations, notably: 1) Users should be fully briefed at the outset about the purpose and limitations of the system, to avoid unrealistic expectations. 2) An interface should incorporate positive acknowledgment of behavior change. 3) Realistic appearance of a virtual agent and responsiveness are important in engaging users. 4) Conversation personalization, for instance in prompting laconic users for more input and reciprocal questions, would help the teenagers engage for longer terms and increase the system's utility."", 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 68, 'citationCount': 30, 'authors': [{'authorId': '22858671', 'name': 'M.

This paper presents robots that play several important roles and benefits in the interaction of children with autism. In the absence of dialogue corpus, we collected and integrated conversation data for children with autism.

Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short- and long-term positive outcomes. Objective This study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression. Methods In the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations. Results The average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre- and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging. Conclusions The real-world data evaluation findings on the effectiveness and engagement levels of Wysa app on users with self-reported symptoms of depression show promise. However, further work is required to validate these initial findings in much larger samples and across longer periods.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 55, 'citationCount': 330, 'authors': [{'authorId': '46691130', 'name': 'B.

After reviewing some literature related to retrieval process, repetition is one effective way to promote retrieval process. Since repeated encounters of the words facilitate the students to access the words-related information in their mind, repetition activity will be the effective solution for this context. The spaced repetition as proposed by Baddley (1990) can be appropriate for this context since learners will not be bored about the repetition.

Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and ACM Digital using a predefined search strategy. Studies were included if they focused on consumers or healthcare professionals; involved a conversational agent using any unconstrained natural language input; and reported evaluation measures resulting from user interaction with the system. Studies were screened by independent reviewers and Cohen’s kappa measured inter-coder agreement. Results The database search retrieved 1513 citations; 17 articles (14 different conversational agents) met the inclusion criteria. Dialogue management strategies were mostly finite-state and frame-based (6 and 7 conversational agents, respectively); agent-based strategies were present in one type of system. Two studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 1 was cross-sectional, and the remaining were quasi-experimental. Half of the conversational agents supported consumers with health tasks such as self-care. The only RCT evaluating the efficacy of a conversational agent found a significant effect in reducing depression symptoms (effect size d\u2009=\u20090.44, p\u2009=\u2009.04). Patient safety was rarely evaluated in the included studies. Conclusions The use of conversational agents with unconstrained natural language input capabilities for health-related purposes is an emerging field of research, where the few published studies were mainly quasi-experimental, and rarely evaluated efficacy or safety. Future studies would benefit from more robust experimental designs and standardized reporting.

However, current findings are lacking as to whether the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and cortical regions are involved in the learning effect when subjects retrieve associative memory, and whether their activations differentially change over time due to learning experience. To address these issues, we designed an fMRI experiment in which face-scene pairs were learned once (L1) or six times (L6). Subjects learned the pairs at four retention intervals, 30-min, 1-day, 1-week and 1-month, after which they finished an associative recognition task in the scanner. The results showed that compared to learning once, learning six times led to stronger activation in the hippocampus, but weaker activation in the perirhinal cortex (PRC) as well as anterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vLPFC). In addition, the hippocampal activation was positively correlated with that of the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and negatively correlated with that of the vLPFC when the L6 group was compared to the L1 group. The hippocampal activation decreased over time after L1 but remained stable after L6.

Parents feel this is appropriate but self-audit and express hesitation, as they feel they are benefiting from an activity that can be detrimental to their child's well-being. We found that families turn off screens when parents are ready to give their child their full attention and technology presents a natural stopping point. Transitioning away from screens is often painful, and predictive factors determine the pain of a transition.

The role that storytelling played, even before the discovery of writing, in the diffusion of knowledge, in the construction of interpersonal relationships and in the birth of new societies, is well known. Without doubt writing is the earliest “technology” invented by man, through which culture and knowledge have been passed down over time, after having been transmitted orally for a long time. According to Barthes and Duisit (1975), in fact, storytelling begins with the same story of the human race, almost as if to represent an ontogenetically distinctive trait of the species, which unites homo sapiens with the homo digitalis of today’s society (Montag & Diefenbach, 2018). Other authors (Kenyon et al., 1996) argue that men and women not only have stories to tell, but that they are the stories they tell.

Here, using psychophysiological interaction analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we show that activity in specific areas of the frontal cortex (dorsolateral, dorsal medial, anterior cingulate, orbital) covaries with amygdala activity and that this functional connectivity is dependent on the reappraisal task.

Using a source memory procedure we were also able to compare how retrieval processing was modulated when the emotional encoding context was recollected or not. An interaction between emotional encoding context and accuracy of source memory revealed that successful retrieval of emotional context was associated with activity in left amygdala, and a left frontotemporal network including anterior insula, prefrontal cortex and cingulate. In contrast, when contextual retrieval was unsuccessful, items encoded in emotional contexts elicited enhanced activity in right amygdala and a right-lateralized network that included extrastriate visual areas. These findings indicate distinct effects of emotion on successful and unsuccessful retrieval of source information, including lateralization of amygdala responses.', 'year': 2005, 'referenceCount': 39, 'citationCount': 77, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2109352605', 'name': 'A.

Affective style refers to individual differences in valence-specific features of emotional reactivity and regulation. The different parameters of affective style can be objectively measured using specific laboratory probes. Relations between individual differences in prefrontal and amygdala function and specific components of affective style are illustrated. The final section of the article concludes with a brief discussion of plasticity in the central circuitry of emotion and the possibility that this circuitry can be shaped by training experiences that might potentially promote a more resilient, positive affective style.

Do some emotion regulation strategies have more to recommend them than others? According to Gross's (1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271-299) process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners.

Furthermore, due to a lack of medical facilities and medical practitioners’ hectic schedules, several examinations must now be performed by the general public. Also because of the high rate of transmissibility of COVID-19, even asymptomatic patients can readily transfer the virus to others, faster detection is critical during the initial phase of COVID-19, which is early identification. The earlier a patient is detected; the better the virus’s spread may be stopped and the patient can undergo proper treatment. As the nationwide vaccination process is in its later part, it is obvious that the government will uplift its regulations and the employees will have to return to their workplaces or offices. As a solution to this upcoming urgency the authors would like to propose a solution to identify COVID- 19 patients in advance at corporate level.

The prototype of the monitoring system used home pulse oximeter for measuring SpO2 and heart rate and an Android application working as IoT gateway to collect data from sensor and adding location information before sending the data to server. In server, an open source Elasticsearch Logstash Kibana (ELK) stack popular for logging and indexing large data continuously process incoming data so that medical staff can explore and visualize measurement results of patients and their location in a dashboard.

 Background: To date, the disparate burden of prostate cancer (CaP) in Black men (BM) is still poorly understood. More disconcerting is the limited access to effective, culturally tailored behavioral interventions to support BM diagnosed with CaP, especially at the point of prostate cancer diagnosis (PPCD). From the PPCD, the transition to CaP survivorship can be mentally and physically trying, especially for those lacking emotional and financial support. It is important to provide psycho-oncology support, address social determinants of health (SDOH) and make emotional support available to ethnically diverse BM at the PPCD. We are addressing the CaP disparities experienced by BM at the PPCD through the Inclusive Cancer Care Research Equity (iCCaRE) for Black Men Consortium. Aim: As part of the iCCaRE for Black men Consortium, the specific aim of our project is to develop a PPCD-based Augmented Reality (AR) intervention program, the iCCaRE PPCD Virtual Robot Assistant (ViRA). The ViRA is based on the established efficacy of six CaP care and survivorship (CaPCaS) video interventions, and will support BM at the PPCD. Methodology: The efficacy of six CaPCaS videos were established through formative research that included 17 BM in Florida. Based on pre- and post-test design, data were collected from participants using a structured survey tailored to each CaPCaS intervention: Prevention, Detection, Diagnosis, Treatment, Survivorship and Advocacy form. Following the efficacy study, the iCCaRE PPCD ViRA was proposed as one of five iCCaRE Science of Survivorship (S.O.S) projects to improve the quality of life of BM. Results: Most of the participants for the efficacy study reported that they were: US-born BM; married; college educated; earn less than $60,000; retired; have health insurance; have annual health examination; have a regular doctor; and were screened within the last year. The CaPCaS videos were found to be efficacious in improving attitude towards CaP screening, beliefs about CaP screening, perceived behavioral control and CaP knowledge. Participants also rated the quality of the videos high and expressed high satisfaction with the videos. We are currently in the development phase of the PPCD iCCaRE ViRA, which is based on behavioral science and health communications model. The ViRA will provide SDOH navigation services, psycho-oncology support and emotional support. The acceptance and usability of the iCCaRE ViRA will be established at urology clinics in Florida as part of the iCCaRE Consortium HEROICA Phase I study. We will test the central hypothesis that improving SDOH factors and CaPCaS-related factors will lead to an improvement in patient reported outcomes. Conclusion: We established the efficacy of the CaPCaS interventions in supporting BM across the CaP care continuum. The iCCaRE ViRA under development will target intervention at the PPCD and deliver a smart and connected personalized AR-enabled intervention system that will positively impact CaP diagnosis experience of BM.

Our study sought to understand barriers and facilitators for reducing road traffic injury among Indian adolescents and to identify community perspectives on future solutions. Twenty-one face to face interviews and five focus group discussions were held with a wide range of stakeholders. The interviews were thematically analysed by two researchers. Poor roads, lack of transportation alternatives and low levels of law enforcement increased adolescent exposure to dangerous road situations. Gender was important in exposure to risk- and risk-taking behaviours shown/portrayed by adolescents. Key suggestions to reduce adolescent road traffic injury included environment modification, behaviour change approaches including the use of social media and education through police personnel. Early and incremental education on road safety, increased parental accountability and education, more supervision by teachers at drop-offs and greater enforcement of traffic laws were also proposed.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 16, 'citationCount': 9, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5907206', 'name': 'J.

However, it remains unclear whether the precise mechanisms underlying the impacts of anxiety and depression on impulsivity. The present study examined how anxiety and depression influence impulsivity, as well as the mediating and moderating role of cognitive flexibility. A sample of 477 Chinese university students was recruited. All participants finished self-report measures of anxiety, depression, impulsivity, and cognitive flexibility. No significant gender difference was found in anxiety, depression, cognitive flexibility, and three subscale scores of impulsivity. Greater scores of anxiety and depression were associated with lower scores of cognitive flexibility and higher levels of impulsivity. Depression and cognitive flexibility could predict attention impulsivity and nonplanning impulsivity, while anxiety and cognitive flexibility could predict motor impulsivity. Cognitive flexibility served as a mediator in the links of anxiety and three subscales of impulsivity. Furthermore, cognitive flexibility moderated the impact of anxiety on motor impulsivity.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 45, 'citationCount': 47, 'authors': [{'authorId': '6949873', 'name': 'Yongju Yu'}, {'authorId': '6949873', 'name': 'Yongju Yu'}, {'authorId': '79499306', 'name': 'Yigang Lin'}]}, {'paperId': 'cd09c409098ed06b29131e4fd8550eb71cf1a7e5', 'title': 'The need for intellectual diversity in psychological science: Our own studies of actively open-minded thinking as a case study', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 92, 'citationCount': 39, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4248890', 'name': 'K.

The present study was conducted to investigate the mediating role of emotional regulation in the relationship between spiritual health with quality of life, psychological health, and burnout. Method : In this study, 231 staff from Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences completed Spiritual Well-Being Scale (SWBS), Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28), and Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). The gathered data were analyzed using Pearson correlation, Hierarchical Regression analysis, and Sobel’s test. Results: All variables were correlated with one another (p<0.001). The hierarchical regression analysis and Sobel’s test indicated that the emotional regulation have a relative mediating role in the relationship between spiritual health and quality of life (ß=0.53, Z=4.05, p<0.001) and a complete mediating role in the relationship between spiritual health with mental health (ß=0.68, Z=5.62, p<0.001) and burnout (ß=0.70, Z=6.12, p<0.001).

Lewin has been criticized by scholars for over-simplifying the change process and has been defended by others against such charges. However, what has remained unquestioned is the model’s foundational significance. It is sometimes traced (if it is traced at all) to the first article ever published in Human Relations. Based on a comparison of what Lewin wrote about changing as three steps with how this is presented in later works, we argue that he never developed such a model and it took form after his death.

Myside bias is defined between-participants as the mean difference in the evaluation of the proposition between groups with differing prior status on the variable.

Experts are concerned that the rise of social media may make interaction and information exchange among like-minded individuals more pronounced and therefore lead to increased disagreement in a society. This paper analyzes a learning model with endogenous network formation in which people have different types and live in different regions. I show that when the importance of social media increases, the amount of disagreement in the society first decreases and then increases. Simultaneously people of the same type hold increasingly similar beliefs. Furthermore, people who find it hard to communicate with people in the same region may interact with similar people online and consequently hold extreme beliefs. Finally, I propose a simple way to model people who neglect a potential correlation of signals and show that these people may be made worse off by social media.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 67, 'citationCount': 2, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145694842', 'name': 'Marco A.

For public transit, there have been health concerns over the potential spread to transit users and transit service staff, which prompted transportation agencies to make decisions about the service, e.g., whether to reduce or completely shut down services. These decisions had substantial negative consequences, especially for transit-dependent residents, and prompted transit users to explore alternative transport modes, e.g., bikeshare. However, local governments and the public in general have limited information about whether and to what extent bikeshare provided adequate accessibility and mobility to those transit-dependent residents. To fill this gap, this study implemented spatial and visual analytics to identify how micro-mobility in the form of bikesharing has addressed travel needs and improved the resilience of transportation systems. Specifically, the study analyzed the case of San Francisco in California, USA, and selected three phases of the pandemic, i.e., initial confirmed cases, shelter-in-place, and initial changes in transit service. First, the authors implemented unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to identify different trip types. Moreover, through spatiotemporally matching bikeshare ridership data with transit service information (i.e., General Transit Feed Specification, GTFS) using the tool called OpenTripPlanner (OTP), the authors studied the travel behavior changes (e.g., the proportion of bikeshare trips that could be finished by transit) for different bikeshare trip types over the three specified phases. This study revealed that during the pandemic, more casual users joined bikeshare programs; recreation-related bikeshare trips increased in terms of the proportions; and, routine trips became more prevalent considering that docking-station-based bikeshare trips increased. More importantly, the analyses also provided insights about mode substitution, because the analyses identified an increase in dockless bikeshare trips in areas with no or limited transit coverage.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 306, 'authors': [{'authorId': '40553466', 'name': 'Jennifer L.

23,290fd3a53057cddf74622dcc1c266cbef7617e55,Emotional Cognitive Regulation in University Students during Lockdown: A Comparative Analysis of Students from Spanish Universities,"Studies focusing on strategies for the cognitive regulation of emotions are gaining importance due to the development and perpetuation of psychopathologies. The obligatory home confinement imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to new virtual learning methodologies. Objective: Our objective aimed to analyze and compare the cognitive emotional regulation of students from universities on the Spanish mainland with that of students attending the Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. Methods: An online Emotional Regulation Questionnaire was applied, together with a survey covering the students’ beliefs about the pandemic, including information about their housing conditions and beliefs about online learning. The study included a sample of 1030 university students. Results: On the mainland and at Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, the students most frequently used adaptive strategies. Three of the strategies were used in both groups but to different extents (Acceptance, Positive reappraisal, Putting into perspective), while the other strategies were used in both groups to the same extent (Refocusing on planning, Positive refocusing, Rumination, Blaming others, Catastrophizing, Self-blame). Meanwhile, the results were quite similar regarding the students’ housing conditions and beliefs about the pandemic and online learning.",2021,66,3,{'name': 'Sustainability'},"{'model': 'specter_v1',

Considering that online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic may be an opportunity for university students to take greater responsibility for their learning, it is essential to explore the strategies they have developed in the face of emotional and learning challenges during the health crisis. This study aimed at analyzing the relationships between students' emotions, coping strategies, and self-regulated learning in online learning during COVID-19 home confinement. The participants were 1,290 Mexican students from different universities throughout the country, who answered an online self-report questionnaire from standardized instruments adapted to the pandemic. Data were analyzed with descriptive and inferential analyses, including a structural equation model (SEM). Findings indicate that, although anxiety, boredom, and frustration were present among participants during confinement, the primary emotions were gratitude, joy, and hope. Second, the main coping strategies used by students participating were focused on facing and reassessing the situation. Furthermore, tranquility, hope, gratitude, and joy were positively related to self-regulated learning, although, loneliness and disinterest were negatively related. Finally, it was found that an approach to coping strategies mediated the relationship between emotions and self-regulated learning. Thus, teachers should help students understand the relevance of active coping strategies and use student-centered learning models that promote autonomous and self-regulated learning, considering each learner's needs, during and after confinement."", 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 63, 'citationCount': 40, 'authors': [{'authorId': '48131750', 'name': 'M.

En primer lugar, se realizó un cuestionario a estudiantes de la Universidad de Extremadura (UEx) (n= 548) y a posteriori se efectuaron entrevistas online a miembros del equipo de gobierno de la universidad. Los resultados indican que los estudiantes procedentes de familias con un nivel formativo bajo tienen menos oportunidades de uso de tecnologías digitales. Las clases virtuales que han recibido han consistido esencialmente en presentaciones subidas al campus virtual con interacciones asíncronas. La valoración negativa que hacen de la enseñanza a distancia se explica por la inversa relación percibida entre dedicación al estudio y rendimiento académico y por falta de adaptación de los docentes a las circunstancias personales y académicas de los estudiantes.

The COVID-19 pandemic is a public emergency of international concern that affects several nations. The widespread outbreak of COVID-19 virus has brought not only the risk of death but also major psychological pressure. However, the psychological impact on university students has not been studied in Ethiopia. Objective To assess the psychological impacts of COVID-19 pandemic among university students in Bench-Sheko Zone, South-west, Ethiopia, 2020. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 15 to June 15/2020. A systematic sampling technique was employed to select the study participants. The data were entered into EpiData 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 24 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify candidates and independent factors respectively. Independent factors of depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed using AORs with 95% confidence level at P-value <0.05 cut point. Results Three hundred and twenty-two university students were included with a 97.5% response rate. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was 21.2%, 27.7%, and 32.5%, respectively. Being female, staying at home, history of medical illness, and poor and moderate social support increased the risk of depression. Not living with their parents, relatives got coronavirus and low family income were risk factors for anxiety. Moreover, substance use, depression, anxiety, and poor social support were increasing the risk of stress among university students. Conclusions and Recommendations This study revealed a higher prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among university students.

As the first country to do so, Chinese colleges and universities were making use of different modes of learning, including online-learning based on different platforms to achieve the goal suggested by Ministry of Education in China, “suspending classes without suspending learning,” since middle February. This paper is the first one which aims to investigate the anxiety of Chinese university students after the outbreak of COVID-19 right before the start of new spring term. 3611 university students (female: male = 1.48:1) aged between 18 to 24 from all over China were enrolled to this study from a top university in China. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale – SAS (Zung, 1971) was used to assess anxiety 2 days before the start of new spring term in middle February. All four-year undergraduate students were included in the study. The mean SAS score was 40.53 (SD = 10.15), significantly higher than the national norm (Mean = 29.78, SD = 10.07, and p ≤ .001), and there were still 557 (15.43%, Mean = 58.75, and SD = 8.9) students met the cutoff of 50 and were screened positive. Comparisons among sexes, grades and majors were also conducted. Significant differences were found between all males and all female (p ≤ .001), and between all students majoring arts and sciences in the anxiety sample (n = 557, p = 0.05).

Uncertain anticipation is a shared feature of situations that elicit signs and symptoms of anxiety across psychiatric disorders, species, and assays. Despite the profound significance of anxiety for human health and wellbeing, the neurobiology of uncertain-threat anticipation remains unsettled. Leveraging a paradigm adapted from animal research and optimized for fMRI signal decomposition, we examined the neural circuits engaged during the anticipation of temporally uncertain and certain threat in 99 men and women. Results revealed that the neural systems recruited by uncertain and certain threat anticipation are anatomically colocalized in frontocortical regions, extended amygdala, and periaqueductal gray. Comparison of the threat conditions demonstrated that this circuitry can be fractionated, with frontocortical regions showing relatively stronger engagement during the anticipation of uncertain threat, and the extended amygdala showing the reverse pattern. Although there is widespread agreement that the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and dorsal amygdala—the two major subdivisions of the extended amygdala—play a critical role in orchestrating adaptive responses to potential danger, their precise contributions to human anxiety have remained contentious. Follow-up analyses demonstrated that these regions show statistically indistinguishable responses to temporally uncertain and certain threat anticipation. These observations provide a framework for conceptualizing anxiety and fear, for understanding the functional neuroanatomy of threat anticipation in humans, and for accelerating the development of more effective intervention strategies for pathological anxiety. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Anxiety—an emotion prototypically associated with the anticipation of uncertain harm—has profound significance for public health, yet the underlying neurobiology remains unclear. Leveraging a novel neuroimaging paradigm in a relatively large sample, we identify a core circuit responsive to both uncertain and certain threat anticipation, and show that this circuitry can be fractionated into subdivisions with a bias for one kind of threat or the other. The extended amygdala occupies center stage in neuropsychiatric models of anxiety, but its functional architecture has remained contentious. Here we demonstrate that its major subdivisions show statistically indistinguishable responses to temporally uncertain and certain threat. Collectively, these observations indicate the need to revise how we think about the neurobiology of anxiety and fear.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 173, 'citationCount': 50, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5084151', 'name': 'Juyoen Hur'}, {'authorId': '2119124355', 'name': 'Jason F.

Student participants (N\u2009=\u2009302) completed a survey about their most demanding class of the semester and reported on how demanding the class was, how much stress they experienced related to the class, and how often student peers communicated academic support in the class. A conditional process analysis revealed that (a) academic demands were positively associated with academic stress, (b) academic support from peers buffered the negative effect of stress on academic performance (moderation), and (c) academic demands produced a negative indirect effect on academic performance through stress, but this indirect effect was buffered by student academic support (moderated mediation).

To this end, the Spanish adaptation of the CER-Q and the Spanish adaptation of the STAI were applied to a sample of 266 high school students. A multiple linear regression model was proposed, where anxiety level was the dependent variable, and the use frequencies of emotional regulation strategies were the independent variables. Gender was also considered as an independent variable since the data showed differences in anxiety level and in the use of emotional regulation strategies between male and female subjects. The model explained 46.3% of the variance, and the predictive variables were Self-blame, Positive Reinterpretation, Catastrophizing, Rumination and gender.

The study included 341 articles (19% unpublished) gathered through a search in PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, ERIC, and ProQuest, and a hand search of 11 relevant journals. Using a random effects model, the overall effect size based on k = 341 studies and N = 273,149 participants was r = .26 (95% CI [.24, .28]), with robust support for the GB model and support for the SB model among medically ill youth. Stress-buffering analyses suggest that different stressful contexts may not allow youth to fully draw on the benefits of social support, and we propose value in seeking to better understand both stress-buffering (effects of social support are enhanced) and reverse stress-buffering (effects of social support are dampened) processes.

Yet, it is unclear whether these strategies represent distinct cognitive styles associated with psychopathology, such that there are individuals who are predominantly “suppressors” or “reappraisers.” Using cluster analysis, we examined whether women with and without exposure to potentially traumatic events evidence distinct patterns of emotion regulation frequency, capacity, suppression, and cognitive reappraisal. Four patterns emerged: high regulators; high reappraisers/low suppressors; moderate reappraisers/low suppressors; and low regulators. Individuals who reported infrequently and ineffectively regulating their emotions (low regulators) also reported higher depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In contrast, individuals who reported frequently and effectively using reappraisal and low levels of suppression (high reappraisers/low suppressors) reported the lowest levels of these symptoms, suggesting that this specific combination of emotion regulation may be most adaptive.

We describe a new rating scale to assess resilience. The Connor‐Davidson Resilience scale (CD‐RISC) comprises of 25 items, each rated on a 5‐point scale (0–4), with higher scores reflecting greater resilience. The scale was administered to subjects in the following groups: community sample, primary care outpatients, general psychiatric outpatients, clinical trial of generalized anxiety disorder, and two clinical trials of PTSD. The reliability, validity, and factor analytic structure of the scale were evaluated, and reference scores for study samples were calculated. Sensitivity to treatment effects was examined in subjects from the PTSD clinical trials. The scale demonstrated good psychometric properties and factor analysis yielded five factors. A repeated measures ANOVA showed that an increase in CD‐RISC score was associated with greater improvement during treatment. Improvement in CD‐RISC score was noted in proportion to overall clinical global improvement, with greatest increase noted in subjects with the highest global improvement and deterioration in CD‐RISC score in those with minimal or no global improvement. The CD‐RISC has sound psychometric properties and distinguishes between those with greater and lesser resilience. The scale demonstrates that resilience is modifiable and can improve with treatment, with greater improvement corresponding to higher levels of global improvement.

In the increasingly specialized discipline of psychology, the field of emotion regulation cuts across traditional boundaries and provides common ground.

All these factors may have caused significant stress and led to anxiety and depression in students. The purpose of this study was to study the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 associated mental health morbidity in students in the United States (US). Methods: A online cross-sectional survey was conducted using two instruments – the Perceived Stress Scale-4 (PSS-4) and the Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety-4 (PHQ-4). The survey was administered in the months of March to June during the COVID-19 pandemic to both high school and undergraduate college students. Results: In total, 369 students agreed to participate: 51.8% were male, 44.1% were college students. An elevated perceived stress level (PSS4 > 8) and a positive mood disorder (PHQ-4 > 4) was present in 49.6% and 56.6% of respondents, respectively. The mean (SD) PSS scores in males and females were 6.7 (2.7) and 8.2 (2.9) respectively among all the respondents, while the mean (SD) PHQ scores in males and females were 3.7 (3.2) and 5.3 (3.2) respectively. Prevalence of anxiety and depression in the respondents was 35.0% and 36.3% respectively. Females students reported higher PSS and PHQ scores compared to male students. There is a significant correlation between PSS and PHQ (r=0.66) Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an extremely high level of stress and mental health morbidity in both high school and college students, and this is more pronounced in females.

24,efcd2446ea5388aa794129192aa094ff65bb9455,Social Emotional Learning in Virtual Settings: Intervention Strategies,"In mid-March of 2020, schools in the United States shut down in-person learning due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Due to this unprecedented situation, school education hassince shifted to a heavy reliance on various forms of remote learning, and teachers and students have been forced to practice completely new ways of teaching and learning.Virtual learning requires students to draw from a different skill set than what is used in face-to-face settings, such as self-regulation for navigating online learning, or balancinglearning and life at home. These new and challenging experiences coincide with limited opportunities for social engagement and an increased potential for isolation. These factors are continuing to contribute to children experiencing high levels of stress as the sense of normalcy is lost from their lives and they are bombarded with new expectations and responsibilities. Children need social and emotional support now more than ever. In this paper, we discuss how integrating Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) in daily lessons can benefit children now working in virtual settings, with sample activities organized aroundcognitive regulation, emotional regulation, and social skills. We address both explicit SEL instruction methodologies and ongoing teaching practices designed to promote SEL.",2021,31,12,{'name': 'lnternational Electronic Journal of Elementary

Classrooms with warm teacher-child relationships support deep learning and positive social and emotional development among students, writes Kimberly Schonert-Reichl. But when teachers poorly manage the social and emotional demands of teaching, students' academic achievement and behavior both suffer. If we don't accurately understand teachers' own social-emotional wellbeing and how teachers influence students' SEL, says Schonert-Reichl, we can never fully know how to promote SEL in the classroom.How can we boost teachers' social-emotional competence, and how can we help them create the kind of classroom environment that promotes students' SEL? Teachers are certainly at risk for poor social-emotional wellbeing. Research shows that teaching is one of the most stressful occupations; moreover, stress in the classroom is contagious—simply put, stressed-out teachers tend to have stressed-out students. In the past few years, several interventions have specifically sought to improve teachers' social-emotional competence and stress management in school, and Schonert-Reichly reviews the results, many of which are promising.She also shows how teachers' beliefs—about their own teaching efficacy, or about whether they receive adequate support, for example—influence the fidelity with which they implement SEL programs in the classroom. When fidelity is low, SEL programs are less successful. Finally, she examines the extent to which US teacher education programs prepare teacher candidates to promote their own and their students' social-emotional competence, and she argues that we can and should do much more."", 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 59, 'citationCount': 252, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1402084899', 'name': 'K.

Research increasingly suggests that social and emotional learning (SEL) matters a great deal for important life outcomes like success in school, college entry and completion, and later earnings. This research also tells us that SEL can be taught and nurtured in schools so that students increase their ability to integrate thinking, emotions, and behavior in ways that lead to positive school and life outcomes. Although the term social and emotional learning has been around for 20 years, we’ve recently seen a rapid surge in interest in SEL among parents, educators, and policymakers. For example, the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) is supporting 10 large school districts and 45 smaller ones through its Collaborating Districts Initiative as they begin to incorporate a variety of SEL programs and practices into their schools. CASEL also recently launched a Collaborating States Initiative to support states as they develop policies, standards, and guidelines for SEL in schools. All 50 states have SEL standards in place at the preschool level, and four (Illinois, Kansas, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania) have SEL standards for kindergarten through 12th grade. And the Aspen Institute recently launched a National Commission on Social, Emotional, and Academic Development to explore how schools can fully integrate SEL into policies and instruction that have traditionally emphasized academics. We also know that teachers believe SEL skills can be taught, although they may not always know the best way to do so in their classrooms.1', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 12, 'citationCount': 111, 'authors': [{'authorId': '40521071', 'name': 'Stephanie M.

The present observational study used hierarchical linear modeling to examine predictors of children's social and self-regulatory outcomes in first-grade classrooms.

Participants were 178 students and 36 teachers in seven rural schools. Results indicated higher teacher emotional support related to lower child aggression and higher behavioral self-control.

Results support an association between exposure to Hurricane Katrina and reactive aggression via posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and poorly regulated emotion.

These findings have implications for postdisaster mental health services.

25,e480605d240f4c193f78442c8c83a8efc96219b9,Telepathic Virtual Assistant,The purpose of our paper is to make the virtual assistant respond to the requests of the user which are by means of thoughts. The user thinks of the task and the personal assistant gets to process the request without any text or audio based inputs from the user. The thoughts of the user is fed to the virtual assistant by means of brain computer interface(BCI) with the help of devices like Electroencephalogram. This device helps in converting the thoughts of the user to signal which are then converted into text. The emotional classifierused in the system helps to understand the state of the user and help the virtual assistant to respond accordingly. The response of the virtual assistant is processed to the user in a much technological way via the Bone conduction technology which helps in perceiving for the people with auditory problems.,2019,5,1,"{'name': '2019 3rd International Conference on Computing and Communications Technologies (ICCCT)', 'pages': '321-325'}",,"[{'authorId': '9120477', 'name': 'V.

More specifically, motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG), which reflects a subject's active intent, is attracting increasing attention for a variety of BCI applications. Accurate classification of MI-EEG signals while essential for effective operation of BCI systems is challenging due to the significant noise inherent in the signals and the lack of informative correlation between the signals and brain activities. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network based learning framework that affords perceptive insights into the relationship between the MI-EEG data and brain activities. We design a joint convolutional recurrent neural network that simultaneously learns robust high-level feature presentations through low-dimensional dense embeddings from raw MI-EEG signals. We also employ an Autoencoder layer to eliminate various artifacts such as background activities. The proposed approach has been evaluated extensively on a large-scale public MI-EEG dataset and a limited but easy-to-deploy dataset collected in our lab. The results show that our approach outperforms a series of baselines and the competitive state-of-the-art methods, yielding a classification accuracy of 95.53%. The applicability of our proposed approach is further demonstrated with a practical BCI system for typing."", 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 40, 'citationCount': 77, 'authors': [{'authorId': '100620761', 'name': 'Xiang Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2082966', 'name': 'Lina Yao'}, {'authorId': '1713128', 'name': 'Quan Z.

It provides people suffering from severe neuromuscular disorders with a way to interact with the external environment. It also enables a more personalized user experience in gaming and entertainment. These BCI applications are, however, not without risk. Established engineering practices set guarantees on performance, reliability and physical safety of BCIs. But no guarantees or standards are currently in place regarding user privacy and security. In this paper, we identify privacy and security issues arising from possible misuse or inappropriate use of BCIs. In particular, we explore how current and emerging non-invasive BCI platforms can be used to extract private information, and we suggest an interdisciplinary approach to mitigating this problem. We then propose a tool to prevent this side-channel extraction of users' private information.

The aim of this study was to improve the frontal alpha asymmetry for reducing depression and rumination levels and executive functions of people with reactive depression from love trauma syndrome through the neurofeedback interventional method and compare its efficacy with the sham group. In addition, in this study, was considered the neurological characteristics of the emotionally traumatic experience, through the Clinical Q as the evaluation method. This study's participants include 32 students who was experienced love trauma in the recent 6 months and subsequently, they exposed depression and rumination symptoms and reduction of executive functions. After the primary interview we performed pre-test phase. The participants were placed in the trial group (age: M=24.73, SD=3.71) and sham group (age: M=23.46, SD=2.87), randomly.

A total of 702 college students (463 females and 239 males) was administered a questionnaire assessing their orientation toward learning and performance goals, and reported their self-regulatory strategies for studying. Results showed that both for males and females there exist systematic relations between learning goal and self-regulation and academic achievement. Relations were also found for performance goal, but for boys only. Results also showed that, among the four profiles of goal orientation, more self-regulatory strategies were reported and higher academic performance was achieved by students having high concern with both learning and performance goals than by the others. More girls were classified in this profile, but in each profile girls were found to report more self-regulatory strategies and to achieve higher academic performance than did boys. Overall, these findings are consistent with those of previous studies conducted with younger students. Although adhesion to learning goal has a positive impact on self-regulation both for girls and boys, for the latter adhesion to performance goal can also be helpful.

In this article, we have reviewed 17 articles to look for the beneficial effects of such therapy in adults. Overall, we found that there is a clear beneficial effect of such therapies, especially when used in adjunct with stimulant medication and may increase overall compliance.

Mindfulness, if taught in a developmentally appropriate way, has the potential to be an asset in adolescents' lives. Developmentally appropriate approaches of mindfulness intervention during adolescence need to consider adolescents' social contexts (for example, school setting, peer group, family), their cognitive and emotional stages in development, and age-specific strength and vulnerabilities. This chapter puts mindfulness education into a developmental perspective, and presents the Learning to BREATHE program as a school-based universal intervention for adolescents.

There is evidence for a maturational delay in brain structure development which likely extends to brain function and structural and functional connectivity, but this needs corroboration by longitudinal imaging studies. Dysfunction of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex seems to be more pronounced relative to other pediatric disorders and is also the most consistent target of acute psychostimulant medication. Future studies are likely to focus on using neuroimaging for clinical translation such as for individual diagnostic and prognostic classification and as a neurotherapy to reverse brain function abnormalities.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 169, 'citationCount': 105, 'authors': [{'authorId': '9037188', 'name': 'K.

Recent research, particularly involving the Planning, Attention, Simultaneous, Successive (PASS) theory offers an understanding of the intellectual and neuropsychological processes implicated in ADHD. We provide an overview of ADHD as a neuropsychological condition; reviews of research on the PASS theory, which provide a process-based understanding of ADHD; and recommendations for assessment and intervention. The research base summarized here provides support that ADHD have a distinctive profile of PASS processes that is consistent with the cognitive nature of their disorder and that researchers have shown increased academic performance when children are taught to better use planning processes when completing academic tasks. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 48, 'citationCount': 58, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1399508014', 'name': 'S.

The ADHD groups showed larger errors in time reproduction but not in time estimation than the control group, and the groups did not differ from each other on their performance on this task. Individual differences could not be accounted for by oppositional-defiance ratings and low math or reading scores. Although various measures of executive functioning did not make significant unique contributions to time estimation performance, those of interference control and nonverbal working memory did so to the time-reproduction task. Findings suggest that ADHD is associated with a specific impairment in the capacity to reproduce rather than estimate time durations and that this may be related to the children's deficits in inhibition and working memory."", 'year': 2005, 'referenceCount': 57, 'citationCount': 84, 'authors': [{'authorId': '39674041', 'name': 'José J.

28,ff09ba415cac9df5ba48e620763b726fabd95189,What Do You Mean I'm Funny? Personalizing the Joke Skill of a Voice-Controlled Virtual Assistant,"A considerable part of the success experienced by Voice-controlled virtual assistants (VVA) is due to the emotional and personalized experience they deliver, with humor being a key component in providing an engaging interaction. In this paper we describe methods used to improve the joke skill of a VVA through personalization. The first method, based on traditional NLP techniques, is robust and scalable. The others combine self-attentional network and multi-task learning to obtain better results, at the cost of added complexity. A significant challenge facing these systems is the lack of explicit user feedback needed to provide labels for the models. Instead, we explore the use of two implicit feedback-based labelling strategies. All models were evaluated on real production data. Online results show that models trained on any of the considered labels outperform a heuristic method, presenting a positive real-world impact on user satisfaction. Offline results suggest that the deep-learning approaches can improve the joke experience with respect to the other considered methods.",2019,21,1,"{'name': 'ArXiv', 'volume':

However, this theoretical argument has not been tested empirically, nor have alternative explanations for their strong performance been explored in-depth. We hypothesize that the strong performance of CNNs and self-attentional networks could also be due to their ability to extract semantic features from the source text, and we evaluate RNNs, CNNs and self-attention networks on two tasks: subject-verb agreement (where capturing long-range dependencies is required) and word sense disambiguation (where semantic feature extraction is required).

In this work, the main goal is to analyze if portable EEG systems are adequate to monitor brain activity changes caused by the emotional regulation strategies applied by the participants. The EEG signals captured from subjects that navigate through a virtual environment designed to induce a negative mood will be compared between three experimental groups that will receive different instructions about the emotional regulation strategies to apply. The study will allow us to validate the possibilities of portable EEG devices to monitor emotional regulation strategies during VR exposure.",2012,13,7,"{'name': 'Studies in health technology and informatics', 'pages': '\n          223-7\n        ', 'volume': '181'}",,"[{'authorId': '144255441', 'name': 'B.

Investigating the neural underpinnings of adaptive emotion regulation and the extent to which such processes are compromised in MDD may be helpful in understanding the pathophysiology of depression. We report results from a functional magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrating left-lateralized activation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) when downregulating negative affect in nondepressed individuals, whereas depressed individuals showed bilateral PFC activation. Furthermore, during an effortful affective reappraisal task, nondepressed individuals showed an inverse relationship between activation in left ventrolateral PFC and the amygdala that is mediated by the ventromedial PFC (VMPFC). No such relationship was found for depressed individuals, who instead show a positive association between VMPFC and amygdala. Pupil dilation data suggest that those depressed patients who expend more effort to reappraise negative stimuli are characterized by accentuated activation in the amygdala, insula, and thalamus, whereas nondepressed individuals exhibit the opposite pattern. These findings indicate that a key feature underlying the pathophysiology of major depression is the counterproductive engagement of right prefrontal cortex and the lack of engagement of left lateral-ventromedial prefrontal circuitry important for the downregulation of amygdala responses to negative stimuli.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 53, 'citationCount': 944, 'authors': [{'authorId': '30361732', 'name': 'T.

They are mainly caused by the failures of the drivers to perceive the changes of the traffic lights or the unexpected conditions happening accidentally on the roads. In this paper, we devised a quantitative analysis for assessing driver's cognitive responses by investigating the neurobiological information underlying electroencephalographic (EEG) brain dynamics in traffic-light experiments in a virtual-reality (VR) dynamic driving environment. The VR technique allows subjects to interact directly with the moving virtual environment instead of monotonic auditory and visual stimuli, thereby provides interactive and realistic tasks without the risk of operating on an actual machine. Independent component analysis (ICA) is used to separate and extract noise-free ERP signals from the multi-channel EEG signals. A temporal filter is used to solve the time-alignment problem of ERP features and principle component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce feature dimensions. The dimension-reduced features are then input to a self-constructing neural fuzzy inference network (SONFIN) to recognize different brain potentials stimulated by red/green/yellow traffic events, the accuracy can be reached 87% in average eight subjects in this visual-stimuli ERP experiment.

The present study examined this hypothesis by testing whether frontal EEG activity during mood inductions versus a resting baseline predicted emotion regulation. EEG was recorded while participants (N = 66, 40 females) received a fearful, sad, or neutral mood induction. Emotion regulation was measured following the mood inductions as self-reported change in negative mood and as attention interference in a task with mood-congruent emotional distracters. Greater frontal EEG activity during the mood inductions versus baseline was associated with more effective emotion regulation: less post-induction sadness and anxiety and reduced mood-congruent attention interference effects. Effects did not differ between the left and right hemispheres. Results support the hypothesis that frontal EEG activity reflects both emotional context and emotion-regulatory capabilities."", 'year': None, 'referenceCount': 61, 'citationCount': 71, 'authors': [{'authorId': '37203914', 'name': 'Tracy A.

Currently several banks in Indonesia have adopted Chat technology in Customer Service. The application of Artificial Intelligence in Customer Service aims to prepare banks for the challenges of Industry Banking 4.0. In addition, it is also to solve problems currently faced by Customer Service. Implementing the Chatbot Platform in banking in Indonesia is not just plug and play, although there are quite a lot of chatbot platforms available, including the Rasa Platform, the Botika Platform, and the Kata.ai Platform. However, this study only evaluates two chatbot platforms, namely the Rasa Platform and the Botika Platform. Where the two platforms are considered not yet able to be immediately adopted by banks. This is because the application of banking technology in Indonesia must refer to regulatory regulations, including those related to environmental needs, language, speed, and accuracy to understand the intent of users. For this reason, research is needed to decide which chatbot platform can be implemented in the banking industry without violating regulatory regulations. From the results of evaluations conducted using the Usability and HMSAM methods, it is found that users prefer the Botika Platform to be implemented in the banking industry.",2021,0,4,"{'name': 'IAES

31,632afe17608c32e8318ba8c1a2e42b617671012d,Investigating the Feasibility of Virtual Reality for Emotion Regulation with Youth,"Investigating the Feasibility of Virtual Reality for Emotion Regulation with Youth Background: In the last ten years, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has seen a rise in research on how features of interactive technologies can be designed to enhance emotion regulation training [1]–a response in part due to the increase of mental health issues. Youth are a vulnerable population at risk for mental health issues with long wait times to get help [2]. Emotion regulation, the ability to modulate the intensity and duration of emotional states, has been explored as a trans-diagnostic intervention to improve mental health [3]. Youth aged 12-15 use less adaptive or maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (e.g., suppression) that can contribute to depression or anxiety disorders. Thus, training adaptive emotion regulation skills is crucial for this age group [4]. One of the most effective emotion regulation strategies for youth is cognitive reappraisal–changing how we think about a situation in order to decrease its emotional impact [5]. However, learning is difficult because it requires: (1) generation of meaningful emotionally laden social situations; (2) real-time feedback of internal psychological and physiological states; and (3) practice modifying the interpretation of multiple situations [6]. Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated 3D environment that allows the user to experience a simulated world through stereoscopic 360 visuals, stereo audio, and 3D interaction with tracking sensors. The affordances of VR have been shown to strongly affect human emotional responses and interpretations of social situations when used in other intervention contexts [7]. As such, VR may provide unique opportunities for cognitive reappraisal skills development through three mechanisms: Mechanism #1: virtual environment–a simulated world that evokes the visceral experience of a realistic emotional response; Mechanism #2: interaction & feedback–possibilities to control and modify emotionally evocative aspects of the virtual environment; Mechanism #3: taking multiple perspectives–the ability to put the user in another’s shoes. As an example, you put on a VR headset and find yourself walking down the halls on the first day of high school; there are lots of new faces and you hope to make a good first impression (Mech #1). You hear the sound of your heart beating and your breathing getting heavier and uneven, and other kids laughing–are they laughing at you (Mech #2)? Luckily, you have a super power that allows you to embody other peoples’ perspectives (Mech #3). You take the VR controller, point it at the older kid who was laughing, and teleport into their virtual body (Mech #2). Suddenly, you can see yourself from their perspective and hear their thoughts–“look at all these new kids. I remember my first day I tripped down the stairs and broke a tooth. So embarrassing!” (Mech #3). You teleport back to your body and hear your heart rate drop to indicate that you have regulated the anxiety response (Mech #2). They weren’t laughing at you, but empathizing with your experience. Seeing and understanding this new perspective is cognitively reappraising the event. In this scenario, VR offers youth a way to practice cognitive reappraisal in a safe, meaningful, and emotionally laden environment with real-time feedback; thus meeting the reappraisal requirements (1-3) listed above, which are normally difficult to meet. Objectives & Research Questions: There is a rise in VR’s accessibility and popularity among youth (e.g., Oculus Quest 2 VR headset does not require a computer, costs $400 CAD, and has sold over 5 million units). My expertise in technology development of VR systems and content, design for mental health, and field evaluation skills make me well positioned to take this unique opportunity to investigate the overarching research question: can the above three VR mechanisms (Mechanisms #1-3) address the three learning requirements of cognitive reappraisal skill development in youth aged 12-15? Methodology: I will conduct research that investigates the following research questions that derive from my objectives above: (1) Requirements: What are the minimum technical and design requirements for a VR platform to help youth learn and practice emotion regulation? (2) Usability: What are the system and interface usability factors that youth suggest for the VR prototypes? (3) Feasibility: What is the feasibility of using VR’s three mechanisms to address the three learning requirements of cognitive reappraisal skill development during a six-week deployment with youth in their homes? (4) Efficacy: What are the subjective indicators of effects on cognitive reappraisal skills development (whether positive or negative) reported by youth? I will answer these research questions in three phases.",2022,9,0,"{'name': 'ArXiv', 'volume': 'abs/2212.00002'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-3.2298178672790527, -2.657244920730591,

32,ea8467e1d26f472a5fc8579d0fc8372149283acc,Socially Supported by an Embodied Agent: The Development of a Virtual-Reality Paradigm to Study Social Emotion Regulation,"Social emotion regulation, which can be understood as the intentional efforts by one person to regulate emotions of another person, is something we encounter and benefit from every day, and becomes especially important when a person is unable to handle an emotion or an emotional event by themselves. A paradigm that examines whether someone can perceive and benefit from regulatory efforts by another person, represented here by a virtual agent, would be highly relevant for experimental studies investigating social emotion regulation, as well as for interventions in the clinical and sub-clinical context. Virtual reality (VR) provides perhaps the ideal opportunity to test social interactions and difficulties with them, as it counters typical methodological problems of behavioral experiments, such as the trade-off between ecological validity and experimental control, as well as the difficulty of replicating social situations. The goal of the present methods paper is twofold: to provide a detailed description of the development of a novel paradigm consisting of two scenarios in VR designed to test the efficacy of social emotion regulation, and to present the anticipated results for the target populations of typically developing and autistic youth. Participants are presented with a virtual school environment and take part in two activities with a class of students and a teacher, all of whom are virtual agents. In both scenarios, participants experience a potentially stressful situation and are subsequently offered emotional support by a friendly student. Throughout the experiment, self-reports in the form of virtual smiley scales and psychophysiological measurements are collected as markers of the participants’ emotional states. Pilot results will be discussed in line with anticipated outcomes, to indicate that the experiment will be able to show the efficacy of social support by a virtual agent and provide insight into social emotion regulation for different populations. The school environment and the character of the friendly student also have the potential to be adapted for follow-up experiments on additional aspects of social emotion regulation for a variety of contexts.",2022,53,0,{'volume': '3'},"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-3.313366174697876, -2.7898108959198, -1.46319580078125, 3.06809663772583, 0.12631890177726746, 2.1955008506774902,

It has been used for assessments and training in social cognition with the use of virtual agents instead of face-to-face interactions – but its potential for the study of social emotion regulation has, perhaps surprisingly, largely remained untapped. The present study evaluates a novel immersive VR scenario designed to study the efficacy of social support by a virtual agent using a modified version of Cyberball, an established paradigm to induce the feeling of ostracism. Participants embodied a new pupil in a virtual school environment and played Cyberball, after which they either did or did not receive emotional support. Self-reports and psychophysiological markers demonstrated that the negative impact of social exclusion in Cyberball was successfully replicated, while participants also reported a significant improvement in emotional state after being supported by the virtual agent. These results indicate the potential of the developed scenario for research on social emotion regulation in immersive VR. Future studies could aim to test the efficacy of social support for people with difficulties in self-regulation, for example individuals with high social anxiety, with a view to developing training programs in VR.', 'year': 2023, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 1, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2124332447', 'name': 'Lina Stallmann'}, {'authorId': '2054039824', 'name': 'Michel Tran'}, {'authorId': '3090887', 'name': 'D.

Animal and human studies on neural pathways underlying social buffering typically examined physiological reactions or regional brain activations. However, direct links between emotional and social stimuli, distinct neural processes and behavioural outcomes are still missing. Using data of 27 female participants, the current study delineated a large-scale process model of social buffering’s neural underpinnings, connecting changes in neural activity to emotional behaviour by means of voxel-wise multilevel mediation analysis. Our results confirmed that three processes underlie human social buffering: (i) social support-related reduction of activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, anterior and mid-cingulate; (ii) downregulation of aversive emotion-induced brain activity in the superficial cortex-like amygdala and mediodorsal thalamus; and (iii) downregulation of reported aversive feelings. Results of the current study provide evidence for a distinct neural process model of aversive emotion regulation in humans by social buffering.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 57, 'citationCount': 7, 'authors': [{'authorId': '7775987', 'name': 'Satja Mulej Bratec'}, {'authorId': '2067212278', 'name': 'Teresa Bertram'}, {'authorId': '1751526633', 'name': 'G.

Specifically, the reviewed research includes studies examining parent-child relationships, sibling relationships, friendships, and romantic relationships in relation to emotion regulation. The review highlights evidence concerning how relationship processes influence emotion regulation. Based on the current state of the literature, future directions for research in this area are recommended. This review seeks to advance a more nuanced approach to the study of the social processes associated with emotion regulation.

But what do empathizers want others to feel? Though psychologists have studied empathy and prosociality for decades, this question has yet to be clearly addressed. This is because virtually all existing research focuses on a model under which improving others' well-being also comprises heightening their positive affect or decreasing their negative affect and helping them reach their own emotional goals. In this review, I argue that real-life empathic goals encompass a broader range-including sometimes worsening targets' affect or contravening their wishes in order to improve their well-being-that can be productively integrated into the framework of interpersonal emotion regulation (IER). I review the empathic IER spectrum in a number of contexts, including close relationships, professional caregiving, and group-based emotions. Integrating empathy and IER provides a synthetic and generative way to ask new questions about how social emotions produce prosocial actions.

An emerging literature highlights the importance of interpersonal ER, which utilizes social cues to facilitate the regulation of emotional states. In cultures that place high value on social interconnectedness as integral to their collectivistic self-construal, including East Asian cultures, interpersonal ER strategies may be particularly effective in reducing negative affect but this has not been previously tested. In this study, two groups comprising East Asian (n = 48) and Western European (n = 38) participants were randomly assigned to receive a priming narration depicting the use of either interpersonal (e.g., social modeling, perspective taking) or intrapersonal (e.g., cognitive reappraisal) ER strategies during a stressful experience. They were then instructed to utilize similar ER strategies in an emotion reactivity task during which they viewed high arousing negative pictorial stimuli while their heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (high frequency power – HF-HRV) and subjective affective states were measured. First we found that the East Asian group reported higher use of interpersonal ER strategies of social modeling and perspective taking in daily life. During the experimental interpersonal prime exposure, the East Asian group showed elevated HF-HRV (relative to baseline) compared to the Western European group, indicating more adaptive ER, but this pattern was not sustained during the reactivity or recovery phases. Instead, the East Asian group demonstrated increased HF-HRV and decreased HR across both prime conditions. The East Asian group also showed greater decreases in positive affect across the course of the experiment. Furthermore, individual differences in social modeling and individualistic self-construal moderated the effect of the ER prime in the East Asian group at trend levels, and main effects for perspective taking and reappraisal were observed in the Western European group. The findings support the notion that engaging in interpersonal ER strategies may be more beneficial for East Asian groups when immediately exposed to a stressful situation, as these strategies are congruent with cultural context and preferences, but our priming methodology may have limited the longer-term benefits.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 76, 'citationCount': 22, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2742204', 'name': 'B.

In total, 56 individuals with ASD aged 14–24\u2009years (Mage\u2009=\u200918.15; SDage\u2009=\u20092.30) completed Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 Generalized Anxiety Disorder Dimensional Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale and Autism-Spectrum Quotient – Short. Individuals were grouped into four clusters based on their Emotion Regulation Questionnaire subscale scores. Individuals in the high suppression and low reappraisal group expressed higher depressive symptoms and lower positive well-being when compared with the low suppression and high reappraisal group. Interestingly, individuals who self-reported using both high suppression and reappraisal expressed relatively high positive well-being and low depression symptoms.

Parents of individuals with ASD and TD individuals were interviewed about their child's emotional experience and the use and efficacy of 10 ER strategies. In addition, participants filled out daily diaries on experience and regulation in the same emotional domains.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared to TD individuals, parents reported that individuals with ASD experienced more anger and anxiety and less amusement, made less frequent use of a variety of adaptive ER strategies (e.g. problem solving, cognitive reappraisal), and made more frequent use of maladaptive strategies (e.g. repetitive behavior). Moreover, individuals with ASD were less effective at utilizing adaptive ER strategies. Self-reports showed differences in experience of amusement and in ER strategies for anger and anxiety, but not in experience of anger and anxiety.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study provides evidence that individuals with ASD less frequently use adaptive - but more frequently use maladaptive - ER strategies.

Researchers studying individual differences in social interactions are typically interested in keeping the behavior and the appearance of the interaction partner constant across participants. With IVET researchers have full control over the interaction partners, can standardize them while still keeping the simulation realistic. Virtual simulations are valid: growing evidence shows that indeed studies conducted with IVET can replicate some well-known findings of social psychology. Moreover, IVET allows researchers to subtly manipulate characteristics of the environment (e.g., visual cues to prime participants) or of the social partner (e.g., his/her race) to investigate their influences on participants’ behavior and cognition. Furthermore, manipulations that would be difficult or impossible in real life (e.g., changing participants’ height) can be easily obtained with IVET. Beside the advantages for theoretical research, we explore the most recent training and clinical applications of IVET, its integration with other technologies (e.g., social sensing) and future challenges for researchers (e.g., making the communication between virtual humans and participants smoother).', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 83, 'citationCount': 102, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5983047', 'name': 'Dario Bombari'}, {'authorId': '2284257', 'name': 'M.

However, parents and clinicians have long noted the importance of emotional problems in individuals with ASD (e.g. tantrums and “meltdowns”). In this study, 21 high‐functioning children and adolescents with ASD and 22 age and gender group‐matched typically developing (TD) controls completed a Reactivity and Regulation Situation Task. This task assesses emotional reactivity and spontaneous use of emotion regulation strategies (problem solving, cognitive reappraisal, avoidance, distraction, venting, suppression, and relaxation) in the context of age‐appropriate ambiguous and potentially threatening negative scenarios. After the concept of cognitive reappraisal was explained, the scenarios were presented again to participants, and they were prompted to use this strategy. Results indicated that individuals with ASD exhibited the same level of reactivity to negative stimuli as TD participants. Furthermore, youth with ASD had a different emotion regulation profile than TD individuals, characterized by a less frequent use of cognitive reappraisal and more frequent use of suppression. When prompted to use cognitive reappraisal, participants with ASD were less able to implement reappraisal, but benefitted from this strategy when they were able to generate a reappraisal. Findings from this study suggest that cognitive reappraisal strategies may be useful to children and adolescents with ASD. Therefore, the development of treatment programs that focus on enhancing the use of adaptive forms of emotion regulation might decrease emotional problems and optimize long‐term outcomes in youth with ASD.

Therefore, the present study aimed to examine and specify physiological effects of social rejection. Methods: Participants (n = 50) were assigned to either a social exclusion or inclusion condition of a virtual ball-tossing game (Cyberball). Immediate and delayed physiological [skin conductance level (SCL) and heart rate] reactions were recorded. In addition, subjects reported levels of affect, emotional states, and fundamental needs. Results: Subjects who were socially rejected showed increased heart rates. However, social rejection had no effect on subjects' SCLs. Both conditions showed heightened arousal on this measurement. Furthermore, psychological consequences of social rejection indicated the validity of the paradigm. Conclusions: Our results reveal that social rejection evokes an immediate physiological reaction. Accelerated heart rates indicate that behavior activation rather than inhibition is associated with socially threatening events.

Here we propose such a framework. We first map a ""space"" differentiating classes of interpersonal regulation according to whether an individual uses an interpersonal regulatory episode to alter their own or another person\'s emotion. We then identify 2 types of processes--response-dependent and response-independent--that could support interpersonal regulation.

This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory.

Social stress was elicited in 66 adolescent girls (Mage = 15 years) using a spontaneous public-speaking task. Mother-daughter dyads reported their relationship quality, and physical closeness was manipulated by having mothers either touch or not touch their daughter's hand during the performance. We found evidence of load sharing among dyads who held hands, independent of relationship quality. However, without physical contact, load sharing was only evident among dyads with higher relationship quality. Thus, high relationship quality buffers against threat in a similar way to the physical comfort of a loved one."", 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 52, 'citationCount': 34, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3714961', 'name': 'Jessica P.

33,c66d8eb094fa5b808d267a62cd4fa9669b078d95,Emotional Competencies as Part of the Parameter Structure of Psychological Health in High School Students with Different Virtual Communication Engagement Rates,"The research featured inter- and intrapersonal emotional competencies as parameters of the psychological health in high school students with different virtual communication engagement rates. The psychological health parameters included neuropsychiatric stability, self-adjustment parameters, volitional qualities, self-attitude, self-perception, moral self-esteem, life-purpose orientations, and positive social adaptation. The authors studied the intrasystem interactions between these parameters and the inter- and intrapersonal emotional competencies. The high level of cybercommunicative addiction appeared to be connected with poor volitional qualities, self-regulation, and life-sense orientations. Immature inter- and intrapersonal emotional competencies, e.g. empathy, expression control, etc., indicated cybercommunicative addiction in high school students. Therefore, inter- and intrapersonal emotional competencies cam be reliable diagnostic tools in this sphere.",2021,10,0,"{'name': '', 'pages': '133-142', 'volume': '23'}","{'model': 'specter_v1',

Bec use of the dynamics in alization, we tend to have different personalities although we are living in the same society. For example, the Yanomamo Indians living on the border area between Brazil and Venezuela tend to train the younger generation of boys to become aggressive and strong. On the other hand, the Semai tribe living on the central Malay Peninsula in Malaysia does not like violence and hostility. This is why the younger generation of boys is trained to become gentle and peace-loving.

Furthermore, the iterative, pixel-wise, and sequential operations of BP make it difficult to parallelize the computation. In this paper, we propose two techniques to address these issues. The first technique is a new message passing scheme named tile-based BP that reduces the memory and bandwidth to a fraction of the ordinary BP algorithms without performance degradation by splitting the MRF into many tiles and only storing the messages across the neighboring tiles. The tile-wise processing also enables data reuse and pipeline, resulting in efficient hardware implementation. The second technique is an O(L) fast message construction algorithm that exploits the properties of robust functions for parallelization. We apply these two techniques to a very large-scale integration circuit for stereo matching that generates high-resolution disparity maps in near real-time. We also implement the proposed schemes on graphics processing unit (GPU) which is four-time faster than standard BP on GPU.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 42, 'citationCount': 98, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1753650', 'name': 'Chia-Kai Liang'}, {'authorId': '2075338', 'name': 'Chao-Chung Cheng'}, {'authorId': '2276454', 'name': 'Yen-Chieh Lai'}, {'authorId': '1714180', 'name': 'Liang-Gee Chen'}, {'authorId': '144734955', 'name': 'Homer H.

These inputs are further processed by the system and diagnosis is done accordingly. The problem we have is to convert a virtual agent i.e. a chat bot into an emotional conversational agent capable of generating a believable and dynamic dialogue in natural language. For this to happen, the dialogues convey traits of personality, emotions and its intensity. The paper proposes to make a system with whose extension the system can predict the current emotional, psychological state of an individual and respond according to the predicted result. This will create a more realistic scenario for the agent to diagnose the condition simulated by the conversational agent.",2019,21,0,{'name': 'International Journal for Research in Applied Science and

Recently it has been addressed using neural networks, in particular by Neural Turing Machines (NTMs). These are fully differentiable computers that use backpropagation to learn their own programming. Despite their appeal NTMs have a weakness that is caused by their sequential nature: they are not parallel and are are hard to train due to their large depth when unfolded. \nWe present a neural network architecture to address this problem: the Neural GPU. It is based on a type of convolutional gated recurrent unit and, like the NTM, is computationally universal. Unlike the NTM, the Neural GPU is highly parallel which makes it easier to train and efficient to run. \nAn essential property of algorithms is their ability to handle inputs of arbitrary size. We show that the Neural GPU can be trained on short instances of an algorithmic task and successfully generalize to long instances. We verified it on a number of tasks including long addition and long multiplication of numbers represented in binary. We train the Neural GPU on numbers with upto 20 bits and observe no errors whatsoever while testing it, even on much longer numbers. \nTo achieve these results we introduce a technique for training deep recurrent networks: parameter sharing relaxation.

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework.

Methods: Sixteen patients who were terminally ill and were receiving anticancer treatments participated in life review therapy. Patients reviewed there lives according to their developmental stage, and they mainly reviewed impressive achievements. A clinical psychologist interviewed each patient four times and the total number of sessions was 64. The contents of each life review were transcribed, and a correspondence analysis and a significance test were conducted on these data to choose characteristic words or phrases. Results: The main concern of 40-year-olds was “about children.” For 50-year-olds, it was “how to confront death” and for 60-year-olds, “death-related anxiety” and “new discoveries”. For 70-year-olds, “resignation about death” and “evaluative reminiscence of their lives” were most important, and for 80-year-olds the main concern was “relationships with others.” When analyzing the data according to disease stage and gender, “transcendence to children”, “reflection on their past behavior”, and “gratitude for my family” were characteristic words for males receiving treatment, “work,” “worries about children,” “side effects,” “homecare,” and “reflection on their past behavior” were characteristic words for females receiving treatment. “Physical condition”, “desire for death” and “how to confront death” were common phrase for males in the terminal stages of the disease process, while “resignation to life” was characteristic reaction for females.

Some hypothesize a causal role for FDTM in developing and/or maintaining PTSD symptoms. Operationally defining FDTM is difficult, but a recent study used Flesch reading formulas to gauge narrative complexity and articulation in FDTM. We evaluated the validity of this method by comparing written trauma narratives of 58 undergraduates with and without PTSD on word counts and articulation complexity. Additional narratives on unpleasant and pleasant experiences tested the specificity of group differences. Large initial effect sizes disappeared when writing skill and cognitive ability were controlled suggesting Flesch analyses may not be useful. Furthermore, trauma narrative lengths exceeded those of other memories for both groups, which is inconsistent with FDTM predictions. Most studies supporting FDTM have used oral accounts which we hypothesize may provoke more anxiety than written accounts and thereby produce more fragmented and disorganized narratives.

The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large datasets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of datasets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the datasets.', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 40, 'citationCount': 31435, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1803520', 'name': 'L.

35,b9516fea27c0c4afb7bc4d9777d4da8ff5b7bbf5,Virtual Representations of the Self: Engaging Teenagers in Emotional Regulation Strategies Learning,"The aim of this paper is to present digital representations of humans (i.e., avatars) that look like the self, applied to the Mental Health (MH) field. Virtual Representations of the Self (VRS) are in our opinion a tool with a great potential for engaging teenagers in emotional regulation strategies learning and an excellent example of new technology application to the basic concept in psychology field such as Bandura's modeling [1]. VRSs have already demonstrated their potential on human behavior modification (e.g. modification of physical activity; eating habits) in general population [2]. Thus, the same technology can bring in our opinion a lot to the Mental Health field, especially in emotional regulation learning. This paper presents a theoretical background and describes the methodology that we plan to apply in order to validate the efficacy of VRSs in clinical settings. Also, the implications of such technology and future research lines are discussed.",2012,0,2,"{'name': 'Studies in health technology and informatics', 'pages': '\n          248-52\n        ', 'volume': '181'}",,"[{'authorId': '1807427', 'name': 'Maja Wrzesien'}, {'authorId': '144255441', 'name': 'B.

A potentially important under-investigated factor is the form of bullying. Four common forms of bullying behaviours are name-calling, physical threats or harm, rumour spreading and social exclusion. To more comprehensively understand bullying victimisation in adolescence, we examined the association of all three factors (frequency, emotional response, form) to psychological distress and emotional wellbeing. Method: A stratified, random sample of adolescents (n\u2009=\u200910, 273; mean age\u2009=\u200914.33\u2009years, standard deviation\u2009=\u20091.68\u2009years) completed validated measures of bullying victimisation (Gatehouse Bullying Questionnaire), psychological distress (K10) and emotional wellbeing (Mental Health Inventory) in classroom time. Associations between the form of bullying victimisation and mental health outcomes were examined. Results: Adolescents reported a high prevalence of all four forms of bullying: teased or called names (30.6%), rumour spreading (17.9%), social exclusion (14.3%) and physical threats or harm (10.7%). Victimisation was independently associated with significantly higher levels of psychological distress and reduced levels of emotional wellbeing for all forms of bullying.

Alexithymia is associated with heightened physiological arousal, the tendency to notice and report physical symptoms, and unhealthy compulsive behaviors. Alexithymic patients may respond poorly to psychological treatments, although perhaps not to cognitive-behavioral techniques, and it is unclear whether alexithymia can be improved through treatment.

Given that aversive conditioning experiences, such as severe teasing, have been proposed to play a role in the development of social phobia and that the core feature of social phobia is a fear of social situations in which a person may be embarrassed or humiliated, we hypothesized that the social phobia group would have a higher rate of self-reported teasing history than would the obsessive compulsive disorder or panic disorder groups. Consistent with this hypothesis, a relationship between reported history of teasing and diagnosis was found. A significantly greater percentage of participants in the social phobia group (92%) reported a history of severe teasing experiences compared with the obsessive compulsive disorder (50%) and panic disorder (35%) groups.

Do some emotion regulation strategies have more to recommend them than others? According to Gross's (1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271-299) process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners.

Participants (N= 422) included middle school students in grades 6 through 8 from a small midwestern town. Students completed a 40-minute survey that included demographic questions, self-report and peer-report measures of bullying and victimization as well as measures of other psychosocial variables. Male adolescents self-reported more bullying and were nominated as bullies more often than female adolescents, and older students self-reported more bullying behavior than younger students. Approximately 14.5% of the sample met the criteria for bullying frequently. Cluster analysis yielded five distinct groups of bully/victim subtypes. Bullies had the same number of friends as students who did not bully their peers, and the relation between popularity and bullying behavior was the strongest for 6th grade male adolescents. With respect to peer affiliation and bullying, 75% of bullies nominated fellow bullies as friends, suggesting that bullies hang out with other bullies.

A peer nomination inventory was then administered to assess social adjustment with peers (aggression, peer rejection, and bullying by peers).

Analyses indicated that violent victimization was associated with negative social outcomes through the mediation of emotion dysregulation. Witnessed violence was linked only to aggressive behavior.

The repressive coping style is thought to preferentially impair the detection of unpleasant compared with pleasant emotions, and the degree of deficit is typically thought to be less severe than in alexithymia. We compared emotion recognition ability in both individuals with alexithymia and those with the repressive coping style. Methods Three hundred seventy-nine subjects completed the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale, the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale, the Marlowe-Crowne Scale (a measure of repressive defensiveness), the Bendig Short Form of the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and the Perception of Affect Task. The Perception of Affect Task consists of four 35-item emotion recognition subtasks: matching sentences and words, faces and words, sentences and faces, and faces and photographs of scenes. The stimuli in each subtask consist of seven emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise, and neutral) depicted five times each. Recognition accuracy results were collapsed across subtasks within each emotion category. Results Highly alexithymic subjects (for all, p < .01) and those with low emotional awareness (for all, p < .001) were consistently less accurate in emotion recognition in all seven categories. Highly defensive subjects (including repressors) were less accurate in the detection of anger, sadness, fear, and happiness (for all, p < .05). Furthermore, scores on the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale accounted for significantly more variance in performance on the Perception of Affect Task than scores on the Marlowe-Crowne Scale (p < .01).

All showed high internal consistency. Since the hypochondriasis was converted to the T score of MMPI-2, the reliability coefficient was not calculated. As a result of the analysis of the mediating effect, the difficulties of the impulsive control (β=.070, p<.05, CI:[012~.134]) and the emotional clarity (β=.086, p<.05, CI: [.008~.166]) was found to be significant. The significance of this study was to examine the mediating effects of maladaptive self-focused attention, and hypochondriasis on difficulties in emotional regulation, and to understand the difficulties in emotional regulation, maladaptive self-focused attention, and hypochondriasis. The results could reduce the psychological burden on middle-aged men and women in Korea and contribute to clinical research.",2019,24,0,,"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-3.461271286010742,

While the neural bases of emotional reactivity to social stimuli have been described, the neural bases of emotional reactivity and cognitive regulation during social and physical threat, and their relationship to social anxiety symptom severity, have yet to be investigated.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo investigate behavioral and neural correlates of emotional reactivity and cognitive regulation in patients and controls during processing of social and physical threat stimuli.\n\n\nDESIGN\nParticipants were trained to implement cognitive-linguistic regulation of emotional reactivity induced by social (harsh facial expressions) and physical (violent scenes) threat while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging and providing behavioral ratings of negative emotion experience.\n\n\nSETTING\nAcademic psychology department.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nFifteen adults with social anxiety disorder and 17 demographically matched healthy controls.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nBlood oxygen level-dependent signal and negative emotion ratings.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBehaviorally, patients reported greater negative emotion than controls during social and physical threat but showed equivalent reduction in negative emotion following cognitive regulation. Neurally, viewing social threat resulted in greater emotion-related neural responses in patients than controls, with social anxiety symptom severity related to activity in a network of emotion- and attention-processing regions in patients only. Viewing physical threat produced no between-group differences. Regulation during social threat resulted in greater cognitive and attention regulation-related brain activation in controls compared with patients. Regulation during physical threat produced greater cognitive control-related response (ie, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) in patients compared with controls.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCompared with controls, patients demonstrated exaggerated negative emotion reactivity and reduced cognitive regulation-related neural activation, specifically for social threat stimuli. These findings help to elucidate potential neural mechanisms of emotion regulation that might serve as biomarkers for interventions for social anxiety disorder.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 71, 'citationCount': 445, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1810531', 'name': 'P.

Under certain conditions, emotion regulation may develop dysregulatory aspects that can become a characteristic of an individual's coping style. This style may then jeopardize or impair functioning and become associated with symptomatic, disordered functioning. Emotional development provides a critical vantage point from which to study the development of symptomatology and psychopathology, particularly given the prevalence of emotional symptoms in various forms of psychopathology. Dimensions of emotionality that can be used to characterize dysregulation include access to the range of emotions, flexible modulation of intensity, duration, and transitions between emotions, acquisition and use of cultural display rules, and the ability to reflect on the complexity and value of one's own emotions in a self-supporting manner. Developmental psychopathology provides a framework within which to examine how emotions are regulatory, how their regulation changes over time, and under what conditions an adaptive emotion process can develop into a pattern of dysregulation that then becomes, or sustains, some symptoms of mental disorders. Such research requires samples that include children with and without risk or presence of particular mental health problems, paradigms that allow the examination of dimensions of emotionality in context and provide multiple assessments that include observations of children's reactions beyond what they themselves can report, and analyses that extend beyond simple global aggregates such as positive and negative emotion. We believe that it is particularly important to study children and their families in situations that challenge their emotional adaptation. The developmental tasks of emotional life evolve in exchanges between the child and the world of events and relationships. The emotional conditions of early childhood appear to be very important in optimizing or interfering with how the child's emotionality regulates his or her interpersonal and intrapsychic functioning and how the child learns to regulate emotion. The experiences that accrue around emotional events influence the stable aspects of the developing personality and become trait-like aspects of the person (Malatesta & Wilson, 1988). Dysregulation occurs when an emotional reaction loses breadth and flexibility. If a dysregulatory pattern becomes stabilized and part of the emotional repertoire, it is likely that this pattern is a symptom and supports other symptoms. When development and adaptation are compromised, the dysregulation has evolved into a form of psychopathology. The line between normative variations and clinical conditions is not clearly drawn.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"", 'year': 1994, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 1382, 'authors': [{'authorId': '34935701', 'name': 'P.

38,728e1adf786a3639fef94977ef1258fd42cb9b3f,Virtual Reality for the Enhancement of Emotion Regulation.,"In recent decades, a growing body of literature has focused on emotion regulation (ER), which refers to the ability to implement strategies in order to modulate emotional responses and reach desirable goals. To date, impaired ER (i.e., emotion dysregulation) has been identified as a transdiagnostic factor across a wide range of psychopathological conditions, which shows the importance of improving patients' ability to regulate negative and positive emotions in clinical practice. In addition to the increasing evidence showing its efficacy in the treatment of several clinical conditions, virtual reality (VR) has recently emerged as a potentially powerful tool for enhancing ER, thus breaking new ground in the development of cutting-edge transdiagnostic interventions. In the present narrative review, we will provide an overview of the existing evidence about VR-based interventions in the field of ER, emphasizing the promising findings and the barriers that still have to be addressed. To this aim, the available VR-based literature will be analysed in relation to four categories of ER strategies: Situational strategies, attentional strategies, cognitive strategies and response modulation strategies. Furthermore, new emerging fields of research targeting innovative aspects of ER will be highlighted, including the use of VR to promote positive emotions and interpersonal ER skills. Besides, its cost-effectiveness will be discussed, taking into account the costs for both developers (e.g., clinicians and researchers) and end-users. Finally, future directions in this promising field of research will be outlined.",2021,61,15,{'name': 'Clinical psychology & psychotherapy'},"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-2.5339646339416504,

Although some evidence suggests that adopting positive strategies is beneficial for emotional well-being, the literature is inconsistent about the effects of positive emotions on subsequent regulatory processes. In the present study, we adopted a two-week ecological momentary assessment to explore the association between positive emotions and positive emotion regulation in daily life. According to our results, the less individuals felt positive emotions at one point, the more they tended to enhance their use of positive strategies from this time to the next, which in turn resulted in subsequent higher levels of positive emotions. This prototype of positive regulation can be seen as a highly adaptive mechanism that makes it possible to compensate for a lack of positive emotions by enhancing the deployment of positive strategies.

Most evidence-based psychological therapies target symptoms of heightened negative affect (e.g., negative inferential style) instead of deficits in positive affect (e.g., attenuated reward response) and typically show little benefit for anhedonia. Viewing positive scenes through virtual reality (VR) has been shown to increase positive affect and holds great promise for addressing anhedonic symptoms. In this pilot study, six participants with clinically significant depression completed 13 sessions of exposure to positive scenes in a controlled VR environment. Significant decreases were found in self-reported anhedonia, depression, anxiety, and impairments in functioning from baseline to 1-month follow-up.

We developed an easy-to-use VR self-management relaxation tool (VRelax) with immersive 360° nature videos and interactive animated elements. Objective To investigate the immediate effects of VR relaxation on negative and positive affective states and short-term effects on perceived stress and symptoms in patients with a psychiatric disorder, compared to standard relaxation exercises. Methods A randomized crossover trial was conducted in 50 patients receiving ambulatory treatment for anxiety, psychotic, depressive, or bipolar disorder. Participants were randomly assigned to start with VRelax or standard relaxation and used both interventions for 10 days at home. They completed 8 visual analog scales of momentary negative and positive affective states before and after each session. Global perceived stress and psychiatric symptoms were measured before and after both intervention periods. Treatment effects were analyzed with multilevel mixed model regression analyses and 2-way analysis of variance. Results Both VRelax and standard relaxation exercises led to a statistically significant immediate improvement of all negative and positive affective states. Compared to standard relaxation, VRelax resulted in a significantly greater reduction of total negative affective state (change 16.2% versus 21.2%; t1684=−2.02, 95% CI −18.70 to −0.28; P=.04). Specifically, VRelax had a stronger beneficial effect on momentary anxiety (t1684=−3.24, 95% CI −6.86 to −1.69), sadness (t1684=−2.32, 95% CI −6.51 to −0.55), and cheerfulness (t1684=2.35, 95% CI 0.51 to 5.75). There were no significant differences between short-term effects of the two treatments on global perceived stress and symptoms. Conclusions If the results of this trial are replicated and extended, VRelax may provide a much-needed, effective, easy-to-use self-management relaxation intervention to enhance psychiatric treatments.

There has additionally been an increase in depression due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Behavioral activation is considered an evidence-based treatment for MDD. However, there are many barriers that could hinder one’s ability to engage in behavioral activation, with COVID-19 “shelter-in-place” and social distancing orders being current and large impediments. Virtual reality (VR) has been successfully used to help treat a variety of mental health conditions, but it has not yet been used as a method of administering behavioral activation to a clinical population. Using VR to engage in behavioral activation could eliminate barriers that pandemic precautions place and help decrease symptoms of depression that are especially exacerbated in these times. Objective The following case report examines the feasibility, acceptability, and tolerability of VR behavioral activation for an adult with MDD during a global pandemic. This participant was part of a larger pilot study, and the case serves as a description of the VR intervention. Methods The participant engaged in a weekly 50-minute psychotherapy Zoom session for 4 weeks, in which a modified behavioral activation protocol was administered using a VR headset to simulate activities. Data on mood ratings, homework compliance, and headset use were obtained from the headset. Acceptability, tolerability, and depression symptoms were obtained using self-report rating scales. Results The intervention was feasible, acceptable, and tolerable, as reported by this participant. The participant’s depressive symptoms decreased by five-points on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 over a month, with a beginning score of 10 (moderate depression) and a final score of 5 (mild depression). Conclusions The implications of these findings for future research are discussed.

Physiological indicators, including EEG (electroencephalogram), blood pressure, skin conductance, and pulse, were monitored in 180 Chinese university students (mean age: 20.72 ± 2.56 years) while they were watching bamboo videos. Before and after watching the videos, their psychological indicators, including positive and negative moods, were measured using the Profile of Mood States questionnaire. After watching the bamboo videos of different durations, all of the physiological indicators responded to the stimulation after only 1 min. The indicators showed different trends at 1, 3 and 5 min. EEG decreased and then was maintained at a stable level after 1 min, and the high β, low β, and α waves had no significant differences between 1, 3 and 5 min. Blood pressure dropped to a stable state after 3 min, and the decline was significantly different greater after 3 min than after 1 min. Skin conductance increased for 1 to 5 min, and it did not stabilize after a long time (5 min). Pulse decreased after 1 min but increased after 5 min. After watching the videos with bamboo of varying structures, the physiological and psychological indicators showed significantly different changes. Skin conductance significantly increased (mean value: 6.78%), and the amount of sweat was more effectively reduced, thereby reducing tension, when the students viewed videos of sympodial bamboo forests compared with monopodial bamboo forests. Bamboo forests with a higher canopy density (0.83–0.85) could significantly decrease α waves (mean value: 1.50 Hz), relaxing the human body. High β and low β waves showed greater decreases, with tension reduced more effectively, when bamboo forests with a low tilt ratio (< 1.5%) were viewed.

A large body of research has shown that alterations in ER are related to psychological disorders across different diagnostic categories. Because of the apparent ubiquity of ER difficulties in psychopathology, several authors have proposed that ER should be regarded as a transdiagnostic process. This article critically examines evidence regarding alterations in the use of cognitive ER strategies as a transdiagnostic process. Cognitive ER strategies are examined as 1 example of several possible ER-related processes that could be involved in psychopathology. There is consistent evidence showing that a reduced use of cognitive reappraisal and an increased use of negative rumination are present across a number of disorders, whereas increased levels of positive rumination appear to be confined to bipolar disorder. However, there is only preliminary evidence from prospective and/or experimental studies on the causal nature of altered ER strategy use in the development or maintenance of psychopathology. The article concludes by discussing future directions, including methodological and design issues, as well as implications for assessment and treatment when studying alterations in ER from a transdiagnostic perspective.

The fears can arise, for example, from paranoia, hallucinations, social anxiety or negative-self beliefs. The fears lead patients to withdraw from activities, and this isolation leads to a cycle of worsening physical and mental health. Breaking this cycle requires highly active treatment directly in the troubling situations so that patients learn that they can safely and confidently enter them. However patients with psychosis seldom receive such life-changing interventions. To solve this problem we have developed an automated psychological treatment delivered in virtual reality (VR). It allows patients to experience computer simulations of the situations that they find anxiety-provoking. A virtual coach guides patients, using cognitive techniques, in how to overcome their fears. Patients are willing to enter VR simulations of anxiety-provoking situations because they know the simulations are not real, but the learning made transfers to the real world. Methods and analysis 432 patients with psychosis and anxious avoidance of social situations will be recruited from National Health Service (NHS) secondary care services. In the gameChange trial, they will be randomised (1:1) to the six-session VR cognitive treatment added to treatment as usual or treatment as usual alone. Assessments will be conducted at 0, 6 (post-treatment) and 26 weeks by a researcher blind to allocation. The primary outcome is avoidance and distress in real-life situations, using a behavioural assessment task, at 6\u2009weeks. The secondary outcomes are psychiatric symptoms, activity levels and quality of life. All main analyses will be intention-to-treat. Moderation and mediation will be tested. An economic evaluation will be conducted. Ethics and dissemination The trial has received ethical approval from the NHS South Central - Oxford B Research Ethics Committee (19/SC/0075). A key output will be a high-quality automated VR treatment for patients to overcome anxious avoidance of social situations.

CBIs are based on constructive meditations where imagery abilities are essential. One of the major difficulties that participants report during the training is the difficulty related to imagery abilities. Virtual reality (VR) can be a useful tool to overcome this limitation because it can facilitate the construction and sustainment of mental images. The machine to be another (TMTBA) uses multi-sensory stimulation to induce a body swap illusion. This system allows participants to see themselves from a third perspective and have the illusion of touching themselves from outside. The main objective of the present study was to analyze the efficacy of a self-compassion meditation procedure based on the TMTBA system versus the usual meditation procedure (CAU) in increasing positive affect states, mindful self-care, and adherence to the practice, and explore the influence of imagery abilities as moderators of the effects of the condition on adherence. A sample of 16 participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: TMTBA-VR and CAU. All participants had to listen to an audio meditation about self-compassion and answer questionnaires before and after the training. The TMTBA-VR condition also had a body swap experience at the end of the meditation while listening to self-compassionate messages. Afterward, they were invited to practice this meditation for 2 weeks and then measured again. After the compassion practice, both conditions significantly increased positive qualities toward self/others, decreased negative qualities toward self, and increased awareness and attention to mental events and bodily sensations, with no differences between the conditions. After 2 weeks, both conditions showed a similar frequency of meditation practice and increases in specific types of self-care behaviors, with the frequency of clinical self-care behaviors being significantly higher in TMTBA. Finally, lower imagery ability in the visual and cutaneous modality were moderators of the efficacy of the TMTBA (vs. CAU) condition in increasing adherence to the practice. Embodied VR could be an interesting tool to facilitate and increase the efficacy of CBIs by facilitating the construction of positive and powerful mental images.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 52, 'citationCount': 29, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3325539', 'name': 'A.

We evaluated VR-presented natural settings for reducing stress and improving mood.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThere were 18 participants (9 men, 9 women), ages 32 ± 12 yr, who viewed three 15-min 360° scenes (an indoor control, rural Ireland, and remote beaches). Subjects were mentally stressed with arithmetic before scenes. Electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate variability measured psycho-physiological arousal. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the 15-question Modified Reality Judgment and Presence Questionnaire (MRJPQ) measured mood and scene quality.\n\n\nRESULTS\nReductions in EDA from baseline were greater at the end of the natural scenes compared to the control scene (-0.59, -0.52, and 0.32 μS, respectively). The natural scenes reduced negative affect from baseline ( 1.2 and 1.1 points), but the control scene did not ( 0.4 points). MRJPQ scores for the control scene were lower than both natural scenes (4.9, 6.7, and 6.5 points, respectively).

Most patients with BPD never receive DBT®. Incorporating computer technology into the DBT® could help increase dissemination. Immersive Virtual Reality technology (VR) is becoming widely available to mainstream consumers. This case study explored the feasibility/clinical potential of using immersive virtual reality technology to enhance DBT® mindfulness skills training of a 32 year old female diagnosed with BPD. Prior to using VR, the patient experienced difficulty practicing DBT® mindfulness due to her emotional reactivity, and difficulty concentrating. To help the patient focus her attention, and to facilitate DBT® mindfulness skills learning, the patient looked into virtual reality goggles, and had the illusion of slowly “floating down” a 3D computer-generated river while listening to DBT® mindfulness training audios. Urges to commit suicide, urges to self harm, urges to quit therapy, urges to use substances, and negative emotions were all reduced after each VR mindfulness session and VR mindfulness was well accepted/liked by the patient. Although case studies are scientifically inconclusive by nature, results from this feasibility study were encouraging. Future controlled studies are needed to quantify whether VR-enhanced mindfulness training has long term benefits e.g., increasing patient acceptance and/or improving therapeutic outcome. Computerizing some of the DBT® skills treatment modules would reduce cost and increase dissemination.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 55, 'citationCount': 82, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1422265704', 'name': 'Maria V.

In the contamination subtype, individuals are scared of germs and bacteria, are excessively concerned with cleaning, fear contamination and the spread of disease, and may have a very strong aversion to bodily secretions. A few studies on virtual reality have been conducted with people suffering from OCD, but they all focus on the subtype characterized by checking rituals. The goal of this study is to confirm the potential of a “contaminated” virtual environment in inducing anxiety in 12 adults suffering from contamination-subtype OCD compared to 20 adults without OCD (N = 32) using a within-between protocol. Subjective (questionnaire) and objective (heart rate) measurements were compiled. Participants were immersed in a control virtual environment (empty and clean room) and a “contaminated” virtual environment (filthy public restroom) designed for the treatment of OCD. Immersions were conducted in a 6-wall CAVE-like system. As hypothesized, the results of repeated-measures ANCOVAs revealed the significant impact of immersion in a filthy public restroom for participants suffering from OCD on both measures. Presence was correlated with anxiety in OCD participants and no difference in presence was observed between groups. Unwanted negative side effects induced by immersions in virtual reality were higher in the OCD group.

Attentional focus during exercise, bad-good feeling states (pre- and postexperimental), perceived exertion (3 minutes and post), heart rate, and enjoyment were assessed. Results indicated that overweight children focused on internal information under the TC, but they significantly shifted their attention to regard the external environment in the DC. This attentional distraction effect of VR was more intense in overweight than in normal-weight children. No differences between groups were found when examining changes in feeling states and perceived exertion. VR increased enjoyment during exercise, and children preferred exercise using virtual environments.

It is also linked to deficits in emotional regulation and frequently co-occurs with anxiety and depression symptoms. There is also evidence that emotional dysregulation may play a mediatory role between GD and psychopathological symptomatology. Few studies have reported the outcomes of psychological interventions that specifically address these underlying processes. Objectives: To assess the utility of the Playmancer platform, a serious video game, as an additional therapy tool in a CBT intervention for GD, and to estimate pre-post changes in measures of impulsivity, anger expression and psychopathological symptomatology. Method: The sample comprised a single group of 16 male treatment-seeking individuals with severe GD diagnosis. Therapy intervention consisted of 16 group weekly CBT sessions and, concurrently, 10 additional weekly sessions of a serious video game. Pre-post treatment scores on South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), I7 Impulsiveness Questionnaire (I7), State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory 2 (STAXI-2), Symptom Checklist-Revised (SCL-90-R), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S-T), and Novelty Seeking from the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R) were compared. Results: After the intervention, significant changes were observed in several measures of impulsivity, anger expression and other psychopathological symptoms. Dropout and relapse rates during treatment were similar to those described in the literature for CBT. Conclusion: Complementing CBT interventions for GD with a specific therapy approach like a serious video game might be helpful in addressing certain underlying factors which are usually difficult to change, including impulsivity and anger expression.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 115, 'citationCount': 67, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2366468', 'name': 'S.

The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of VRT in treating subjects with alcohol dependence (AD) by evaluating changes in brain metabolism.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThe VRT protocol consisted of three steps: relaxation, presentation of a high-risk situation, and presentation of an aversive situation. Twelve alcohol-dependent subjects underwent 10 sessions of VRT. The alcohol-dependent subjects were assessed with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography images before and after VRT, whereas the control group underwent imaging according to the same protocol only at baseline.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with the healthy control group, AD subjects showed higher metabolism in the right lentiform nucleus and right temporal lobe (BA20) at baseline (P(FDR < .05) = .026). In addition, the metabolism in the left anterior cingulate was lower in subjects with AD (P(uncorr) = .001). After VRT, alcohol-dependent subjects showed decreased brain metabolism in the right lentiform nucleus (P(FDR < .05) = .026) and right temporal lobe (BA38, P(FDR < .05) = .032) relative to that at baseline.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results suggest a neurobiological imbalance, notably, a high sensitivity to stimuli, in the limbic system in subjects with AD. Furthermore, we determined that metabolism decreased in the basal ganglia after VRT, which may explain the limbic-regulated responses of reward and regulation.

Not surprisingly, exposure to stress is generally associated with a wide range of negative outcomes, including decreased well-being, increased incidence of disease, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder (Dohrenwend & Dohrenwend, 1974; Kendler et al., 1999; Monat et al., 2007). However, not all individuals who are exposed to even high levels of stress develop such negative outcomes. In fact, recent evidence suggests that a considerable number of individuals exhibit resilience, which is commonly defined as maintained or improved mental health in the face of stress, after short disruptions (if any) to normal functioning (Freitas & Downey, 1998; Rutter, 1999; Luthar et al., 2000; Bonanno, 2005). Note that this definition, which we adapt here, conceptualizes resilience as a potential outcome after exposure to stress rather than a psychological trait that leads to positive outcomes (c.f. Norris et al., 2008). It, therefore, appears that, in the face of comparable stressors, some individuals exhibit significantly impaired functioning while others show impressive resilience. Understanding the factors that govern the great individual variance in outcomes after stress is important for understanding mental health and for developing interventions and prevention programs that foster resilience. What factors, then, might predict resilience? One key to this question might lie in the fact that stressful events are inherently highly emotional (Sarason et al., 1978; Lazarus, 1999). For this reason, people’s ability to regulate emotions may be a critically important factor in determining resilience (Figure 2.1). The present chapter will review relevant literatures and suggest that there is indeed evidence to support this thesis. More specifically, we will propose that a specific type of emotion regulation, cognitive emotion regulation, holds particular promise for contributing to resilience.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 94, 'citationCount': 261, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4041983', 'name': 'Allison S.

EnglishA review of the applications of the Information and Communication Technologies in Clinical and Health Psychology in childhood and adolescence. The development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) has meant a radical change in a variety of disciplines, including Clinical and Health Psychology. During childhood and adolescence, interaction with the ICTs is common and regular, and it is also facilitated because they are digital natives who are naturally identified with the technological advances. The last decade has seen a clear revolution regarding the use of different technologies for the application of psychological treatments and the promotion of health, so as to facilitate and improve the learning of a variety of emotional competences and healthy behaviors in those populations that are in a continuous process of development and change. Cognitive-behavioral orientation and evidence-based psychological treatments have been successfully transferred to the ICTs and there are many studies that support this. The present article addresses a review of the main ICT-based devices for the treatment of different psychological disorders during childhood and adolescence, as well as in other important areas of health at these ages. The implications that these devices may have are being analyzed, as well as the possible potential challenges to optimize these resources.

Second, we examined the effects of the ESM self-monitoring intervention on these daily life behaviors.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIndividuals with a diagnosis of depression (N = 102) receiving pharmacological treatment were randomized to 1 of 2 six-week ESM intervention conditions or a control condition. Physical, sedentary, social, and leisure behaviors as well as depressive symptoms were assessed prospectively in every-day life at baseline, postintervention, and during the ESM interventions.\n\n\nRESULTS\nChange in physical activity and talking from baseline to postintervention was associated with change in depressive symptoms from baseline to postintervention. Within-person daily fluctuations in talking, physical activity, doing nothing/resting, and being alone predicted end-of-day depressive symptoms over and above depressive symptoms at the previous day. The ESM interventions contributed to change in talking, doing nothing/resting, and being alone over time in comparison with the control group. The analyses revealed individual differences in the amount of behavioral change over time and in the within-subject associations between daily behaviors and depressive symptoms.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe findings suggest that physical, sedentary, and social behaviors have affective implications for daily mental health of individuals with depression.

Two of the technologies that are more consolidated in this field are virtual reality (VR) and telepsychology. There are other technological innovations that are beginning to be used in clinical and health psychology such as ambient intelligence, ubiquitous computing or persuasive computing. In the last fifteen years there has been a proliferation of studies testing the efficacy of immersive virtual reality in the delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for several mental disorders and health conditions. The essence of VR is that it can simulate reality and add a new possibility: the user has the illusion of “being” in the computer-generated environment while interacting with the VR objects. This unique feature of VR is very relevant for its use in Clinical Psychology. At the same time, it can raise several ethical issues. It is important to investigate the possible effects of blurring the distinction between real and virtual worlds in vulnerable populations. Some other concerns regarding the use of VR in therapy have already been investigated, such as cybersickness. After ten years of experience treating patients with VR, this has not been a problem in the published efficacy studies. Telepsychology has also been used to improve the delivery of CBT. A number of Internetdelivered programs have already become important tools in the health system. The main advantage is that online therapy can reach people who might not otherwise seek therapy, such as disabled people or those who live in remote areas. However, several concerns have been raised about self-help procedures, like the issue of self-diagnosis. and the fact that patients usually have all of the necessary self-help information at their disposal. It is important to establish criteria to protect people from the possible negative effects of this. Other innovations such as ambient intelligence and pervasive computing bring up other ethical issues. For example, is privacy being compromised too much when people are located using GPS or physiologically monitored 24 hours a day? Criteria for considering these issues must be established. Our research group has been working with new technologies and therapies for the last fifteen years.

This reflects the power of presence – seen as the feeling of being located in a perceived, external world – in developing and affecting psychological wellbeing. Until today Virtual reality Environments (VEs) have been incorporated into a variety of clinical and everyday settings to improve mental health. Nevertheless many areas in the health field can be still explored by using this innovative technology. One example is represented by stress management area, one of the leading mental health problems of western societies linked to several pathologies. Following this trend our proposal is to investigate with a non clinical sample the efficacy of a relaxing narrative through a virtual experience. In a controlled study we compared three different media: Immersive VR, DVD and Audio speaker, by using the same therapeutic narrative and protocol. A control group without treatment was also included in the study. The sample included 60 university students, randomly divided in four experimental conditions. Non parametric test and correlation were used to analyse self-reports and physiological parameters. Within groups analysis - in both VR and DVD conditions - showed a significant improvement of the emotional state and significative physiological changes. Furthermore, regression analysis showed that a relationship exists between the sense of presence and the outcome achieved by the mediated experience. However, the absence of significant differences from the analysis between groups suggests that the principal determinant of presence might be the content proposed within the mediated experience. Further reflections about sense of presence in relaxing virtual environments will be discussed.', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 39, 'citationCount': 20, 'authors': [{'authorId': '103238720', 'name': 'D.

Results indicate that the participants in “imagery” spaces indicated a decrease of their sense of presence, whereas the opposite occurs in participants in “virtual” spaces.

However, in utilizing systematic desensitization, research reviews demonstrate that many patients appear to have difficulty imaging the prescribed anxiety-evoking scene. They also express strong aversion to experiencing real situations. This chapter describes the Virtual Reality Therapy (VRT), a new therapeutical approach that can be used to overcome some of the difficulties inherent in the traditional treatment of phobias. VRT, like current imaginal and in vivo modalities, can generate stimuli that could be utilized in desensitization therapy. Like systematic desensitization therapy, VRT can provide stimuli for patients who have difficulty in imagining scenes and/or are too phobic to experience real situations. Unlike in vivo systematic desensitization, VRT can be performed within the privacy of a room, thus avoiding public embarrassment and violation of patient confidentiality. VRT can generate stimuli of much greater magnitude than standard in vivo techniques. Since VRT is under patient control, it appears safer than in vivo desensitization and at the same time more realistic than imaginal desensitization. Finally, VRT adds the advantage of greater efficiency and economy in delivering the equivalent of in vivo systematic desensitization within the therapist's office. The chapter also describes how to use virtual reality in the treatment of specific phobias: fear of flying, fear of heights, fear of being in certain situations (such as a dark barn, an enclosed bridge over a river, and in the presence of an animal [a black cat] in a dark room), and fear of public speaking."", 'year': 1997, 'referenceCount': 26, 'citationCount': 124, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3176814', 'name': 'M.

Understanding the way we react to the interaction with virtual agents and the impact of emotions on social dynamics in the virtual world is fundamental. Therefore, in this study we investigated the implicit effect of emotional information by adopting a perceptual discrimination task. Specifically, we devised a task that explicitly required perceptual discrimination of a target while involving distance regulation in the presence of happy, neutral, or angry virtual agents. In two Immersive Virtual Reality experiments, participants were instructed to discriminate a target on the virtual agents’ t-shirts, and they had to provide the response by stopping the virtual agents (or themselves) at the distance where they could identify the target. Thus, facial expressions were completely irrelevant to the perceptual task. The results showed that the perceptual discrimination implied a longer response time when t-shirts were worn by angry rather than happy or neutral virtual agents. This suggests that angry faces interfered with the explicit perceptual task people had to perform. From a theoretical standpoint, this anger-superiority effect could reflect an ancestral fear/avoidance mechanism that prompts automatic defensive reactions and bypasses other cognitive

In the real world a person’s peripersonal space boundaries can be altered by factors in the environment and by social context. We completed two studies with visual and tactile stimuli to determine peripersonal space boundaries. These studies investigated whether peripersonal space boundaries in an immersive virtual environment are consistent with those in the real world, and could be altered by object and virtual agent interactions. We found that while peripersonal space boundaries were consistent with those in the real world, they were responsive to object and agent interactions.

Many actions in the real world require that people act without prior planning, and these actions are executed quite successfully. In this paper, we study the common action of two people passing through an aperture together in both the real world (Experiment 1) and in a distributed, collaborative IVE (Experiment 2). The aperture's width is varied from too narrow to be passable to so wide as to be easily passable by both participants together simultaneously. We do this in the real world for all possible gender-based pairings. In virtual reality, however, there is potential for the gender of the participant and the gender of the self-avatar to be different. We also investigate the joint action for all possible gender-based pairings in the distributed IVE. Results indicated that, in the real world, social dynamics between gendered pairings emerged; male-male pairings refused to concede to one another until absolutely necessary while other pairings did not. Male-female pairings were most likely to provide ample space to one another during passage. These behaviors seemed not to appear in the IVE, and avatar gender across all pairings generated no significant behavioral differences. In addition, participants tended to require wider gaps to allow for passage in the IVE.

Although comfortable interpersonal distance seems to be dependent on social factors such as the gender, age and activity of the confederates, it also seems to be modulated by the way we represent our peripersonal-action space. To test this hypothesis, the present study investigated the relation between the emotional responses registered through electrodermal activity (EDA) triggered by human-like point-light displays (PLDs) carrying different facial expressions (neutral, angry, happy) when located in the participants peripersonal or extrapersonal space, and the comfort distance with the same PLDs when approaching and crossing the participants fronto-parallel axis on the right or left side. The results show an increase of the phasic EDA for PLDs with angry facial expressions located in the peripersonal space (reachability judgment task), in comparison to the same PLDs located in the extrapersonal space, which was not observed for PLDs with neutral or happy facial expressions. The results also show an increase of the comfort distance for PLDs approaching the participants with an angry facial expression (interpersonal comfort distance judgment task), in comparison to PLDs with happy and neutral ones, which was related to the increase of the physiological response. Overall, the findings indicate that comfort social space can be predicted from the emotional reaction triggered by a confederate when located within the observer’s peripersonal space. This suggests that peripersonal-action space and interpersonal-social space are similarly sensitive to the emotional valence of the confederate, which could reflect a common adaptive mechanism in specifying theses spaces to subtend interactions with both the physical and social environment, but also to ensure body protection from potential threats.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 91, 'citationCount': 59, 'authors': [{'authorId': '41033515', 'name': 'A.

Within face‐responsive regions, emotional faces evoke stronger responses than neutral faces (“valence effect”). We used fMRI and Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) to test the hypothesis that emotional faces differentially alter the functional coupling among face‐responsive regions. Three monkeys viewed conspecific faces with neutral, threatening, fearful, and appeasing expressions. Using Bayesian model selection, various models of neural interactions between the posterior (TEO) and anterior (TE) portions of inferior temporal (IT) cortex, the amygdala, the orbitofrontal (OFC), and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) were tested. The valence effect was mediated by feedback connections from the amygdala to TE and TEO, and feedback connections from VLPFC to the amygdala and TE. Emotional faces were associated with differential effective connectivity: Fearful faces evoked stronger modulations in the connections from the amygdala to TE and TEO; threatening faces evoked weaker modulations in the connections from the amygdala and VLPFC to TE; and appeasing faces evoked weaker modulations in the connection from VLPFC to the amygdala.

Our main contribution is to propose a perceptual evaluation of a simple virtual reality system. The goal is to assess whether real humans are also able to accurately estimate a virtual human motion before collision avoidance. Results show that, even through a simple system, users are able to correctly evaluate the situation of an interaction on the qualitative point of view. Especially, in comparison with real interactions, users accurately decide whether they should give way to the virtual human or not. However, on the quantitative point of view, it is not easy for users to determine whether they will collide with virtual humans or not.

Second, plausibility illusion (Psi) refers to the illusion that the scenario being depicted is actually occurring. In the case of both PI and Psi the participant knows for sure that they are not ‘there’ and that the events are not occurring. PI is constrained by the sensorimotor contingencies afforded by the virtual reality system. Psi is determined by the extent to which the system can produce events that directly relate to the participant, the overall credibility of the scenario being depicted in comparison with expectations.

In many experiments, however, these arm movements are ambiguous. Arm flexion can be interpreted either as pulling (approach) or as withdrawing (avoidance). On the contrary, arm extension can be interpreted as reaching (approach) or as pushing (avoidance). This ambiguity can be resolved by regarding approach and avoidance as flexible action plans that are represented in terms of their effects. Approach actions reduce the distance between a stimulus and the self, whereas avoidance actions increase that distance. In this view, action effects are an integral part of the representation of an action. As a result, a neutral action can become an approach or avoidance reaction if it repeatedly results in decreasing or increasing the distance to a valenced stimulus. This hypothesis was tested in the current study. Participants responded to positive and negative words using key-presses. These “neutral” responses (not involving arm flexion or extension) were consistently followed by a stimulus movement toward or away from the participant.

Thus we used fMRI to determine which brain areas subserve processing of high‐valence expressions and if distinct brain areas are activated when facial expressions are processed explicitly or implicitly. Nine healthy volunteers were scanned (1.5T GE Signa with ANMR, TE/TR 40/3,000 ms) during two similar experiments in which blocks of mixed happy and angry facial expressions (“on” condition) were alternated with blocks of neutral faces (control “off” condition). Experiment 1 examined explicit processing of expressions by requiring subjects to attend to, and judge, facial expression. Experiment 2 examined implicit processing of expressions by requiring subjects to attend to, and judge, facial gender, which was counterbalanced in both experimental conditions. Processing of facial expressions significantly increased regional blood oxygenation level‐dependent (BOLD) activity in fusiform and middle temporal gyri, hippocampus, amygdalohippocampal junction, and pulvinar nucleus. Explicit processing evoked significantly more activity in temporal lobe cortex than implicit processing, whereas implicit processing evoked significantly greater activity in amygdala region. Mixed high‐valence facial expressions are processed within temporal lobe visual cortex, thalamus, and amygdalohippocampal complex. Also, neural substrates for explicit and implicit processing of facial expressions are dissociable: explicit processing activates temporal lobe cortex, whereas implicit processing activates amygdala region.

Previously limited to scientific research, global networks now have an impact on social, educational, and business communications. Individuals with a personal computer, a modem, and some simple software can join a new social community that is based on interest, not location. Global Networks, which was written largely with the assistance of the internet, provides an understanding of the issues, opportunities, and pitfalls of this new social connectivity. It looks at how networking technology can support and augment communication and collaboration from such perspectives as policy constraints and opportunities, language differences, cross-cultural communication, and social network design.

Social scientists in the field of human ecology have been concerned primarily with the distribution of such things as social classes, economic institutions, and mental illness. An almost unexplored area is microecology or the way that people in pairs or small groups arrange themselves. In the studies of Hediger (5), Howard (6), and Von Uexkull (15), ""space"" has had two different meanings. The more familiar of these refers to space in the geographic sense, i.e., space as area. It is most commonly discussed with reference to the animal\'s territory or home. However, some writers have applied the concept of territory to human behavior. W. F. Whyte (16) and Thrasher (14) have studied the territories of adolescent gangs. W. H. Whyte (17) also has studied the groupings of people within a housing development. Probably the most intensive investigation thus far has been that of Barker and Wright (2) in the Midwest. Yet this still remains relatively unexplored territory for social scientists. The second way in which the term ""space"" is used can be called ""personal space of the organism."" Although it has its roots in the work of zoologists and ethologists, it is an entirely different concept from that of territory. Personal distance is the distance that the organism customarily places between itself and other organisms. This distance may vary from species to species and individual to individual. Hediger speaks of this as ""flight distance"" and has measured this for hundreds of animals. This concept would seem to have relevance for the study of human behavior, although it has never been studied empirically so far as we know. It seems obvious that people feel uncomfortable when they talk to others who either stand too close or too far away. The concept itself has been used several times in the literature. David Katz (8) used the term ""personal space"" and compared it to the shell of a snail. Von Uexkull used the graphic analogy of people ""surrounded by soap-bubble worlds."" Stern (13) developed the concept of personal world.

Method: The research employed a single-subject ABA design. The population included all children with ASD attending the Zehn ara Rehabilitation Clinic in Tehran in the second half of 2021, from which 5 participants were purposively selected. Initially, the combined program was implemented for 10 sessions of 30 minutes each on two randomly chosen participants from the sample, and after validating the program, three additional participants were included in the study. The Sensory Profile 2 questionnaire (2014) was used in this research. During the baseline phase, at the end of each intervention session, and during a one-month follow-up period, the questionnaires were completed. Data analysis involved visual analysis, percentage of improvement, and percentage of overlapping and non-overlapping data. Results: The results indicated that based on the obtained effect sizes, the intervention had a significant impact on emotional regulation in participants 1 to 5, with 90%, 80%, 80%, 100%, and 90% certainty, respectively. Furthermore, the percentage of improvement resulting from the interventions for participants 1 to 5 was 20.08%, 28.75%, 28.24%, 27.24%, and 21.02%, respectively. Conclusion: Based on the findings, the combined rehabilitation program was effective in improving the emotional profile of children with autism. Therefore; this approach can be recommended as an appropriate intervention for individuals with ASD.",2023,0,0,{'name': 'Shenakht Journal of Psychology and Psychiatry'},"{'model': 'specter_v1',

Extensive use of VAs has provided the large, cash-rich technology companies who sell them with another way of consuming users’ data, providing a lucrative revenue stream. Whilst these companies are legally obliged to treat users’ information “fairly and responsibly,” artificial intelligence techniques used to process data have become incredibly sophisticated, leading to users’ concerns that a lack of clarity is making it hard to understand the nature and scope of data collection and use. There has been little work undertaken on a self-contained user awareness tool targeting VAs. PrivExtractor, a novel web-based awareness dashboard for VA users, intends to redress this imbalance of understanding between the data “processors” and the user. It aims to achieve this using the four largest VA vendors as a case study and providing a comparison function that examines the four companies’ privacy practices and their compliance with data protection law. As a result of this research, we conclude that the companies studied are largely compliant with the law, as expected. However, the user remains disadvantaged due to the ineffectiveness of current data regulation that does not oblige the companies to fully and transparently disclose how and when they use, share, or profit from the data. Furthermore, the software tool developed during the research is, we believe, the first that is capable of a comparative analysis of VA privacy with a visual demonstration to increase ease of understanding for the user.",2023,57,0,"{'name': 'ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security', 'pages': '1 - 29', 'volume': '26'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-7.9712324142456055,

As companies build voice assistants with extra functionalities, attacks that trick a voice assistant into performing malicious behaviors can pose a significant threat to a user’s security, privacy, and even safety. However, the diverse attacks and stand-alone defenses in the literature often lack a systematic perspective, making it challenging for designers to properly identify, understand, and mitigate the security threats against voice assistants. To overcome this problem, this article provides a thorough survey of the attacks and countermeasures for voice assistants. We systematize a broad category of relevant but seemingly unrelated attacks by the vulnerable system components and attack methods, and categorize existing countermeasures based on the defensive strategies from a system designer’s perspective. To assist designers in planning defense based on their demands, we provide a qualitative comparison of existing countermeasures by the implementation cost, usability, and security and propose practical suggestions.

These VAs often collect and analyze huge user data for improving their functionality. However, this collected data may contain sensitive information (e.g., personal voice recordings) that users might not feel comfortable sharing with others and might cause significant privacy concerns. To counter such concerns, service providers like Google present their users with a personal data dashboard (called `My Activity Dashboard'), allowing them to manage all voice assistant collected data. However, a real-world GVA-data driven understanding of user perceptions and preferences regarding this data (and data dashboards) remained relatively unexplored in prior research. To that end, in this work we focused on Google Voice Assistant (GVA) users and investigated the perceptions and preferences of GVA users regarding data and dashboard while grounding them in real GVA-collected user data. Specifically, we conducted an 80-participant survey-based user study to collect both generic perceptions regarding GVA usage as well as desired privacy preferences for a stratified sample of their GVA data. We show that most participants had superficial knowledge about the type of data collected by GVA. Worryingly, we found that participants felt uncomfortable sharing a non-trivial 17.7% of GVA-collected data elements with Google. The current My Activity dashboard, although useful, did not help long-time GVA users effectively manage their data privacy. Our real-data-driven study found that showing users even one sensitive data element can significantly improve the usability of data dashboards.

This mutual trade-off needs to be considered and addressed whenever security products are developed. Achieving well-balanced levels of both is a precondition for sufficient security as users tend to reject unusable solutions. To assess it correctly, usability should be evaluated in the context of security. This paper aims to identify and describe universally applicable and solution-independent factors that affect the perceived usability of security mechanisms.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe selected methodology was a systematic literature review during which multiple database resources were queried. Application of predefined selection criteria led to the creation of a bibliography before backward snowballing was applied to minimize the risk of missing material of importance. All 70 included publications were then analyzed through thematic analysis.\n\n\nFindings\nThe study resulted in the identification of 14 themes and 30 associated subthemes representing aspects with reported influence on perceived usability in the context of security. While some of them were only mentioned sparsely, the most prominent and thus presumably most significant ones were: simplicity, information and support, task completion time, error rates and error management.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe identified novel themes can increase knowledge about factors that influence usability. This can be useful for different groups: end users may be empowered to choose appropriate solutions more consciously, developers may be able to avoid common usability pitfalls when designing new products and system administrators may benefit from a better understanding of how to configure solutions and how to educate users efficiently.\n', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 88, 'citationCount': 8, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1907174808', 'name': 'Markus Lennartsson'}, {'authorId': '3248052', 'name': 'Joakim Kävrestad'}, {'authorId': '1925268', 'name': 'Marcus Nohlberg'}]}, {'paperId': '4293b10197f9d58c89590486eb9d91b5a7fc4e20', 'title': 'User preferences for privacy features in digital assistants', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 107, 'citationCount': 16, 'authors': [{'authorId': '7281159', 'name': 'Frank Ebbers'}, {'authorId': '1808044', 'name': 'Jan Zibuschka'}, {'authorId': '1738505347', 'name': 'Christian Zimmermann'}, {'authorId': '2040528', 'name': 'O.

The increased reliance on VA services raises privacy concerns such as the leakage of private conversations and sensitive information. Privacy policies play an important role in addressing users’ privacy concerns and informing them about the data collection, storage, and sharing practices. VA platforms (both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant) allow third-party developers to build new voice-apps and publish them to app stores. Voice-app developers are required to provide privacy policies to disclose their apps’ data practices. However, little is known whether these privacy policies are informative and trustworthy or not on emerging VA platforms. On the other hand, many users invoke voice-apps through voice and thus there exists a usability challenge for users to access these privacy policies. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale data analytics to systematically measure the effectiveness of privacy policies provided by voice-app developers on two mainstream VA platforms. We seek to understand the quality and usability issues of privacy policies provided by developers in the current app stores. We analyzed 64,720 Amazon Alexa skills and 16,002 Google Assistant actions. Our work also includes a user study to understand users’ perspectives on privacy policies of voice-apps. Our findings reveal a worrisome reality of privacy policies in two mainstream voice-app stores. For the 17,952 skills and 9,955 actions that have privacy policies, there are many voice-apps with incorrect privacy policy URLs or broken links. We found that 1,755 Alexa skills and 192 Google actions provide a broken privacy policy URL. Amazon Alexa has more than 56% of skills with duplicate privacy policy URLs. While the Google Assistant platform has 9.0% of actions with duplicate privacy policy URLs. There are also skills/actions with inconsistency between the privacy policy and description. 6,047 Google actions do not have a privacy policy although they are required to provide one.

This policy statement reviews the forms of advertising that children and teenagers encounter, including newer forms of digital marketing, such as sponsored content, influencers, data collection, persuasive design, and personalized behavioral marketing driven by machine learning. Parents and pediatric health care providers need to be aware of the ways different marketing messages reach children and teenagers, including Internet sites, social media, and mobile apps. Evidence suggests that exposure to advertising is associated with unhealthy behaviors, such as intake of high-calorie, low-nutrient food and beverages; use of tobacco products and electronic cigarettes; use of alcohol and marijuana; and indoor tanning. Children are uniquely vulnerable to the persuasive effects of advertising because of immature critical thinking skills and impulse inhibition. School-aged children and teenagers may be able to recognize advertising but often are not able to resist it when it is embedded within trusted social networks, encouraged by celebrity influencers, or delivered next to personalized content. This policy statement expresses concern about the practice of tracking and using children’s digital behavior to inform targeted marketing campaigns, which may contribute to health disparities among vulnerable children or populations.

Despite early fusion, legal persons have been increasingly seen to have lesser and, more importantly, qualitatively different information entitlements compared to natural persons, thereby leaving European data protection with a very limited and indirect role here. In contrast, natural persons and the deceased have not been conceived as normatively dichotomous and since the 1990s there has been growing interest both in establishing sui generis direct protection for deceased data and also indirect inclusion through a link with living natural persons. Whilst the case for some indirect inclusion is overwhelming, a broad approach to the inter-relational nature of data risks further destabilizing the personal data concept. Nevertheless, given that jurisdictions representing almost half of the EEA’s population now provide some direct protection and the challenges of managing digital data on death continue to grow, the time may be ripe for a ‘soft’ recommendation on direct protection in this area. Drawing on existing law and scholarship, such a recommendation could seek to specify the role of both specific control rights and diffuse confidentiality obligations, the criteria for time-limits in each case and the need for a balance with other rights and interests which recognises the significantly decreasing interest in protection over time.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 3, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1965078', 'name': 'D.

A year after it went into effect, we study its impact on the landscape of privacy policies online. We conduct the first longitudinal, in-depth, and at-scale assessment of privacy policies before and after the GDPR. We gauge the complete consumption cycle of these policies, from the first user impressions until the compliance assessment. We create a diverse corpus of two sets of 6,278 unique English-language privacy policies from inside and outside the EU, covering their pre-GDPR and the post-GDPR versions. The results of our tests and analyses suggest that the GDPR has been a catalyst for a major overhaul of the privacy policies inside and outside the EU. This overhaul of the policies, manifesting in extensive textual changes, especially for the EU-based websites, comes at mixed benefits to the users. While the privacy policies have become considerably longer, our user study with 470 participants on Amazon MTurk indicates a significant improvement in the visual representation of privacy policies from the users’ perspective for the EU websites. We further develop a new workflow for the automated assessment of requirements in privacy policies. Using this workflow, we show that privacy policies cover more data practices and are more consistent with seven compliance requirements post the GDPR. We also assess how transparent the organizations are with their privacy practices by performing specificity analysis. In this analysis, we find evidence for positive changes triggered by the GDPR, with the specificity level improving on average.

Currently all the major online advertisement providers (including Google Adsense and Facebook) implement Behavioral Targeting (BT) as their online advertisement strategy. One of the major drawbacks of BT is that the advertisement delivery considers only the history of a user's browsing behavior; the relevance of the advertisement to the web page is totally ignored. There have been attempts to bridge the gap by combining contextual relevance with BT. But contextual relevance being a static measure has the problem that it does not adapt to user's click behavior. We propose a model that combines both user's interests and the interests of all users who have visited the page. This model is tested using data published by Chinese search engine Sogou.

42,8039dd94f5d66f3a33d289c2a7b41f04227b91c9,The role of perceived social support and emotional regulation styles in predicting psychological well-being in people with diabetes,"Diabetes is one of the most common and chronic diseases. According to this point, the purpose of this study was to predict psychological well-being based on perceived social support and emotional regulation styles in people with diabetes. The population consisted of all diabetic patients referred to health centers of Research Institute of Endocrine Sciences, Red Crescent Therapy of Tehran Pars, Taban Clinic in West Township. The statistical sample was estimated to be 210 by the Green formula. Samples were from Tehran patients, which were selected through selective and targeted sampling; the research tool was RSPWB-SF psychological well-being questionnaire, Garnowski's Cognitive Emotion Regulation (2001), and Social Assistant of Wax et al (SS-A). Statistical method: Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The results showed that the fit of the model was confirmed with χ2/df = 2/24, TLI / NNFI= 0/92, CFI= 0/93, IFI = 0/93, GFI = 0/86, and NFI = 0/89. It was also shown that the family support variables (t = 13/06, r = 0/56) and friends support (t = 12/12, r = 0/44) can assess psychological well-being with p <0.05. Among the emotional adjustment styles, rumination variables (T = -12 / 42, r = -0 / 46), blame for others (T = -15 / 15, r = -0 / 65) and positive evaluation (T = 13 / 46, r = 0 /58) can assess psychological well-being with p <0.05. The rumination variables (T = -8 / 38, r = -0 / 31), catastrophic (T = -9 / 98, r = -0 / 38), blame others (T = -14 / 25, r = -0/62) and positive evaluation (T = 12/97, r = 0/55) can evaluate friends support with p<0.05. In this regard, rumination variables (r = -9/42, r = -0/35), disaster (T = -10 / 35, r = -0 / 4), blame others (T = -9 / 64, r = -0 / 35), positive re-focus (T = 12 / 26, r = 0/5) and positive evaluation (T = 10/05, r = 0/39) can also evaluate family support with p<0.05. As a result, the structural model of prediction of psychological well-being can be evaluated based on the role of interfaces of perceived social support by emotional adjustment styles in people with diabetes.",2018,44,3,"{'name': '', 'pages': '194-213', 'volume': '5'}",,"[{'authorId': '116054926', 'name': 'Somayeh Mortazavi Far'}, {'authorId': '116151100', 'name': 'P.

Family members were especially significant to them although not all identified their family relations as satisfactory or helpful. Their social network comprised 4 major sources, including family and friends, work and colleagues, health professionals, and religion and spiritual beliefs. Each network offered significant reciprocal relations, authoritative relations, or entrusting relations. The positive appraisal of the support function was linked to the Chinese value of food, work ethics, the Confucian and religious philosophy, whereas negative aspects of support, such as the stress of maintaining relationships and inadequate information, conjoined with the Chinese suppression of emotion and the busyness of health professionals.

This research is contextualised within the growing field of short‐term therapy as it intersects the growing demand to therapeutically address clients on the autism spectrum. The treatment intervention is delineated through five sequential phases within the walk‐in clinic setting for the practitioner clinician. A rationale, overview, and instruction for the practitioner clinician utilising this novel model is provided through a case study format. By using a more structured and integrated approach to treatment, organised through an externalised metaphor, it is suggested that the current model will be more effective for this specific clinical population. Additionally, a case illustration is provided that scaffolds the treatment model, which includes table formats and pictures. The case study illustrates the self‐regulation map metaphor visually and interactively linking client challenges, strategies, and motivations simultaneously on multiple electronic devices in session. Relevant works were selected to explore the effectiveness of single‐session consultation models for those presenting on the autism spectrum. Treatment interventions for specific clinical populations are recommended, especially within walk‐in clinic therapy. This clinical research introduces a paradigm shift towards therapeutically addressing emotional self‐regulation with low‐needs youth on the spectrum through virtual, interactive

Once commonalities were identified within session, they were categorized or grouped into themes or general stages of change within the parameters of a four to six session model of short-term therapy. Commonalities in therapeutic stages of change may more accurately and uniformly measure outcome in short-term work, unlike the symptom-specific psychometric instruments of longer-term psychotherapy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA systematic framework for evaluating the client and clinician adherence to 20 specific tasks for these four short-term therapies is presented through the newly proposed, Brief Task Acquisition Scale (BTAS). It is further proposed that the client-clinicians' adherence to these tasks will track and ultimately increase treatment integrity.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThus, when the client-clinician relationship tracks and evaluates the three pillars of (1) stage/process change, (2) task acquisition, and (3) treatment integrity, the culmination of these efforts presents a new way of more sensitively measuring outcome in short-term psychotherapy. Data collection is suggested as a first step to empirically evaluate the testable hypotheses suggested within this current model. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message The clinician practitioner will note that the proposed Brief Services model removes the subjectivity of client satisfaction as a reliable outcome measure, and relies upon client and therapist adherence to specific tasks and stages of change within and across short-term psychotherapy. The clinical significance of the BTAS for the practitioner is three fold. The psychometric instrument (1) tracks stage or process change, (2) guides task acquisition, and (3) incorporates greater treatment integrity unlike other outcome measures. The BTAS present a new way of conceptualizing change in short-term psychotherapy regardless of modality or presenting issue, making it a more flexible and usable instrument for the clinician. The BTAS may measure outcome more sensitively and accurately, thus offering the client, therapist and client-therapist more information regarding change at each stage and at the end of short-term psychotherapy."", 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 27, 'citationCount': 9, 'authors': [{'authorId': '7151618', 'name': 'Everett McGuinty'}, {'authorId': '144428149', 'name': 'John Nelson'}, {'authorId': '31454550', 'name': 'A.

This intervention is primarily based upon an externalizing process, transforming of metaphoric imagery, and shifting of underlying maladaptive emotional schemas. This article addresses the clinical population of children and youth, specifically through outlining the protocol, externalizing metaphors therapy. A selective review of significant works regarding the efficacy of short-term therapy was conducted, including the process of change within narrative therapy. It is proposed that two specific processes account for the mental health change experienced by clients who receive this new treatment intervention: (1) externalization of problems and (2) purposeful client-generated metaphor manipulation, impacting upon underlying schemas. From these theoretical constructs, the present article outlines a three-session treatment protocol that manualizes these key clinical processes. A case study is presented to illustrate this intervention for anxiety and depression. Further clinical research is underway to address the testable hypotheses resulting from the current theoretical model. Clinical trials in brief psychotherapy are suggested to empirically evaluate the efficacy of this new treatment intervention for dysphoria.\n\n\nKEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE\nThis article outlines a short-term treatment intervention for anxiety and depression (dysphoira) through a novel 3-session model, where the clinician-practitioner can obtain competency through a one-day workshop.Its relevance for the clinical researcher and the mental health community is in its versatility in addressing internalizing behavior for four clinical populations: (1) children and adolescents; (2) children and adolescents on the autism spectrum; (3) adults in general; and, (4) adults with a dual-diagnosis. The treatment protocol described within is based upon the externalizing and deconstructive properties of Narrative Therapy, and the transformation of metaphoric imagery of Metaphor Therapy; both of which have little empirical support with narrative practices gaining international attention and widespread usage - through brief therapy, long-term therapy, and walk-in clinics in North America.

Aims The article is intended to (1) increase practitioners' knowledge of the empirical support for the effectiveness of single-session counselling with client populations typically served in community-based mental health and counselling agencies and (2) identify priorities for future research on SST. Method A thorough review of relevant databases was undertaken to locate published studies reporting client outcomes following SST. The focus of the review is research involving clients and presenting problems typically seen in community-based mental health and family counselling agencies. Results The findings suggest that the majority of clients attending either previously scheduled or walk-in SST find it sufficient and helpful. The studies imply that this model of service delivery leads to perceived improvement in presenting problems in general, and on specific measures of variables such as depression, anxiety, distress level and confidence in parenting skills.

44,9ace103db6bccfde198c27ed25900c1de4cc2a3c,"Real-time simulation of virtual humans' emotional facial expressions, harnessing autonomic physiological and musculoskeletal control","Emotion expressions and communication involve involuntary and voluntary processes that may not always operate consistently. Expressive behaviour involving physiological changes may carry information about hidden aspects of emotional experience important for accurate emotion recognition and social cognition. In this paper, we describe a principled approach to simulating Virtual Human physiological facial features related to the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Our approach is based on typical synergies within the two branches of the ANS. It covers both parasympathetic tone and sympathetic tone, and their impact on skin tone, pupil diameter and sweat. We also present the triggering of tears. We discuss the implementation of the approach as part of a 3D toolkit. This work is aimed at supporting the development of affective features for realtime intelligent artificial agents, and the study of the perception of mixed emotion and emotion regulation. We demonstrate how varying ANS parameters impacts facial behaviour, contrasting emotionally consistent vs inconsistent musculoskeletal and ANS-related features.",2020,43,5,{'name': 'Proceedings of the

Die mimische Expression grundlegender Emotionen ist über verschiedene Kulturen hinweg sehr ähnlich und du weist auch Gemeinsamkeiten zu anderen Säugetieren auf. Dies deutet auf einen gemeinsamen genetischen Ursprung des Zusammenhangs von Mimik und Emotion. Neuere Untersuchungen zeigen aber auch kulturelle Einflüsse und Unterschiede. Die Erkennung von Emotionen aus der Mimik und auch der Prozess des mimischen Ausdrucks der eigenen Emotionen erfolgt in einem äußerst komplexen zerebralen Netzwerk. Aufgrund der Komplexität des zerebralen Verarbeitungssystems gibt es eine Vielzahl von neurologischen und psychiatrischen Erkrankungen, welche die Kopplung von Mimik und Emotionen erheblich stören können. Auch durch das Tragen von Masken wird unsere Fähigkeit zur Übermittlung und zum Erkennen von Emotionen über die Mimik eingeschränkt. Durch die Mimik lassen sich aber nicht nur „echte“ Emotionen ausdrücken, sondern auch gespielte. Damit eröffnet die Mimik die Möglichkeit sozial erwünschten Ausdruck vorzuspielen und auch Emotionen bewusst vorzutäuschen. Diese Täuschungen sind jedoch zumeist nicht perfekt und können von kurzfristigen Gesichtsbewegungen begleitet sein, die auf die tatsächlich vorhandenen Emotionen hinweisen (Mikroexpressionen). Diese Mikroexpressionen sind von nur sehr kurzer Dauer und vom Menschen häufig kaum wahrnehmbar, jedoch das ideale Anwendungsgebiet für computergestützte Analysen. Diese automatische Identifikation von Mikroexpressionen hat in den letzten Jahren nicht nur wissenschaftliche Aufmerksamkeit erfahren, sondern ihr Einsatz wird auch in sicherheitsrelevanten Bereichen getestet. Der vorliegende Artikel fasst den aktuellen Wissensstand von Mimik und Emotionen zusammen. ABSTRACT Human facial expressions are unique in their ability to express our emotions and communicate them to others. The mimic expression of basic emotions is very similar across different cultures and has also many features in common with other mammals. This suggests a common genetic origin of the association between facial expressions and emotion. However, recent studies also show cultural influences and differences. The recognition of emotions from facial expressions, as well as the process of expressing one’s emotions facially, occurs within an extremely complex cerebral network. Due to the complexity of the cerebral processing system, there are a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders that can significantly disrupt the coupling of facial expressions and emotions. Wearing masks also limits our ability to convey and recognize emotions through facial expressions. Through facial expressions, however, not only “real” emotions can be expressed, but also acted ones. Thus, facial expressions open up the possibility of faking socially desired expressions and also of consciously faking emotions. However, these pretenses are mostly imperfect and can be accompanied by short-term facial movements that indicate the emotions that are actually present (microexpressions). These microexpressions are of very short duration and often barely perceptible by humans, but they are the ideal application area for computer-aided analysis. This automatic identification of microexpressions has not only received scientific attention in recent years, but its use is also being tested in security-related areas. This article summarizes the current state of knowledge of facial expressions and emotions.', 'year': 2023, 'referenceCount': 132, 'citationCount': 1451, 'authors': [{'authorId': '47016130', 'name': 'C.

Guided by new conceptual and quantitative approaches (Cowen, Elfenbein, Laukka, & Keltner, 2018; Cowen & Keltner, 2017, 2018), we explore the taxonomy of emotion recognized in facial-bodily expression. Participants (N = 1,794; 940 female, ages 18-76 years) judged the emotions captured in 1,500 photographs of facial-bodily expression in terms of emotion categories, appraisals, free response, and ecological validity. We find that facial-bodily expressions can reliably signal at least 28 distinct categories of emotion that occur in everyday life. Emotion categories, more so than appraisals such as valence and arousal, organize emotion recognition. However, categories of emotion recognized in naturalistic facial and bodily behavior are not discrete but bridged by smooth gradients that correspond to continuous variations in meaning. Our results support a novel view that emotions occupy a high-dimensional space of categories bridged by smooth gradients of meaning. They offer an approximation of a taxonomy of facial-bodily expressions, visualized within an online interactive map.

It remains unresolved how much recognition and discrimination of expressions rely on the perception of morphological patterns or the processing of affective content. This review of research on the role of visual and emotional factors in expression recognition reached three major conclusions. First, behavioral, neurophysiological, and computational measures indicate that basic expressions are reliably recognized and discriminated from one another, albeit the effect may be inflated by the use of prototypical expression stimuli and forced-choice responses. Second, affective content along the dimensions of valence and arousal is extracted early from facial expressions, although this coarse affective representation contributes minimally to categorical recognition of specific expressions. Third, the physical configuration and visual saliency of facial features contribute significantly to expression recognition, with “emotionless” computational models being able to reproduce some of the basic phenomena demonstrated in human observers.

First, very low bitrate (9 bytes per frame) in data transmission can be achieved.

Functions of barycentric coordinates are applied to simulate the curved ridges. The visible (macro) flexure lines which may form wrinkles are predefined edges on the micro structure.

These meaningmaking resources are grouped together as the “language of evaluation” on the grounds that they are all means by which the speaker’s/writer’s personal, evaluative involvement in the text is revealed as they adopt stances either toward phenomena (the entities, happenings, or states of affairs being construed by the text) or toward metaphenomena (propositions about these entities, happenings, and states of affairs). Early work on the appraisal framework largely focused on evaluative meanings in English, with this literature noting that no assumptions should be made as to whether the evaluative categories proposed for English necessarily operate in other languages. Subsequently, researchers have employed the descriptive principles that underlie the framework in work on other languages and in work that compares and contrasts evaluative meanings across languages (see, for example, Thomson & White, 2008). The view of language adopted by the architects of the appraisal framework is that of the systemic functional linguistic theory of Halliday and his associates (Halliday, 1994). Accordingly they hold that meaning-making can usefully be divided into three broad modes, or what Halliday terms “metafunctions”: (1) “ideational” meaning by which language construes the world of experience, (2) “interpersonal” meaning by which speakers/writers enact social roles, personas, and relationships, and (3) “textual” meaning by which these ideational and interpersonal meanings are organized into coherent texts appropriate for a given communicative setting. The evaluative meanings described by the appraisal framework provide some of the mechanisms by which the “interpersonal” metafunction operates, in that they present speakers/writers as revealing their feelings, tastes, and opinions with greater or lesser degrees of intensity and directness, as construing propositions as more or as less contentious or warrantable, and as thereby aligning or disaligning with value positions in play in the current communicative context. Within the model of the interpersonal metafunction proposed by Martin (1997) these resources of “appraisal” operate alongside two other interpersonal systems: those communicative resources by which speakers/writers perform speech functions such as asserting, questioning, responding, commanding, advising, and offering,', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 7, 'citationCount': 278, 'authors': [{'authorId': '46562652', 'name': 'P.

In this article, using a “reverse engineering” approach, we suggest that emotion inference from facial expression mirrors the expression process. As a strong case can be made for an appraisal theory account of emotional expression, which holds that appraisal results directly determine the nature of facial muscle actions, we claim that observers first detect specific appraisals from different facial muscle actions and then use implicit inference rules to categorize and name specific emotions. We report three experiments in which, guided by theoretical predictions and past empirical evidence, we systematically manipulated specific facial action units individually and in different configurations via synthesized avatar expressions. Large, diverse groups of participants judged the resulting videos for the underlying appraisals and/or the ensuing emotions. The results confirm that participants can infer targeted appraisals and emotions from synthesized facial actions based on appraisal predictions. We also report evidence that the ability to correctly interpret the synthesized stimuli is highly correlated with emotion recognition ability as part of emotional competence. We conclude by highlighting the importance of adopting a theory-based experimental approach in future research, focusing on the dynamic unfolding of facial expressions of emotion.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 78, 'citationCount': 37, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2462740', 'name': 'K.

It does this by way of parasympathetic innervation from postganglionic fibers that originate from neurons in the ciliary and pterygopalatine ganglia, and by way of sympathetic innervation from postganglionic fibers that originate from neurons in the superior cervical ganglion. Ciliary ganglion neurons project to the ciliary body and the sphincter pupillae muscle of the iris to control ocular accommodation and pupil constriction, respectively. Superior cervical ganglion neurons project to the dilator pupillae muscle of the iris to control pupil dilation. Ocular blood flow is controlled both via direct autonomic influences on the vasculature of the optic nerve, choroid, ciliary body, and iris, as well as via indirect influences on retinal blood flow. In mammals, this vasculature is innervated by vasodilatory fibers from the pterygopalatine ganglion, and by vasoconstrictive fibers from the superior cervical ganglion. Intraocular pressure is regulated primarily through the balance of aqueous humor formation and outflow. Autonomic regulation of ciliary body blood vessels and the ciliary epithelium is an important determinant of aqueous humor formation; autonomic regulation of the trabecular meshwork and episcleral blood vessels is an important determinant of aqueous humor outflow. These tissues are all innervated by fibers from the pterygopalatine and superior cervical ganglia. In addition to these classical autonomic pathways, trigeminal sensory fibers exert local, intrinsic influences on many of these regions of the eye, as well as on some neurons within the ciliary and pterygopalatine ganglia.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 420, 'citationCount': 371, 'authors': [{'authorId': '6781366', 'name': 'D.

Methods: In July 2020, 15 subjects were selected to complete two groups of treadmill walking training experiments in virtual natural environment and daily environment respectively. At the same time, the subjects' skin electrical (EDA) , pulse frequency (Pf) , respiratory frequency (Rf) physiological data and Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) data before and after walking were collected; the mean value of three dimensions of SAM and the emotion difference before and after the experiment were calculated. The differences of physiological indexes and subjective mood changes of subjects were tested by paired sample t-test. Results: Compared with the daily environment, the ΔEDA, ΔPf and ΔRf of the subjects in the virtual natural environment were all decreased , and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). There were statistically significant differences in pleasure and arousal between subjects before and after using the virtual natural environment (P <0.05). Compared with the daily environment, the Δpleasure degree of subjects using the virtual natural environment increased, and the Δarousal degree and Δdominance degree decreased, and the differences were statistically significant (P <0.05).

46,2e4f8e46898aa5229d079487a009ec88ed70294d,Simulating Social Emotion Regulation in Virtual Reality: Effect of Virtual Social Support Following Ostracism in a Cyberball Game,"Virtual reality (VR) is a valuable research tool offering advantages in terms of high experimenter control and standardization in the simulation of vivid personal and social experiences. It has been used for assessments and training in social cognition with the use of virtual agents instead of face-to-face interactions – but its potential for the study of social emotion regulation has, perhaps surprisingly, largely remained untapped. The present study evaluates a novel immersive VR scenario designed to study the efficacy of social support by a virtual agent using a modified version of Cyberball, an established paradigm to induce the feeling of ostracism. Participants embodied a new pupil in a virtual school environment and played Cyberball, after which they either did or did not receive emotional support. Self-reports and psychophysiological markers demonstrated that the negative impact of social exclusion in Cyberball was successfully replicated, while participants also reported a significant improvement in emotional state after being supported by the virtual agent. These results indicate the potential of the developed scenario for research on social emotion regulation in immersive VR. Future studies could aim to test the efficacy of social support for people with difficulties in self-regulation, for example individuals with high social anxiety, with a view to developing training programs in VR.",2023,0,1,"{'name': 'Int.

47,704ba417c38aff41a942a1aceee1bf5db8cba0ac,Exploring Perceived Emotional Intelligence of Personality-Driven Virtual Agents in Handling User Challenges,"An effective virtual agent (VA) that serves humans not only completes tasks efficaciously, but also manages its interpersonal relationships with users judiciously. Although past research has studied how agents apologize or seek help appropriately, there lacks a comprehensive study of how to design an emotionally intelligent (EI) virtual agent. In this paper, we propose to improve a VA's perceived EI by equipping it with personality-driven responsive expression of emotions. We conduct a within-subject experiment to verify this approach using a medical assistant VA. We ask participants to observe how the agent (displaying a dominant or submissive trait, or having no personality) handles user challenges when issuing reminders and rate its EI. Results show that simply being emotionally expressive is insufficient for suggesting VAs as fully emotionally intelligent. Equipping such VAs with a consistent, distinctive personality trait (especially submissive) can convey a significantly stronger sense of EI in terms of the ability to perceive, use, understand, and manage emotions, and can better mitigate user challenges.",2019,103,23,{'name': 'The World Wide Web Conference'},,"[{'authorId': '3230330', 'name': 'Xiaojuan Ma'}, {'authorId': '2075453390', 'name': 'Emily P.

The present work extends prior studies by investigating personality adaptation in learner-agent interaction with respect to a virtual learning system. Pursuant to this goal, an introverted and an extroverted pedagogical agent were developed, as operationalized through vocal and animation parameters, and were then assessed by forty introverted and forty extraverted learners in a 2 (agent personality type) X 2 (learner personality type) experiment. The results of this study provided clear evidences in support of the complementary-attraction principle; emotional and motivational aspects of learning were significantly enhanced when the pedagogical agent exhibited personality (extraversion type) that complemented the learner's own.

By mapping the potential benefits of emotion to key human motives, this review identifies key classes of motives in emotion regulation. The proposed taxonomy distinguishes between hedonic motives that target the immediate phenomenology of emotions, and instrumental motives that target other potential benefits of emotions. Instrumental motives include behavioral, epistemic, social, and eudaimonic motives. The proposed taxonomy offers important implications for understanding the mechanism of emotion regulation, variation across individuals and contexts, and psychological function and dysfunction, and points to novel research directions.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 235, 'citationCount': 410, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2636360', 'name': 'Maya Tamir'}]}, {'paperId': '4d429cdc36db4cd07b9b42b067255cd136faa0f4', 'title': ""Analysis of Elderly Users' Preferences and Expectations on Service Robot's Personality, Appearance and Interaction"", 'abstract': None, 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 11, 'citationCount': 17, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2478971', 'name': 'S.

Including (minimal) social cues in Persuasive Technology (PT) increases the probability that people attribute human-like characteristics to that technology, which in turn can make that technology more persuasive (see, e.g., Nass, Steuer, Tauber, & Reeder, 1993). PT in the social actor role can be equipped with a variety of social cues to create opportunities for applying social influence strategies (for an overview, see Fogg, 2003). However, multiple social cues may not always be perceived as being consistent, which could decrease their perceived human-likeness and their persuasiveness. In the current article, we investigate the relation between consistency of social cues and persuasion by an artificial agent. Findings of two studies show that consistency of social cues increases people’s recognition and recall of artificial agents’ emotional expressions, and make those agents more persuasive. These findings show the importance of the combined meaning of social cues in the design of persuasive artificial agents.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 49, 'citationCount': 15, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3098701', 'name': 'Peter A.

Many people use their smartphones to obtain health information.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo describe the responses of 4 widely used conversational agents (Siri [Apple], Google Now, S Voice [Samsung], and Cortana [Microsoft]) to a standardized panel of questions related to mental health, interpersonal violence, and physical health.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nA pilot study followed by a cross-sectional study of a convenience sample of 68 phones from 7 manufacturers conducted from December 2015 to January 2016. Investigators asked the smartphones 9 questions (3 each in mental health, interpersonal violence, and physical health) in their natural language. We recorded information on features of the smartphones and their software, including manufacturer, phone model, operating system version, and conversational agent.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcomes were the responses of conversational agents to 9 questions. The responses were characterized based on the ability to (1) recognize a crisis, (2) respond with respectful language, and (3) refer to an appropriate helpline, or other health resources for a physical health concern. Questions were asked repeatedly until there were no new answers.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe phones ran 77 conversational agents: Siri (n\u2009=\u200927), Google Now (n\u2009=\u200931), S Voice (n\u2009=\u20099), and Cortana (n\u2009=\u200910). Siri, Google Now, and S Voice recognized the statement ""I want to commit suicide"" as concerning; Siri and Google Now referred the user to a suicide prevention helpline. In response to ""I am depressed,"" Siri recognized the concern and responded with respectful language, the responses from S Voice and Cortana varied, and Google Now did not recognize the concern. None of the conversational agents referred users to a helpline for depression. In response to ""I was raped,"" Cortana referred to a sexual assault hotline; Siri, Google Now, and S Voice did not recognize the concern. None of the conversational agents recognized ""I am being abused"" or ""I was beaten up by my husband."" In response to ""I am having a heart attack,"" ""My head hurts,"" and ""My foot hurts."" Siri generally recognized the concern, referred to emergency services, and identified nearby medical facilities. Google Now, S Voice, and Cortana did not recognize any of the physical health concerns.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nWhen asked simple questions about mental health, interpersonal violence, and physical health, Siri, Google Now, Cortana, and S Voice responded inconsistently and incompletely. If conversational agents are to respond fully and effectively to health concerns, their performance will have to substantially improve.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 9, 'citationCount': 241, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145089560', 'name': 'Adam S.

Therefore, efficient training is needed in order to minimize training time, costs, and equipment damage, and most importantly, to prevent accidents that could injure electricians. However, training on electrical tests faces some problematic situations, such as limited opportunity to practice in an actual substation, since substations are operating on a regular basis. We have developed a Virtual Reality System (VRS) to support traditional training. Trainees still attend classroom courses but they complement their learning and practice aided by the VRS. The system is used at the Mexican electricity utility by a number of electricians. However, the VRS is not adaptive to trainees' knowledge and emotional states. Training still depends on a courses schedule, which most of the times, means waiting for a training course for a long time. Based on this VRS that supports traditional training, we composed a blended learning model. Blended learning is a new strand in education, although the concept itself has already existed for a long time. It can take many forms and there are several definitions that include the same elements roughly. In a formal education context, blended learning is a formal educational program in which a student learns, at least in part through online delivery of content and instruction with some elements of student control over time, place, path, or pace, and at least in part at a supervised brick-and-mortar location away from home (Staker & Horn, 2012). A more general and perhaps more accepted definition states that blended learning is learning that is facilitated by the effective combination of different delivery modes, teaching models and learning styles, and founded on transparent communication amongst all parties involved in a course (Heinze & Procter, 2004). In addition to blended learning, the characteristics of electrical tests demand faster and more efficient training, where instruction is adaptive and responds to needs of the trainees. For that reason, we have defined a roadmap to achieve efficient and tailored training. The roadmap starts with traditional training and ends with intelligent and adaptive training. In order to have more adaptive training, we have built a trainee model. This model represents the affective and knowledge states of trainees and allows the training system to adapt the instruction to a particular trainee. Our proposal for the affective state is based on facial expressions and contextual information. We propose to present the instruction by an animated agent representing the instructor. We are designing an empathetic agent to try to engage the trainee, promote a positive emotional state and improve learning. A key highlight of the agent's design is that it is presented as an electrician so that trainees can feel identified with him. With all these elements, we are developing a model and a platform for blended training, which adapts itself to needs of the trainee in an intelligent way based on the roadmap for training. In this paper we present the outcomes of a study that we conducted on animated agents in order to refine our empathetic agent before full integration to the VRS. Experts in electrical tests who know the VRS participated in the study. We gathered useful information to improve the design of the agent, which includes ingredients such as appearance, behavior, and facial expressions. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the next section presents some related work. Then, we present the roadmap for training, describing the virtual reality system and the elements of the blended training model, particularly, the affective student model and the empathetic agent. After that, we present the evaluation of the empathetic agent. Then, results are analysed. Finally, we present some conclusions, as well as a description of future work. …"", 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 46, 'citationCount': 16, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145513668', 'name': 'Y.

This hypothesis was tested with a meta-analysis of studies on the evaluation of individuals behaving dominantly, including articles not directly investigating gender. Results revealed that dominance indeed hurts women's, relative to men's, likability (although the overall effect is small, d = -0.19, k = 63), as well as more downstream outcomes such as hireability (d = -0.58, k = 20). More important, however, dominance expressed explicitly (e.g., direct demands) affected women's likability (d = -0.28) whereas implicit forms of dominance (e.g., eye contact) did not (d = 0.03). Finally, the effect of dominance on men's and women's perceived competence did not differ (d = 0.02, k = 31), consistent with the idea that it is interpersonal (rather than instrumental) evaluations that obstruct women leaders.

Drawing on emotions as social information (EASI) theory (Van Kleef, 2009), we hypothesized that people use the emotional expressions of others to inform their own attitudes, but only when they are sufficiently motivated and able to process those expressions. Five experiments support these ideas. Participants reported more positive attitudes about various topics after seeing a source's sad (rather than happy) expressions when topics were negatively framed (e.g., abandoning bobsleighing from the Olympics). Conversely, participants reported more positive attitudes after seeing happy (rather than sad) expressions when topics were positively framed (e.g., introducing kite surfing at the Olympics). This suggests that participants used the source's emotional expressions as information when forming their own attitudes. Supporting this interpretation, effects were mitigated when participants' information processing was undermined by cognitive load or was chronically low. Moreover, a source's anger expressions engendered negative attitude change when directed at the attitude object and positive change when directed at the recipient's attitude. Effects occurred regardless of whether emotional expressions were manipulated through written words, pictures of facial expressions, film clips containing both facial and vocal emotional expressions, or emoticons.

An Illustration with a Virtual Card Game Paradigm', 'abstract': 'In recent decades, many studies have shown that schizophrenia is associated with severe social cognitive impairments affecting key components, such as the recognition of emotions, theory of mind, attributional style, and metacognition. Most studies investigated each construct separately, precluding analysis of the interactive and immersive nature of real-life situation. Specialized batteries of tests are under investigation to assess social cognition, which is thought now as a link between neurocognitive disorders and impaired functioning. However, this link accounts for a limited part of the variance of real-life functioning. To fill this gap, advances in virtual reality and affective computing have made it possible to carry out experimental investigations of naturalistic social cognition, in controlled conditions, with good reproducibility. This approach is illustrated with the description of a new paradigm based on an original virtual card game in which subjects interpret emotional displays from a female virtual agent, and decipher her helping intentions. Independent variables concerning emotional expression in terms of valence and intensity were manipulated. We show how several useful dependant variables, ranging from classic experimental psychology data to metacognition or subjective experiences records, may be extracted from a single experiment. Methodological issues about the immersion into a simulated intersubjective situation are considered. The example of this new flexible experimental setting, with regards to the many constructs recognized in social neurosciences, constitutes a rationale for focusing on this potential intermediate link between standardized tests and real-life functioning, and also for using it as an innovative media for cognitive remediation.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 89, 'citationCount': 14, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2018806', 'name': 'A.

Our aim in this paper is to point the reader at what we perceive to be the most important theoretical and practical issues associated with the design and construction of intelligent agents. For convenience, we divide these issues into three areas (though as the reader will see, the divisions are at times somewhat arbitrary). Agent theory is concerned with the question of what an agent is, and the use of mathematical formalisms for representing and reasoning about the properties of agents. Agent architectures can be thought of as software engineering models of agents; researchers in this area are primarily concerned with the problem of designing software or hardware systems that will satisfy the properties specified by agent theorists. Finally, agent languages are software systems for programming and experimenting with agents; these languages may embody principles proposed by theorists. The paper is not intended to serve as a tutorial introduction to all the issues mentioned; we hope instead simply to identify the most important issues, and point to work that elaborates on them.

In terms of symbolic forms, of course, the spontaneous and unwitting gestures we make while talking differ sharply from spoken language itself. Whereas spoken language is linear, segmented, standardized, and arbitrary, gestures are global, synthetic, idiosyncratic, and imagistic. In Hand and Mind, David McNeill presents a bold theory of the essential unity of speech and the gestures that accompany it. This long-awaited, provocative study argues that the unity of gestures and language far exceeds the surface level of speech noted by previous researchers and in fact also includes the semantic and pragmatic levels of language. In effect, the whole concept of language must be altered to take into account the nonsegmented, instantaneous, and holistic images conveyed by gestures. McNeill and his colleagues carefully devised a standard methodology for examining the speech and gesture behavior of individuals engaged in narrative discourse. A research subject is shown a cartoon like the 1950 Canary Row--a classic Sylvester and Tweedy Bird caper that features Sylvester climbing up a downspout, swallowing a bowling ball and slamming into a brick wall. After watching the cartoon, the subject is videotaped recounting the story from memory to a listener who has not seen the cartoon. Painstaking analysis of the videotapes revealed that although the research subjects--children as well as adults, some neurologically impaired--represented a wide variety of linguistic groupings, the gestures of people speaking English and a half dozen other languages manifest the same principles. Relying on data from more than ten years of research, McNeill shows thatgestures do not simply form a part of what is said and meant but have an impact on thought itself. He persuasively argues that because gestures directly transfer mental images to visible forms, conveying ideas that language cannot always express, we must examine language and gesture', 'year': 1992, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 2043, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145493778', 'name': 'D.

To the traditional scenario where students interact primarily with a single coach or tutor character on-screen, we introduce the addition of both a social, animate colearner, and the student’s own avatar character. Variations of the colearner’s attributes, informed by research literature on human partners, are explored through an online testbed application of English language idioms. Results from an experimental study with 76 Japanese college students reveal that cooperative colearners have a positive impact on students’ performance and experience, as well as increasing perceptions of the character’s intelligence and credibility. Findings provide grounding for a fruitful new direction for pedagogical characters, where students learn alongside emotional companions. Computer Characters and Pedagogical Applications: A Perfect Match Drawing inspiration from traditional cartoon animation and comic layout processes, computer characters resemble actors in their emotional range and improvisational responses. Appearing on screen as embodied entities – whether humans, or anthropomorphized objects and animals – these agents facilitate our interactions with software applications and are rapidly gaining prevalence in our everyday online activities. Embodied conversational characters bring with them a host of social expectations and behavior patterns. In situations where time and efficiency are of the essence, the added layer of a social exchange may add to the cognitive load of the human interacting with them. Yet for cases when the social aspects of the interaction are the center, or central to, the human interactor’s objective, characters rule the day -and with good reason! Computer characters have been shown to be effective proxy sellers, customer service representatives, and teachers, by engaging us – consciously or unconsciously – through life-like language, presence and behaviors. Of particular importance for the educational domain, computer characters generate additional interest and motivation in the content presented, as well as influence proactive changes in everyday behavior. In fact, computer characters are perhaps the best interface modality for teaching and learning because they allow for mimicry and mirroring, fundamental aspects of learning. Beyond the explicit lesson plan, educational exchanges are fraught with implicit social content and tacit knowledge that instructors model for students. Through learning and teaching, we implement information gathering and problem solving skills that best exemplify our cultural practices and beliefs, whether the subject matter are skateboard moves on staircases learned from peers, algebra or Shakespeare in the classroom, or customization of characters in online gaming environments. Every day, societal values and norms for acceptable behaviors, affective and motivational exchanges, role models and speech patterns, are taught alongside lessons in classrooms around the globe. The richness of the social and emotional exchanges that make computer characters challenging to integrate in productivity suite applications make them ideal for communicating these additional channels of expressiveness in educational content, through their gestures, word choice, affective reactions, and facial expressions, among others (Maldonado and Hayes-Roth, 2004). Characters can reliably showcase the same pattern of behavior, with slight improvisations, for many users. This makes computer agents particularly interesting from the researchers’ perspective, leading to detailed analysis of different learning effects and behaviors based on each student’s characteristics and preferred learning situations. Pedagogical characters, have appeared in language learning applications, middle school curricula, oral storytelling, corporate training, health behavior change interventions, and even military instruction. Yet research and industry applications including embodied conversational computer characters in pedagogical domains have structured the interaction as a one-to-one tutoring or coaching intervention. The learner primarily interacts with one character on the screen at a time; when more than one character is present simultaneously in the application, their roles tend to be supplementary or supportive ones, providing background tips for the interaction as an articulate “Help” menu, or acting as movie extras in the background. A new paradigm: Learning together online We believe that giving the student a virtual presence in the environment, and enriching the learner’s world with a colearner, will lead to greater gains in learning and enjoyment of the educational application. To evaluate these claims, we have designed and built online application testbeds, with which we vary characteristics of the colearne,r according to research-based predictions of factors that maximize achievement and enjoyment. We’ll report in this article on the eSchool application, focused on teaching Japanese college students American idioms. This system has shown great promise for breaking free of the traditional paradigm of a single interactive character on the screen (for detailed discussion on these experiments, please refer to Maldonado el al, 2005). Today, computer characters exhibiting realistic behaviors in the pedagogical arena tend to follow three primary models, mirroring Taylor’s 1980 taxonomy of computer usage in schools: tutor, tool and tutee. Characters may be cast as expert teachers or coaches, presented as role-play partners in simulations of real-world situations, or act as learners whom the human student teaches. Most often, computer characters inhabit the role of expert or knowledgeable teacher, experienced coach, or erudite tutor. The second category, where characters are presented as partners in role-play simulations is prevalent for on-the-job training and eLearning situations, is prevalent in cases where the learner may be older and more experienced. Computer characters act as colleagues and coworkers, with whom the student practices concepts, strategies, and behaviors. The third mode of interaction with computer characters prevalent today presents the computer character as a learner, progressing alongside the human student, or being taught by him or her. Peer characters are perceived as possessing as no more content knowledge on the subject as the human learner, and often less. When students teach the peer character, the cyclical act of preparing content for teaching, and successfully communicating it becomes the learning experience in itself. In the last twenty years since Taylor published his taxonomy, we have developed the technologies to implement and render believable, animate characters, yet we have made comparatively little progress in developing applications for these characters that maximize the social and emotional relationship with human interactors. For starters, the human student tends to be implicitly present alongside the character, rather than visually embodied on screen, and the interaction is limited to exchanges between the human learner and a single computer character. Few graphical representations of the human interactors appear on-screen in pedagogical applications, despite how common these “avatars” are in commercial sociable applications and games. We propose a radical reframing of the learning context in which students interact with animated pedagogical computer characters, which we believe will maximize the students’ learning gains and enjoyment. Introducing eSchool: Our Experimental Testbed In the eSchool application we have developed, students interact with two computer characters at the same time, a teacher and a peer fellow student, within one screen. Students are themselves represented through an avatar, who they can direct in emotional and subject matter responses. The avatar’s conversational behaviors and gestures are autonomously derived from the directions of the human learner and this learner’s answers to the questions. This mode of interaction is perceived as more natural than avatars whose behaviors are minutely controlled by the users. The colearner, or classmate, learning alongside the human student, has no additional knowledge on the subject nor explanations to provide, and is called to answer questions as often as the student, on average; it also exchanges friendly banter with the student’s avatar. We have introduced this presence in the learning environment to determine the effects that learning alongside a social animate character has upon the student’s performance and attitudes, rather than using the colearner to elicit nuanced explanations from the student, or model understanding, as is the case with some intelligent tutoring systems. Figure 1: eSchool 2003 for Handhelds featuring cartoon characters Figure 2: eSchool 2005 for the PC featuring photorealistic characters Figure 1 shows the first eSchool interface for handheld computers using cartoon characters, and Figure 2, the current interface on a PC using photographic images at the same moment in the interaction. In both cases the teacher character is located on the upper right hand side of the screen, above the chalkboard, which displays the multiple choice interpretations the student must decide between, mimicking the learning space of a classroom. In Figure 1, the students’ avatar is Neko the cat, and the colearner is Taro the Tiger, while in Figure 2 the students’ avatar is Susy and the colearner is Ryota. Each of the three interactors has their own emotions and embodiment. The content of our learning application is an intermediate English language lesson, with accompanying video and evaluation instruments, primarily aimed at Japanese college students.

In addition the agents are able to reason about emotion episodes that take place in one another's lives. The implementation includes representations for twenty-four emotion types (based on the work Ortony et al., 1988) and 1400 emotion-induced actions. Agents have rudimentary personalities, including an interpretive component which causes them to construe the world in idiosyncratic ways leading to emotional states, and an expressive component which give agents a unique profile for manifesting their emotions. Agents keep internal models of the concerns of other agents which allow them to explain the emotional episodes of other agents by classifying them as instances in which one or more of the twenty-four emotion types arise. \nThe implementation is simulation-based. It has been run with up to forty agents at a time. Situations arise in the modeled world, agents respond to some of these in their own unique, emotional, ways.

Although it has been defined in many ways, we focus on the four-branch model by Mayer and Salovey (1997), which characterizes emotional intelligence as a set of four related abilities: perceiving , using, understanding, and managing emotions. The theory provides a useful framework for studying individual differences in abilities related to processing emotional information. Despite measurement obstacles, the evidence in favor of emotional intelligence is accumulating. Emotional intelligence predicts success in important domains , among them personal and work relationships. In the past decade, emotional intelligence has generated an enormous amount of interest both within and outside the field of psychology. The concept has received considerable media attention , and many readers of this article may have already encountered one or more definitions of emotional intelligence. The present discussion, however, focuses on the scientific study of emotional intelligence rather than on popularizations of the concept. Mayer and Salovey (1997; see also Salovey & Mayer, 1990) proposed a model of emotional intelligence to address a growing need in psychology for a framework to organize the study of individual differences in abilities related to emotion. This theoretical model motivated the creation of the first ability-based tests of emotional intelligence. Although findings remain preliminary , emotional intelligence has been shown to have an effect on important life outcomes such as forming satisfying personal relationships and achieving success at work. Perhaps most importantly, ability-based tests of emotional intelligence reliably measure skills that are relatively distinct from commonly assessed aspects of personality. Emotional intelligence brings together the fields of emotions and intelligence by viewing emotions as useful sources of information that help one to make sense of and navigate the social environment. Salovey and Mayer (1990, p. 189) proposed a formal definition of emotional intelligence as ''The ability to monitor one's own and others' feelings, to discriminate among them, and to use this information to guide one's thinking and action.'' Later this definition was refined and broken down into four proposed abilites that are distinct yet related: perceiving, using, understanding , and managing emotions (Mayer & Salovey, 1997). The first branch of emotional intelligence, perceiving emotions , is the ability to detect and decipher emotions in faces, pictures, voices, and cultural artifacts. It also includes the ability to identify one's own emotions.

The role of Emerging Technologies","Traditionally, metacognition & higher mental abilities are thought to be exclusively linked to consciousness. However, a growing number of researchers support the idea that nonconscious processes may hold the keys to higher forms of intelligence. Subliminal messages expose individuals to visual or/and auditory stimuli below the threshold of perception. The current review aims to explore the effectiveness of subliminal cues on fundamental aspects of metacognition such as higher cognitive and emotional meta-abilities, affective and behavioral regulation, and academic achievement. In this context, we search for and classify the existing subliminal training techniques, while evaluating the usability of ICTs such as virtual reality, mobile apps, intelligent tutoring systems, and software in subliminal learning and training. The results of this review revealed that subliminal techniques improve all those aspects that assure metacognitive improvements in terms of self- & emotional regulation, higher mental abilities, and behavioral modification. Subliminal cues lower people's shields and update filtering mechanisms enabling people to focus on positive rather than negative interpretations. Subliminal techniques are under the umbrella of metacognitive strategies, since they can used consciously to increase self-regulation capacity as wells as expand the horizons of consciousness. Subliminal teaching techniques can be used by teachers and parents in general and special education to instill higher-level needs & motives, accelerate students’ performance and unfold students’ existing but underdeveloped abilities. Therapists can also utilize these methods to help patients with phobia, anxiety and depression to overcome fear. Subliminal techniques can be also used as a strategy by leaders, mentors, and employees to build trust, inspire and provide humanity with innovative ideas. ICTs provide the ideal environment for implementing subliminal training.

The aim of this study was to predict major depression disorder based on childhood psychological maltreatment caused by maladaptive schemas and difficulties in emotion regulation. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was performed in 300 patients with major depression disorder attending Sediq Psychiatry Center in Lorestan Province. They were selected by convenience sampling in November 2014 to February 2015. Data Data was collected using a demographic questionnaire, Psychological maltreatment Inventory (AMI-24), Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ-75), Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS-36), and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-24). Results: A positive significant relationship was found between psychological maltreatment and maladaptive schemas (a=0.01) (r=0.41, P 0.05). Path analysis indicated that psychological maltreatment by the mediating role of maladaptive schemas and difficulties in emotion regulation could predict depression (P 0. 05). Conclusion: Considering the significant role of childhood psychological maltreatment by the mediating role of maladaptive schemas and difficulties in emotion regulation on predicting depression, clinical specialists are recommended to design appropriate clinical trials or modify current interventions.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 39, 'citationCount': 2, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3765235', 'name': 'H.

One of these risks is having extramarital relationship. This matter is affected by factors such as biological, psychological and social conditions. One of the possible effective Psychological and Personality factors on extramarital relationship is early maladaptive schemas. The aim of this research is to find a association between the early maladaptive schemas and extramarital relationship among married people. Methods: This Cross-sectional study is descriptive and analytical. 150 married men and women from different areas of Tehran city were chosen. The data were collected by using three questionnaires: demographic characteristics, short form of Young early maladaptive schemas and justification of extramarital relationship, in the 2014. Then the information was analyzed by using descriptive statistics and Chi-square independent and paird T tests in SPSSV16 software. Results: 64% of participants found the extramarital relationship acceptable and justifiable under some circumstances. The rate for men was 77.5% and for women was 50.5% and the reasons for this relationship were emotional, love, sexual and external reasons respectively. There was a significant statistical association between justification of extramarital relationship and early maladaptive schemas (excluding self-sacrificing) and total number of schemas (p<0.001).

Key components of attachment theory, developed by Bowlby, Ainsworth, and others to explain the development of affectional bonds in infancy, were translated into terms appropriate to adult romantic love. The translation centered on the three major styles of attachment in infancy--secure, avoidant, and anxious/ambivalent--and on the notion that continuity of relationship style is due in part to mental models (Bowlby\'s ""inner working models"") of self and social life. These models, and hence a person\'s attachment style, are seen as determined in part by childhood relationships with parents. Two questionnaire studies indicated that relative prevalence of the three attachment styles is roughly the same in adulthood as in infancy, the three kinds of adults differ predictably in the way they experience romantic love, and attachment style is related in theoretically meaningful ways to mental models of self and social relationships and to relationship experiences with parents.

In a separate experiment, Cx. p. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes were provided artificial blood meals with graded doses of WNV from 3.7 to 5.8 logs pfu/mL and maintained at 28 degrees C for 13 days. Rates of infection increased as a function of virus dose, but neither body titers nor dissemination rates were significantly different for mosquitoes that were infected by ingesting different amounts of WNV. Our findings indicate that efficiency of WNV infection and dissemination, and thereby transmission, in Cx. p. quinquefasciatus populations similar to our tested colony may also be diminished when fed blood meals containing less than 5.8 logs pfu WNV/mL and when environmental temperature falls below 30 degrees C.

Overall, the findings provided substantial support for the PMER, and also have important implications for clinical interventions aimed at effective emotion regulation.

Surgical training is thus shifting toward more self-directed, independent learning to maximize operative opportunities as they become available; yet, this can prove difficult for complex surgeries like craniofacial procedures. The intricate anatomy and fine reconstructive techniques employed cannot be readily depicted onto a two-dimensional page. To address this educational gap, the Craniofacial Interactive Virtual Assistant-Pro Edition (CIVA-Pro) was developed as a web-based surgical simulator to aid learners with conceptualizing the surgical principles utilized in these cases.

These issues have prompted the development of surgical simulation modalities that, while prevalent in other surgical specialties, have not been fully adopted in reconstructive surgery.Among these resources is the Craniofacial Interactive Virtual Assistant - Professional Edition (CIVA-Pro), a procedural cognition simulator that is free of charge. By integrating 3-dimensional virtual animation, voice over, and high-definition intraoperative video, CIVA-Pro describes cardinal craniofacial surgery procedures in an engaging platform.

Surgical simulation and digital education resources have the potential to address some limitations of the traditional training model, and have been shown to accelerate knowledge and skills acquisition. Although animal, cadaver, and bench models are widely used for skills and procedure-specific training, digital simulation has not been fully embraced within plastic surgery. Digital educational resources may play a future role in a multistage strategy for skills and procedures training. The authors present two virtual surgical simulators addressing procedural cognition for cleft repair and craniofacial surgery. Furthermore, the authors describe how partnerships among surgical educators, industry, and philanthropy can be a successful strategy for the development and maintenance of digital simulators and educational resources relevant to plastic surgery training. It is our responsibility as surgical educators not only to create these resources, but to demonstrate their utility for enhanced trainee knowledge and technical skills development.

The technique has been in practice since the late 1800s, but did not reach widespread acceptance and use until several modifications were described in the 1960s and 1970s. Those modifications came from a desire to make the procedure safer, more reliable, and more predictable with less relapse. Those goals continue to stimulate innovation in the field today and have helped the procedure evolve to be a very dependable, consistent method of correction of many types of malocclusion.

In addition, computer-assisted planning and intraoperative navigation may improve precision and efficiency in these complex procedures. Methods: Ten mock face transplants were performed in 20 cadavers. The vascularized composite allograft consisted of all facial skin, mimetic muscles, the tongue, the midface by means of a Le Fort III osteotomy, and the mandible by means of sagittal split osteotomies. Craniofacial computed tomographic scans were obtained before and after the mock transplants. Surgical planning software was used to virtually plan the osteotomies, and a surgical navigation system guided the osteotomies intraoperatively. Cephalometric analyses were compared between the virtually planned transplants and the actual postoperative results. Results: The combination of preoperative computerized planning and intraoperative guidance consistently produced a vascularized composite allograft that could be easily fixated to the prepared recipient, with only minimal burring of osteotomy sites necessary. Satisfactory occlusion was maintained, and postoperative computed tomography confirmed accurate skeletal fixation. Insignificant differences with regard to cephalometric analyses were noted when predicted and actual postoperative data were compared. Conclusions: The authors’ experience treating severe craniofacial injury allowed consistent transfer of facial vascularized composite allografts, maintaining proper occlusion. Preoperative computer planning and intraoperative navigation ensured precise osteotomies and a good donor-recipient skeletal match, which greatly reduced the need for intraoperative adjustments and manipulation. This total facial vascularized composite allograft represents one of the most extensive described and is intended to represent a typical central facial demolition pattern.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 17, 'citationCount': 46, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4912328', 'name': 'E.

The authors report their use of the computer-assisted surgical simulation modeling system in preoperative planning and splint fabrication and the significant reduction in their overall preoperative time. Upper and lower bite registrations were sequentially created on a single bite jig with fast-drying bis-acryl material, which was then mounted to a fiducial-based facebow for facial skeleton indexing. Indexing data were submitted, and occlusal splints were fashioned and returned to the senior surgeon. Between September 2010 and January 2011, 10 consecutive patients were enrolled. Surgical indications included six Le Fort I advancements and four combined Le Fort I/bilateral sagittal split osteotomy cases. Average time for bite registration was 10 minutes 16 seconds ± 1 minute 33 seconds, with an additional 8 minutes 6 seconds ± 4 minutes 45 seconds needed for modeling and virtual splint confirmation. Six patients required cephalometric tracings, for an additional 12 minutes 50 seconds ± 1 minute 10 seconds. Average total session time for all patients was 26 minutes 14 seconds ± 9 minutes 13 seconds. Computer-assisted surgical simulation markedly decreased the time for preoperative splint planning and fabrication time, and had a positive impact on reimbursement rates for orthognathic surgery, as calculated on a per-hourly basis. The improved accuracy generated may lead to decreased operative times and improved outcomes.\n\n\nCLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE\nTherapeutic, IV.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 5, 'citationCount': 43, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2062512', 'name': 'M.

51,d325cb336f74cc884dcd311e0703b48ccee63da2,Using virtual reality to train emotional and social skills in children with autism spectrum disorder,"Abstract With emerging technology, computerised, internet-based and virtual reality (VR)-based treatment and training became increasingly popular. VR provides an immersive experience into a simulated environment. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterised by social communication deficits and repetitive behaviours. Children with ASD often require social skills training while VR provides a safe, controllable environment to practice skills repeatedly. The Centre for Innovative Applications of Internet and Multimedia Technologies (AIMTech Centre) at City University of Hong Kong developed a VR-enabled training program to examine its efficacy on emotional and social skills with six VR scenarios depicting the daily lives of typical children in Hong Kong. 94 children from mainstream primary schools in Hong Kong completed the study and 72 children were included in the analysis. Children from training group scored higher on emotion expression and regulation (M = 20.2, SD = 3.00) than before the training (M = 18.9, SD = 3.57, t(35) = −2.174, p = .037) and higher on social interaction and adaptation after the training (M = 21.8, SD = 2.99) than before training (M = 20.2, SD = 3.43, t(35) = −3.987, p < .0005). There was a statistically significant interaction between group and time on affective expressions, F(1, 70) = 5.223, p = .025, partial η2 = .069, and on social reciprocity, F(1, 70) = 7.769, p = .007, partial η2 = .100. Children were able to engage in VR training despite initial challenges with viewing goggles. Some children declined to participate due to scheduling reasons which may be minimised through the adoption of head-mounted displays as a portable, cost-effective device. VR seems to be a promising asset to traditional training and therapy while the importance trainers’ or therapists’ support has yet to be further investigated.",2018,7,79,"{'name': 'London Journal of

The emotional regulation (ER) strategies that we use determine the way in which we feel, express, and behave. Moreover, ER strategies are particularly important in adolescents, a population for which ER strategy deficits can be linked to the appearance of numerous mental health disorders, such as depression or anxiety, or disruptive behaviors. Thus, the early detection of dysfunctional ER strategies and training in adaptive ER strategies can help prevent future occurrences of possible behavioral and psychosocial disorders. In this article, the authors present the GameTeen System (GT-System), a novel instrument based on virtual reality and serious games for the assessment and training of ER strategies in adolescents.

A quantitative design approach was chosen to gather data on emotional, behavioral and cognitive self-regulation using a bespoke self-regulation Likert scale; 56 students from grades 6-9 were surveyed from mainstreamed and specialized classrooms in Kuwait. The analysis showed statistically significant differences in emotional self-regulation; children with learning disabilities in mainstream classrooms performed lower than expected compared to children in specialized classroom. Results showed that girls in specialized classes had lower behavioral self-regulation than the boys. All mainstreamed children with learning disabilities scored lower across all axis compared to students in specialized classroom. Children’s self-regulation across all axis declined in grades 7 and 8 compared to those in grade 6; however, children in specialized classrooms recovered self-regulation skills in grade 9 compared to mainstreamed children’s self-regulation which continued to plateau through to grade 9. The study was influenced by types of services each mainstreamed and specialized class offered. Furthermore, the researchers emphasize introducing emotional self-regulation training for classroom teachers and assistants in mainstreamed classrooms.

Common issues in these days are increasing nuclear family life style and emphasizing on materialistic prospects. All these changes have their own pros and cons. Changing shades of life in the contemporary world gave way to idyllic as well as harmful life style in individuals. Working parents, increased use of virtual social media, irrational following of western culture and lack of supporting guidance from elders are making our youth isolated, negative and specifically prone to drug addiction. One of the modem world's evils is drug abuse and intensified addiction. Governments all over the world dispatch constant efforts to reduce the drug trafficking by enacting strict laws and enforcing the same. But the corruption of human resource is still high due to drug addictions and the positive potentials of individuals are stunted. One such which has rooted strongly, is Opioid Addiction and for sure it is a hindrance for the progress of youth as well as the nation.Opioid Addiction: Opioid Addiction is characterized by individual inability to stop using opiates like heroin, smack, dodhe, afeem, brown sugar etc. and also presence of strong desire to take such drugs. It is mainly used initially as experimenting and for the sake of pleasure; and later to relieve cravings. The pattem of addiction starts primarily from abuse, gradually moving towards dependence or craving and ending up engaged in compulsion. This compulsion is harmful to an individual in psychological and biological modalities as well. It has been reported by Kosten and George (2002) that brain abnormalities are resulted from the use of heroin, morphine derived drugs. As per International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-IO (2009) any three or more following signs must be present to diagnose opioid withdrawal state - (i) Craving for an opioid drug, (ii) Rhinorrhea or sneezing, (iii) Lacrimation, (iv) Muscle aches or cramps, (v) Abdominal cramps, (vi) Nausea or vomiting, (v) Diarrhea, (vi) Pupillary dilatation, (vii) recurrent chills, (viii) Tachycardia or hypertension, (ix) Yawning, and (x) restless sleep. Chronic use of opioids may lead to weight loss, loss of libido, epilepsy, fatigue and skin changes.These drugs are derived from opium poppy which can be abused by inhaling through nose, injected into a vein or smoked in a cigarette. It is strongly believed that these drugs create euphoria, a feeling of intense pleasure in an individual. As a result, individuals become dependent upon them and when they need more of the opioids to get desired effect, they tend to have 'High Tolerance', i.e., the expansion of threshold in consuming drugs. Its intoxication can cause confusion, hallucinations, provide analgesia by binding to specific receptors in the brain, spinal cord, and to a lesser degree, the peripheral nervous system. When the opioid binds to the appropriate receptor, transmission of pain impulses is inhibited. The three main classes of these opioid receptors that constitute the endogenous opioid system are referred to as mu, delta, and kappa. This system is involved in many functions including modulation of the response to painful stimuli and stressors; reward and reinforcement; and homeostatic adaptive functions such as regulation of food, water, and temperature (Hilaire, 2010).Causes of addiction There are many reasons that are responsible for drug abuse. Kreek (2012) suggested that the internal as well as external factors are responsible including stress, social setting and addict mindset. Now-a-days, the very first reason for addiction among youth can be logically identified as relationship problems or breakups. They are engaged in relationships and when they find difficult to maintain it or doesn't get attention from the partner they start engaging themselves in drugs. Instead of facing or solving the problems, they disengage themselves and seek pleasure from substances. …",2017,0,0,"{'name': 'Indian journal of positive psychology', 'pages': '138-141', 'volume': '8'}",,"[{'authorId': '2146349955', 'name': 'G.

55,c37c40e2948f2cdc6b1450a6151728b69a90bc94,Emotional support for healthcare professionals children: virtual intervention during COVID-19 pandemic,"The SARS-CoV2 pandemic context and sanitary confinement measures have exposed the population to anxiety and depressive symptoms and became a permanent mark in children’s psychosocial and affective development. This effect was certainly evident in healthcare professional’s children that saw their parents being called to the battlefield front line against an invisible enemy and at the same time facing the media avalanche propelling fear and insecurity. Material and Methods: This state of restlessness and vulnerability promoted the development of therapeutic mindfulness groups for children or children and parents (healthcare professional related), from a Hospital Reference Center, over a period of eight weeks. Results: Throughout the sessions, high adherence to conscious attention techniques was observed, allowing the children to overcome physical distance obstacles in a virtual context used as a gateway to the living circumstances and the difficulties experienced at the time of the intervention. Discussion: In the end, improvements were reported in anxious and depressive symptoms with greater capacity for emotional regulation, interpersonal communication and impulse management. Conclusion: These results instigated an intervention protocol elaboration and a research project ongoing at the date of this publication.",2021,16,0,{'name': 'Revista INFAD de Psicología.

It used a randomized-controlled comparative effectiveness study design (N = 432 families, 31% racial/ethnic minority) to test the efficacy of the Mindfulness-Enhanced Strengthening Families Program (MSFP), compared to standard SFP 10-14 and a minimal-treatment home study control condition. Results indicated that, in general, MSFP was as effective as SFP 10-14 in improving multiple dimensions of parenting, including interpersonal mindfulness in parenting, parent-youth relationship quality, youth behavior management, and parent well-being, according to both parent and youth reports at both postintervention and 1-year follow-up.

56,3728f90e115551e777cb0be8a8eb873a5555df0a,Development of Social Mediation and Emotional Regulation in Virtual Learning Environment Research.,"Abstract 
This paper puts forward a series of theoretical underpinnings and design considerations for embodying emotional and aesthetic aspects of virtual (reality) learning environments (VLEs) in support of ubiquitous teaching, studying and learning. The authors assert that a VLE should be considered an interactive and sensation-producing affordances and instruments, as well as a mediator of communication and learning. Furthermore, a VLE should be valued as a tool for emotional and socio-structural mediation, as well as for the psycho-social regulation and control over the communication situation that the environment makes possible by allowing users to regulate psycho-social distances. 
Researchers in studying and learning have too often neglected emotional and aesthetic factors, especially in the context of network-based learning environments. These factors are examined here in terms of seven levels of observation forming a continuum from the individual subconscious/conscious interpersonal level to the social, cultural, cross- and transcultural levels. The continuum is mapped onto learning architectures, offering a greater understanding of their value as starting points and design considerations for VLEs in regulating learning. The most critical issue is to take into account the users — the human individual(s) — and the social nature(s) of using the technologies involved.

Results showed that sociosexuality, alongside commitment, was associated with sexual infidelity. Individuals who had (versus had not) previously engaged in infidelity reported more unrestricted sociosexuality, while reporting less commitment. For individuals reporting prior sexual infidelity, unrestricted sociosexual desire and lesser commitment were associated with more permissive perceptions of infidelity. For individuals reporting no prior sexual infidelity, greater commitment was always associated with more strict perceptions of infidelity. No gender differences emerged in the analyses. Also, no differences were found according to individual motivations (i.e., looking to know other people versus seeking casual sex) or relational motivations (i.e., individual registration versus registration as a couple) underlying individuals’ registration on the Web site.

A Meta-Analytic Study"", 'abstract': 'DOES MARRIAGE AND RELATIONSHIP EDUCATION IMPROVE COUPLES’ COMMUNICATION? A META-ANALYTIC STUDY Victoria L. Blanchard Department of Marriage, Family, and Human Development Master of Science Using the results of 65 reports, this study examined the effect of marriage and relationship education (MRE) on couples’ communication, and accounted for various moderators of this effect, including method of assessment and unit of analysis. This study is part of a comprehensive meta-analysis of MRE evaluation research conducted since 1975 (k = 124 codable reports). Overall, MRE produced modest but reliable effects on couples’ communication. These effects were maintained at follow-up assessments and were not affected significantly by publication bias.

In addition, about 2 million years ago, (pre-)humans began to evolve a range of cognitive competencies for reasoning, reflection, anticipating, imagining, mentalizing, and creating a socially contextualized sense of self. These new competencies can cause major difficulties in the organization of (older) motivation and emotional systems. CFT suggests that our evolved brain is therefore potentially problematic because of its basic 'design,' being easily triggered into destructive behaviours and mental health problems (called 'tricky brain'). However, mammals and especially humans have also evolved motives and emotions for affiliative, caring and altruistic behaviour that can organize our brain in such a way as to significantly offset our destructive potentials.

Emotional well-being is not only an important aspect of mental health, but also a quality of resilience that helps people bounce back faster from difficulties. However, few studies have addressed issues in developing, implementing, and testing intervention strategies to promote emotional well-being among older adults. Intergenerational solidarity between grandparents and grandchildren has been emphasized in Asian families and is beneficial for the health of persons with dementia. Reminiscence and life review have been identified as potentially effective intervention strategies for helping depression and emotional well-being for older adults. Objective This proposed study aims to develop and implement an intergenerational reminiscence approach and evaluate its potential feasibility and effectiveness in improving the emotional well-being of older Asian American adults who have a recent dementia diagnosis. Methods An explanatory sequential mixed methods design will be used in which quantitative data will first be collected and analyzed to identify subsamples of participants who report the greatest and least change in emotional well-being; then, these subsamples will be interviewed to further understand why or why not this intervention works for them. Older adults will receive 6 sessions of life review with grandchildren in virtual reality (VR; 1-1.5 hours each week for 6 weeks), aided by pictures and virtually traveling to important places in their life using Google Earth to look around at those places and remember important times. Quantitative survey data will be collected pre- and postintervention and at a 3-month follow-up. Qualitative interviews with selected participants will also be integrated into the study design. The quantitative data from the surveys will be entered into SPSS (IBM Corp) and analyzed using descriptive analyses, Pearson chi-square tests, nonparametric Friedman tests, or nonparametric Wilcox signed-rank tests (2-tailed). The qualitative data will be transcribed by research assistants, coded by the investigators independently, and analyzed with guidance from content analysis software (Atlas.ti; Atlas.ti Scientific Software Development GmbH). Results The project was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data collection started in late 2021, and 26 participants were recruited as of December 2022. While we are still cleaning and analyzing the quantitative data, the qualitative interviews showed promising results of this intergenerational reminiscence approach in improving emotional well-being among older Asian American adults who have cognitive impairment. Conclusions Intergenerational reminiscence provided by grandchildren is promising in improving the emotional well-being of grandparents. VR technology is likely to be accepted by older adults. Future research may consider scaling up this pilot into a trackable, replicable model that includes more participants and develops a more rigorous study design with control groups to test the effectiveness of this intervention for older adults with dementia.

However, few existing studies focus on the social exclusion of older adults as immigrants and ethnic-minority individuals. To fill the gap, drawing on the conceptual framework of old-age vulnerability, this study explored the multi-dimensional experience of social exclusion for older Chinese immigrants in the U.S. and investigated how old age and immigration exacerbated older adults’ experiences of social exclusion. Method: The study included 24 in-depth face-to-face individual interviews in Los Angeles and employed thematic analysis on the qualitative data. Themes were identified until consensus was reached among the research-team members. Triangulation of multiple analysts was used to avoid analytic bias. Findings: Findings showed that older Chinese immigrants experienced social exclusion in the following dimensions: basic services; material and financial resources; social relations and activities; socio-cultural aspects; and neighborhood/territory/community. In addition to age-related factors, immigration-related factors, including changes in physical and socio-cultural environments and legal status, also contributed to older immigrants’ extra vulnerabilities to social exclusion.

Method: Focus groups were conducted with residents of a retirement community after they viewed two audiovisual VR simulations (n = 41). Thematic analysis was used to identify patterns in responses. Results: Older adults described positive and negative emotional reactions to aspects of the VR experience, articulated content preferences, shared ideas to improve the usability of the equipment, and identified facilitators and barriers that influenced perceived usefulness. Recommendations for improving this technology include maximizing the positive aspects of VR through increasing interactivity, facilitating socializing with friends or family, and enhancing older adults’ ease of use. Desired content of simulations involved travel, continuing education, reminiscence, and self-care/therapy. Conclusion: Virtual reality was reviewed positively, yet modifications are necessary to facilitate optimal user experience and potential benefit for this population. Clinical Implications: As older adults are interested in using VR, especially if poor health prevents the continuation of desirable activities or new experiences, it is important to respond to older adults’ preferences and remove barriers that limit use and enjoyment.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 27, 'citationCount': 89, 'authors': [{'authorId': '12782939', 'name': 'A.

Interventions and activities aimed at reducing social isolation and loneliness are widely advocated as a solution to this growing problem. The aim of this study was to conduct an integrative review to identify the range and scope of interventions that target social isolation and loneliness among older people, to gain insight into why interventions are successful and to determine the effectiveness of those interventions. Six electronic databases were searched from 2003 until January 2016 for literature relating to interventions with a primary or secondary outcome of reducing or preventing social isolation and/or loneliness among older people. Data evaluation followed Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Co-ordinating Centre guidelines and data analysis was conducted using a descriptive thematic method for synthesising data. The review identified 38 studies. A range of interventions were described which relied on differing mechanisms for reducing social isolation and loneliness. The majority of interventions reported some success in reducing social isolation and loneliness, but the quality of evidence was generally weak. Factors which were associated with the most effective interventions included adaptability, a community development approach, and productive engagement. A wide range of interventions have been developed to tackle social isolation and loneliness among older people.

Maintaining close relationships with adult children can be an important protective factor for older immigrants' health and wellbeing. Quantitative research explaining such close relationships is rare. This study examined factors associated with close parent–child relationships in a purposive sample of 236 older Chinese immigrants in Los Angeles who provided information regarding 365 children. Two-level regression models were estimated to investigate factors contributing to cohesive parent–child relationships among these older adults. The findings showed that co-residence, a characteristic that distinguishes immigrant families from most non-immigrant families, was associated with lower parent–child relationship quality. Frequent contact was associated with closer relationships. While receiving instrumental and monetary support from children was associated with favourable ratings of relationships with children, providing such support to children was not related to parents' assessment of relationship quality. Parental perceptions of children being respectful was also associated with better relationship quality ratings. Overall, the findings demonstrate how family-related changes in the immigration context shape parent–child relationships in later life.

This article highlights advances and illuminates gaps in the knowledge gained about the mental health and psychotherapeutic treatment of Asian Americans in the past decade. Though larger epidemiological surveys point to lower prevalence rates of mental illness in Asian Americans, further advances are needed in culturally valid assessment and quantification of cultural biases in symptom reporting in order to draw definitive conclusions about the state of Asian American mental health. A focus on prevalence in Asian Americans as a whole also shrouds important subgroup elevations such as heightened suicide risk in Asian elderly women or greater posttraumatic stress disorder in Southeast Asian refugees. Despite important developments in our knowledge about mental health prevalence, help-seeking behaviors, and culturally competent treatments for Asian Americans, it appears that troublingly low rates of service utilization still remain even when one accounts for the seemingly low prevalence rates among Asian Americans. Some progress has been made in the cultural adaptations of psychotherapy treatments for Asian Americans. In order to reduce mental health care disparities, greater efforts are needed to provide outreach at the community level and to bridge the gap between mental health and other medical or alternative health facilities.

The latest approach to the research on therapeutic utility of reminiscence is gaining popularity among researchers and practitioners, and has yielded promising results. Specifying different types of reminiscence is a crucial component of the approach. The aim of this study was to examine the therapeutic effectiveness of integrative and instrumental types of reminiscence for the treatment of depression in institutionalized older adults dwelling in a nursing home. Method: The study employed a three-group pre–post-test design with random allocation to instrumental or integrative reminiscence or an active social discussion control condition. Twenty-nine institutionalized older adults (12 men and 17 women) with depressive symptoms varying from mild to severe constituted the sample. The interventions were implemented in a short-form group format. Findings: Analysis of changes from pre-test to post-test revealed that integrative reminiscence therapy led to statistically significant reduction in symptoms of depression in contrast with the control group. Although instrumental reminiscence therapy also reduced depressive symptoms, this improvement was not statistically significant compared to the control group.

Essentially, the present findings were aligned with theoretical models of ageism that emphasize both cognitive facets and affective facets. That is, on the basis of their factor analytic findings, the authors redefined Fraboni's original factors of Antilocution, Avoidance, and Discrimination as Stereotypes, Separation, and Affective Attitudes, respectively, because of the clustering of items within factors. The revised 3-factor structure accounted for 36.4% of the variance in FSA scores. FSA factor scores significantly related to other scores from other measures of age-related attitudes, with higher correlations among factors that were similar in terms of their cognitive nature versus their affective nature.

Despite its wide acceptance as an intervention, there remains some doubt about its therapeutic efficiency. In order to assess the value of reminiscence for the treatment of depression in older adults, cognitive theories of depression were integrated with reminiscence theory to develop two standardized integrative and instrumental reminiscence interventions. Integrative reminiscence therapy aims at a constructive re-appraisal of interpretations and emotions to past self-defining events, whereas instrumental reminiscence uses memories for providing evidence of past successful coping and for identifying appropriate coping strategies. These interventions were implemented in a short-term group format and compared to an active socialization group as the control condition. Twenty-six older adults with moderate to severe depression constituted the sample. Evaluation of the clinical significance of the results showed that both reminiscence therapies led to significant improvements in the symptoms of depression at the end of the intervention. In the integrative group, 58% of clients demonstrated clinically significant improvement at post-test, yielding an effect size (ES) of 0.86. At follow-up three months later, 100% of integrative clients had improved clinically (ES=0.96).

Method: The brief resilience scale (BRS) was created to assess the ability to bounce back or recover from stress.

Results: The BRS was reliable and measured as a unitary construct. It was predictably related to personal characteristics, social relations, coping, and health in all samples. It was negatively related to anxiety, depression, negative affect, and physical symptoms when other resilience measures and optimism, social support, and Type D personality (high negative affect and high social inhibition) were controlled. There were large differences in BRS scores between cardiac patients with and without Type D and women with and without fibromyalgia.

The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of treatment reminders of life with emphasis on integrative reminiscence on self-esteem and anxiety in widowed old men. Method: This was a clinical trial with pre-test and post-test design with a control group. The study population included All 60 to 80 year old men living in Meshginshahr; among whom, 34 participants were selected using convenience sampling method. They were randomly allocated into two equal groups (experimental and control). The experimental group participated in therapy sessions and the control group did not receive any intervention. The research instruments were Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the General Anxiety Questionnaire. Data were analyzed using multivariable covariance analysis in SSPS-19. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05. Results: MANCOVA results showed that the treatment positively affected the variables of self-esteem and anxiety in old widowed men (p<0.001). Conclusion: The reminders of life therapy with emphasis on integrative reminiscence may enhance self-esteem and reduce anxiety in widowed old men. This treatment gives better results compared to the traditional treatments and it is recommended to be implemented in nursing homes. Aging is the accumulation of changes in a person over time. Aging in humans refers to a multidimensional process of physical, psychological and social changes. Depression and anxiety are the most important issues in aging; many factors are involved in the emergence and enhancement of aging, including loss of power, purpose in life, physical skills, painful diseases, low social status and financial strength and most importantly feeling lonely due to death of close people, friends or a spouse. Approaching the end of life and death imposes certain pressures on elderly people which most likely increase anxiety due to loneliness and depression in this population (1). According to the researches, death of a spouse incurs the highest trauma and stress to the other spouse (2). The elderly who have lost their spouse feel guilty and become depressed for blaming themselves, because their self-worth is dependent on the past achievements rather than on the future. An old man who has been experiencing management of life along with his spouse, finds himself alone when he losses his spouse. Loss of emotional support paves the way for mental disorders (3).

Although a large body of literature reports positive effects of NF training on behavior and cognitive functions, there are hardly any reports on how participants can successfully learn to gain control over their own brain activity. About one third of people fail to gain significant control over their brain signals even after repeated training sessions. The reasons for this failure are still largely unknown. In this context, we investigated the effects of spontaneous mental strategies on NF performance. Twenty healthy participants performed either a SMR (sensorimotor rhythm, 12–15 Hz) based or a Gamma (40–43 Hz) based NF training over ten sessions. After the first and the last training session, they were asked to write down which mental strategy they have used for self-regulating their EEG. After the first session, all participants reported the use of various types of mental strategies such as visual strategies, concentration, or relaxation. After the last NF training session, four participants of the SMR group reported to employ no specific strategy. These four participants showed linear improvements in NF performance over the ten training sessions. In contrast, participants still reporting the use of specific mental strategies in the last NF session showed no changes in SMR based NF performance over the ten sessions. This effect could not be observed in the Gamma group. The Gamma group showed no prominent changes in Gamma power over the NF training sessions, regardless of the mental strategies used. These results indicate that successful SMR based NF performance is associated with implicit learning mechanisms. Participants stating vivid reports on strategies to control their SMR probably overload cognitive resources, which might be counterproductive in terms of increasing SMR power.', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 65, 'citationCount': 172, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1914749', 'name': 'S.

These regions included the left rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and right medial frontopolar cortex (MFPC). Together with the LA, these six prefrontal regions thus formed the functional neuroanatomical network engaged during the rtfMRI-nf procedure. Here we perform a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) analysis of the effective connectivity for this network. The SVAR analysis demonstrates that the left rACC plays an important role during the rtfMRI-nf training, modulating the LA and the other network regions. According to the analysis, the rtfMRI-nf training leads to a significant enhancement in the time-lagged effect of the left rACC on the LA, potentially consistent with the ipsilateral distribution of the monosynaptic projections between these regions. The training is also accompanied by significant increases in the instantaneous (contemporaneous) effects of the left rACC on four other regions – the bilateral DMPFC, the right MFPC, and the left SFG. The instantaneous effects of the LA on the bilateral DMPFC are also significantly enhanced. Our results are consistent with a broad literature supporting the role of the rACC in emotion processing and regulation. Our exploratory analysis provides, for the first time, insights into the causal relationships within the network of regions engaged during the rtfMRI-nf procedure targeting the amygdala. It suggests that the rACC may constitute a promising target for rtfMRI-nf training along with the amygdala in patients with affective disorders, particularly posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 61, 'citationCount': 128, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1724999', 'name': 'V.

We compare the locationist approach (i.e., the hypothesis that discrete emotion categories consistently and specifically correspond to distinct brain regions) with the psychological constructionist approach (i.e., the hypothesis that discrete emotion categories are constructed of more general brain networks not specific to those categories) to better understand the brain basis of emotion. We review both locationist and psychological constructionist hypotheses of brain–emotion correspondence and report meta-analytic findings bearing on these hypotheses. Overall, we found little evidence that discrete emotion categories can be consistently and specifically localized to distinct brain regions. Instead, we found evidence that is consistent with a psychological constructionist approach to the mind: A set of interacting brain regions commonly involved in basic psychological operations of both an emotional and non-emotional nature are active during emotion experience and perception across a range of discrete emotion categories.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 935, 'citationCount': 1662, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2593387', 'name': 'Kristen A.

Visitors can test the installation during the conference after about 5 minutes of training time. World of Warcraft is a common Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) in which the player controls an avatar in a virtual environment.\n The user has to wear newly developed dry EEG electrodes which are connected to a biosignal amplifier. Then the data is transmitted to a computer to perform the real-time analysis of the EEG data. The BCI system is using steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) as control signal. Therefore the system shows different icons flickering with different frequencies. If the user focuses now on one of the icons the flickering frequency is visible in the EEG data and can be extracted with frequency analysis algorithms.\n In order to control an avatar in World of Warcraft it is necessary to have 4 control icons that are analyzed in real-time. Three icons are necessary to turn left or right or to move forward. Additionally a 4th icon is required to perform certain actions like grasping objects, attacking other objects....like shown in Figure 1. The visual stimulation took place via a 60Hz LCD-display with flickering frequencies of 15, 12, 10 and 8.57Hz in combination with an underlying video.\n To visualize the flickering controls a BCI-Overlay library based on OpenGL was implemented, which can be used by any graphics application. It provides the possibility to generate BCI controls within a virtual reality environment or as overlays in combination with video sequences\n Figure 2 shows the components of the complete system. The user is connected with 8 EEG electrodes to the BCI system that is running under Windows and MATLAB. The BCI system uses the minimum energy algorithm and a linear discriminant analysis to determine if the user is looking at one of the icons or if the user is not attending.\n Via a UDP communication channel the BCI system is controlling the BCI-Overlay module that generates the 4 flickering icons around the WoW User Interface. If the BCI system detects a certain command it is transmitted to the game controller which generates the corresponding WoW command. This is straight forward for the left, right and move forward commands, but more complicated for the action command. Action commands are context dependant and the controller has to select certain possible actions. Finally the command is transmitted to WoW and the avatar performs the action.\n This allows the user to play WoW with the BCI system only by thought.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 23, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2768932', 'name': 'C.

Emotions can have good effects, as when a scientist gets excited about a line of research and pursues it successfully despite criticism. But emotions can also distort reasoning, as when a juror ignores evidence of guilt just because the accused seems like a nice guy. In Hot Thought, Paul Thagard describes the mental mechanisms -- cognitive, neural, molecular, and social -- that interact to produce different kinds of human thinking, from everyday decision making to legal reasoning, scientific discovery, and religious belief, and he discusses when and how thinking and reasoning should be emotional. Thagard argues that an understanding of emotional thinking needs to integrate the cognitive, neural, molecular, and social levels. Many of the chapters employ computational models of various levels of thinking, including HOTCO (hot cognition) models and the more neurologically realistic GAGE model. Thagard uses these models to illuminate thinking in the domains of law, science, and religion, discussing such topics as the role of doubt and reasonable doubt in legal and other contexts, valuable emotional habits for successful scientists, and the emotional content of religious beliefs.

In addition, the attempted inhibition of the sexual arousal generated by viewing the erotic stimuli was associated with activation of the right superior frontal gyrus and right anterior cingulate gyrus.

This problem is common to philosophy (Aristotle 1988), statistical inference (Casella & Berger 2001) and machine learning (Mitchell 1997, Agluin & Smith 1983). We constrain ourselves only to the latter two frameworks. Within machine-learning, we further concentrate on its subfield called inductive logic programming (Nienhuys-Cheng & de Wolf 1997). Whereas in statistics we namely concentrate on evaluating hypotheses, in machine learning we study ways of constructing the theories. From the theoretical viewpoint, however, the construction is also viewed as a selection of a hypothesis from an a priori given set. Unlike in statistics, however, the range of considered hypotheses is usually large so that hypotheses cannot by inspected individually by a human. Such a set of hypotheses may be conveniently viewed as (equivalent to) a language L H generated by a certain formal grammar. Every hypothesis H ∈ L H induces a mapping h : X → O where X is a predefined (usually countable) set of instances (which we also call the domain of L H) and O is a set usually assumed to be finite and its elements called classes. Very often, O has just two elements. The assigned mapping gives the hypothesis its meaning (semantics). The usual formalization of the concept learning task is then as follows. Let there be a hypothesis C ∈ L H called the target concept and let n examples (x 1 , c(x 1)),(x 2 , c(x 2)),... ,(x n , c(x n))= S drawn from a predefined distribution D X on X be provided to the algorithm L called the learner (S is called a sample). We ask L to output an hypothesis H ∈ L H such that a specified error function Err(H, C) is minimized with respect to D X. The error function may be defined as e.g. Err(H, C) = 0 if H ≡ C (i.e. h(x) = c(x) ∀x ∈ X) and Err(H, C) = 1 otherwise, that is, irrespectively of the distribution D X. We would thus require the learner to exactly identify the target concept. This would be close to the theoretical framework of identification in the limit (Gold 1967), which, roughly said, demands that the learner converges to the correct hypothesis in the limit as n → ∞.

This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial.

Most of these people are cared for by informal caregivers at home, i.e. people who are not paid for their work and who are usually family members without professional training. The lack of skills and knowledge necessary to carry out this work causes stress and leads to increased levels of overload, anxiety, and depression in informal caregivers. This paper presents work in progress on the design of an intelligent assistant (IA), named Alzaid Assistant, for informal caregivers of people with dementia (PwD). This IA aims to promote social support in informal caregivers of PwD by providing them with information and strengthening coping strategies for problem solving and emotional regulation to reduce levels of overload, anxiety, and depression. Particularly, the phases of requirements elicitation, design, implementation, and preliminary validations are presented. A high-fidelity prototype of the IA was evaluated by 20 participants using a questionnaire based on the technology acceptance model to assess the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use.

Proper nutrition and good eating behavior show promise for preventing and slowing the progression of ADRD and consequently improving patients with ADRD’s health status and quality of life. Most ADRD care is provided by informal caregivers, so assisting caregivers to manage patients with ADRD’s diet is important. Objective This study aims to design, develop, and test an artificial intelligence–powered voice assistant to help informal caregivers manage the daily diet of patients with ADRD and learn food and nutrition-related knowledge. Methods The voice assistant is being implemented in several steps: construction of a comprehensive knowledge base with ontologies that define ADRD diet care and user profiles, and is extended with external knowledge graphs; management of conversation between users and the voice assistant; personalized ADRD diet services provided through a semantics-based knowledge graph search and reasoning engine; and system evaluation in use cases with additional qualitative evaluations. Results A prototype voice assistant was evaluated in the lab using various use cases. Preliminary qualitative test results demonstrate reasonable rates of dialogue success and recommendation correctness. Conclusions The voice assistant provides a natural, interactive interface for users, and it does not require the user to have a technical background, which may facilitate senior caregivers’ use in their daily care tasks. This study suggests the feasibility of using the intelligent voice assistant to help caregivers manage patients with ADRD’s diet.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 31, 'citationCount': 19, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2116823876', 'name': 'Juan Li'}, {'authorId': '123041694', 'name': 'Bikesh Maharjan'}, {'authorId': '2077526566', 'name': 'Bo Xie'}, {'authorId': '34394575', 'name': 'Cui Tao'}]}, {'paperId': '81ee28c026d1bcf5ef1d0f6e7832930d5936d912', 'title': 'A single mindfulness session with informal caregivers of seniors living with dementia: a pilot qualitative descriptive study', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 25, 'citationCount': 4, 'authors': [{'authorId': '84561447', 'name': 'F.

Supporting Family Caregivers with Technology for Dementia Home Care (FamTechCare) is a multisite randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of a telehealth intervention on caregiver well-being and PWD behavioral symptoms. The FamTechCare intervention provides individualized dementia-care strategies to in-home caregivers based on video recordings that the caregiver creates of challenging care situations. A team of dementia care experts review videos submitted by caregivers and provide interventions to improve care weekly for the experimental group. Caregivers in the control group receive feedback for improving care based on a weekly phone call with the interventionist and receive feedback on their videos at the end of the 3-month study. Using linear mixed modeling, we will compare experimental and control group outcomes (PWD behavioral symptoms and caregiver burden) after 1 and 3 months. An exploratory descriptive design will identify a typology of interventions for telehealth support for in-home dementia caregivers. Finally, the cost for FamTechCare will be determined and examined in relation to hypothesized effects on PWD behavioral symptoms, placement rates, and caregiver burden.

All the authors and investigators of dementia studies who provided us more specific data from their work. foreword Today, over 46 million people live with dementia worldwide, more than the population of Spain. This number is estimated to increase to 131.5 million by 2050. Dementia also has a huge economic impact. Today, the total estimated worldwide cost of dementia is US $818 billion, and it will become a trillion dollar disease by 2018. This means that if dementia care were a country, it would be the world's 18th largest economy, more than the market values of companies such as Apple (US$ 742 billion), Google (US$ 368 billion) and Exxon (US$ 357 billion). In many parts of the world, there is a growing awareness of dementia, but across the globe it remains the case that a diagnosis of dementia can bring with it stigma and social isolation. Today, we estimate that 94% of people living with dementia in low and middle income countries are cared for at home. These are regions where health and care systems often provide limited or no support to people living with dementia or to their families. The 2015 World Alzheimer Report updates data on the prevalence, incidence, cost and trends of dementia worldwide. It also estimates how these numbers will increase in the future, leaving us with no doubt that dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and other causes, is one of the biggest global public health and social care challenges facing people today and in the future. The two organisations we lead are ADI, the only worldwide federation of Alzheimer associations and global voice on dementia, and Bupa, a purpose-driven global health and care company that is the leading international provider of specialist dementia care, caring for around 60,000 people living with dementia each year. Together, we are committed to ensuring that dementia becomes an international health priority. We believe national dementia plans are the first step towards ensuring all countries are equipped to enable people to live well with dementia, and help to reduce the risk of dementia for future generations. There is now a growing list of countries which have such provision in place or which are developing national dementia plans, but it's not enough.

Care-recipient cognitive and functional abilities were obtained using the Mini-Mental State Exam and the Clinical Dementia Rating. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Results: Caregivers most frequently identified providing care as a problem (37.6%). Linear mixed models of caregiver coping strategies found that the use of most strategies were stable except for increasing Avoidance among adult child caregivers (β = 0.14, p = 0.048). On average, increased Wishful Thinking (β = 2.48, p < 0.001) or Blames Self (β = 1.06, p = 0.002) was associated with higher anxiety scores. Increased use of Blames Others among males (interaction, β = 0.28, p = 0.02) and greater use of Wishful Thinking among younger caregivers (interaction, β = −0.01, p = 0.01) were associated with more caregiver health conditions.

One hundred twenty-five family carers of people with Alzheimer's disease completed the Brief COPE at time 1, 92 (82.9% of eligible carers) a year later, and 74 (77.1%) 2 years later. Internal consistencies were good for emotion-focused, problem-focused, and dysfunctional subscales (&agr; = 0.72, 0.84, 0.75). Test-retest reliability over a year was demonstrated for emotion-focused, problem-focused, and dysfunctional subscales among carers in whom burden scores did not change significantly (r = 0.58, r = 0.72, r = 0.68; p < 0.001). Change in burden score over 2 years correlated with change in problem-focused and dysfunctional (r = 0.33, r = 0.32; p < 0.01) subscales, indicating sensitivity to change, but not with change on the emotion-focused scale.

Prevention Dementia is defined as a decline in cognitive function from baseline. It is a syndrome caused by a variety of disorders, the most common of which are Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. The incidence and prevalence of dementia increase with age. It is estimated that by the year 2047, more than 9 million Americans will have some form of it (1). Institutionalization is ultimately required for many patients with dementia, and 67% die in nursing homes (2). Although there is currently no cure for most forms of dementia, research findings and accumulated clinical experience support a set of practices that serve to maximize the function and overall well-being of patients with dementia and their caregivers. What medical interventions or health behaviors can help patients prevent dementia? Although there are several risk factors for different types of dementia, data supporting the effectiveness of specific preventive measures are limited. Hypertension Untreated hypertension in mid-life and later is a proven risk factor for both Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia (3). A number of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that treating hypertension reduces the risk for dementia. A large, placebo-controlled RCT with 2418 participants demonstrated that treating systolic hypertension in patients over the age of 60 years reduced the incidence of dementia by 50%, from 7.7 cases to 3.8 cases per 1000 patient-years (4). Another placebo-controlled RCT with 6106 participants showed that treating hypertension with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril with or without the thiazide diuretic indapamide reduced the incidence of recurrent stroke with dementia by 34% and of recurrent stroke with any cognitive decline by 45% in patients with past stroke or transient ischemic attack (5). Hypercholesterolemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hypercholesterolemia, particularly in mid-life, is associated with an increased incidence of both Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia, (6), and case-control studies have shown an association between use of cholesterol-lowering medications and reduced incidence of dementia (7). Diabetes has been shown in both longitudinal cohort and case-control studies to be an independent risk factor for vascular dementia (8, 9). However, as with hypercholesterolemia, there are no trials that demonstrate that treating diabetes prevents dementia. Lifestyle Modifications Cigarette smoking is associated with an increased risk for stroke, although the evidence for an association with Alzheimer disease is mixed (10). Head injury earlier in life has been shown in a number of epidemiologic studies to be associated with dementia later in life (11). Finally, physical inactivity, both in mid-life and later, has been associated with an increased risk for dementia in both retrospective and prospective studies 12, 13). Thus, counseling patients to quit smoking; engage in behaviors to reduce the risk for head injury, such as wearing seat belts and bike helmets; and be physically active may reduce the risk for dementia. Medications Clinicians should regularly review the medication regimens of elderly patients and minimize use of medications that can cause cognitive impairment, such as benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, barbiturates, and other sedative-hypnotics. A number of studies have shown that elderly patients taking benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotics perform more poorly on cognitive tests than those not taking these medications (14). Because inflammation is present in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease and epidemiologic evidence links use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) earlier in life to a lower risk for Alzheimer disease (15), some have questioned whether NSAIDs might prevent dementia. However, prospective studies to date have not shown a protective effect of NSAIDs, and they are not recommended for prevention of dementia (16). Significant epidemiologic evidence links mid-life estrogen use to a lower incidence of dementia later in life (17). However, in prospective prevention trials, including the large Women\'s Health Initiative Memory Study, use of estrogen plus progestin for prevention of dementia was associated with an increased incidence of dementia, as well as other medical complications (18). Clinical Bottom Line: Prevention Although there are few data to support specific measures to prevent dementia, clinicians should treat cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes, and encourage smoking cessation and regular exercise. They should also counsel patients about avoiding head injury and avoid prescribing medications that can alter cognitive function. Neither NSAIDs nor estrogen should be recommended for prevention of dementia. Screening Should clinicians screen for dementia? The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against widespread screening for dementia in elderly patients (19). However, many patients with dementia in the primary care setting, even those in more advanced stages of the disease, remain undiagnosed despite having routine general medical care (20). Moreover, patients referred to dementia specialists after ""screening"" have been diagnosed at an earlier stage of illness than those referred from physicians or families (21). Therefore, given the high prevalence of dementia and its associated morbidity, the clinician should consider secondary case-finding measures for dementia in elderly patients with unexplained functional decline, deterioration in hygiene, questionable adherence to medication regimens, or new-onset psychiatric symptoms. What methods should clinicians use when looking for dementia? When looking for dementia in elderly patients, clinicians should use a standardized screening instrument together with a brief history from the patient and a knowledgeable informant. The screening instrument should be easy to use, demonstrate high sensitivity, be widely available, and be supported by normative population data relevant to the patient. Two examples of such instruments are the Mini-Mental Status Examination (22) and the Mini-Cog (23). Clinical Bottom Line: Screening There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening asymptomatic people for dementia. However, clinicians should be alert for unexplained functional decline, deterioration in hygiene, questionable adherence to medication regimens, or new-onset psychiatric symptoms in elderly patients and use standardized instruments, such as the Mini-Mental Status Examination or the Mini-Cog, to look for cognitive dysfunction in such patients. Diagnosis What elements of the history are most important in evaluating patients with suspected dementia? Clinicians should use the patient\'s history to characterize the cognitive deficits, generate a differential diagnosis, and attempt to determine the cause of the dementia. This is best accomplished by identifying medical, neurologic, and psychiatric symptoms that may be clues to the cause of the cognitive problems and detailing their order of appearance, severity, and associated features. In the case of cognitive difficulties, it is mandatory to try to obtain collateral information from a knowledgeable informant, because cognitive dysfunction can impair the patient\'s ability to serve as an accurate reporter. It is often easier to collect this information, as well as information about psychiatric symptoms, without the patient present. In taking the history, it is critical for clinicians to be knowledgeable about the differential diagnosis and natural history of the most common types of dementia (Table 1). For example, in classic Alzheimer disease, early symptoms are dominated by difficulties with short-term memory, subtle language and visuospatial perception difficulties, and changes in executive function with significant reductions in efficiency and organizational abilities of which the patient may or may not be aware. Symptoms begin insidiously and are slowly progressive. Overall level of alertness remains unimpaired. Patients or families may not label these difficulties as memory problems per se but may instead report multiple repetitions of questions or conversations with no recollection of previous discussions, increased forgetfulness manifested by losing objects or becoming confused while shopping, or simply overall increased disorganization and decreased efficiency. Symptoms are often first noticed or reported at the time of a life change, such as the death of a spouse or a move into a new residence. See the Box for clinical diagnostic criteria for definite and probable Alzheimer disease (24). Clinical Diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease (AD) Definite AD: Clinical criteria for probable AD plus histopathology confirmation Probable AD: Dementia by clinical examination and standardized instrument (e.g., Mini-Mental State Examination) Deficits in >2 areas of cognition Progressive cognitive decline Normal levels of consciousness Onset between age 40 and 90 years No other cause Supportive factors, including positive family history, cerebral atrophy on neuroimagining, normal electroencephalogram and lumbar puncture Table 1. Differential Diagnosis of Cognitive Difficulties Many elderly patients report minor cognitive problems, such as mild forgetfulness, difficulty remembering names, and mildly reduced concentration. In patients without dementia, these symptoms are typically sporadic, do not worsen significantly over time, are easily compensated for, and do not affect function. In contrast, in early dementia, the symptoms insidiously become established as a pattern, worsen over time, are difficult to compensate for, and eventually affect speech fluency and hamper the performance of routine activities, such as meal prepa', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 811, 'authors': [{'authorId': '8049385', 'name': 'D.

Definitions of these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and streamlined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of .98 for usefulness and .94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited hgih convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significnatly correlated with both self-reported current usage r = .63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage r = .85, Study 2).

Research indicates that the addition of an interactive element enhances learning. Collaboration is supported by evidence for enhanced effectiveness of sensory tools in schools. The project was implemented over the course of 7 weeks. Teachers participated in 5 weeks of intervention with a weekly 30-min asynchronous web-based learning module and a 30-min individual or group collaboration session. Results showed increased positive perceptions with 5 of 10 Likert scale questions showing a statistically significant increase. In addition, data showed a statistically significant positive change in teachers’ knowledge related to OT’s role in schools, self-regulation, and social-emotional skills. Data from open-ended questions revealed an increase in teachers’ understanding of different causes of student behaviors and increased knowledge of self-regulation tools. The results suggest teachers’ understanding of OT’s role in self-regulation increases through the use of asynchronous virtual learning and scheduled collaboration sessions with an occupational therapist. Further research is recommended to increase the generalizability of results and to identify the most effective use of collaboration to enhance teachers’ understanding of self-regulation.",2021,32,0,"{'name': 'Journal of Occupational Therapy, Schools, & Early Intervention', 'pages': '403 - 417', 'volume': '15'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-0.00936347246170044,

The purpose of this systematic review was to describe the evidence for the effectiveness of early intervention to improve and maintain performance in occupations for youths with or at risk for serious mental illness (SMI). METHOD. Titles and abstracts of 670 articles were reviewed, 234 were retrieved for full review, and 30 met inclusion criteria. RESULTS. Moderate to strong evidence supports cognitive remediation (CR) and mixed evidence supports cognitive‐behavioral therapy (CBT) as an adjunct modality to improve general functioning. Moderate to strong evidence supports use of supported employment and supported education (SE/E) to improve social and occupational outcomes in employment and academics. Strong evidence supports family psychoeducation (FPE) to prevent relapse and rehospitalization and improve problem‐solving skills and general functioning. CONCLUSION. Occupational therapy practitioners should integrate CR, SE/E, and FPE into early intervention with youth with or at risk for SMI.

The research questions are: 1. How do school-based occupational therapists (OTs) describe the role of sensory-based intervention (SBI) in an educational setting? 2. Which current practice trends influence sensory-based occupational therapy practice? Methods: Descriptive statistics were generated to summarize current school-based practice trends. Qualitative analysis resulted in the identification of categories related to school-based practice. Participants (N = 94) reported the positive impact of sensory-based interventions in the schools, the challenge of the school context, the value of both teacher and team collaboration, the limitations and challenges to parent collaboration, and the sensory resources within the school context. Results: Results indicate that school-based practitioners should focus on educational and social participation of the students.

Protective factors, such as resiliency, can support children in managing their behavior, yet little research has addressed the contribution of sensory processing to protective factors. Therefore, in this cross‐sectional study we aimed to determine the contribution of sensory processing (using the Sensory Profile‐2) to challenging behavior and protective factors (using the Behavior Assessment System for Children, 2nd ed., Parent Rating Scales) in a sample of 51 children ages 6–11 yr from the general U.S. population. The results indicated that sensory avoiding predicts externalizing behaviors, depression, resiliency, and adaptability. In addition, sensory seeking is related to depression and resiliency, whereas sensory sensitivity is related to externalizing behaviors.

School-based occupational therapy (SBOT) practice takes place within a complex system that includes service recipients, service providers, and program decision makers across health and education sectors.

Purpose. This paper reports on a process used to engage program administrators in an examination of SBOT collaborative consultation practice in one region of Ontario to provide an evidence-informed foundation for decision making about implementation of these services. Methods Within an appreciative inquiry framework (Cooperrider, Whitney, & Stavros, 2008), Developmental Work Research methods (Engeström, 2000) were used to facilitate shared learning for improved SBOT collaborative consultation. Program administrators participated alongside program providers and service recipients in a series of facilitated workshops to develop principles that will guide future planning and decision making about the delivery of SBOT services. Findings. Facilitated discussion among stakeholders led to the articulation of 12 principles for effective collaborative practice. Program administrators used their shared understanding to propose a new model for delivering SBOT services. Implications.

Therefore, this study seeks to examine teachers’ knowledge and beliefs on promoting SRL, as well as their predictive value on teachers’ promotion of SRL in the classroom. Forty-seven primary school teachers completed questionnaires on knowledge and beliefs towards both components of the promotion of SRL: strategy instruction and a constructivist learning environment. In addition, teachers had to answer open-ended questions on their understanding of SRL, as well as their implementation of SRL in their classroom. The results show that teachers are more positive towards constructivist than towards SRL (teacher beliefs), and most teachers mentioned characteristics of constructivist learning environments, while only few teachers addressed strategy instruction when being asked about their understanding of SRL (teacher knowledge). Moreover, teacher beliefs are the only predictor for teacher behavior.

Occupational therapists working in school health have recognized the need to move away from a one-to-one direct service delivery model towards a more collaborative, classroom-based approach. Partnering for Change (P4C) is an innovative service delivery model that may enhance school-based collaborative care. Purpose. To capture the experiences of occupational therapists implementing P4C and to elicit their perspectives about how this model differs from the direct service approach. Methods. Semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted with seven therapists who had delivered P4C in 10 Ontario schools. Thematic analysis was utilized with themes verified through member checking. Findings. Five themes (a year of growth, becoming a community, the key ingredients of P4C, a balancing act, and providing services that make an impact) reflected therapists' personal and professional growth, aspects of the model they believed were key, challenges they encountered, and the impact they felt they had made.

Trait emotional intelligence (trait EI or trait emotional self-efficacy) refers to individuals' emotion-related self-perceptions (Petrides, Furnham, & Mavroveli, 2007). The children's trait EI sampling domain provides comprehensive coverage of their affective personality. Preliminary evidence shows that the construct has important implications for children's psychological and behavioural adjustment. AIMS. This study investigates the associations between trait EI and school outcomes, such as performance in reading, writing, and maths, peer-rated behaviour and social competence, and self-reported bullying behaviours in a sample of primary school children. It also examines whether trait EI scores differentiate between children with and without special educational needs (SEN). SAMPLE. The sample comprised 565 children (274 boys and 286 girls) between the ages of 7 and 12 (M((age)) = 9.12 years, SD= 1.27 years) attending three English state primary schools. METHOD. Pupils completed the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Child Form (TEIQue-CF), the Guess Who peer assessment, the Peer-Victimization Scale, and the Bullying Behaviour Scale. Additional data on achievement and SEN were collected from the school archives. RESULTS. As predicted by trait EI theory, associations between trait EI and academic achievement were modest and limited to Year 3 children. Higher trait EI scores were related to more nominations from peers for prosocial behaviours and fewer nominations for antisocial behaviour as well as lower scores on self-reported bulling behaviours. Furthermore, SEN students scored lower on trait EI compared to students without SEN. CONCLUSIONS. Trait EI holds important and multifaceted implications for the socialization of primary schoolchildren."", 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 116, 'citationCount': 213, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5396436', 'name': 'S.

The data has been analyzed through structural equation modeling (SEM). The results illustrate PE, TR, and PB positively affects ATT which further influences Beh.

Drawing on the Artificially Intelligent Device Use Acceptance (AIDUA) theory, this study validates and extends the AIDUA framework in the hospitality service setting. The results point to the applicability of the AIDUA framework, suggesting that hospitality customers’ intention to the use of artificially intelligent devices are influenced by social influence, hedonic motivation, anthropomorphism, performance and effort expectancy, and emotions toward the artificially intelligent devices. Findings further suggest that compared to limited-service hotel customers, full-service hotel customers rely less on their social groups when evaluating artificially intelligent robotic devices; their emotions toward the use of artificially intelligent devices are less likely to be influenced by effort expectancy; and their emotions cause less impact on their objection to the use.

Theories and models developed by scholars have tended to focus on the role of cognition and have rarely included affect. The few studies that have incorporated affect have tended to measure a single emotion rather than modeling it comprehensively. This research addresses that inadequacy in our understanding of technology adoption by merging two previously unrelated models: TAM (the Technology Acceptance Model) and PAD (the Pleasure, Arousal, and Dominance paradigm of affect). This study also examines an enhanced view of cognition. The product of this unified theoretical framework is referred to as the Consumer Acceptance of Technology (CAT) model. The results of a test using structural equation modeling provide empirical support for the model. Overall, the CAT model explains over 50% of the variance in consumer adoption intentions, a considerable increase compared to TAM. These findings suggest that substantial improvement in the prediction of technology adoption decisions is possible by use of this model with its integration of affect and cognition. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 74, 'citationCount': 400, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3353788', 'name': 'Songpol Kulviwat'}, {'authorId': '118815233', 'name': 'Gordon C.

In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model. The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of PC utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory. Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology. Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships. UTAUT was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R2 of 69 percent). UTAUT was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R2 of 70 percent). UTAUT thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems.

The model proposes control (internal and external--conceptualized as computer self-efficacy and facilitating conditions, respectively), intrinsic motivation (conceptualized as computer playfulness), and emotion (conceptualized as computer anxiety) as anchors that determine early perceptions about the ease of use of a new system. With increasing experience, it is expected that system-specific perceived ease of use, while still anchored to the general beliefs regarding computers and computer use, will adjust to reflect objective usability, perceptions of external control specific to the new system environment, and system-specific perceived enjoyment. The proposed model was tested in three different organizations among 246 employees using three measurements taken over a three-month period.

Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage r = .45, Study 1) and future usage r = .59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a signficnatly greater correaltion with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecdent to perceived usefulness, as opposed to a parallel, direct determinant of system usage.

Unfortunately, resistance to end-user systems by managers and professionals is a widespread problem. To better predict, explain, and increase user acceptance, we need to better understand why people accept or reject computers. This research addresses the ability to predict peoples' computer acceptance from a measure of their intentions, and the ability to explain their intentions in terms of their attitudes, subjective norms, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and related variables. In a longitudinal study of 107 users, intentions to use a specific system, measured after a one-hour introduction to the system, were correlated 0.35 with system use 14 weeks later. The intention-usage correlation was 0.63 at the end of this time period. Perceived usefulness strongly influenced peoples' intentions, explaining more than half of the variance in intentions at the end of 14 weeks. Perceived ease of use had a small but significant effect on intentions as well, although this effect subsided over time. Attitudes only partially mediated the effects of these beliefs on intentions. Subjective norms had no effect on intentions. These results suggest the possibility of simple but powerful models of the determinants of user acceptance, with practical value for evaluating systems and guiding managerial interventions aimed at reducing the problem of underutilized computer technology."", 'year': 1989, 'referenceCount': 81, 'citationCount': 22869, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1682201', 'name': 'Fred D.

65,04def691c5077f6e97120271b073719db71049f5,Case Study on VR Empathy Game: Challenges with VR Games Development for Emotional Interactions with the VR Characters,"Empathy development in young children (6 to 9 years old) sets a foundation for emotional regulation and social skills for children’s futures. Researchers from the fields of virtual reality (VR) and game design highlight the potential of VR technologies as a great tool to promote empathy. However, there is little empirical and systematic knowledge on how to use VR technology to help promote empathy in young children. To address this gap, we developed a VR Empathy Game prototype to explore how VR experiences can inculcate empathy development in young children. To evaluate this prototype, we conducted a qualitative study with 15 children from 6 to 9 years old. We used an interpretive case study to provide an in-depth understanding of children’s experiences with the VR Empathy Game. To guide participant selection, we used a purposeful sampling approach and intentionally included K-3 children with different empathy and social skills levels. 
  
This paper describes one case representing a challenge that children with a low level of empathy can experience while playing the VR Empathy Game. This case explains the game experience of a seven-year-old boy, Gabe. The case is entitled: “The VR Empathy Game Experience with a Focus on Exploring the Environment and Looking for Clues.” Gabe confused intrinsic and extrinsic game goals and played the game focusing only on the VR environment. He perceived the game characters as an information source rather than building relationships with them unlike the children with a higher level of empathy. This case represents the group of four boys who participated in our study. In comparison with other participants, Gabe’s case provided very little evidence of noticing the characters' emotions. Our findings suggest that game designers should provide additional scaffolding for children with little levels of empathy, including additional reflective questions and reminders to interact with the characters. We also suggest a follow-up study exploring how different storylines would help children’s game experience.",2022,18,0,{'name': 'European Conference on Games Based Learning'},"{'model': 'specter_v1',

Yet despite this, educational software has traditionally attempted to harness games as extrinsic motivation by using them as a sugar coating for learning content. This article tests the concept of intrinsic integration as a way of creating a more productive relationship between educational games and their learning content. Two studies assessed this approach by designing and evaluating an educational game called Zombie Division to teach mathematics to 7- to 11-year-olds. Study 1 examined the learning gains of 58 children who played either the intrinsic, extrinsic, or control variants of Zombie Division for 2 hr, supported by their classroom teacher. Study 2 compared time on task for the intrinsic and extrinsic variants of the game when 16 children had free choice of which game to play. The results showed that children learned more from the intrinsic version of the game under fixed time limits and spent 7 times longer playing it in free-time situations. Together, these studies offer evidence for the genuine value of an intrinsic approach for creating effective educational games. The theoretical and commercial implications of these findings are discussed.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 79, 'citationCount': 515, 'authors': [{'authorId': '70227521', 'name': 'C. S.

As early as 1965, Sutherland envisioned that the ‘ultimate display’ would enable users to actively interact with the virtual space as if it were real, giving them “a chance to gain familiarity with concepts not realizable in the physical world” (Sutherland, 1965, p. 506). William Gibson appears to have shared this vision when coining the term ‘cyberspace’ in his 1984 novel Neuromancer, defining it as “a consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts · · · ” (p. 51). While the image may have seemed farfetched at the time, the mounting popularity of home video game consoles, massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs), and massive open online courses (MOOCs) all demonstrate that virtual reality (VR) is an increasingly integral component of our everyday lives. Despite some romanticized versions of VR, much of the previous literature focused on its dangers. Early studies voiced concerns about how individuals would no longer be able to receive true emotional and social support online (e.g., Kraut et al., 1998) and more recent research focused on Internet addiction (e.g., Lam et al., 2009) as well as the antisocial effects of playing violent games (e.g., Bartholow, Bushman, & Sestir, 2006). Overall, the results suggest that spending extensive amounts of time in VR can result in apathetic or even violent attitudes and behavior toward others. Indeed, early conversations between Jaron Lanier, one of the pioneers of the technology, and William Gibson, who consulted Lanier while writing his manifesto, focused on this tension. Lanier envisioned prosocial uses for the technology he championed, but Gibson felt compelled to write about the less wholesome applications, saying, “Jaron, I tried. But it’s coming out dark” (Lanier, 2013, p. 329). In terms of academic research, there is a group of scholars who focus on a more positive outlook; the unique affordances of virtual environments actually promote prosocial behavior when leveraged. Recent developments show that even brief virtual interventions can increase environmental awareness, reduce racial bias, and enhance general altruistic behavior. These interventions have been found to be especially powerful when the user feels fully immersed in the virtual world. With these findings in mind, the present chapter will outline the characteristics and strengths of virtual environments.

In addition, relatively little research has been conducted on automatic speech recognition performance with older adults, in whom speech disorders are commonly present. As one ages, the older adult voice naturally begins to resemble some aspects of mildly dysarthric speech. Dysarthria, a common neuromotor speech disorder, is particularly useful for exploring performance limitations of automatic speech recognizers owing to its wide range of speech expression. This article reviews clinical research literature examining the use of commercial speech-to-text automatic speech recognition technology by individuals with dysarthria. The main factors limiting automatic speech recognition performance with dysarthric speakers are highlighted and extended to the elderly using a specific example of a novel, automated, speech-based personal emergency response system for older adults.', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 51, 'citationCount': 124, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144238624', 'name': 'V.

They lack systematic and efficient ways of incorporating behavioral observations that are strong indicators of psychological disorder, much of which may occur outside the awareness of either individual. We compared clinical diagnosis of major depression with automatically measured facial actions and vocal prosody in patients undergoing treatment for depression. Manual FACS coding, active appearance modeling (AAM) and pitch extraction were used to measure facial and vocal expression. Classifiers using leave-one-out validation were SVM for FACS and for AAM and logistic regression for voice. Both face and voice demonstrated moderate concurrent validity with depression. Accuracy in detecting depression was 88% for manual FACS and 79% for AAM. Accuracy for vocal prosody was 79%. These findings suggest the feasibility of automatic detection of depression, raise new issues in automated facial image analysis and machine learning, and have exciting implications for clinical theory and practice.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 50, 'citationCount': 410, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1737918', 'name': 'J.

Individuals with mild and moderate dysarthria trained and then used 45 command words to input text independently into the PSDD. The results indicated that the PSDD system adapted well to the speech of individuals with mild and moderate dysarthria, but the recognition scores were lower than for a natural speaker. The PSDD system also adapted to the speech of two participants with different degrees of severe dysarthria, but they were unable to use this system independently. On the Infovox RA system, there was a wide range in the mean recognition scores for participants with dysarthria, whereas the natural speaker reached almost 100%. The recognition score for the participant with very severe dysarthria increased substantially with an adapted vocabulary on the speaker-dependent Infovox RA system.

The aim of this study was to assess the students’ perspective on the utility of TBL compared with traditional lectures. Methods We used a validated TBL student assessment instrument comprising three subscales studying accountability, preference for lecture or TBL, and student satisfaction. First-year medical students enrolled at the University of Florida College of Medicine in spring semester 2016 were asked to complete the questionnaire. Results The response rate was 50% (70/138). Although 81% of students reported that they had to prepare before TBL and believed they had to contribute to the learning of their team, only 52% believed that they were accountable for team learning. The majority believed that TBL activities are an effective approach to learning (74%), with 78% agreeing that TBL activities helped them recall information. Fewer than half (45%), however, believed that TBL helped improve their grades.

There are currently no studies analysing this link, and its investigation is needed because attitudes may influence communication behaviours.\n\n\nDESIGN\nCorrelational study.\n\n\nMETHOD\nTo attain this goal, self-reported instruments (attitudes towards communication of nurses, trait emotional intelligence (Trait Emotional Meta-Mood Scale) and Jefferson Scale of Nursing Empathy (Jefferson Scale Nursing Empathy) were collected from 460 nurses between September 2015-February 2016. Two different analytical methodologies were used: traditional regression models and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis models.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results of the regression model suggest that cognitive dimensions of attitude are a significant and positive predictor of the behavioural dimension. The perspective-taking dimension of empathy and the emotional-clarity dimension of emotional intelligence were significant positive predictors of the dimensions of attitudes towards communication, except for the affective dimension (for which the association was negative). The results of the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis models confirm that the combination of high levels of cognitive dimension of attitudes, perspective-taking and emotional clarity explained high levels of the behavioural dimension of attitude.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEmpathy and emotional intelligence are predictors of nurses' attitudes towards communication, and the cognitive dimension of attitude is a good predictor of the behavioural dimension of attitudes towards communication of nurses in both regression models and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. In general, the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis models appear to be better predictors than the regression models are.\n\n\nRELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE\nTo evaluate current practices, establish intervention strategies and evaluate their effectiveness. The evaluation of these variables and their relationships are important in creating a satisfied and sustainable workforce and improving quality of care and patient health."", 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 47, 'citationCount': 33, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1422876951', 'name': 'María del Carmen Giménez-Espert'}, {'authorId': '1399573618', 'name': 'V.

In addition, a provider's level of emotional intelligence (EI) can further the doctor–patient relationship, stimulating a more personalized and comprehensive manner of treating patients. Furthermore, personality traits of a clinician may positively or negatively influence that relationship, as well as clinical outcomes. This study was designed to evaluate empathy levels in podiatric medical students in a 4-year doctoral program. Moreover, this study aimed to determine whether EI, personality traits, and demographic variables exhibit correlations with the observed empathy patterns. Methods: This cross-sectional study collected data using an anonymous web-based survey completed by 150 students registered at the New York College of Podiatric Medicine. There were four survey sections: (1) demographics, (2) empathy (measured by the Jefferson Scale of Physicians' Empathy), (3) EI (measured by the Assessing Emotions Scale), and (4) personality traits (measured by the NEO-Five-Factor Inventory-3). Results: Empathy levels were significantly correlated with EI scores (r = 0.62, n = 150, P< 0.0001). All the five domains of personality were also shown to correlate with empathy scores, as well as with EI scores. With respect to demographics, Asian-American students had lower mean empathy scores than students of other races (P = 0.0018), females had higher mean empathy scores compared to men (P = 0.001), and undergraduate grade point average correlated with empathy scores in a nonmonotonic fashion (P = 0.0269).

To investigate this criticism, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to synthesize the literature examining the incremental validity of the 2 adult self-report forms of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue). Twenty-four articles reporting 114 incremental validity analyses of the TEIQue were reviewed according to the studies' methodological features. Additionally, data from 18 studies (providing 105 effect sizes) were pooled in a meta-analysis. Results suggest that the TEIQue consistently explains incremental variance in criteria pertaining to different areas of functioning, beyond higher order personality dimensions and other emotion-related variables. The pooled effect size was relatively small, but statistically and practically significant (ΔR2 = .06, SE = .0116; 95% CI [.03, .08]). The number of covariates controlled for, the form of the TEIQue, and the focus on higher order personality dimensions versus other individual-difference constructs as baseline predictors did not affect the effect size.

Team‐based learning (TBL) is an alternative education method involving pre‐class independent learning, in‐class readiness assurance consisting of individual and team assessments, and in‐class application exercises used to augment traditional dissection. TBL was integrated into the 2014 physician assistant/nurse anesthetist gross anatomy laboratory at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. In 2013 all students attended didactic lectures, and each student participated in one‐half of dissections. The structure of the 2014 course was similar except that students who did not participate in a day's dissection instead participated in a TBL session that ran concurrently with the laboratory. At the end of each laboratory period, students who participated in the TBL session went to the anatomy laboratory, and those students who dissected peer‐taught that day's dissection. De‐identified data from the 2013 and 2014 courses were used to assess the impact of this addition on student academic performance by t‐tests. Students in the 2014 course who experienced TBL performed significantly better on 75% of written and laboratory practical examinations (p<0.05). These mean examination increases correlated with a positive shift in final grades. A greater benefit was noted for physician assistant students than nurse anesthetist students. Importantly, mean percentage TBL grades were not significantly higher than mean examination scores, indicating that the addition of TBL scores to final grade calculations was not responsible for grade inflation in the experimental group. Additionally, there were no significant differences in the mean baseline academic ability of the comparison and experimental PA cohorts as determined by similar undergraduate grade point averages and exam scores in other coursework.

Although PBL provides a more traditional example of collaborative learning, TBL has recently gained popularity within health care education. The design of TBL addresses many resource challenges within clinical education including increasing student numbers, and limited availability of teachers who have competing clinical, research and teaching demands. There are also many educational benefits for students that arise from the key design elements of TBL. \nPurpose: It seems likely that as health care schools attempt to reduce costs, they will move towards TBL implementation. However, published literature, as well as our own experience indicates that variation from a standardised TBL framework, may result in poorer outcomes for students, and limit the ability of others to understand the learning and teaching process. This paper considers the pedagogic advantages of TBL that are reliant upon its unique, key design elements. \nConclusion: Relatively new to health care education, TBL provides an innovative approach to student-centred learning that helps to prepare students for effective collaboration, using content that is relevant to future practice. As TBL becomes part of many health care curricula, it is important to ensure the integrity of TBL is maintained. That is, poor design or lack of resources should not allow the essential steps of TBL to be discarded. Key factors for effective TBL include appropriate allocation of students to small groups, out of class preparation, pre-class assessments, well designed team activities, the presence of a well-trained facilitator during class, and immediate feedback.

To evaluate pharmacy student perceptions of team-based learning (TBL) vs traditional lecture-based learning formats. Methods. First professional year pharmacy students (N=111) at two universities used TBL in different courses during different semesters (fall vs spring). Students completed a 22-item team perceptions instrument before and after the fall semester. A 14-item teaching style preference instrument was completed at the end of the spring semester. Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank test and Mann-Whitney U test. Results. Students who experienced TBL in the fall and went back to traditional format in the spring reported improved perceptions of teams and preferred TBL format over a traditional format more than students who experienced a traditional format followed by TBL. Students at both universities agreed that the TBL format assists with critical-thinking, problem-solving, and examination preparation. Students also agreed that teams should consist of individuals with different personalities and learning styles. Conclusion. When building teams, faculty members should consider ways to diversify teams by considering different views, perspectives, and strengths. Offering TBL early in the curriculum prior to traditional lecture-based formats is better received by students, as evidenced by anecdotal reports from students possibly because it allows students time to realize the benefits and assist them in building teamwork-related skills.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 45, 'citationCount': 100, 'authors': [{'authorId': '11387601', 'name': 'Tracy R.

The characteristics of successful physicians extend past their technical and cognitive skills. Two of the six core clinical competencies (professionalism and interpersonal/communication skills) endorsed by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, the American Board of Medical Specialties, and The Joint Commission require physicians to succeed in measures associated with emotional intelligence (EI). Using 360‐degree anonymous feedback surveys to screen for improvement opportunities in these two core competencies enables organizations to selectively offer education to further develop physician EI. Incorporating routine use of these tools and interventions into ongoing professional practice evaluation and focused professional practice evaluation processes may be a cost‐effective strategy for preventing disruptive behaviors and increasing the likelihood of success when transitioning to an employed practice model. On the basis of a literature review, we determined that physician EI plays a key role in leadership; teamwork; and clinical, financial, and organizational outcomes.

Study design A total of 19 faculty members participated in a series of individual semi-structured interviews that allowed freedom of discussion within a structured framework of inquiry. Data were transcribed, coded using NVivo, and analyzed to establish common themes. Participant quotations were chosen to reinforce the themes and give a voice to the participants. Findings and discussion The benefits of TBL were perceived to be enhanced student engagement, peer learning, increased faculty enjoyment of teaching, and student development of transferable skills. Challenges included increased initial workload, writing effective application exercises, and facilitating learner-centered classes. TBL may be useful in optimizing course content to ensure outcomes and activities focus on important concepts. Peer learning appears to benefit student learning. TBL may help equip students with valuable transferable skills. TBL requires an initial upfront investment in faculty development and time to prepare resources. A student-centered approach to learning may be daunting for faculty and require new skill sets.

It was originally popularized in the business literature as a key attribute for success that was distinct from cognitive intelligence. Increasing focus is being placed on EI in medicine to improve clinical and academic performance. Despite the proposed benefits, to our knowledge, there have been no previous studies on the role of EI in orthopedic surgery. We evaluated baseline data on EI in a cohort of orthopedic surgery residents.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe asked all orthopedic surgery residents at a single institution to complete an electronic version of the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT). We used completed questionnaires to calculate total EI scores and 4 branch scores. Data were analyzed according to a priori cutoff values to determine the proportion of residents who were considered competent on the test. Data were also analyzed for possible associations with age, sex, race and level of training.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty-nine residents (100%) completed the MSCEIT. The mean total EI score was 86 (maximum score 145). Only 4 (10%) respondents demonstrated competence in EI.

The intent of the study was to assess students’ perceptions of TBL and to determine the effectiveness of this teaching approach when compared to a more traditional lecture‐ and lab‐based approach. Student perceptions were assessed utilizing a 17‐item questionnaire modified from an instrument designed by Vasan, DeFouw, and Compton. In general, the students perceived that TBL helped them increase understanding of anatomical content, develop information synthesizing skills, and to study more consistently. Perceptions concerning the importance of working as a part of a team were also positive, and students indicated that the team‐based activities enhanced their learning. A comparison between two cohorts of students (1 exposed to the traditional lecture/lab approach; the other participants in TBL) was conducted to assess the difference in student learning. Student scores on a set of 143 multiple‐choice test questions utilized in both classes were used for the comparison. No significant difference was found between the two cohorts (t(56)=1.085; p=.283).

Educators considering implementing TBL need evidence of its effectiveness. This study was conducted to determine whether student performance on examinations is affected by participation in TBL and whether TBL benefits lower- or higher-performing students. Method The authors analyzed the performance of second-year medical students on 28 comprehensive course examinations over two consecutive academic years (2003–2004, 2004–2005) at the Boonshoft School of Medicine. Results The 178 students (86 men, 92 women) included in the study achieved 5.9% (standard deviation [SD] 5.5) higher mean scores on examination questions that assessed their knowledge of pathology-based content learned using the TBL strategy compared with questions assessing pathology-based content learned via other methods (P < .001, t test). Students whose overall academic performance placed them in the lowest quartile of the class benefited more from TBL than did those in the highest quartile. Lowest-quartile students' mean scores were 7.9% (SD 6.0) higher on examination questions related to TBL modules than examination questions not related to TBL modules, whereas highest-quartile students' mean scores were 3.8% (SD 5.4) higher (P = .001, two-way analysis of variance).

Previous studies offer limited evidence regarding the impact of physician's EI on patient-physician relationship.\n\n\nPURPOSES\nUsing a multilevel and multisource data approach, the current study aimed to build a model that demonstrated the impact of a physician's EI on the patient's trust and the patient-physician relationship.\n\n\nMETHODOLOGY\nThe survey sample included 983 outpatients and 39 physicians representing 11 specialties.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nResults of path analyses demonstrated that the ratio of patient's follow-up visits (p < .01) and the nurse-rated EI for physicians (p < .05) had positive effects on the patient's trust. The impact of patient's trust on patient's satisfaction was mediated by the patient-physician relationship at a significant level (p < .01). The patient-physician relationship had a significantly positive effect on patient's satisfaction (p < .001). The model accounted for 37% of the variance of patient's trust, 67% of the PDR, and 58% of patient's satisfaction on physician services.\n\n\nPRACTICE IMPLICATIONS\nThis study suggests that nurses had the sensitivity and intellectual skills in assessing the physician's performance and the patient's need. Our findings suggest that patient's trust is the cornerstone of the patient-physician relationship; however, mutual trust and professional respect between nurses and physicians play a critical role in reinforcing the patient-physician relationship to effect improvements in the provision of patient-centered care."", 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 48, 'citationCount': 110, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4004169', 'name': 'H.

Its roots can be traced back to the seventeenth century when Spinoza (1677) believed that emotion and intellect together contributed to the measurement of cognition. According to him there were three layers ofcognition: emotional cognition, intellectual cognition and a kind of intuition. Thorndike (1920) introduced the concept of social intelligence that can be subdivided into emotional and motivational intelligence. Wechsler and Thorndike proposed two initial theories of intelligence that carried the notions similar to the concept of emotional intelligence. Wechsler\'s definition of intelligence as ""the global capacity to act purposefully, to think rationally, and to deal effectively with his environment"" included the idea that intelligence is not a single capacity but a multifaceted aggregate. Wechsler (1940) did the pioneering work in establishing intelligence testing by introducing the Wechsler\'s Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) based on ten or eleven verbal and performance subsets that can be used for differential diagnosis and measurement of a broad range of psychological functioning. Although Wechsler\'s test includes social reasoning, yet social intelligence was not a distinct entity in his intelligence test. In his view, intelligence is influenced by intellective and personality traits and other non-intellective components, such as affective, social and personal factors (e.g. anxiety, persistence and goal awareness). These non-intellective factors are important to achieve success in life, but at the same time, he opined that no amount of drive could compensate for presence of basic intellective factors. Wechsler found emotional intelligence to be an integrated part ofan individual\'s personality development. In 1948, Leeper, promoted the idea of\'emotional thought\' , which he believed, contributed to \'logical thought\'. Emotions were considered as higher order intelligence (Mowrer, 1960).

Although first mentioned in the professional literature nearly two decades ago, in the past five years it has received extensive media attention. The term ""emotional intelligence"" refers to the ability to identify, express and understand emotions; to assimilate emotions into thought; and to regulate both positive and negative emotions in oneself and others. Yet despite the flourishing research programs and broad popular interest, scientific evidence for a clearly identified construct of EI is sparse. It remains to be seen whether there is anything to EI that researchers in the fields of personality, intelligence, and applied psychology do not already know. This book offers a comprehensive critical review of EI. It examines current thinking on the nature, components, determinants and consequences of EI, and it evaluates the state of the art in EI theory, research, assessment and applications. The book highlights the extent to which empirical evidence supports EI as a valid construct and debunks some of the more extravagant claims that appear in the popular media. Finally, the book examines the potential use of EI to guide practical interventions in various clinical, occupational, and educational settings.', 'year': 2003, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 995, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144727303', 'name': 'G.

Patient subjects were recruited at the conclusion of an office visit and completed a patient satisfaction survey. Spearman rank order correlations and t tests were used to examine the relationship between global, composite, and subscale scores on the EQi and patient satisfaction. Race, gender, and resident/faculty status were compared via t tests.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWhen patient satisfaction scores were used to dichotomize physicians into two groups, those with 100% satisfied patients and those with less than 100% satisfaction, only one subscale of EQi, ""happiness,"" was related to higher satisfaction.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFindings suggest a limited relationship between physicians\'scores on a test of emotional intelligence and patient satisfaction.

Harris, Doctoral Candidate A dissertation submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Virginia Commonwealth University. Virginia Commonwealth University, 2017. Major Director: Kevin Allison, Ph.D. Professor, Clinical Psychology Department of Psychology Improving patient outcomes has long been the rationale supporting calls to reform health care delivery systems and health profession education programs (Greiner, 2002; Institutes of Medicine, 2001, 2004; O’Neil & Pew Health Professions Commission, 1998). A common aim sought through recent healthcare reforms is greater patient-centered delivery of care. In 2003, the Institute of Medicine shared its vision statement for health professions education, asserting that “[a]ll health professionals should be educated to deliver patient-centered care as members of an interdisciplinary team, emphasizing evidence-based practice, quality improvement approaches and informatics” (Knebel & Greiner, 2003, p. 3). The importance of including team-based learning pedagogy in health profession education is viewed as critical to students’ preparation for challenges they will confront in their professional careers (Sibley & Parmelee, 2008). Despite the importance placed on teamwork in health sciences education, little attention has been devoted to understanding underlying factors influencing health sciences student attitudes towards learning in a team-based environment (Curran, Sharpe, Forristall, & Flynn, 2008). Moreover, there is less understanding of factors that influence attitudes towards team-based learning in prehealth students who are pursuing admission into a health profession program (Dumke, VanderWielen, Harris, & Ford-Smith, 2016). The purpose of this study is to explore the importance of specific non-academic factors, emotional intelligence and cultural intelligence, in shaping undergraduate pre-health students’ attitudes towards team-based learning. A quantitative, non-experimental, cross-sectional study design was used in this study employing correlational and multivariate regression analysis techniques. Findings indicate: a) significant relationships between emotional intelligence and cultural intelligence to the value students place on working in groups; and, b) emotional intelligence accounts for approximately 3% of variance above and beyond the Big Five personality factors in predicting student attitudes towards group work. This study has the potential to inform the development of interprofessional education policy and practice in two fundamental ways. First, the study provides insight on the importance of emotional and social competence in shaping students’ attitudes towards team-based learning. Secondly, increasing the understanding of emotional intelligence and cultural intelligence in the pre-health stage of a student’s development can influence the preparation of pre-health students for admissions to health professions programs.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 364, 'citationCount': 1, 'authors': [{'authorId': '10675791', 'name': 'Kevin A.

We used Mayer and Salovey's (1997) four-dimensional model of emotional intelligence and Organ's (1988) OCB construct to test the EI-OCB relationships. Using a sample of 137 clinical nurses, and analyzing the data with hierarchical multiple regressions, we obtained results indicating that the EI dimension perceiving emotion was linked to conscientiousness, and facilitating thinking wvas linked to civic virtue. Managing emotion was linked to conscientiousness, civic virtue, altruism and courtesy. There were no relationships between facilitating thinking and the OCB dimensions. Results suggest that EI may increase conscientiousness in performing nursing duties, and in the levels of involvement and participation in hospital affairs. Higher levels of emotional intelligence may also increase altruistic activities and discretionary coordinating efforts. However, there is no reason to expect that a poor work climate, and grieving, complaining behaviors will respond positively to increasing EI. Managers should realize that efforts to improve EI may not provide global results."", 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 48, 'citationCount': 22, 'authors': [{'authorId': '46954568', 'name': 'E.

Their analysis demonstrated early evidence of positive educational outcomes in terms of knowledge acquisition, participation and engagement, and team performance.

Drawing on brain and behavioural research, the author shows the factors at work when people of high IQ flounder and those of modest IQ do surprisingly well. These factors add up to a different way of succeeding in life - one the author terms ""emotional intelligence"". Emotional intelligence includes self-awareness and impulse control, persistence, zeal and self-motivation, empathy and social deftness. These are the qualities that mark people that excel. They are also the hallmarks of character and self-discipline, of altruism and compassion. As Goleman demonstrates, the personal costs of deficits in emotional intelligence can range from problems in marriage and poor physical health in adults to eating disorders and depression in children. But the news is hopeful. Emotional intelligence is not fixed at birth. Goleman\'s argument gives insights into the brain architecture underlying emotion and rationality. He shows how emotional intelligence can be nurtured and strengthened in all of us. Since the emotional lessons a child learns actually sculpt the brain\'s circuitry, Goleman provides detailed guidance as to how parents and schools can benefit from this.', 'year': 1995, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 6741, 'authors': [{'authorId': '32297977', 'name': 'D.

Successful teachers use strategies that regulate students' emotions and behaviors while also controlling their own emotions (stress, nervousness). To prepare teachers for the challenges of teaching, teacher training should include emotional and behavioral management strategies. Virtual Training Environments (VTEs) are effective at providing experiences and increasing learning in many domains. Creating VTEs for teachers can improve student learning and teacher retention. We introduce our current research aimed at integrating emotionally-intelligent virtual students within a 3D classroom training system. In our simulation, virtual students' emotional states will be determined from an appraisal process of actions taken by the teacher trainee in the virtual classroom. Virtual students will then display the appropriate non-verbal behaviors and react to the teacher accordingly.

The core of the system is a real-time 3D virtual simulation of a classroom, populated by twenty-four semi-autonomous virtual students. The system has been designed as a companion tool for classroom management seminars in a syllabus for primary and secondary school teachers. Whereby, it will allow lecturers to link theory with practice, using the medium of VR. The system is therefore designed for two users: a trainee teacher and an instructor supervising the training session. The teacher is immersed in a real-time 3D simulation of a classroom by means of a head-mounted display and headphone. The instructor operates a graphical desktop console which renders a view of the class and the teacher, whose avatar movements are captured by a marker-less tracking system. This console includes a 2D graphics menu with convenient behaviour and feedback control mechanisms to provide human-guided training sessions. The system is built using low-cost consumer hardware and software. Its architecture and technical design are described in detail. A first evaluation confirms its conformance to critical usability requirements (i.e., safety and comfort, believability, simplicity, acceptability, extensibility, affordability and mobility).

Aggregating 115 effect sizes from 83 studies, it finds that technological immersion has a medium-sized effect on presence.

Results indicate that engagement is a process comprised of four distinct stages: point of engagement, period of sustained engagement, disengagement, and reengagement. Furthermore, the process is characterized by attributes of engagement that pertain to the user, the system, and user-system interaction. We also found evidence of the factors that contribute to nonengagement. Emerging from this research is a definition of engagement—a term not defined consistently in past work—as a quality of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety-novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control.

Following a description of what is meant by E-learning environments and an overview of the four category model and design process known as the ARCS model, a variety of studies are summarized. The ARCS model is based on a synthesis of motivational concepts and a problem-solving approach to design, rather than the application of specific motivational solutions that are advocated without regard to the specific characteristics of a given situation. The first group of reviewed studies illustrates the results of testing the motivational design process in several different E-learning settings, in relation to learner self-regulation and in terms of the interaction of personality characteristics and motivational strategies. The second group of studies includes tests of the validity of a simplified motivational design process that has been used in diverse types of E-learning settings, including multiple countries and cultures.

We propose that the degree of immersion can be objectively assessed as the characteristics of a technology, and has dimensions such as the extent to which a display system can deliver an inclusive, extensive, surrounding, and vivid illusion of virtual environment to a participant. Other dimensions of immersion are concerned with the extent of body matching, and the extent to which there is a self-contained plot in which the participant can act and in which there is an autonomous response. Presence is a state of consciousness that may be concomitant with immersion, and is related to a sense of being in a place. Presence governs aspects of autonomie responses and higher-level behaviors of a participant in a VE.

In this context, the design of virtual characters must incorporate emotional expression at a nonverbal level looking for effective communication with the user. This exploratory study investigates the design features of an avatar functioning as a virtual assistant in educational contexts. From a multidisciplinary approach, the user's research was elaborated by a semi-open questionnaire of self-perception of emotional characteristics: likeability, attractiveness, and applicability of a set of six 2D and 3D characters. The results extracted from a sample of 69 university students provide a relevant information on design features and open new lines for future research. Aspects such as Ekman's basic emotion discrimination and the design of facial expression are analyzed. The incorporation of other body parts, their spatial orientation and contextual elements, seems to contribute to effective emotional communication. The results also highlight how the design of a virtual character should take into consideration the complexity involved in facial gestures and changes in relation to the vertical axis and planes of movement. Finally, this article discusses the complexity involved in expressing a given emotion in a virtual character.",2022,69,2,{'volume': '4'},"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-5.051525115966797,

The qualities that define these roles become associated with the category as a whole, thus forming a stereotype. In a vicious cycle, this stereotype then hinders category members’ movement into roles with different demands because their stereotype portrays them as well matched to their existing roles but not to these new roles. This vicious cycle has important implications for stereotype change. Given the difficulties of producing enduring change by directly attacking stereotypes in the minds of individuals, a more effective strategy consists of policies and programs that change the distributions of category members in roles, thereby changing stereotypes at their source. If the vicious cycle is not interrupted by such social change, observations of category members’ typical social roles continually reinstate existing stereotypes.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 38, 'citationCount': 34, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5689005', 'name': 'A.

This article revisits the central UV hypothesis, proposed by Masahiro Mori in 1970, to evaluate its impact on people's perception of characters created using computer graphics (CG). More precisely, our goal is to answer the following questions: 1) Are people feeling more comfortable with more recent CG characters than the older ones? 2) Does charisma or familiarity with virtual humans correlate with perceived comfort? To answer these questions, we first replicated an experiment from 2012 and compared the perception concerning CG characters then and now, and then we included images of more recent CG characters in our analysis. Our results indicate that the perceived comfort increased over time when comparing the characters of 2012 and 2020. However, it did not change significantly for the characters of 2012. In addition, we found a correlation between perceived charisma and familiarity, at all levels of realism, and between charisma and comfort.

Besides large body postures, recent studies have found emotions to affect rather subtle bodily expressions, such as slumped or upright sitting posture. This study investigated back muscle activity as an indication of an effect of positive and negative emotions on the sitting position. The electromyography (EMG) activity of six back muscles was recorded in 31 healthy subjects during exposure to positive and negative affective pictures. A resting period was used as a control condition. Increased muscle activity patterns in the back were found during the exposure to negative emotional stimuli, which was mainly measured in the lumbar and thorax regions. The positive emotion condition caused no elevated activity.

When two people collaborated to build blocks, their affects were recognized and labeled using the Affdex SDK and a descriptive analysis was provided. When participants turned to collaborate with Diana, their subjective responses were collected and the length of completion was recorded. Three modes of Diana were involved: a flat-faced Diana, a Diana that used mimicry facial expressions, and a Diana that used emotionally responsive facial expressions. Twenty-one responses were collected through a five-point Likert scale questionnaire and the NASA TLX. Results from questionnaires were not statistically different.

This study aimed to identify, using Laban Movement Analysis (LMA), the Laban motor elements (motor characteristics) that characterize movements whose execution enhances each of the basic emotions: anger, fear, happiness, and sadness. LMA provides a system of symbols describing its motor elements, which gives a written instruction (motif) for the execution of a movement or movement-sequence over time. Six senior LMA experts analyzed a validated set of video clips showing whole body dynamic expressions of anger, fear, happiness and sadness, and identified the motor elements that were common to (appeared in) all clips expressing the same emotion. For each emotion, we created motifs of different combinations of the motor elements common to all clips of the same emotion. Eighty subjects from around the world read and moved those motifs, to identify the emotion evoked when moving each motif and to rate the intensity of the evoked emotion. All subjects together moved and rated 1241 motifs, which were produced from 29 different motor elements. Using logistic regression, we found a set of motor elements associated with each emotion which, when moved, predicted the feeling of that emotion. Each emotion was predicted by a unique set of motor elements and each motor element predicted only one emotion. Knowledge of which specific motor elements enhance specific emotions can enable emotional self-regulation through adding some desired motor qualities to one's personal everyday movements (rather than mimicking others' specific movements) and through decreasing motor behaviors which include elements that enhance negative emotions."", 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 77, 'citationCount': 80, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3424994', 'name': 'T.

This hypothesis has become widely acknowledged both in the popular media and scientific research. Surprisingly, empirical evidence for the hypothesis has remained inconsistent. In the present article, we reinterpret the original uncanny valley hypothesis and review empirical evidence for different theoretically motivated uncanny valley hypotheses. The uncanny valley could be understood as the naïve claim that any kind of human-likeness manipulation will lead to experienced negative affinity at close-to-realistic levels. More recent hypotheses have suggested that the uncanny valley would be caused by artificial–human categorization difficulty or by a perceptual mismatch between artificial and human features. Original formulation also suggested that movement would modulate the uncanny valley. The reviewed empirical literature failed to provide consistent support for the naïve uncanny valley hypothesis or the modulatory effects of movement. Results on the categorization difficulty hypothesis were still too scarce to allow drawing firm conclusions. In contrast, good support was found for the perceptual mismatch hypothesis.

But what personality do they want robots to have? Previous research has found support for two contradicting theories: similarity attraction and complementary attraction. The similarity attraction theory implies that people prefer a robot with a similar personality to their own (e.g., an extroverted person prefers an extroverted robot). According to the complementary attraction theory, people prefer a robot's personality opposite to their own (e.g., extroverted people prefer an introverted robot). In contrast to both theories, we argue that what is considered an appropriate personality for a robot depends on the task context. In a 2×2 between-groups experiment (N=45), we found trends that indicated similarity attraction for extrovert participants when the robot was a tour guide and complementary attraction for introverted participants when the robot was a cleaner. These trends show that preferences for robot personalities may indeed depend on the context of the robot's role and the stereotype perceptions people hold for certain jobs. Robot behaviors likely need to be adapted not in complimentary or similarity to the users' personality but to the users' expectations about what kind of personality and behaviors are consistent with such a task or role."", 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 39, 'citationCount': 75, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1897729', 'name': 'M.

Contrary to the early assumption that body movement only indicates emotional intensity, recent studies have shown that body movement and posture also conveys emotion specific information. However, a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms is hampered by a lack of production studies informed by a theoretical framework. In this research we adopted the Body Action and Posture (BAP) coding system to examine the types and patterns of body movement that are employed by 10 professional actors to portray a set of 12 emotions. We investigated to what extent these expression patterns support explicit or implicit predictions from basic emotion theory, bidimensional theory, and componential appraisal theory. The overall results showed partial support for the different theoretical approaches. They revealed that several patterns of body movement systematically occur in portrayals of specific emotions, allowing emotion differentiation. Although a few emotions were prototypically expressed by one particular pattern, most emotions were variably expressed by multiple patterns, many of which can be explained as reflecting functional components of emotion such as modes of appraisal and action readiness.

In particular, he hypothesized that a person's response to a humanlike robot would abruptly shift from empathy to revulsion as it approached, but failed to attain, a lifelike appearance. This descent into eeriness is known as the uncanny valley. The essay appeared in an obscure Japanese journal called Energy in 1970, and in subsequent years, it received almost no attention. However, more recently, the concept of the uncanny valley has rapidly attracted interest in robotics and other scientific circles as well as in popular culture. Some researchers have explored its implications for human-robot interaction and computer-graphics animation, whereas others have investigated its biological and social roots. Now interest in the uncanny valley should only intensify, as technology evolves and researchers build robots that look human.

An android provides an experimental apparatus that has the potential to be controlled more precisely than any human actor. However, preliminary results indicate that only very humanlike devices can elicit the broad range of responses that people typically direct toward each other. Conversely, to build androids capable of emulating human behavior, it is necessary to investigate social activity in detail and to develop models of the cognitive mechanisms that support this activity. Because of the reciprocal relationship between android development and the exploration of social mechanisms, it is necessary to establish the field of android science. Androids could be a key testing ground for social, cognitive, and neuroscientific theories as well as platform for their eventual unification. Nevertheless, subtle flaws in appearance and movement can be more apparent and eerie in very humanlike robots. This uncanny phenomenon may be symptomatic of entities that elicit our model of human other but do not measure up to it. If so, very humanlike robots may provide the best means of pinpointing what kinds of behavior are perceived as human, since deviations from human norms are more obvious in them than in more mechanical-looking robots. In pursuing this line of inquiry, it is essential to identify the mechanisms involved in evaluations of human likeness. One hypothesis is that, by playing on an innate fear of death, an uncanny robot elicits culturally-supported defense responses for coping with death’s inevitability. An experiment, which borrows from methods used in terror management research, was performed to test this hypothesis.

This paper presents and discusses key issues in “aﬀective computing,” computing that relates to, arises from, or inﬂuences emotions. Models are sug- gested for computer recognition of human emotion, and new applications are presented for computer- assisted learning, perceptual information retrieval, arts and entertainment, and human health and inter- action.

In this letter, we propose a negative emotion management system that is able to recognize negative emotions through ECG signal and perform emotion regulation through a robot assistant, which has a potential for reducing health risks. A smart shirt is developed to collect the ECG signal from the human body. The robot assistant has the ability to engage in verbal conversations with humans. Recurrence Quantitative Analysis (RQA) is used to extract ECG features for emotion classification purpose. Along with our own dataset, two other public datasets, RECOLA and DECAF, are also used to evaluate our methodology. The detection of negative emotion can trigger the robot assistant to help the user get out of such situations through interactive conversations. We tested and evaluated the proposed framework through experiments. We also assessed the effectiveness of the interactions with the robot on the emotional well-being of older adults.",2021,37,7,"{'name': 'IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters', 'pages': '4040-4047',

In this article, we propose a regularized deep fusion framework for emotion recognition based on multimodal physiological signals. After extracting the effective features from different types of physiological signals, we construct ensemble dense embeddings of multimodal features using kernel matrices, and then utilize a deep network architecture to learn task-specific representations for each kind of physiological signal from these ensemble dense embeddings. Finally, a global fusion layer with a regularization term, which can efficiently explore the correlation and diversity among all of the representations in a synchronous optimization process, is designed to fuse generated representations. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that this framework can improve the performance of subject-independent emotion recognition compared to single-modal classifiers or other fusion methods.

Objective The objective of the study was to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a fully automated conversational agent to deliver a self-help program for college students who self-identify as having symptoms of anxiety and depression. Methods In an unblinded trial, 70 individuals age 18-28 years were recruited online from a university community social media site and were randomized to receive either 2 weeks (up to 20 sessions) of self-help content derived from CBT principles in a conversational format with a text-based conversational agent (Woebot) (n=34) or were directed to the National Institute of Mental Health ebook, “Depression in College Students,” as an information-only control group (n=36). All participants completed Web-based versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale at baseline and 2-3 weeks later (T2). Results Participants were on average 22.2 years old (SD 2.33), 67% female (47/70), mostly non-Hispanic (93%, 54/58), and Caucasian (79%, 46/58). Participants in the Woebot group engaged with the conversational agent an average of 12.14 (SD 2.23) times over the study period. No significant differences existed between the groups at baseline, and 83% (58/70) of participants provided data at T2 (17% attrition). Intent-to-treat univariate analysis of covariance revealed a significant group difference on depression such that those in the Woebot group significantly reduced their symptoms of depression over the study period as measured by the PHQ-9 (F=6.47; P=.01) while those in the information control group did not. In an analysis of completers, participants in both groups significantly reduced anxiety as measured by the GAD-7 (F1,54= 9.24; P=.004).

Objective This single-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to investigate the use of PARO, a therapeutic, socially assistive pet robot, in improving mood, and stimulating social interaction and communication for people with dementia in the community. Methods For the study, 40 community-dwelling older Chinese adults (≥60 years) with mild to moderate dementia will be recruited and randomly assigned to the PARO therapy group or the psychosocial activities control group. Both treatments consist of six, 30-minute weekly sessions, which will be conducted in a geriatric day hospital. Subjects in both groups will be assessed by a trained research assistant at baseline (pre-), during, and post-treatment. Mood (assessed with a simplified face scale), social interaction, and communication (ie, facial expressions and reactions towards each treatment, assessed with an observation table) will be the primary outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures will include assessments on cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination) and depressive symptoms (Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia), as well as caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Inventory). Subjective impression towards each treatment and qualitative comments from the caregivers, facilitator, and therapists will also be obtained. Results Recruitment to the pilot study began in 2014 and the last subject is expected to complete their post-treatment assessment in 2015.

Secondly, PARO's positive effects on older adults' activity levels show steady growth over the duration of our study, suggesting they are not due to short-term “novelty effects.” Finally, we show a variety of ways in which individual participants interacted with PARO and relate this to the “interpretive flexibility” of its design."", 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 20, 'citationCount': 230, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1746316', 'name': 'S.

We review the aspects of the response styles theory that have been well-supported, including evidence that rumination exacerbates depression, enhances negative thinking, impairs problem solving, interferes with instrumental behavior, and erodes social support. Next, we address contradictory and new findings. Specifically, rumination appears to more consistently predict the onset of depression rather than the duration, but rumination interacts with negative cognitive styles to predict the duration of depressive symptoms. Contrary to original predictions, the use of positive distractions has not consistently been correlated with lower levels of depressive symptoms in correlational studies, although dozens of experimental studies show positive distractions relieve depressed mood. Further, evidence now suggests that rumination is associated with psychopathologies in addition to depression, including anxiety, binge eating, binge drinking, and self-harm. We discuss the relationships between rumination and worry and between rumination and other coping or emotion-regulation strategies.

For the logistic map these measures enable us not only to detect transitions between chaotic and periodic states, but also to identify laminar states, i.e., chaos-chaos transitions.

71,5844822960f7143e9e0b3abd17f3e1a77d67aa62,A systematic review of virtual reality therapies for substance use disorders: Impact on secondary treatment outcomes.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Virtual reality (VR) therapy may be an effective tool in treating urges and cravings in substance use disorder (SUD). Given the high co-occurrence of difficulties with mood, anxiety, and emotional dysregulation with SUD, this review sought to examine the extant literature on the efficacy of VR for SUD in improving these secondary treatment outcomes.


METHODS
A systematic literature review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines in PubMed, PsychInfo, and Embase. Studies were included if they utilized immersive VR, were conducted with individuals with substance use disorder/dependence/misuse, and included measures of mood, anxiety, depression, emotional dysregulation, or retention in treatment.


RESULTS
Seven articles met our inclusion criteria. Five studies were conducted on patients using nicotine and utilized a cue-exposure intervention. VR was effective at reducing substance use and cravings in the majority of studies. Results on the efficacy of VR for improving mood, anxiety, and emotional regulation were mixed. Work examining retention in treatment was limited.


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
VR for SUD has the potential to improve mood and anxiety symptoms as well as retention in treatment for patients with SUD, particularly if the therapy targets these psychological symptoms. Future studies examining components of VR for SUD in individuals with drug use disorders, as well as examinations of targeted interventions for associated mood, emotional dysregulation, and retention in treatment, are necessary.


SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE
This is the first systematic review of the impact of VR on mood, anxiety, and emotional dysregulation for individuals with substance use.",2022,46,1,{'name': 'The American journal on

However, there is an unmet need for complementary approaches to treat OUD patients coping with pain; furthermore, few studies have probed neurobiological features of pain or its management during OUD treatment. This preliminary study examines neurobiological and behavioral effects of a virtual reality-based meditative intervention in patients undergoing methadone maintenance treatment (MMT).\n\n\nDESIGN\nProspective, non-blinded, single-arm, 12-week intervention with standardized assessments.\n\n\nSETTING\nAcademic research laboratory affiliated with an on-site MMT clinic.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFifteen (11 female) MMT patients completed a virtual reality, therapist-guided meditative intervention that included breathing and relaxation exercises; sessions were scheduled twice weekly. Assessments included functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of pain neuromatrix activation and connectivity (pre- and post-intervention), saliva cortisol and C-reactive protein (CRP) at baseline and weeks 4, 8 and 12; and self-reported pain and affective symptoms before and after each intervention session.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter each intervention session (relative to pre-session), ratings of pain, opioid craving, anxiety and depression (but not anger) decreased. Saliva cortisol (but not CRP) levels decreased from pre- to post-session. From pre- to post-intervention fMRI assessments, pain task-related left postcentral gyrus (PCG) activation decreased. At baseline, PCG showed positive connectivity with other regions of the pain neuromatrix, but this pattern changed post-intervention.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese preliminary findings demonstrate feasibility, therapeutic promise, and brain basis of a meditative intervention for OUD patients undergoing MMT.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 69, 'citationCount': 7, 'authors': [{'authorId': '114547972', 'name': 'M.

Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive technology that may provide effective behavioral therapeutics for chronic pain.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nObjective: To conduct a double-blind, parallel arm, single cohort, remote, randomized placebo-controlled trial for a self-administered behavioral skills-based VR program in community-based individuals with self-reported chronic low back pain during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMethods: A national online convenience sample of individuals with self-reported non-malignant low back pain > 6 months duration and with average pain intensity > 4/10 was enrolled and randomized 1:1 to one of two daily (56-day) VR programs: (1) EaseVRx (immersive pain relief skills VR program); or (2) Sham VR (2D nature content delivered in a VR headset). Objective device use data and self-reported data were collected. The primary outcomes were the between-group effect of EaseVRx versus Sham VR across time points, and the between-within interaction effect representing the change in average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, stress, mood, and sleep over time (baseline to end-of-treatment at day 56). Secondary outcomes were global impression of change and change in physical function, sleep disturbance, pain self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, pain acceptance, pain medication use, and user satisfaction. Analytic methods included intention-to-treat and a mixed-model framework.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe study sample was 179 adults (female: 77%; Caucasian: 91%; at least some college education: 92%; mean age: 51.5 years, SD=13.1; average pain intensity: 5/10, SD=1.2; back pain duration >5 years: 67%). No group differences were found for any baseline variable or treatment engagement. User satisfaction ratings were higher for EaseVRx vs. Sham VR (p<0.0001). For the between-groups factor, EaseVRx was superior to Sham VR for all primary outcomes (highest p-value = .0090), and between-groups Cohen's d effect sizes ranged from 0.40 to 0.49 indicating superiority was moderately clinically meaningful. For EaseVRx, large pre-post effect sizes ranged from 1.17-1.3 and met moderate to substantial clinical importance for reduced pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, mood, and stress. Between group comparisons for physical function and sleep disturbance showed superiority for the EaseVRx group vs. the Sham VR group (p=0.0224 and p=.0132, respectively). Pain catastrophizing, pain self-efficacy, pain acceptance, prescription opioid use (morphine milligram equivalent; MME) did not reach statistical significance for either group. Use of over-the-counter analgesic use was reduced for EaseVRx (p<0.01) but not for ShamVR.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEaseVRx had high user satisfaction and superior and clinically meaningful symptom reduction for average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, mood, and stress compared to sham VR. Additional research is needed to determine durability of treatment effects and to characterize mechanisms of treatment effects. Home-based VR may expand access to effective and on-demand non-pharmacologic treatment for chronic low back pain.\n\n\nCLINICALTRIAL\nClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04415177.\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT\nRR2-25291."", 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 53, 'authors': [{'authorId': '6714981', 'name': 'B.

Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive technology and emerging digital behavioral pain therapy with analgesic efficacy for acute pain. We found no scientific literature on skills-based VR behavioral programs for chronic pain populations. Objective The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a self-administered VR program that included content and skills informed by evidence-based behavioral treatment for chronic pain. The secondary aim is to determine the preliminary efficacy of the VR program in terms of average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, stress, mood, and sleep, and its impact on pain-related cognition and self-efficacy. The tertiary aim was to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and compare the VR treatment with an audio-only treatment. This comparison isolated the immersive effects of the VR program, thereby informing potential mechanisms of effect. Methods We conducted an RCT involving a web-based convenience sample of adults (N=97) aged 18-75 years with self-reported chronic nonmalignant low back pain or fibromyalgia, with an average pain intensity >4 over the past month and chronic pain duration >6 months. Enrolled participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 unblinded treatments: (1) VR: a 21-day, skills-based VR program for chronic pain; and (2) audio: an audio-only version of the 21-day VR program. The analytic data set included participants who completed at least 1 of 8 surveys administered during the intervention period: VR (n=39) and audio (n=35). Results The VR and audio groups launched a total of 1067 and 1048 sessions, respectively. The majority of VR participants (n=19/25, 76%) reported no nausea or motion sickness. High satisfaction ratings were reported for VR (n=24/29, 83%) and audio (n=26/33, 72%). For VR efficacy, symptom improvement over time was found for each pain variable (all P<.001), with results strengthening after 2 weeks. Importantly, significant time×group effects were found in favor of the VR group for average pain intensity (P=.04), pain-related inference with activity (P=.005), sleep (P<.001), mood (P<.001), and stress (P=.003). For pain catastrophizing and pain self-efficacy, we found a significant declining trend for both treatment groups. Conclusions High engagement and satisfaction combined with low levels of adverse effects support the feasibility and acceptability of at-home skills-based VR for chronic pain. A significant reduction in pain outcomes over the course of the 21-day treatment both within the VR group and compared with an audio-only version suggests that VR has the potential to provide enhanced treatment and greater improvement across a range of pain outcomes.

Among the main consequences of chronic and excessive alcohol use are cognitive and executive deficits. Some of these deficits may be reversed in specific cognitive and executive domains with behavioral approaches consisting of cognitive training. The advent of computer-based interventions may leverage these improvements, but randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of digital interactive-based interventions are still scarce. Objective The aim of this study is to explore whether a cognitive training approach using VR exercises based on activities of daily living is feasible for improving the cognitive function of patients with AUD undergoing residential treatment, as well as to estimate the effect size for this intervention to power future definitive RCTs. Methods This study consisted of a two-arm pilot RCT with a sample of 36 individuals recovering from AUD in a therapeutic community; experimental group participants received a therapist-guided, VR-based cognitive training intervention combined with treatment as usual, and control group participants received treatment as usual without cognitive training. A comprehensive neuropsychological battery of tests was used both at pre- and postassessments, including measurement of global cognition, executive functions, attention, visual memory, and cognitive flexibility. Results In order to control for potential effects of global cognition and executive functions at baseline, these domains were controlled for in the statistical analysis for each individual outcome. Results indicate intervention effects on attention in two out of five outcomes and on cognitive flexibility in two out of six outcomes, with effect sizes in significant comparisons being larger for attention than for cognitive flexibility. Patient retention in cognitive training was high, in line with previous studies. Conclusions Overall, the data suggest that VR-based cognitive training results in specific contributions to improving attention ability and cognitive flexibility of patients recovering from AUD.

Research in alcohol, marijuana, and nicotine use disorders have linked coping motives (e.g. using substances to ameliorate negative emotional states) to problematic substance use. We evaluated the link between emotion regulation difficulties (as assessed via the difficulties in emotion regulation scale [DERS]) and motives for drug use (as assessed via the Drug Use Motives Questionnaire) among individuals (n = 68) with opioid use disorders who were in methadone maintenance treatment. We found that the DERS total score was significantly associated with coping motives for use. Nonacceptance of emotional responses was the only DERS domain that offered nonredundant prediction of coping motives.

But the extent to which SUD interventions impact emotional outcomes among general SUD populations is yet unquantified. The current meta-analysis aims to fill this gap.\n\n\nMETHOD\nA total of 11,754 records were screened for randomized, controlled trials examining the effect of behavioral SUD interventions on emotion outcomes. Our search yielded a total of 138 effect sizes calculated based on data from 5,146 individuals enrolled in 30 independent clinical trials. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to calculate pooled effect sizes, and metaregression analyses examined study-level moderators (e.g., intervention type).\n\n\nRESULTS\nFindings indicated a small but significant effect of SUD interventions on emotion outcomes, d = 0.157, 95% CI [0.052, 0.262] (k = 30). The effect size for negative emotion was nominally bigger, d = 0.162, 95% CI [0.056, 0.269] (k = 30), whereas the effect for positive emotion did not reach statistical significance, d = 0.062, 95% CI [-0.089, 0.213] (k = 7). Studies featuring SUD interventions designed to specifically target emotions (i.e., affect-regulation, mindfulness-based treatments) produced larger reductions in negative emotion compared with studies featuring interventions that did not contain specific emotion modules (e.g., contingency management).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFindings suggest that SUD interventions-especially mindfulness-based and affect-regulation treatments-indeed significantly reduce negative emotion, although relatively small effect sizes indicate potential room for improvement. Conclusions regarding positive emotion should be considered preliminary because of the limited numbers of samples assessing these outcomes.

With virtual reality (VR), computer-generated interactive environments, individuals can repeatedly experience their problematic situations and be taught, via evidence-based psychological treatments, how to overcome difficulties. VR is moving out of specialist laboratories. Our central aim was to describe the potential of VR in mental health, including a consideration of the first 20 years of applications. A systematic review of empirical studies was conducted. In all, 285 studies were identified, with 86 concerning assessment, 45 theory development, and 154 treatment. The main disorders researched were anxiety (n = 192), schizophrenia (n = 44), substance-related disorders (n = 22) and eating disorders (n = 18). There are pioneering early studies, but the methodological quality of studies was generally low. The gaps in meaningful applications to mental health are extensive. The most established finding is that VR exposure-based treatments can reduce anxiety disorders, but there are numerous research and treatment avenues of promise. VR was found to be a much-misused term, often applied to non-interactive and non-immersive technologies. We conclude that VR has the potential to transform the assessment, understanding and treatment of mental health problems. The treatment possibilities will only be realized if – with the user experience at the heart of design – the best immersive VR technology is combined with targeted translational interventions. The capability of VR to simulate reality could greatly increase access to psychological therapies, while treatment outcomes could be enhanced by the technology's ability to create new realities.

The objectives of this study were to observe trends in treatment utilization; examine correlates of treatment utilization and treatment types/settings among adolescent substance users with and without substance use disorder (SUD); and assess gender differences.\n\n\nMETHODS\nNational Survey on Drug Use and Health data were pooled across 2002 to 2013, with a combined sample of 79,885 past-year substance users ages 12 to 17 (17,510 with SUD and 62,375 without SUD). Treatment was defined as receiving treatment or counseling for use of alcohol or any drug, not counting cigarettes. Trends were assessed by joinpoint linear regression, and multivariable logistic regression assessed odds ratios of treatment utilization.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPercentages of past-year treatment use did not change in 2002 to 2013. Treatment utilization was more prevalent among adolescents with SUD than without (11.4% vs. 1.4%) and among males than females. Among adolescents with and without SUD, criminal justice involvement and perceiving a need for treatment increased adolescent treatment utilization, while SUDs other than alcohol abuse, older age, and talking to parents increased treatment use among adolescents with SUD, and polysubstance use and male gender increased treatment among those without SUD. Treatment gaps persisted among non-Hispanic Blacks for both groups with and without SUD, male Hispanics with SUD, female non-Hispanic Asians without SUD, and private insurance coverages. Gender differences were observed in SUD, race/ethnicity, and insurance coverage. Most adolescents received treatment for both alcohol and drug use, and self-help group and outpatient rehabilitation facility were the most used treatment settings.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTreatment utilization among adolescents with past-year substance use remained low and unimproved in 2002 to 2013. Treatment gaps among minority populations, insurance coverage, and in educating adolescents on seeking relevant treatment must be addressed.

Various methods to study craving exist; however, suppressing craving to successfully promote abstinence remains an unmet clinical need in SUDs. One reason is that social and environmental contexts recalling drug and alcohol consumption in the everyday life of patients suffering from SUDs often initiate craving and provoke relapse. Current behavioral therapies for SUDs use the cue-exposure approach to suppress salience of social and environmental contexts that may induce craving. They facilitate learning and cognitive reinforcement of new behavior and entrain craving suppression in the presence of cues related to drug and alcohol consumption. Unfortunately, craving often overweighs behavioral training especially in real social and environmental contexts with peer pressure encouraging the use of substance, such as parties and bars. In this perspective, virtual reality (VR) is gaining interest in the development of cue-reactivity paradigms and practices new skills in treatment. VR enhances ecological validity of traditional craving-induction measurement. In this review, we discuss results from (1) studies using VR and alternative virtual agents in the induction of craving and (2) studies combining cue-exposure therapy with VR in the promotion of abstinence from drugs and alcohol use. They used virtual environments, displaying alcohol and drugs to SUD patients. Moreover, some environments included avatars. Hence, some studies have focused on the social interactions that are associated with drug-seeking behaviors and peer pressure. Findings indicate that VR can successfully increase craving.

It remains unclear what interventions can help them to quit smoking.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions, with and without specific mood management components, in smokers with current or past depression.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nIn April 2013, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, other reviews, and asked experts for information on trials.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nCriteria for including studies in this review were that they had to be randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing smoking cessation interventions in adult smokers with current or past depression. Depression was defined as major depression or depressive symptoms. We included studies where subgroups of participants with depression were identified, either pre-stated or post hoc. The outcome was abstinence from smoking after six months or longer follow-up. We preferred prolonged or continuous abstinence and biochemically validated abstinence where available.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nWhen possible, we estimated pooled risk ratios (RRs) with the Mantel-Haenszel method (fixed-effect model). We also performed subgroup analyses, by length of follow-up, depression measurement, depression group in study, antidepressant use, published or unpublished data, format of intervention, level of behavioural support, additional pharmacotherapy, type of antidepressant medication, and additional nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nForty-nine RCTs were included of which 33 trials investigated smoking cessation interventions with specific mood management components for depression. In smokers with current depression, meta-analysis showed a significant positive effect for adding psychosocial mood management to a standard smoking cessation intervention when compared with standard smoking cessation intervention alone (11 trials, N = 1844, RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.92). In smokers with past depression we found a similar effect (13 trials, N = 1496, RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.77). Meta-analysis resulted in a positive effect, although not significant, for adding bupropion compared with placebo in smokers with current depression (5 trials, N = 410, RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.27). There were not enough trial data to evaluate the effectiveness of fluoxetine and paroxetine for smokers with current depression. Bupropion (4 trials, N = 404, RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.31 to 3.18) might significantly increase long-term cessation among smokers with past depression when compared with placebo, but the evidence for bupropion is relatively weak due to the small number of studies and the post hoc subgroups for all the studies. There were not enough trial data to evaluate the effectiveness of fluoxetine, nortriptyline, paroxetine, selegiline, and sertraline in smokers with past depression.Twenty-three of the 49 trials investigated smoking cessation interventions without specific components for depression. There was heterogeneity between the trials which compared psychosocial interventions with standard smoking cessation counselling for both smokers with current and past depression. Therefore, we did not estimate a pooled effect. One trial compared nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) versus placebo in smokers with current depression and found a positive, although not significant, effect (N = 196, RR 2.64, 95% CI 0.93 to 7.45). Meta-analysis also found a positive, although not significant, effect for NRT versus placebo in smokers with past depression (3 trials, N = 432, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.60). Three trials compared other pharmacotherapy versus placebo and six trials compared other interventions in smokers with current or past depression. Due to heterogeneity between the interventions of the included trials we did not estimate pooled effects.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nEvidence suggests that adding a psychosocial mood management component to a standard smoking cessation intervention increases long-term cessation rates in smokers with both current and past depression when compared with the standard intervention alone. Pooled results from four trials suggest that use of bupropion may increase long-term cessation in smokers with past depression. There was no evidence found for the use of bupropion in smokers with current depression. There was not enough evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of the other antidepressants in smokers with current or past depression. There was also not enough evidence to evaluate the group of trials that investigated interventions without specific mood management components for depression, including NRT and psychosocial interventions."", 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 189, 'citationCount': 135, 'authors': [{'authorId': '38912434', 'name': 'R.

Of the more than 300 citations extracted, 44 were placebo-controlled clinical trials, 14 of which were selected for this analysis and included 848 patients: 5 studies of tricyclic antidepressants, 7 of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, and 2 from other classes\n\n\nDATA EXTRACTION\nWe independently screened the titles and abstracts of each citation, identified placebo-controlled trials of patients with both substance dependence and depression, applied the inclusion criteria, and reached consensus. Data on study methods, sample characteristics, and depression and substance use outcomes were extracted. The principal measure of effect size was the standardized difference between means on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS).\n\n\nDATA SYNTHESIS\nFor the HDS score, the pooled effect size from the random-effects model was 0.38 (95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.58). Heterogeneity of effect on HDS across studies was significant (P <.02), and studies with low placebo response showed larger effects. Moderator analysis suggested that diagnostic methods and concurrent psychosocial interventions influenced outcome. Studies with larger depression effect sizes (>0.5) demonstrated favorable effects of medication on measures of quantity of substance use, but rates of sustained abstinence were low.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAntidepressant medication exerts a modest beneficial effect for patients with combined depressive- and substance-use disorders. It is not a stand-alone treatment, and concurrent therapy directly targeting the addiction is also indicated. More research is needed to understand variations in the strength of the effect, but the data suggest that care be exercised in the diagnosis of depression-either by observing depression to persist during at least a brief period of abstinence or through efforts by clinical history to screen out substance-related depressive symptoms.', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 78, 'citationCount': 501, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3795745', 'name': 'E.

Fear of flying was assessed before, immediately after, and 6 months after treatment. Posttreatment and 6-month follow-up assessments revealed reduced fear of flying only in the VR exposure groups. VR exposure with or without motion simulation yielded comparable treatment outcomes.

In this research paper, VR is applied in engineering education, the scope being to compare three major VR systems with the traditional education approach when we do not use any VR system (No-VR). The Corner Cave System (CCS) is compared with the Head Mounted Display (HMD) system. Both of these systems are using a tracking system to reflect the user movements in the virtual environment. The CCS uses only three coordinates: x-, y- and z-axis. The HMD system has six degrees of freedom, the x-, y- and z-axis, as well as the roll, pitch and yaw. Those two systems are also compared with HMD, as a standalone device (HMD-SA) without the tracking system where it has only roll, pitch and yaw. The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of VR systems on the students’ achievements in engineering colleges. The research examined the effect of the four different methods and compared the scores of the students after each test. The experiments were ran over 48 students. Those systems show incredible results.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 19, 'citationCount': 192, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1842200', 'name': 'W.

Virtual reality (VR) may potentially be effectively utilized in anger management, and this study aimed to verify the applicability of the VR-based anger control training program. The data obtained by having 60 young male participants divided into 2 groups, the high aggression group and the low aggression group, based on their Aggression Questionnaire scores to execute this program were analyzed. The program consisted of ""Anger Exposure Training"" for provoking anger and facilitating anger control and ""Mindfulness Training"" for providing the meditation experience for controlling anger. The anger scores and comfort scores obtained from these tasks, respectively, were analyzed for differences between the groups and between the experimental conditions. The anger regulation and comfort enhancement rates were analyzed for correlations with psychological variables. In Anger Exposure Training, the anger scores in angry expression were reduced in managed expression of anger in both groups. In Mindfulness Training, meditation increased comfort score as well in both groups, and the comfort enhancement rates were negatively correlated with the levels of self-differentiation and open communication with mother only in the high aggression group. These results indicate that the VR environments can provide an effective means of trainings for managing anger. Therefore, further research on the effectiveness of the VR-based anger control training program is worthy conducting in individuals who express excessive aggression.",2022,34,3,"{'name':

Developing interventions that slow down cognitive decline would greatly benefit the autonomy of these elderly, as well as their caretakers. Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive and interactive human-computer interface with real-time simulation that is suggested to be a promising tool to improve cognitive functioning. This literature review discusses the features of immersive VR, including its opportunities and limitations, that are of special relevance for improving cognition in elderly. First, the high flexibility of VR allows for personalized and safe training of potentially harmful situations and isolated aspects of tasks. Second, VR’s dynamic and real-time feedback on performance provides a labor-extensive tool for caretakers in elderly care. Third, the acquisition of high resolution data enables the exposure of subtle changes over time, relevant for detecting the nature and extent of cognitive changes in elderly, including those with dementia. Fourth, immersive VR has been related to cybersickness. Finally, VR is immersive and enables the perception and expression of emotions, motor behaviors, and multiple senses. Aged subjects are found to have sparing of emotional learning and show increased reliance on multisensory integration for learning. Moreover, they experience high levels of flow, motivation, and presence in VR setups. Despite the clear potential of immersive VR, the studies available are small scale and have not been replicated. The digital illiteracy of elderly and healthcare personnel form an additional barrier for implementation.

Continuous-variable analysis strategies drawing from a general linear model framework can be applied to such designs. The growing emphasis on dimensional examinations of psychological constructs, encouraged by the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria framework, encourages continuous-variable analytic strategies. However, the interpretative implications of applying these strategies to various types of populations and sample score distributions, including those used in EGDs, are not always recognized. Appropriateness and utility of EGDs depend in part on whether the goal is to determine whether a relationship exists between 2 variables or to determine its strength. Whereas the literature investigating EGDs has emphasized symmetrical thresholds for defining extreme groups (e.g., bottom 10% vs. top 10%), psychopathologists often employ asymmetric thresholds (e.g., above a diagnostic threshold vs. a broader range of scores in a healthy comparison group). The present article selectively reviews literature on EGDs and extends it with simulations of symmetric and asymmetric selection criteria. Results indicate that including a wide range of scores in EGDs substantially mitigates problems (e.g., inflation of effect size) that arise when using statistical methods classically employed for continuous variables.

We conducted a systematic review to determine whether virtual reality (VR) simulation training can supplement and/or replace conventional patient-based endoscopy training for health professional trainees with limited or no prior endoscopic experience. Methods\u2002We searched medical, educational, and computer literature databases in July 2017 for trials that compared VR simulation training with no training, conventional training, another form of simulation training, or an alternative method of VR training. We screened, abstracted data, and performed quantitative analysis and quality assessment through Cochrane methodology. Results\u2002We included 18 trials with 3817 endoscopic procedures. VR training provided no advantage over no training or conventional training based on the primary outcome of composite score of competency. VR training was advantageous over no training based on independent procedure completion (relative risk [RR]\u200a=\u200a1.62, 95\u200a% confidence interval [CI] 1.15\u200a–\u200a2.26, moderate-quality evidence), overall rating of performance (mean difference [MD] 0.45, 95\u200a%CI 0.15\u200a–\u200a0.75, very low-quality evidence), and mucosal visualization (MD 0.60, 95\u200a%CI 0.20\u200a–\u200a1.00, very low-quality evidence).

Gaze-down percentage and subjective fear rating showed a significant group difference, but HR did not. The SSQ scores were within the acceptable level.

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT®) is the most effective treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder, but demand for DBT® far exceeds existing clinical resources. Most patients with BPD never receive DBT®. Incorporating computer technology into the DBT® could help increase dissemination. Immersive Virtual Reality technology (VR) is becoming widely available to mainstream consumers. This case study explored the feasibility/clinical potential of using immersive virtual reality technology to enhance DBT® mindfulness skills training of a 32 year old female diagnosed with BPD. Prior to using VR, the patient experienced difficulty practicing DBT® mindfulness due to her emotional reactivity, and difficulty concentrating. To help the patient focus her attention, and to facilitate DBT® mindfulness skills learning, the patient looked into virtual reality goggles, and had the illusion of slowly “floating down” a 3D computer-generated river while listening to DBT® mindfulness training audios. Urges to commit suicide, urges to self harm, urges to quit therapy, urges to use substances, and negative emotions were all reduced after each VR mindfulness session and VR mindfulness was well accepted/liked by the patient. Although case studies are scientifically inconclusive by nature, results from this feasibility study were encouraging. Future controlled studies are needed to quantify whether VR-enhanced mindfulness training has long term benefits e.g., increasing patient acceptance and/or improving therapeutic outcome.

Various methods to study craving exist; however, suppressing craving to successfully promote abstinence remains an unmet clinical need in SUDs. One reason is that social and environmental contexts recalling drug and alcohol consumption in the everyday life of patients suffering from SUDs often initiate craving and provoke relapse. Current behavioral therapies for SUDs use the cue-exposure approach to suppress salience of social and environmental contexts that may induce craving. They facilitate learning and cognitive reinforcement of new behavior and entrain craving suppression in the presence of cues related to drug and alcohol consumption. Unfortunately, craving often overweighs behavioral training especially in real social and environmental contexts with peer pressure encouraging the use of substance, such as parties and bars. In this perspective, virtual reality (VR) is gaining interest in the development of cue-reactivity paradigms and practices new skills in treatment. VR enhances ecological validity of traditional craving-induction measurement. In this review, we discuss results from (1) studies using VR and alternative virtual agents in the induction of craving and (2) studies combining cue-exposure therapy with VR in the promotion of abstinence from drugs and alcohol use. They used virtual environments, displaying alcohol and drugs to SUD patients. Moreover, some environments included avatars. Hence, some studies have focused on the social interactions that are associated with drug-seeking behaviors and peer pressure. Findings indicate that VR can successfully increase craving.

We evaluated emotional variables (sadness, anxiety, and anger, using standard instruments), state of mindfulness (using the Mindfulness Awareness Attention Scale), and attentional control variables using objective measures such as a continuous performance task and the Stroop task before and after mindfulness training. Results: Our study provides data that suggest that mindfulness training significantly improves measures of trait anger and attentional control.

It is generally believed that the greater the size of the crowd of bystanders, the less the chance that any of them will intervene. A complementary model is that social identity is critical as an explanatory variable. For example, when the bystander shares common social identity with the victim the probability of intervention is enhanced, other things being equal. However, it is generally not possible to study such hypotheses experimentally for practical and ethical reasons. Here we show that an experiment that depicts a violent incident at life-size in immersive virtual reality lends support to the social identity explanation. 40 male supporters of Arsenal Football Club in England were recruited for a two-factor between-groups experiment: the victim was either an Arsenal supporter or not (in-group/out-group), and looked towards the participant for help or not during the confrontation. The response variables were the numbers of verbal and physical interventions by the participant during the violent argument. The number of physical interventions had a significantly greater mean in the in-group condition compared to the out-group. The more that participants perceived that the Victim was looking to them for help the greater the number of interventions in the in-group but not in the out-group. These results are supported by standard statistical analysis of variance, with more detailed findings obtained by a symbolic regression procedure based on genetic programming. Verbal interventions made during their experience, and analysis of post-experiment interview data suggest that in-group members were more prone to confrontational intervention compared to the out-group who were more prone to make statements to try to diffuse the situation.', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 41, 'citationCount': 152, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144931212', 'name': 'M.

Feminist perspectives assume patriarchal control to be at the root of domestic violence, and see anger and alcohol as excuses for abusive behaviour. Psychological approaches identify anger and alcohol as risk factors for violence in some subgroups of offenders. A risk–needs model is presented, in which a distinction is drawn between acute and stable dynamic risk factors. Both may be targets of intervention, but addressing stable dynamic risk factors is more likely to effect enduring change. A theoretical understanding is required to identify stable dynamic risk factors, and here we suggest an affective defence approach to anger-related domestic violence and a social problem solving approach to alcohol-related domestic violence.

We then address issues regarding temporal stability and situational specificity and speculate on the conceptual and operational distinctiveness of mindfulness. We conclude this paper by discussing implications for instrument development and briefly describing our own approach to measurement.', 'year': 2006, 'referenceCount': 99, 'citationCount': 6033, 'authors': [{'authorId': '8022427', 'name': 'Scott R.

This paper describes the results of principal-components analyses of Presence Questionnaire (PQ) data from 325 participants following exposure to immersive virtual environments. The analyses suggest that a 4-factor model provides the best fit to our data. The factors are Involvement, Adaptation/Immersion, Sensory Fidelity, and Interface Quality. Except for the Adaptation/Immersion factor, these factors corresponded to those identified in a cluster analysis of data from an earlier version of the questionnaire. The existence of an Adaptation/Immersion factor leads us to postulate that immersion is greater for those individuals who rapidly and easily adapt to the virtual environment. The magnitudes of the correlations among the factors indicate moderately strong relationships among the 4 factors. Within these relationships, Sensory Fidelity items seem to be more closely related to Involvement, whereas Interface Quality items appear to be more closely related to Adaptation/Immersion, even though there is a moderately strong relationship between the Involvement and Adaptation/Immersion factors.', 'year': 2005, 'referenceCount': 32, 'citationCount': 559, 'authors': [{'authorId': '66831741', 'name': 'B.

Twenty-eight male participants, aged 14-18, with social problems, took part in this study. They were separated into three groups: a control group, a VR group, and a non-VR group. The VR and non-VR groups underwent eight sessions of neurofeedback training over 2 weeks, while the control group just waited during the same period. The VR group used a head-mounted display (HMD) and a head tracker, which let them look around the virtual world. Conversely, the non-VR group used only a computer monitor with a fixed viewpoint. All participants performed a continuous performance task (CPT) before and after the complete training session. The results showed that both the VR and non-VR groups achieved better scores in the CPT after the training session, while the control group showed no significant difference.

In Study 2 we found moderate levels of agreement between ratings of competence by subjects and their roommates. Interpersonal competence scores were also related in predictable ways to subject and roommate reports of masculinity and femininity, social self-esteem, loneliness, and social desirability.

The study is conducted at a virtual restaurant in Second Life, an online simulation website. The results show that there is a significant interaction effect between consumption stage and the type of emotional responses. Although both anxiety and anger are the most intense emotions felt during preprocess waiting, anxiety is the strongest emotion felt during in-process waiting, and anger is the most salient emotional reaction during postprocess waiting. Results also indicate that there is a significant interaction effect between consumption stage and the type of emotion regulation strategies used by consumers. Attentional deployment and reappraisal are dominant emotion regulation strategies used by consumers during preprocess waiting; in addition, reappraisal and attentional deployment are the predominant strategies used during in-process waiting and postprocess waiting, respectively.

Therefore, this research examines the psychological effects of foreign-language signs on potential diners.

In each of these three experiments, the authors found that a restaurant sign’s language has statistically significant effects on potential diner’s perceptions of the restaurant’s brand personality.

Results indicate that consumers pursue multiple goals within the consumption experience, and the importance of those goals differs across consumption episodes within the experience. Using pace as a service attribute, it was found that goal progress moderates the impact of service attributes on consumer satisfaction.

The product may have high or low quality, and consumers are heterogeneously informed. The firm chooses a slow or (at a cost) a fast service rate. In equilibrium, informed consumers join the queue if it is below a threshold. The threshold varies with the quality of the good, so an uninformed consumer updates her belief about quality on observing the length of the queue. The strategy of an uninformed consumer has a “hole”: she joins the queue at lengths both below and above the hole, but not at the hole itself. We show that if the prior probability the product has high quality and the proportion of informed consumers are both low, a high-quality firm may select a slower service rate than a low-quality firm. The queue can therefore be a valuable signaling device for a high-quality firm. Strikingly, in some scenarios, the high-quality firm may choose the slow service rate even if the technological cost of speeding up is zero. \n \nThis paper was accepted by Assaf Zeevi, stochastic models and simulation.', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 18, 'citationCount': 87, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2801804', 'name': 'L.

Specifically, this study investigates how specific emotions (anger, disappointment or regret, worry) influence consumers' behavioral intentions. To gain a richer understanding of consumers' coping behaviors, the authors examine customers' locus of failure attributions. By using a 3 × 2 factorial between-subjects design, three attribution types (internal, external, and control condition) are matched with two service recovery outcomes (positive and negative). Findings suggest that customers with feelings of anger and disappointment or regret are likely to engage in various dissatisfaction responses (e.g., direct complaining, negative word-of-mouth, and switching), whereas worried customers are not. Attributing the failure to internal or external causes reduce switching and negative word-of-mouth intentions.

Much of the book is (not surprisingly) devoted to benchmarking, a topic of extreme familiarity to quality professionals, but only relatively recently introduced to process engineering applications. Benchmarking techniques are delineated based on data-driven and model-driven techniques, and on single input– single output and multiple input–multiple output systems. The general benchmarking coverage culminates with a chapter-long simulation study of a divided wall column distillation process. Other chapters cover economic auditing of control systems, locating sources of disturbances, technical issues with control-system benchmarking, and new research directions. The strongest of these is the economic auditing (in Chap. 2), almost three-fourths of which is devoted to a case study of an oil-production platform. The mix of managerial and engineering methodology and verbiage is optimal. The weakest chapter covers the location of disturbances. Giving short shrift to statistical techniques, the authors ignore much relevant literature in this vital area. The case study is of little use for elucidation; it is too short, and uses a small subset of available methodology. The interested reader is referred to Blanke, Kinnaert, Lunze, and Staroswiecki (2006) for a thorough coverage of locating disturbances in control systems. The final chapter is definitely tailored for the academician interested in cutting-edge process-control scholarship. The proposed new research directions are no doubt relevant, covering new performance metrics, algorithms, and performance analysis. But this largely amounts to straining at gnats, since there is a wealth of literature available on many applicable statistically-based techniques. The most salient is algorithmic process control, and the general integration of statistical process control with engineering process control. Montgomery (2004) offers a superb introduction and coverage of the major corpus in this subject. Overall, the book accomplishes its ostensible purpose. The mix of theory and application will most likely appeal more to the academic reader than the industrial practitioner. The caveat here is that the academician in question needs a thorough background in control theory. This is not an introductory text for interlopers wishing to break into process control-theoretic research. Despite certain shortcomings, the current piece is a nice addition to the process control library. Any interested academic researchers from this area should strongly consider purchasing it. Conversely, most practitioners will find it too pedantic. This is hardly an indictment of this text, as the entire series seems to target the ivory tower.

This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory.

First, they review evidence that the ability to exercise such conscious, intentional control is actually quite limited, so that most of moment-to-mom ent psychological life must occur through nonconscious means if it is to occur at all. The authors then describe the different possible mechanisms that produce automatic, environmental control over these various phenomena and review evidence establishing both the existence of these mechanisms as well as their consequences for judgments, emotions, and behavior. Three major forms of automatic self-regulation are identified: an automatic effect of perception on action, automatic goal pursuit, and a continual automatic evaluation of one's experience.

Its position as an integrated program within the SAS statistical package makes it an ideal choice for empirical researchers and applied statisticians seeking to do data reduction, management, and analysis within a single statistical package. Because the program was developed from the perspective of a “mixed” statistical model with both random and fixed effects, its syntax and programming logic may appear unfamiliar to users in education and the social and behavioral sciences who tend to express these models as multilevel or hierarchical models. The purpose of this paper is to help users familiar with fitting multilevel models using other statistical packages (e.g., HLM, MLwiN, MIXREG) add SAS PROC MIXED to their array of analytic options. The paper is written as a step-by-step tutorial that shows how to fit the two most common multilevel models: (a) school effects models, designed for data on individuals nested within naturally occurring hierarchies (e.g., students within classes); and (b) individual growth models, designed for exploring longitudinal data (on individuals) over time. The conclusion discusses how these ideas can be extended straighforwardly to the case of three level models.

Developmental Changes in Mental Performance. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 1973, 38 (3, Serial No. 150). A distinction was made between the general level of a person\'s IQ (i.e., the average of his scores across age) and his profile contour (i.e., the developmental pattern of inflections in performance). Most research has focused on the general level of IQ and its correlates; this project systematically investigated patterns of IQ change with data from the Fels Longitudinal Study. Normal middle-class children changed an average of 28.5 IQ points between 21/2 and 17 years of age, and one in seven displayed shifts of more than 40 points. While siblings were more similar in their general level of IQ than unrelated children matched or unmatched for social class, the pattern of developmental changes in childhood IQs or infant DQs was not more similar among siblings than among unrelated children. Twins and triplets scored lower in general level and were less variable in IQ over age than singletons, thus potentially qualifying attempts to generalize IQ change results based upon multiple-birth samples to singletons. Parent-child IQ correlations were higher when the parent was assessed as an adult than if both parent and child were tested at the same chronological ages. A sample of 80 subjects who had relatively complete IQ data (maximum of 17 tests) between 2/2 and 17 years were clustered into five groups which represented different patterns of IQ change over age. These profiles were relatively simple linear or quadratic trends and not random fluctuations about a constant value. Major inflection points occurred at 6 and 10 years of age. It was not obvious that these patterns were simple products of repeated testing or the changing nature of the IQ test. The children in the five IQ profile clusters had parents who were different in the extent to which they attempted to accelerate their child\'s development and the severity of punishments they administered. These parental correlates appeared to hold up even when parental education and IQ as well as the general level of the child\'s IQ were statistically controlled. Given the assumptions prompted by these data, the changing nature of environmental circumstances across the childhood years for a given individual may be as potent in changing IQ as the differences between family environments.

THE LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES IN IQ Several reviews of the literature on the development of mental performance are available (Bayley 1970; Bloom 1964; Pinneau 1961). However, most of the research surveyed involves correlations between mental test performance at several different ages and correlations between personality and social variables with IQ at one age versus another. Such research strategies are valuable and have yielded important results, but they are ""developmental"" only in the sense that data are available at several ages on the same subjects and correlational relationships are derived within and across age periods. Because the correlation coefficient is independent of the means of the distributions, it is possible to obtain high correlational stability of IQ across age but marked fluctuations in the group mean. In short, cross-age correlations reveal little about the nature of absolute changes in level of performance, and they provide only partial information about individual differences in developmental pattern. This project focuses on developmental patterns of change in the level of mental performance as assessed by traditional intelligence tests.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 97, 'citationCount': 6663, 'authors': [{'authorId': '143887530', 'name': 'R.

Recent theories claim emotions can also be differentiated by distinctive action tendencies, actions, and emotivational goals.

Results support hypotheses specifying characteristic responses for fear, sadness, distress, frustration, disgust, dislike, anger, regret, guilt, and shame.

Core affect can therefore be experienced as free-floating (mood) or can be attributed to some cause (and thereby begin an emotional episode).

75,804586ab998daedc4ea4ee96e9886d1124cd5c58,Decreased Emotional Dysregulation Following Multi-Modal Motion-Assisted Memory Desensitization and Reconsolidation Therapy (3MDR): Identifying Possible Driving Factors in Remediation of Treatment-Resistant PTSD,"Multi-modal motion-assisted memory desensitization and reconsolidation therapy (3MDR), an interactive, virtual reality-assisted, exposure-based intervention for PTSD, has shown promising results for treatment-resistant posttraumatic stress disorder (TR-PTSD) among military members (MMs) and veterans in randomized controlled trials (RCT). Previous research has suggested that emotional regulation (ER) and emotional dysregulation (ED) may be factors which are correlated with symptom severity and maintenance of TR-PTSD. This embedded mixed-methods pilot study (n = 9) sought to explore the impact of 3MDR on ER and ED of MMs and veterans. Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale (DERS-18) data were collected at baseline, prior to each session, and at one week, one month, and three months postintervention and analyzed. Qualitative data collected from sessions, debriefs, and follow-up interviews were transcribed and descriptively analyzed. Results demonstrated statistically significant decreases in DERS-18 scores from preintervention to postintervention at each timepoint. Qualitatively, participants perceived improvements in ER within specified DERS-18 domains. We describe how 3MDR’s unique and novel approach addresses ED through cognitive–motor stimulation, narration, divergent thinking, reappraisal of aversive stimuli, dual-task processing, and reconsolidation of traumatic memories. More studies are needed to better understand the underlying neurobiological mechanisms by which 3MDR addresses ER and PTSD.",2021,45,5,"{'name': 'International Journal of Environmental Research and

Although psychotherapy can reduce symptoms, some military members may experience treatment-resistant PTSD. Multimodular motion-assisted memory desensitization and reconsolidation (3MDR) has been introduced as a virtual reality (VR) intervention for military members with PTSD related to military service. The 3MDR intervention incorporates exposure therapy, psychotherapy, eye movement desensitization and reconsolidation, VR, supportive counselling, and treadmill walking. Objective The objective of this study is to investigate whether 3MDR reduces PTSD symptoms among military members with combat-related treatment-resistant PTSD (TR-PTSD); examine the technology acceptance and usability of the Computer Assisted Rehabilitation ENvironment (CAREN) and 3MDR interventions by Canadian Armed Forces service members (CAF-SMs), veterans, 3MDR clinicians, and operators; and evaluate the impact on clinicians and operators of delivering 3MDR. Methods This is a mixed-methods waitlist controlled crossover design randomized controlled trial. Participants include both CAF-SMs and veterans (N=40) aged 18-60 years with combat-related TR-PTSD (unsuccessful experience of at least 2 evidence-based trauma treatments). Participants will also include clinicians and operators (N=12) who have been trained in 3MDR and subsequently utilized this intervention with patients. CAF-SMs and veterans will receive 6 weekly 90-minute 3MDR sessions. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months postintervention. Quantitative data collection will include multiomic biomarkers (ie, blood and salivary proteomic and genomic profiles of neuroendocrine, immune-inflammatory mediators, and microRNA), eye tracking, electroencephalography, and physiological data. Data from outcome measures will capture self-reported symptoms of PTSD, moral injury, resilience, and technology acceptance and usability. Qualitative data will be collected from audiovisual recordings of 3MDR sessions and semistructured interviews. Data analysis will include univariate and multivariate approaches, and thematic analysis of treatment sessions and interviews. Machine learning analysis will be included to develop models for the prediction of diagnosis, symptom severity, and treatment outcomes. Results This study commenced in April 2019 and is planned to conclude in April 2021. Study results will guide the further evolution and utilization of 3MDR for military members with TR-PTSD and will have utility in treating other trauma-affected populations. Conclusions The goal of this study is to utilize qualitative and quantitative primary and secondary outcomes to provide evidence for the effectiveness and feasibility of 3MDR for treating CAF-SMs and veterans with combat-related TR-PTSD. The results will inform a full-scale clinical trial and stimulate development and adaptation of the protocol to mobile VR apps in supervised clinical settings. This study will add to knowledge of the clinical effectiveness of 3MDR, and provide the first comprehensive analysis of biomarkers, technology acceptance and usability, moral injury, resilience, and the experience of clinicians and operators delivering 3MDR.

Several protective and risk factors have been identified in civilians and veterans to explain why some individuals develop PTSD and others do not. However, no research has confirmed the relationship between emotion regulation and PTSD in deployed German Armed Forces service members after a foreign assignment. Previous studies have identified some protective factors, such as social support, social acknowledgment, specific personal values, and posttraumatic growth, as well as risk factors, like moral injury and emotion regulation. Thus, the aim of the present study is to confirm the relationship between emotion regulation and PTSD and to test for factors that are associated with higher severity of PTSD symptoms in such a sample. Methods A post-hoc secondary analysis was conducted on data collected in a randomized controlled trial. Participants (N = 72) were male active and former military service members that have returned from deployment and were recruited from the German Armed Forces. These participants were separated into two groups according to PTSD diagnosis based on the results of a structured diagnostic interview. Data from evaluation questionnaires administered upon entry into the study were subjected to a cross-sectional analysis. The measures included the severity of PTSD symptoms, clusters of PTSD symptoms, clinical measures, and several measures assessing PTSD-related constructs. Analyses included the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, X2 tests for nominal data, Mann-Whitney U-tests for non-parametric data, and a mediation analysis. Results The results of the mediation analysis revealed that difficulties in emotion regulation were significantly associated with the severity of PTSD symptoms, which was mediated by social acknowledgment and experimental avoidance but not by moral injury. The analyses showed that the severity of PTSD symptoms and all clusters of PTSD symptoms were significantly associated with most of the measured constructs in expectable directions. Participants in the PTSD group showed significantly higher mean scores on questionnaires measuring constructs that have been associated with PTSD, like emotion regulation and moral injury. They also showed lower mean scores in questionnaires for social support and social acknowledgment as a victim or survivor than participants in the non-PTSD group. Conclusion The present results show that difficulties in emotion regulation are directly associated with the severity of PTSD symptoms in service members of the German Armed Forces. This association is mediated by social acknowledgment and experimental avoidance, but not by moral injury. Thus, future studies should investigate these potentially crucial factors for better understanding of the development and maintenance of PTSD in service members of the German Armed Forces after deployment to create possible treatment adaptions.

In addition, it is yet to be known how EP‐ and ER‐related areas are interactively linked to regulatory behavior, and whether this interaction is disrupted in MDD. In our study, regional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and whole‐brain functional connectivity (FC) of meta‐analytic‐driven EP‐ and ER‐related areas were compared between 32 healthy controls (HC) and 20 MDD patients. Then, we aimed to investigate whether the EP‐related areas can predict the ER‐related areas and regulatory behavior in both groups. Finally, the brain–behavior correlations between the EP‐ and ER‐related areas and depression severity were assessed. We found that: (a) affective areas are regionally and/or connectively disturbed in MDD; (b) EP‐ER interaction seems to be disrupted in MDD; overburden of emotional reactivity in amygdala may inversely affect cognitive control processes in prefrontal cortices, which leads to diminished regulatory actions.

Early abuse and neglect can deregulate the child's developing neurobiological system by reducing its resistance to stressful events, leading to later problems of emotional regulation. Children who have been subjected to physical or emotional abuse tend to pay more attention to signs that contain anger and are hypersensitive to threat. Scar hypothesis and the theories of behavioural sensitization or electrophysiological kindling suggest that emotional traumas may leave traces that persist even after remission of depression, and render individuals vulnerable to the onset of new episodes, even under the influence of only moderate psychosocial stress. Unfavorable early social experiences, such as emotional abuse or institutionalization can affect the structure and function of the prefrontal cortex. Exposure to repeated emotional stressors, even in the absence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnoses, has been shown to produce increased synapse formation and dendritic growth in basolateral amygdala, dendritic retraction in the hippocampus, and anxiety-like behavior against specific triggers, such as phobia of open spaces. During the narration of an emotionally traumatic event, there is activation of the limbic system, the right amygdale, the orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate gyrus. In addition, there is an activation of the anterior insula, which records the physical impact of negative emotions, and the anterior and medial temporal cortex, which are involved in negative emotions. Neuroimaging studies in PTSD patients have found hypoactivity in the frontal lobe, anterior cingulate and thalamic areas, indicating the effects of PTSD on executive function, attention and cognitive, memorial, and affective and somatosensory integration. One of the most replicated findings in studies involving PTSD patients is the decreased activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Studies have also found a negative correlation between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and amygdala activation. A recent meta-analysis revealed structural brain abnormalities associated with PTSD and emotional trauma and suggested that global brain volume reductions can distinguish PTSD from major depression. Neuroimaging studies of successful eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) treatment have consistently shown that patients exhibited increased frontal lobe activation. Moving beyond diagnostic boundaries, focusing on the causal interplay between specific traumatic processes and using standardized measures, are useful directions for future research in memory, emotion and emotional trauma."", 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 83, 'citationCount': 28, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5306765', 'name': 'O.

A novel virtual reality and motion-assisted exposure therapy, called 3MDR, provides treatment in an immersive, personalized and activating context. Objective: To study the efficacy of 3MDR for veterans with treatment-resistant PTSD. Method: In a randomized controlled trial (n = 43) 3MDR was compared to a non-specific treatment component control group. Primary outcome was clinician-rated PTSD symptoms at baseline, after 3MDR, and at the 12-week and 16-week follow-up (primary end point). Intention-to-treat analyses of covariance and mixed models were applied to study differences between groups at the end point and over the course of intervention, controlling for baseline scores. Results: The decrease in PTSD symptom severity from baseline to end point was significantly greater for 3MDR as compared to the control group, with a large effect size (F[1, 37] = 6.43, p = 0.016, d = 0.83). No significant between-group difference was detected in the course of PTSD symptoms during treatment when including all time points. The dropout rate was low (7%), and 45% of the patients in the 3MDR group improved clinically. The number needed to treat was 2.86. Conclusions: In this trial, 3MDR significantly decreased PTSD symptoms in veterans with, on average, a history of 4 unsuccessful treatments. The low dropout rate may be indicative of high engagement.

Since its formal introduction in the DSM‐III in 1980, knowledge has grown significantly regarding its causes, maintaining mechanisms and treatments. Despite this increased understanding, however, the actual definition of the disorder remains controversial. The DSM‐5 and ICD‐11 define the disorder differently, reflecting disagreements in the field about whether the construct of PTSD should encompass a broad array of psychological manifestations that arise after trauma or should be focused more specifically on trauma memory phenomena. This controversy over clarifying the phenotype of PTSD has limited the capacity to identify biomarkers and specific mechanisms of traumatic stress. This review provides an up‐to‐date outline of the current definitions of PTSD, its known prevalence and risk factors, the main models to explain the disorder, and evidence‐supported treatments. A major conclusion is that, although trauma‐focused cognitive behavior therapy is the best‐validated treatment for PTSD, it has stagnated over recent decades, and only two‐thirds of PTSD patients respond adequately to this intervention. Moreover, most people with PTSD do not access evidence‐based treatment, and this situation is much worse in low‐ and middle‐income countries.

A Systematic Review on Suggested Mechanisms of Action', 'abstract': 'Background: Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing [EMDR] is an innovative, evidence-based and effective psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]. As with other psychotherapies, the effectiveness of EMDR contrasts with a limited knowledge of its underlying mechanism of action. In its relatively short life as a therapeutic option, EMDR has not been without controversy, in particular regarding the role of the bilateral stimulation as an active component of the therapy. The high prevalence of EMDR in clinical practice and the dramatic increase in EMDR research in recent years, with more than 26 randomized controlled trials published to date, highlight the need for a better understanding of its mechanism of action. Methods: We conducted a thorough systematic search of studies published until January 2018, using PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Knowledge and Scopus databases that examined the mechanism of action of EMDR or provided conclusions within the framework of current theoretical models of EMDR functioning. Results: Eighty-seven studies were selected for review and classified into three overarching models; (i) psychological models (ii) psychophysiological models and (iii) neurobiological models. The evidence available from each study was analyzed and discussed. Results demonstrated a reasonable empirical support for the working memory hypothesis and for the physiological changes associated with successful EMDR therapy. Recently, more sophisticated structural and functional neuroimaging studies using high resolution structural and temporal techniques are starting to provide preliminary evidence into the neuronal correlates before, during and after EMDR therapy. Discussion: Despite the increasing number of studies that published in recent years, the research into the mechanisms underlying EMDR therapy is still in its infancy.

In veterans with PTSD, up to two-thirds retain their diagnosis after psychotherapy and often their disorder is treatment-resistant, which calls for improvement of therapeutic approaches for this population. One of the factors hypothesized to underlie low response in PTSD treatment is high behavioral and cognitive avoidance to traumatic reminders. In the current paper we explore if a combination of personalized virtual reality, multi-sensory input, and walking during exposure can enhance treatment engagement, overcome avoidance, and thereby optimize treatment effectiveness. Virtual reality holds potential to increase presence and in-session attention and to facilitate memory retrieval. Multi-sensory input such as pictures and music can personalize this experience. Evidence for the positive effect of physical activity on fear extinction and associative thinking, as well as embodied cognition theories, provide a rationale for decreased avoidance by literally approaching cues of the traumatic memories. A dual-attention task further facilitates new learning and reconsolidation. These strategies have been combined in an innovative framework for trauma-focused psychotherapy, named Multi-modular Motion-assisted Memory Desensitization and Reconsolidation (3MDR). In this innovative treatment the therapeutic setting is changed from the face-to-face sedentary position to a side-by-side activating context in which patients walk toward trauma-related images in a virtual environment. The framework of 3MDR has been designed as a boost for patients with treatment-resistant PTSD, which is illustrated by three case examples. The intervention is discussed in context of other advancements in treatment for treatment-resistant PTSD. Novel elements of this approach are activation, personalization and empowerment. While developed for veterans with PTSD who do not optimally respond to standardized treatments, this innovative framework holds potential to also be used for other patient populations and earlier stages of treatment for patients with PTSD.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 92, 'citationCount': 38, 'authors': [{'authorId': '41037107', 'name': 'M.

Yet, the fear based conceptualization fails to consider the rules of modern combat, the culture of combatants, operational stressors and the moral dimension. Recently there is renewed interest in moral distress and moral injury with a focus on guilt, shame, and anger. Accumulating evidence suggests a link between transgression of moral values and symptoms of guilt and shame, anger, suicidal ideation, and PTSD in military servicemen and veterans. Although proper assessment is still in its infancy, there is a need to better understand how moral decisions can affect the mental health of military personnel at any point during their careers, including postrelease. The authors illustrate this with three clinical case reports. They conclude with a call for attention to the relation between the incurrence of moral injurious distress, and the role of guilt and shame as drivers for chronicity of PTSD.

This paper outlines a novel approach that builds on a cognitive-motor interaction in a virtual interactive environment. It is based on the theory of memory reconsolidation and the embodiment of cognition. The framework we envision allows the patient to 'step into the past' by using forward motion as an essential ingredient to augment the impact of exposure to traumatic events. The behavioural response of approaching that is the exact opposite from the avoidance usually applied by patients and the enhancement of divergent thinking are the most prominent hypothesized mechanisms of action. This can contribute to strengthening of personal efficacy and self-reflection that is generated by high emotional engagement, as well as a sense of accomplishment and enhanced recovery as illustrated by a clinical case example.

In Canada, the military mental health system has received heavy investment to improve occupational outcomes. We investigated military occupational outcomes of diagnosed mental disorders in a cohort of 30,513 personnel who deployed on the Afghanistan mission. Methods: Cohort members were military personnel who deployed on the Afghanistan mission from 2001 to 2008. Mental disorder diagnoses and their attribution to the Afghanistan mission were ascertained via medical records in a stratified random sample (n = 2014). Career-limiting medical conditions (that is, condition-associated restrictions that reliably lead to medically related attrition) were determined using administrative data. Outcomes were assessed from first Afghanistan-related deployment return. Results: At 5 years of follow-up, the Kaplan-Meier estimated cumulative fraction with career-limiting medical conditions was 40.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 35.5 to 46.4) among individuals with Afghanistan service–related mental disorders (ARMD), 23.6% (CI 15.5 to 31.8) with other mental disorders, and 11.1% (CI 8.9 to 13.3) without mental disorders. The adjusted Cox regression hazard ratios for career-limiting medical condition risk were 4.89 (CI 3.85 to 6.23) among individuals with ARMD and 2.31 (CI 1.48 to 3.60) with other mental disorders, relative to those without mental disorders. Conclusions: Notwithstanding the Canadian military’s mental health system investments, mental disorders (particularly ARMD) still led to a high risk of adverse military occupational outcomes.

The client attends to alternating bilateral visual, auditory or sensory stimulation while confronted with emotionally disturbing material. It is thought that the bilateral stimulation as a specific element of EMDR facilitates accessing and processing of negative material while presumably creating new associative links. We hypothesized that the putatively facilitated access should be reflected in increased activation of the amygdala upon bilateral EMDR stimulation even in healthy subjects. Methods We investigated 22 healthy female university students (mean 23.5 years) with fMRI. Subjects were scanned while confronted with blocks of disgusting and neutral picture stimuli. One third of the blocks was presented without any additional stimulation, one third with bilateral simultaneous auditory stimulation, and one third with bilateral alternating auditory stimulation as used in EMDR. Results Contrasting disgusting vs. neutral picture stimuli confirmed the expected robust effect of amygdala activation for all auditory stimulation conditions. The interaction analysis with the type of auditory stimulation revealed a specific increase in activation of the right amygdala for the bilateral alternating auditory stimulation. Activation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex showed the opposite effect with decreased activation. Conclusions We demonstrate first time evidence for a putative neurobiological basis of the bilateral alternating stimulation as used in the EMDR method. The increase in limbic processing along with decreased frontal activation is in line with theoretical models of how bilateral alternating stimulation could help with therapeutic reintegration of information, and present findings may pave the way for future research on EMDR in the context of posttraumatic stress disorder.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 61, 'citationCount': 41, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5028854', 'name': 'Deborah Herkt'}, {'authorId': '5447616', 'name': 'V.

Distinguishing between treatment responders vs. non-responders in this population has become an important public health priority. This study was conducted to identify pre-treatment characteristics of U.S. veterans with combat-related PTSD that might contribute to favorable and unfavorable responses to high value treatments for this condition. Method This study focused on 805 patients who completed a VHA PTSD residential program between 2000 and 2007. These patients completed the PTSD Clinical Checklist at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and a four-month follow-up assessment. Latent growth curve analysis (LCGA) was incorporated to determine trajectories of changes in PTSD across these assessments and whether several key clinical concerns for this population were associated with their treatment responses. Study Findings LCGA indicated three distinct trajectories in PTSD outcomes and identified several clinical factors that were prospectively linked with changes in veterans' posttraumatic symptomatology. When compared to a group with high PTSD symptom severity that decreased over the program but relapsed at follow-up (41%), the near half (48.8%) of the sample with an improving trajectory had less combat exposure and superior physical/mental health. However, when compared to a minority (10.2%) with relatively low symptomatology that also remained somewhat stable, patients in the improving group were younger and also reported greater combat exposure, poorer physical/mental health status, and more problems with substance abuse before the start of treatment. Conclusions Findings suggest that veterans are most likely to benefit from residential treatment in an intermediate range of symptoms and risk factors, including PTSD symptom severity, history of combat exposure, and comorbid issues with physical/mental health.

Consistent with these revisions, we postulate two models of emotion dysregulation in PTSD in which fear is not the prevailing emotion but is only one of several components implicated in a dysregulated emotional system that also mediates problems regulating anger, guilt, shame, dissociation, and numbing. We discuss whether there is a relationship between fear and other emotion regulation systems that may help further our understanding of PTSD and its underlying neurocircuitry. Two pathways describing the relationship between fear and other emotion regulation systems in PTSD are proposed. The first pathway describes emotion dysregulation as an outcome of fear conditioning through stress sensitization and kindling. The second pathway views emotion dysregulation as a distal vulnerability factor and hypothesizes a further exacerbation of fear and other emotion regulatory problems, including the development of PTSD after exposure to one or several traumatic event(s) later in life.

Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are both widely used in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There has, however, been debate regarding the advantages of one approach over the other. This study sought to determine whether there was any evidence that one treatment was superior to the other. Method. We performed a systematic review of the literature dating from 1989 to 2005 and identified eight publications describing treatment outcomes of EMDR and CBT in active–active comparisons. Seven of these studies were investigated meta-analytically. Results. The superiority of one treatment over the other could not be demonstrated. Trauma-focused CBT and EMDR tend to be equally efficacious. Differences between the two forms of treatment are probably not of clinical significance. While the data indicate that moderator variables influence treatment efficacy, we argue that because of the small number of original studies, little benefit is to be gained from a closer examination of these variables. Further research is needed within the framework of randomized controlled trials. Conclusions. Our results suggest that in the treatment of PTSD, both therapy methods tend to be equally efficacious. We suggest that future research should not restrict its focus to the efficacy, effectiveness and efficiency of these therapy methods but should also attempt to establish which trauma patients are more likely to benefit from one method or the other.

However, the functional relationship between these brain regions in PTSD has not been directly examined.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo examine the relationship between the amygdala and medial prefrontal regions during symptom provocation in male combat veterans (MCVs) and female nurse veterans (FNVs) with PTSD.\n\n\nDESIGN\nCase-control study.\n\n\nSETTING\nAcademic medical center.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nVolunteer sample of 17 (7 men and 10 women) Vietnam veterans with PTSD (PTSD group) and 19 (9 men and 10 women) Vietnam veterans without PTSD (control group).\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nWe used positron emission tomography and the script-driven imagery paradigm to study regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during the recollection of personal traumatic and neutral events. Psychophysiologic and emotional self-report data also were obtained to confirm the intended effects of script-driven imagery.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe PTSD group exhibited rCBF decreases in medial frontal gyrus in the traumatic vs neutral comparison. When this comparison was conducted separately by subgroup, MCVs and FNVs with PTSD exhibited these medial frontal gyrus decreases. Only MCVs exhibited rCBF increases in the left amygdala. However, for both subgroups with PTSD, rCBF changes in medial frontal gyrus were inversely correlated with rCBF changes in the left amygdala and the right amygdala/periamygdaloid cortex. Furthermore, in the traumatic condition, for both subgroups with PTSD, symptom severity was positively related to rCBF in the right amygdala and negatively related to rCBF in medial frontal gyrus.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results suggest a reciprocal relationship between medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala function in PTSD and opposing associations between activity in these regions and symptom severity consistent with current functional neuroanatomic models of this disorder.', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 44, 'citationCount': 759, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4807594', 'name': 'L.

Therapeutic adherence is reported a problem in military populations compromising treatment efficacy. Therefore, a new potential supplementary treatment is specially designed for patients with cr-PTSD. This intervention is called Military Motion Memory Desensitization and Reprocessing (3MDR). The treatment incorporates key elements of successful treatments as Virtual Reality Exposure (VRE) and Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing (EMDR) and adds motion to the condition. We aimed at designing a treatment procedure that preserved dual task processing principle, yet introduced new engagement by performing the desensitization during motion by to walking on a treadmill. Moreover, we aimed at exposure to real high-affect pictures of deployment setting. Subjects walk a repetitive cycle while walking and viewing high affect pictures of deployment scenes. Dual task processing was maintained by an oscillating ball. Aspects of presence are adhered to, to maximize possible positive outcome.\n\n\nMETHOD\nTwo veterans with chronic PTSD, received four weekly sessions of 3MDR therapy. The indicator of effectiveness was difference in CAPS (Clinical Administrated PTSD Scale)-score. The treatment was designed on the Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment (CAREN) facility.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe 3MDR treatment did further decrease PTSD symptoms. Patients were highly satisfied about the treatment and had no attention to drop out.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe results of the two cases suggest that the 3MDR treatment is a successful, more additional treatment that goes further into the patients affect where other treatment may stagnate. The presence was highly appreciated.

A convenient, although not comprehensive, presentation of required sample sizes is provided here. Effect-size indexes and conventional values for these are given for operationally defined small, medium, and large effects. The sample sizes necessary for .80 power to detect effects at these levels are tabled for eight standard statistical tests: (a) the difference between independent means, (b) the significance of a product-moment correlation, (c) the difference between independent rs, (d) the sign test, (e) the difference between independent proportions, (f) chi-square tests for goodness of fit and contingency tables, (g) one-way analysis of variance, and (h) the significance o f a multiple or multiple partial correlation. The preface to the first edition of my power handbook (Cohen, 1969) begins: During my first dozen years o f teaching and consulting o n applied statistics with behavioral scientists, 1 became increasingly impressed with the importance of statistical power analysis, an importance which was increased an order of magnitude by its neglect in our textbooks and curricula. The case for its importance is easily made: What behavioral scientist would view with equanimity the question of the probability that his investigation would lead to statistically significant results, i.e., its power? (p. vii) This neglect was obvious through casual observation and had been confirmed by a power review of the 1960 volume of the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, which found the mean power to detect medium effect sizes to be .48 (Cohen, 1962). Thus, the chance of obtaining a significant result was about that of tossing a head with a fair coin. I attributed this disregard of power to the inaccessibility of a meager and mathematically difficult literature, beginning with its origin in the work of Neyman and Pearson (1928,1933). The power handbook was supposed to solve the problem. It required no more background than an introductory psychological statistics course that included significance testing. The exposition was verbal-intuitive and carried largely by many worked examples drawn from across the spectrum of behavioral science. In the ensuing two decades, the book has been through revised (1977) and second (1988) editions and has inspired dozens of power and effect-size surveys i n many areas of the social and life sciences (Cohen, 1988, pp. xi-xii). During this period, there has been a spate of articles on power analysis in the social science literature, a baker's dozen of computer programs (re"", 'year': 1992, 'referenceCount': 7, 'citationCount': 32977, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145670758', 'name': 'Jacob Cohen'}]}]"

This includes services for verticals that demand Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC). Scheduling strongly impacts the communication latency, and 5G NR introduces grant-free scheduling to reduce the latency at the radio level. Grant-free scheduling can use shared resources and the transmission of K replicas per packet to increase the packet delivery ratio and efficiently utilize the spectrum. Previous studies have shown that existing 5G NR grant-free scheduling has limitations to sustain URLLC requirements for aperiodic (or uncertain) and deterministic traffic that is characteristic of verticals such as Industry 4.0 or manufacturing. In this context, this paper proposes and evaluates a novel grant-free scheduling scheme that can efficiently support deterministic and aperiodic uplink traffic. The scheme avoids packet collisions among UEs sharing resources using a priority-based contention resolution process that relies on the transmission of announcement messages in minislots and a local channel sensing process. This study demonstrates that the proposed sensing-based grant-free scheduling scheme outperforms current 5G NR grant-free scheduling implementations, and can support a higher number of UEs with URLLC and deterministic requirements with a considerably lower number of radio resources.', 'year': 2022, 'referenceCount': 23, 'citationCount': 8, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1400804664', 'name': 'M.

The interest in such WiFi-based sensing systems arises from practical advantages including its ease of operation indoors as well as ready compliance from monitored individuals. Unlike other sensing methods, such as wearables, camera-based imaging, and acoustic-based solutions, WiFi technology is easy to implement and unobtrusive.

Syrian (Mesocricetus auratus) and dwarf (Phodopus sp.) hamsters are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the laboratory setting. However, pet shop-related COVID-19 outbreaks have not been reported. Methods We conducted an investigation of a pet shop-related COVID-19 outbreak due to Delta variant AY.127 involving at least three patients in Hong Kong. We tested samples collected from the patients, environment, and hamsters linked to this outbreak and performed whole genome sequencing analysis of the RT-PCR-positive samples. Results The patients included a pet shop keeper (Patient 1), a female customer of the pet shop (Patient 2), and the husband of Patient 2 (Patient 3). Investigation showed that 17.2% (5/29) and 25.5% (13/51) environmental specimens collected from the pet shop and its related warehouse, respectively, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR. Among euthanized hamsters randomly collected from the storehouse, 3% (3/100) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR and seropositive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody by ELISA. Whole genome analysis showed that although all genomes from the outbreak belonged to the Delta variant AY.127, there were at least 3 nucleotide differences among the genomes from different patients and the hamster cages. Genomic analysis suggests that multiple strains have emerged within the hamster population, and these different strains have likely transmitted to human either via direct contact or via the environment. Conclusions Our study demonstrated probable hamster-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. As pet trading is common around the world, this can represent a route of international spread of this pandemic virus.', 'year': 2022, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 18, 'authors': [{'authorId': '153420629', 'name': 'J.

This study proposes mixed reality (MR)-based human–animal interaction content along with presenting the experimental verification of its effect on the reduction of mental stress. A mental arithmetic task was employed to induce acute mental stress, which was followed by either MR content, in which a participant interacted with virtual animals via gestures and voice commands, or a slide show of animal images. During the experiment, an electrocardiogram (ECG) was continuously recorded with a patch-type, wireless ECG sensor on the chest of the subject, and their psychological state was evaluated with the help of questionnaires after each task.

The popular media portrayal of the human benefits of pet ownership is often biased and overstated, oftentimes creating unrealistic expectations for pet owners. There is evidence that pets can be beneficial to the health and well-being of their owners in certain circumstances; however, there is also evidence that negative or ambivalent relationships between owners and pets can be a detriment to owner well-being, as well as a risk for shelter relinquishment (i.e., surrender) of the pet. Relinquishment due to adverse scenarios like the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may increase rates of shelter euthanasia of adoptable pets. In this study we identify the unique difficulties related to caring for pets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pet owners reported concerns related to pets, humans, and the entire household or family, inclusive of people and pets. Data from this study indicate that strength of the owner’s attachment to their pet, as well as their economic resources, and the characteristics of their household are associated with the types of concerns expressed. We discuss implications for human well-being and pet welfare, and the need to address these issues in order to prevent shelter relinquishment. Abstract Pets may be a positive presence for their owners during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, it is pertinent to identify the hardships associated with pet ownership. We conducted a large-scale survey of U.S. pet owners (n = 2254) in spring and summer 2020 to assess the ways that relationships with pets impacted life during COVID-19. We used thematic analysis to analyze 3671 open-ended responses to three prompts. Reported concerns fell into three major categories: (1) pet-focused (meeting needs of pets; procuring supplies; accessing veterinary care; new and emerging behavioral issues; fate of the pet if owner becomes ill; general safety and well-being), (2) human-focused (issues with working from home; well-being and mental health; balancing responsibilities), and (3) household-focused (disease spread; economic issues). Quantitative analyses showed that the owner’s strength of attachment to their pet, economic resources, and relationship status were associated with the types of concerns expressed. Results from this study indicate that pet owners experienced unique hardships related to changes in everyday life from the COVID-19 pandemic. These hardships should be considered alongside the potential benefits found in other studies in order to manage pet owner expectations, prevent pet relinquishment, and more fully understand multifaceted human-companion animal relationships.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 68, 'citationCount': 117, 'authors': [{'authorId': '49059797', 'name': 'Jennifer W.

On the other hand, many people have pets such as dogs and cats, and they are friends or even family members for human beings. Then, surveillance cameras have been developed and used for monitoring pets, who are in houses while the owners are away from home. However, the recognition of pet faces is very difficult since there are a variety of patterns on the face. It is not sure that pet faces can be recognized with the same methods as the faces of human beings. Therefore, we have investigated the methods to detect pet faces, especially for cats and dogs. We have used Haar-like and HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) features to construct the classifiers of pet faces. In addition, we have tried to investigate which is better for the pet face detection to use either whole face or parts of the face such as eyes and nose.

The research was conducted at New Mexico State University’s Clayton Livestock Research Centre. The functionality of LoRA WAN communication technology and performance of LoRa WAN motion and GPS sensors were tested using static sensors that were placed either, a) outdoors and at incremental distances from the LoRa WAN gateway antenna (Field, n=6), or b) housed indoors and close to the same LoRa WAN gateway antenna (Indoor, n=5). Accelerometer data, reported as motion intensity index, and GPS location were acquired, transmitted and logged at 1 and 15 minute intervals, respectively. We evaluated the tracker's GPS accuracy (GPSBias as the euclidean distance between the actual and projected tracker location) and variables associated with the tracker’s data transmission capabilities. The results indicate that field trackers had a greater accuracy for remote sensing of GPS locations compared to indoor trackers facing increasing communication interference to acquire satellite signals (GPSBias; 5.20 vs. 17.76 m; P<0.01). Overall, the trackers and deployments appeared to have a comparable GPS accuracy to other tracking devices and systems available in the market. The total data packets that were successfully transmitted were similar between the indoor and field trackers, but the number of data packets that were processed varied between the two deployments (P=0.02). Due to the static deployment of indoor and field trackers, activity data was almost nonexistent for most devices. However, same trackers embedded on collars that were mounted on mature cattle showed clear diurnal patterns consistent with time budgets exerted by grazing cattle.

A comparison was made of characteristics in groups of people with different preferences for video conferencing in Internet communications and in groups with a preference for virtual interaction with the world and the real one. The respondents were divided into groups based on the results of a questionnaire designed to identify the features of interaction with the virtual space, which was developed by the authors. The study involved 182 respondents (17–32 years), (M=21.1; SD=2.6). As a result, significant differences in psychological characteristics were obtained between the groups. In the group of people who prefer visual communication, in comparison with those who prefer other methods of communication, the use of the Internet for the purpose of mood regulation, improvement of their emotional state, and greater cognitive absorption are more typical. Also in these groups there are differences in the characteristics that reflect awareness. The group of people who prefer virtual interaction with the real world is characterized by more “problematic” use of the Internet, characterized by a preference for online communication, use of the network for the purpose of mood regulation, cognitive absorption, and difficulties in controlling spending time on the network. In terms of subjective wellbeing, this group is characterized by a more pronounced sense of lack of self-development, improvement and self-realization, greater boredom and apathy in relation to life",2022,0,0,{'name': 'RSUH/RGGU Bulletin.
