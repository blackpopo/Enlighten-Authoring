It is well established, for example, that the placement of pillars at proper locations can often facilitate pedestrian flow during the evacuation of a building. Such considerations are therefore important for architects, game level developers, and others whose domains involve agents navigating through buildings. In this paper, we take the first steps towards developing a simulation framework that can be used to study the optimal placement of architectural elements, such as pillars or doors, for the purposes of facilitating dense pedestrian flow during the evacuation of a building. In particular, we show that the steering algorithms used to model the local navigation abilities of the agents significantly affect the results, which motivates the need for a statistically valid approach and further study.

There is a large and growing number of approaches for steering, and it is becoming increasingly important to ask a fundamental question: how can we objectively compare steering algorithms? To our knowledge, there is no standard way of evaluating or comparing the quality of steering solutions. This paper presents SteerBench: a benchmark framework for objectively evaluating steering behaviors for virtual agents. We propose a diverse set of test cases, metrics of evaluation, and a scoring method that can be used to compare different steering algorithms. Our framework can be easily customized by a user to evaluate specific behaviors and new test cases. We demonstrate our benchmark process on two example steering algorithms, showing the insight gained from our metrics. We hope that this framework can grow into a standard for steering evaluation.

Thus higher cognitive levels of perception and behaviour improve simulation quality. Furthermore, giving an agent the possibility to choose the nature of its interactions with the others can not only improve simulation realism but also bring heterogeneity in the simulated population because each agent individually perceives the situation according to its own characteristics. In this paper, we aim at providing the pedestrian agent the ability to obtain an individual representation of the environment that allows him to adapt its behaviour according to the situation. We base our work on the analysis and interpretation of the environment, which makes the agent decide the behaviour it is going to adopt. We focus on two kinds of behaviours, following and group avoidance behaviours, and on their integration in classical avoidance simulations. We integrate recent works about following behaviour and propose to model interactions directly with groups of people instead of individuals. We aim at providing perception rules totally independent from the collision avoidance model used in the simulation. Because of the improved perception process, we observe emerging speed waves, group behaviours and lane formation in our simulations. Our results demonstrate the interest of modelling such behaviours to obtain more realistic simulations and show that specific patterns and collective behaviours emerge when using several types of behaviours in simulations.

We present a data-driven method of simulating a crowd of virtual humans that exhibit behaviors imitating real human crowds. To do so, we record the motion of a human crowd from an aerial view using a camcorder, extract the two-dimensional moving trajectories of each individual in the crowd, and then learn an agent model from observed trajectories. The agent model decides each agent's actions based on features of the environment and the motion of nearby agents in the crowd. Once the agent model is learned, we can simulate a virtual crowd that behaves similarly to the real crowd in the video. The versatility and flexibility of our approach is demonstrated through examples in which various characteristics of group behaviors are captured and reproduced in simulated crowds."", 'year': None, 'referenceCount': 16, 'citationCount': 310, 'journal': None, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Misc{None,\n author = {Dimitris N.

Various studies have been done to cause emotional contagion between a human and a robot or an anthropomorphic agent in HRI research fields. However, few studies have been done to compare different kinds of agents in order to find important properties in emotional contagion in human-agent interaction (HAI). In this research, we conducted an experiment to determine which properties cause this phenomenon between anthropomorphic agents and users. We prepared two kinds of agents. One is a cartoon-like agent, and the other is a concrete agent. The cartoon-like agent smiled exaggeratedly, and the concrete agent smiled modestly. As a result, we found that the concrete agent was more effective than the cartoon-like agent at emotional contagion. This result suggests a model for designing more trustworthy and familiar agents and robots.",2016,16,4,"{'name': '2016 25th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)', 'pages': '1172-1176'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Matsui2016EmotionalCB,\n author = {T.

In the study performed, we varied both mood as well as task difficulty. Our results show that participants are able to differentiate between positive and negative robot mood. Moreover, self-reported mood matches the mood of the robot in the easy task condition.

He referred to this dip in familiarity and corresponding surge in strangeness as the uncanny valley. The eerie sensation associated with a mismatch between human expectations and a robot’s behavior provides a useful source of feedback to improve the cognitive models implemented in the robot. Is the uncanny valley a necessary property of near-humanlike forms? This paper contributes to ongoing work in understanding the nature and causes of the uncanny valley by means of an experiment: 56 participants were asked to rate 13 robots and 1 human, shown in video clips, on a very mechanical (1) to very humanlike (9) scale, a very strange (1) to very familiar (9) scale, and a not eerie (0) to extremely eerie (10) scale. Contrary to earlier studies with morphs [MacDorman and Ishiguro, 2006], plots of average and median values for ratings on these scales do not reveal a single U-shaped valley as predicted by Mori’s uncanny valley hypothesis [1970], although his hypothesis allows for some variation owing to movement. Robots rated similarly on the mechanical versus humanlike scale can be rated quite differently on the strange versus familiar or the eeriness scales. The results indicate that the perceived human likeness of a robot is not the only factor determining the perceived familiarity, strangeness, or eeriness of the robot. This suggests that other factors could be manipulated to vary the familiarity, strangeness, or eeriness of a robot independently of its human likeness. Introduction To build robots that at least superficially approach human likeness is leading to insights in human perception and face-to-face interaction. These android robots possess the physical presence that simulated characters lack, yet can be more perfectly controlled than any human actor, to isolate the factor under study. Even in experiments in which the android’s responses are identical, we can observe how human responses vary according to their beliefs. For example, Japanese participants showed the same modesty with their eyes by averting gaze downward when interacting with an android as when interacting with a human interlocutor if they believed the android were under human control by telepresence [MacDorman et al., 2005]. In addition, androids provide an ideal testing ground for theories from the social and cognitive sciences because competing models can be implemented in an android and then tested by letting the android interact with industrial robot humanoid robot', 'year': 2006, 'referenceCount': 8, 'citationCount': 242, 'journal': None, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Macdorman2006SubjectiveRO,\n author = {K.

They found that incidental emotions significantly influence trust in unrelated settings.

These findings suggest that emotions are more likely to be misattributed when the appraisals of the emotion are consistent with the judgment task than when the appraisals of the emotion are inconsistent with the judgment task.

In this study, we simulate an emergency situation in an open square area with three exits considering Adults and Children agents with different behavior.

We consider several factors for evaluating the quality of a guidance path, including the average traveling time and interaction distance between agents. We apply our method in several examples.

Going through very dense groups or around huge ones would not seem natural and could break any sense of presence in a virtual environment. This paper aims to enable crowd simulators to handle such situations correctly. To this end, we need to understand how real humans decide to go through or around groups. As a first hypothesis, we apply the Principle of Minimum Energy (PME) on different group sizes and density. According to this principle, a walker should go around small and dense groups whereas he should go through large and sparse groups. Such principle has already been used for crowd simulation; the novelty here is to apply it to decide on a global avoidance strategy instead of local adaptations only. Our study quantifies decision thresholds. However, PME leaves some inconclusive situations for which the two solutions paths have similar energetic costs. In a second part, we propose an experiment to corroborate PME decisions thresholds with real observations. As controlling the factors of an experiment with many people is extremely hard, we propose to use Virtual Reality as a new method to observe human behavior. This work represents the first crowd simulation algorithm component directly designed from a VR-based study. We also consider the role of secondary factors in inconclusive situations. We show the influence of the group appearance and direction of relative motion in the decision process. Finally, we draw some guidelines to integrate our conclusions to existing crowd simulators and show an example of such integration.

Editing operations are thus generally required to animate virtual characters with a sufficient level of variety. Evaluating the perceptual plausibility of edited animations can therefore contribute greatly towards producing visually plausible animations. In this article, we study observers’ sensitivity to manipulations of overarm and underarm biological throwing animations. In the first experiment, we modified the release velocity of the ball while leaving the motion of the virtual thrower and the angle of release of the ball unchanged. In the second experiment, we evaluated the possibility of further modifying throwing animations by simultaneously editing the motion of the thrower and the release velocity of the ball, using dynamic time warping. In both experiments, we found that participants perceived shortened underarm throws to be particularly unnatural. We also found that modifying the thrower's motion in addition to modifying the release velocity of the ball does not significantly improve the perceptual plausibility of edited throwing animations. In the third experiment, we modified the angle of release of the ball while leaving the magnitude of release velocity and the motion of the thrower unchanged, and found that this editing operation is efficient for improving the perceptual plausibility of shortened underarm throws. Finally, in Experiment 4, we replaced the virtual human thrower with a mechanical throwing device (a ramp) and found the opposite pattern of sensitivity to modifications of the release velocity, indicating that biological and physical throws are subject to different perceptual rules. Our results provide valuable guidelines for developers of games and virtual reality applications by specifying thresholds for the perceptual plausibility of throwing manipulations while also providing several interesting insights for researchers in visual perception of biological motion."", 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 44, 'citationCount': 12, 'journal': {'volume': '11', 'pages': '10:1-10:23', 'name': 'ACM Trans.

This paper describes how crowd density information can be used to guide a large number of characters through a crowded environment. Crowd density information helps characters avoid congested routes that could lead to traffic jams. It also encourages characters to use a wide variety of routes to reach their destination. Our technique measures the desirability of a route by combining distance information with crowd density information. We start by building a navigation mesh for the walkable regions in a polygonal two‐dimensional (2‐D) or multilayered three‐dimensional (3‐D) environment. The skeleton of this navigation mesh is the medial axis. Each walkable region in the navigation mesh maintains an up‐to‐date density value. This density value is equal to the area occupied by all the characters inside a given region divided by the total area of this region. These density values are mapped onto the medial axis to form a weighted graph. An A* search on this graph yields a backbone path for each character, and forces are used to guide the characters through the weighted environment. The characters periodically replan their routes as the density values are updated. Our experiments show that we can compute congestion‐avoiding paths for tens of thousands of characters in real‐time.

This is made possible by modeling turbulence formation based on an averaged flow field, and relying on universal laws describing the flow near a wall. We precompute the confined vorticity in the boundary layer around an object, and simulate the boundary layer separation during a fluid simulation. Then, a turbulence model is used to identify areas where this separated layer will transition into actual turbulence. We sample these regions with vortex particles, and simulate the further dynamics of the vortices based on these particles. We will show how our method complements previous work on synthetic turbulence, and yields physically plausible results. In addition, we demonstrate that our method can efficiently compute turbulent flows around a variety of objects including cars, whisks, as well as boulders in a river flow.

In this paper, we propose a model for designing trustworthy agents by assuming two factors of trust, that is, emotion and knowledgeableness perceived. Our hypothesis is that when a user feels happy and perceives an agent as being highly knowledgeable, a high level of trust results between the user and agent. We conducted four experiments with participants to verify this hypothesis by preparing transition operators utilizing emotional contagion and knowledgeable utterances. As a result, we verified that users' internal states transitioned as expected and that the two factors significantly influenced their trust states.",2019,40,15,"{'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology', 'volume': '10'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Matsui2019DesigningTP,\n author = {T.

Some researchers propose that people apply the same social norms to computers as they do to humans, suggesting that social psychological knowledge can be applied to our interactions with computers. In contrast, theories of human–automation interaction postulate that humans respond to machines in unique and specific ways. We believe that anthropomorphism—the degree to which an agent exhibits human characteristics—is the critical variable that may resolve this apparent contradiction across the formation, violation, and repair stages of trust. Three experiments were designed to examine these opposing viewpoints by varying the appearance and behavior of automated agents. Participants received advice that deteriorated gradually in reliability from a computer, avatar, or human agent. Our results showed (a) that anthropomorphic agents were associated with greater trust resilience, a higher resistance to breakdowns in trust; (b) that these effects were magnified by greater uncertainty; and c) that incorporating human-like trust repair behavior largely erased differences between the agents.

A study of video interactions between human participants demonstrated that people display more head tilts and pauses when they revealed highly intimate information about themselves; they presented more head nods and eye gazes during less intimate sharing.

Background: To date, reviews of trust in HRI have been qualitative or descriptive. Our quantitative review provides a fundamental empirical foundation to advance both theory and practice. Method: Meta-analytic methods were applied to the available literature on trust and HRI. A total of 29 empirical studies were collected, of which 10 met the selection criteria for correlational analysis and 11 for experimental analysis. These studies provided 69 correlational and 47 experimental effect sizes. Results: The overall correlational effect size for trust was r̄ = +0.26, with an experimental effect size of d̄ = +0.71. The effects of human, robot, and environmental characteristics were examined with an especial evaluation of the robot dimensions of performance and attribute-based factors. The robot performance and attributes were the largest contributors to the development of trust in HRI. Environmental factors played only a moderate role. Conclusion: Factors related to the robot itself, specifically, its performance, had the greatest current association with trust, and environmental factors were moderately associated. There was little evidence for effects of human-related factors. Application: The findings provide quantitative estimates of human, robot, and environmental factors influencing HRI trust.

We adopted a bottom-up, synthetic approach towards interactive competencies in robots using simple, minimal computational models underlying the robot's interaction dynamics. We present two empirical, exploratory studies investigating a drumming experience with a humanoid robot (KASPAR) and a human. In the first experiment, the turn-taking behaviour of the humanoid is deterministic and the non-verbal gestures of the robot accompany its drumming to assess the impact of non-verbal gestures on the interaction. The second experiment studies a computational framework that facilitates emergent turn-taking dynamics, whereby the particular dynamics of turn-taking emerge from the social interaction between the human and the humanoid. The results from the HRI experiments are presented and analysed qualitatively (in terms of the participants’ subjective experiences) and quantitatively (concerning the drumming performance of the human–robot pair). The results point out a trade-off between the subjective evaluation of the drumming experience from the perspective of the participants and the objective evaluation of the drumming performance. A certain number of gestures was preferred as a motivational factor in the interaction. The participants preferred the models underlying the robot's turn-taking which enable the robot and human to interact more and provide turn-taking closer to ‘natural’ human–human conversations, despite differences in objective measures of drumming behaviour. The results are consistent with the temporal behaviour matching hypothesis previously proposed in the literature which concerns the effect that the participants adapt their own interaction dynamics to the robot's."", 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 78, 'citationCount': 40, 'journal': {'volume': '22', 'pages': '103 - 134', 'name': 'Connection Science'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Kose-Bagci2010DrummateID,\n author = {H.

Background: Research has revealed that the reliability of imperfect automation is frequently misperceived. We examined the manner in which the easiness and type of imperfect automation errors affect trust and dependence. Method: Participants performed a target detection task utilizing an automated aid. In Study 1, the aid missed targets either on easy trials (easy miss group) or on difficult trials (difficult miss group). In Study 2, we manipulated both easiness and type of error (miss vs. false alarm). The aid erred on either difficult trials alone (difficult errors group) or on difficult and easy trials (easy miss group; easy false alarm group). Results: In both experiments, easy errors led to participants mistrusting and disagreeing more with the aid on difficult trials, as compared with those using aids that generated only difficult errors. This resulted in a downward shift in decision criterion for the former, leading to poorer overall performance. Misses and false alarms led to similar effects. Conclusion: Automation errors on tasks that appear “easy” to the operator severely degrade trust and reliance.

This chapter analyzes why experts in the field are looking for an alternative to the currently dominant cognitive approach. The basic principles of activity theory are presented and their implications for human-computer interaction are discussed. The chapter concludes with an outline of the potential impact of activity theory on studies and design of computer use in real-life settings. It is generally accepted that the lack of an adequate theory of human-computer interaction (HCI) is one of the most important reasons that progress in the field of HCI is relatively modest, compared with the rate of technological development. People coming to the field of HCI from different disciplines—psychology, computer science, graphics design, and others—have serious problems in coordinating and combining their efforts. For example, typical HCI curricula for undergraduate and graduate students present a mixture of knowledge from various disciplines rather than an integrated perspective. Traditional conceptual approaches cannot provide an appropriate basis for addressing many important aspects of HCI, including computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) and cross-cultural aspects of computer use. Consequently the impact of HCI studies on current design practice is limited, with user interface design being based mainly on intuition and expensive trial and error. The form of a suitable HCI theory has been subjected to much debate recently (Carroll, Kellogg, and Rosson 1991). A major trend in the debate has been the growing dissatisfaction with the dominant cognitive approach (Bannon 1991; Wood 1992; Monk et al. 1993). In contrast to the general agreement that current attempts to apply cognitive psychology to HCI are not very successful, there is little agreement on the most promising theoretical alternatives. Proposals vary from an enrichment of the traditional cognitive scheme (Barnard 1991) to a radical shift in paradigms, for example, from scientific experimental studies to ethnographic methodology (see Monk et al. 1993). In this period of theoretical uncertainty there has been a growing interest in activity theory, greatly stimulated by Bødker's works (1989, 1991). She was the first Western researcher who presented the basic ideas and potential benefits of activity theory to the HCI community. Recently, a number of papers discussing the activity theory approach to HCI have appeared in major international journals and The aim of the present chapter is to summarize current work in activity theory and its implications for …"", 'year': None, 'referenceCount': 31, 'citationCount': 426, 'journal': None, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Misc{None,\n author = {V.

These algorithms simulate the interplay between three processes: (1) development of veins towards hormone (auxin) sources embedded in the leaf blade; (2) modification of the hormone source distribution by the proximity of veins; and (3) modification of both the vein pattern and source distribution by leaf growth. These processes are formulated in terms of iterative geometric operations on sets of points that represent vein nodes and auxin sources. In addition, a vein connection graph is maintained to determine vein widths.

Depending on the specification details and parameters used, the algorithms can simulate many types of venation patterns, both open (tree-like) and closed (with loops).

In this context, computational modelling of emotion is a major challenge in order to design believable virtual humans. This factor has an impact on both the individual behaviour and the collective one. Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in the emotion contagion phenomenon in order to model emerging group behaviour. 
 
Stemming from works on multi-agent systems environments, we propose an architecture to manage both internal and external emotion dynamics. Emotions evolve in function of three influences: punctual events, temporal dynamics and external influences. In an embodied agent approach, the first is the responsibility of the agent's mind, the second of the agent's body, and the third of the environment. This functional architecture is then adapted to a multi-agent architecture, adding a control responsibility to the agent body. Finally, we show the results of several experiments to examine the properties of the architecture and its efficiency by comparing it to a full agent approach.",2014,27,22,{'pages': '645-652'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Saunier2014MixedAD,\n author = {Julien Saunier and H.

Considering other influential factors, such as emotions, has been accused of being “non scientific”. However, pure rational processes fail when trying to explain most of human behaviours, in which emotion plays a key role. Nevertheless, emotional factors add an extra complexity to agent architectures, making them, hitherto, either few efficient or few reusable. This paper presents a context independent cognitive architecture for agents that combine emotions and rationality, named COGNITIVA, which bets on adaptivity as a weapon to fight against that complexity. Key-Words: Cognitive agent architecture, specification process, emotion, personality, virtual characters, adaptivity 1 The Role of Emotions in the Rational Process 1.1 Emotion and Reason, Oil and Water? Emotions and reason have been traditionally considered as two sides of the same coin and, therefore, antagonistic and non combinable. Emotions are something rather irrational that plays down value to human rationality [1], something “non scientific” [2]. However, recent theories [3] [4] suggest that emotions are an essential part of human intelligence, playing a critical role in processes such as perception, learning, attention, memory, rational decision making and other abilities usually associated to intelligent behaviours. The initial approach fails, probably, in considering “emotional systems” as systems that lose the desirable rationality and control. However, it is not right considering laws and rational norms as the unique and more important parts when interpreting human behaviour and intelligence. It is also an error considering human behaviour independent of any emotional process. Up to this point, it is worth to remark that, from the neurological perspective, no polarization, or clean dividing line occurs between thinking and emotions [2]. 1.2 Emotional Architectures Most of the theoretical models of emotion, coming from Psychology are not appropriate to be applied into computer systems, since they weren’t conceived with that purpose. The adaptation of these approaches and the development of new theories, more suitable to the automation of their elements and processes, have reduced the number of theoretical models of emotion present in most of the emotional systems: appraisal models, motivational models, dimensional models... However, neither these models nor the architectures and systems developed from them incorporate successfully emotions to the general rational process. Some deficiency or drawback is always imputed to each one, although, depending on the contexts and problems, they also prove sometimes to be acceptably adequate. The empirical results of these approaches show that emotional factors cannot be considered as yet another component in the agent's architecture, but all the architecture must exhibit an emotional orientation. 1.3 Adaptivity vs. Specificity or Generality Behind these architectures (usually agent-oriented) underlies a very intricate structure. Sometimes, their elements and dynamics are interwoven with the restrictions and particularities of the application context, mingling with them, making these approaches few reusable (cf. [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]). Other times, architectures are intrinsically very generic, independent from any specific problem (cf. [10], [11], [12]). The lack of an adaptation to the particular needs of the problem originates less-efficient, computationally demanding mechanisms. This forces to reconsider the whole structure of the architecture and to simplify some of their original capabilities, in order to offer viable developments. In our opinion, nowadays solutions do not provide the level of desired quality/satisfaction because they – just– fail in the “attitudes” with which complexity is faced: instead of looking for specificity or generality, the key is in adaptivity. A new perspective is needed. A perspective considering the complexity of this kind of systems in an efficient, reusable way; a perspective allowing an adaptation to the specific problem and context needs without loosing the generic purpose of the architecture; a perspective maintaining a structure, components and processes coherent and understandable. 2 Adaptable Cognitive Architecture This paper proposes the definition of a generic architecture, named COGNITIVA, to develop agents whose behaviours are emotionally influenced. Considering an agent as a continuous perception-cognition-action cycle, the scope of this architecture is circumscribed to its cognitive activity, although it does not restrict any of the other two modules (perceptual and actuation). Different from the generic preceding architectures, COGNITIVA provides mechanisms to be adapted to each specific context and problem, from a double perspective: • Adaptation of its structure: COGNITIVA is a multilayered architecture that covers several kinds of behaviour: reactive, deliberative and social. Besides, it includes a flexible model that allows establishing dependencies and influences among elements such as personality traits, attitudes, physical states, concerns and emotions. Even more, both the behaviour modes and the elements are configurable, according to the particular needs of every situation. • Adaptation of its process of application: from the generic architecture, a progressive specification process has been designed, to apply it to every particular context. This process begins with a functional specification of the architecture, which provides a particular design and implementation of each one of the information structures and functions defined in the generic architecture. This first specification is yet too context independent to the application context. In fact, the same functional specification may be used as a basis for many different contexts. The approach to each one of them is made in a second specification phase, the contextual specification, in which all the particular values and procedures of the application environment are included. In the following sections, COGNITIVA and its main components are described with a deeper detail, along with some results obtained from its application. 3 Description of COGNITIVA Internally, COGNITIVA can be considered as a hybrid architecture, combining reactive, deliberative and social skills. Fig. 1 shows a schematic perspective of the three quasi-horizontal levels, namely: • Reactive layer, to provide the agent with immediate responses to the perceived changes in the environment. • Deliberative layer, to provide the agent with goal-directed behaviours, from its individual abilities point of view. • Social layer, to provide the agent with behaviours in which the existence of other agents and the interaction with them is considered. Fig. 1. General Schema of COGNITIVA. 3.1 Management of the Current State of the Agent: Beliefs With independence of the decision making process carried out in each one of the layers, it is very difficult for an agent to exhibit coherent behaviours exclusively from the perceptual input coming from the sensors (perceptual module). It is necessary to consider other information sources, such as its knowledge about the environment, about other agents and, even more, about itself. All this information is represented internally as a beliefs set. To manage the beliefs, a taxonomy has been defined. In a first level, the taxonomy differentiates the object of the belief: places –physical, conceptual or virtual–, objects, individuals and the current situation. Besides, the agent beliefs related to places, objects and individuals are classified into: • Beliefs related to defining characteristics (DCs), that describe the general traits of places, objects and individuals. DCs are fundamental to understand them. The DCs value hardly changes over the time. • Beliefs related to transitory states (TSs), characteristics whose values represent the current state of places, objects and individuals. TSs’ values have a much more dynamic nature, compared to DCs. • Beliefs related to attitudes, useful to determine the behaviour of an agent towards other environment components (places, objects and individuals). Attitudes’ values are less variable than TSs’, but more than DCs’. Among the whole set of agent's beliefs, COGNITIVA distinguishes a small subset related to the agent itself, which is fundamental in the architecture. This subset constitutes what is called the agent's personal model, and includes DCs such as its personality traits, whose values determine the coherent and stable behaviour of the individual; TSs such as its moods and its physical states, identifying the state of the mind and the body of the agent, respectively; and also its attitudes towards others. Many of these characteristics are intrinsically related, and exert some influence on other beliefs of the personal model. So, for instance, the personality traits influence the value of the emotions. 3.2 Management of the Past State: History Agent behaviours that do not take into account events occurred in past moments are specially disappointing for human observers. The architecture proposed considers two mechanisms to maintain the agent's past history information: • Accumulative management of the past: this is an implicit mechanism, related to the way in which beliefs are managed. External changes in the environment or internal modifications in the agent internal state may produce an update of the agent beliefs. However, this update is performed as a variation ---of higher or lower intensity--of the previous beliefs, avoiding abrupt alterations in the individual behaviour. • Explicit management of the past state: an accumulative effect of the past events may not be enough to manage efficiently the past state, because it does not consider information related to the events themselves or to the temporal instant in which they took place.

We consider these two domains as prototypical for Multi-emotional-Agent- Systems (MeASs), which are the focus of this paper. MeASs typically include groups of agents organised into clusters, for example a special-force unit. While each agent in such a group has its own emotional model, resulting in realistic individual emotional behaviour, the group as a whole can show unrealistic emotional behaviour. Currently there is no method to enforce emotional consistency of a cluster of agents while allowing agents to have individual emotions. Our approach introduces an emotionalstate component that is a separate step in the computational model of emotion used by individual agents. The introduction of this emotional-state component enables multiple architectures for group emotions. We evaluate these architectures and conclude that several enable consistent integration of individual emotions and group emotions. We believe that our research enables agent- and scenario designers to benefit from the individual realism a computational model of emotion brings to virtual agents, without losing group consistency. Furthermore, by choosing one architecture versus another, designers can trade-off quality of the group emotion for computational performance.', 'year': 2005, 'referenceCount': 10, 'citationCount': 4, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Broekens2005ConsistentDE,\n author = {J.

Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in the emotion contagion phenomenon in order to model emerging group behaviour. \n \nStemming from works on multi-agent systems environments, we propose an architecture to manage both internal and external emotion dynamics. Emotions evolve in function of three influences: punctual events, temporal dynamics and external influences.

Thus in this work, we perform three experiments to gain a better understanding of how motion editing might affect the emotional content of a captured performance, particularly changes in posture and dynamics, two factors shown to be important perceptual indicators of bodily emotions. In these studies, we analyse the properties (angles and velocities) and perception (recognition rates and perceived intensities) of a varied set of full-body motion clips representing the six emotions anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise.

We propose that basic emotion theories no longer explain adequately the vast number of empirical observations from studies in affective neuroscience, and we suggest that a conceptual shift is needed in the empirical approaches taken to the study of emotion and affective psychopathologies. The circumplex model of affect is more consistent with many recent findings from behavioral, cognitive neuroscience, neuroimaging, and developmental studies of affect.

Pictures of human faces bearing fearful or happy expressions were presented to 10 normal, healthy subjects by using a backward masking procedure that resulted in 8 of 10 subjects reporting that they had not seen these facial expressions. The backward masking procedure consisted of 33 msec presentations of fearful or happy facial expressions, their offset coincident with the onset of 167 msec presentations of neutral facial expressions. Although subjects reported seeing only neutral faces, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal in the amygdala was significantly higher during viewing of masked fearful faces than during the viewing of masked happy faces. This difference was composed of significant signal increases in the amygdala to masked fearful faces as well as significant signal decreases to masked happy faces, consistent with the notion that the level of amygdala activation is affected differentially by the emotional valence of external stimuli. In addition, these facial expressions activated the sublenticular substantia innominata (SI), where signal increases were observed to both fearful and happy faces—suggesting a spatial dissociation of territories that respond to emotional valence versus salience or arousal value.

8,a6077fa80467e741bdbbfdcc29003aeefe174179,Modeling crowd emotion from emergent event video,"In emergency situation, mass panic often causes more causalities than the disaster itself. The crowd emotional model could be used to simulate how crowd behavior in emergency scenarios and be helpful for developing crowd evacuation plans in emergency situations. However, existing crowd emotional models usually set model parameters in an empirical manner and are not validated by real cases. In this paper, a crowd emotional model is proposed to simulate the crowd movement in outdoor emergency situations. First of all, the crowd entropy and the movement difference are proposed to describe the emotional impact of the crowd scene on the agents. The perception of vision and hearing are considered, and the calculation formulas of the agent's emotional intensity and crowd emotional contagion are proposed. By calculating individual trajectories in the real video, the cumulative differences between the movements of the real crowd and the corresponding virtual crowd are analyzed. At last, a multi‐parameter optimization method is implemented by the differential evolution algorithm. To verify the parameters in models, three videos which are generated from three real cases, including explosion attack, shooting incident, and crowd disturbance are selected for experimental verification. The results showed that the proposed model could be a feasible method for optimizing parameters to simulate the emergency scenario.",2021,36,2,"{'name': 'Computer Animation and Virtual Worlds', 'volume': '32'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zhuo2021ModelingCE,\n author = {Lin Zhuo and Zhen Liu and Tingting Liu and Chih-Chieh Hung and Yanjie Chai},\n booktitle = {Comput.

In this paper, we propose a novel crowd simulation method by modeling the generation and contagion of panic emotion under multihazard circumstances. In order to depict the effect from hazards and other agents to crowd movement, we first classify hazards into different types (transient and persistent, concurrent and nonconcurrent, and static and dynamic) based on their inherent characteristics. Second, we introduce the concept of perilous field for each hazard and further transform the critical level of the field to its invoked-panic emotion. After that, we propose an emotional contagion model to simulate the evolving process of panic emotion caused by multiple hazards. Finally, we introduce an emotional reciprocal velocity obstacles (RVOs) model to simulate the crowd behaviors by augmenting the traditional RVO model with emotional contagion, which for the first time combines the emotional impact and local avoidance together. Our experimental results demonstrate that the overall approach is robust, can better generate realistic crowds and the panic emotion dynamics in a crowd.

Despite recent impressive results when simulating and rendering thousands of individuals, many challenges still exist in this area. The comparison of simulation with reality, the realistic appearance of virtual humans and their behavior, group structure and their motion, and collision avoidance are just some examples of these challenges. For most of the applications of crowds, it is now a requirement to have real-time simulations which is an additional challenge, particularly when crowds are very large. Crowd Simulation analyses these challenges in depth and suggests many possible solutions.

While opinions and abilities may, at first glance, seem to be quite different things, there is a close functional tie between them. They act together in the manner in which they affect behavior. A person’s cognition (his opinions and beliefs) about the situation in which he exists and his appraisals of what he is capable of doing (his evaluation of his abilities) will together have bearing on his behavior. The holding of incorrect opinions and/or inaccurate appraisals of one’s abilities can be punishing or even fatal in many situations. It is necessary, before we proceed, to clarify the distinction between opinions and evaluations of abilities since at first glance it may seem that one’s evaluation of one’s own ability is an opinion about it. Abilities are of course manifested only through performance which is assumed to depend upon the particular ability. The clarity of the manifestation or performance can vary from instances where there is no clear ordering criterion of the ability to instances where the performance which reflects the ability can be clearly ordered. In the former case, the evaluation of the ability does function like other opinions which are not directly testable in “objective reality’. For example, a person’s evaluation of his ability to write poetry will depend to a large extent on the opinions which others have of his ability to write poetry. In cases where the criterion is unambiguous and can be clearly ordered, this furnishes an objective reality for the evaluation of one’s ability so that it depends less on the opinions of other persons and depends more on actual comparison of one’s performance with the performance of others. Thus, if a person evaluates his running ability, he will do so by comparing his time to run some distance with the times that other persons have taken. In the following pages, when we talk about evaluating an ability, we shall mean specifically the evaluation of that ability in situations where the performance is unambiguous and is known. Most situations in real life will, of course, present situations which are a mixture of opinion and ability evaluation. In a previous article (7) the author posited the existence of a drive to determine whether or not one’s opinions were “correct”. We are here stating that this same drive also produces behavior in people oriented toward obtaining an accurate appraisal of their abilities. The behavioral implication of the existence of such a drive is that we would expect to observe behaviour on the part of persons which enables them to ascertain whether or not their opinions are correct and also behavior which enables them accurately to evaluate their abilities.

We define an agent's trustworthiness as being operated by user emotion and knowledgeableness perceived by humans. Also, we suggest a user inner state transition model for increasing trust. To increase trust, we aim to cause user emotion to transition to positive by using emotional contagion and to cause user knowledgeableness perceived to become higher by increasing an agent's knowledge. We carried out two experiments to inspect this model. In experiment 1, the PRVAs recommended package tours and became highly knowledgeable in the latter half of ten recommendations. In experiment 2, the PRVAs recommended the same package tours and expressed a positive emotion in the latter half. As a result, participants' inner states transitioned as we expected, and it was proved that this model was valuable for PRVA recommendation.",2016,13,6,{'name': 'Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Human Agent Interaction'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Matsui2016BuildingTI,\n author = {T.

However, commonly used experimental manipulations tend to have collateral effects on emotions other than the targeted emotion, making it difficult to ascribe outcomes to any single emotion. In this letter, we propose to address this problem using causal mediation analysis. We illustrate this approach using an experiment examining the effect of emotion on dyadic trust, as measured by the trust game. Our findings suggest that negative emotions can decrease trust, but only if those negative emotions make people feel less certain about their current situation. Our results suggest that only anxiety, a low-certainty emotion, has a negative impact on trust, whereas anger and guilt, two emotions that differ in their control appraisals but induce the same high level of certainty, appear to have no effect on trusting behavior.

10,2f7f36fe5dc56e32e8ebcdff18378d976e811fe8,A Computational Model of Emotions for Agent-Based Crowds in Serious Games,"Crowd behaviour is an interesting social phenomenon that emerges from complex interactions of individuals. An important aspect of individual behaviour is emotion which plays a significant role in all aspects of human decision making. For example, heightened emotional states can lead people to take highly unexpected or irrational actions. One popular motivation for simulation of virtual crowds is to generate believable characters in movies and computer games. Recently the concept of serious games has been introduced in both academic and industrial circles. In this paper, we propose an emotion engine, based on modern appraisal theory, that is able to model various emotional crowd characteristics. This appraisal engine is capable of capturing the dynamics of emotional contagion and we show how different crowd composition can lead to different patterns of emotional contagion. In addition, we describe a serious game designed for training military personnel in peaceful crowd control. We evaluate this engine in the context of a property protection protest scenario where the players or soldiers are tasked to maintain a peaceful protest without violence. A systematic evaluation is presented which supports the facial validity of the emotion engine and our model of emotional contagion.",2011,17,24,"{'name': '2011 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conferences on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology', 'pages': '72-80', 'volume': '2'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Aydt2011ACM,\n author = {Heiko Aydt and M.

One of challenging issues in behavior modeling is how virtual agents make decisions given some time-critical and uncertain situations. In this paper, we present HumDPM, a decision process model for virtual agents, which incorporates two important factors of human decision making in time-critical situations: experience and emotion. In HumDPM, rather than relying on deliberate rational analysis, an agent makes its decisions by matching past experience cases to the current situation. We propose the detailed representation of experience case and investigate the mechanisms of situation assessment, experience matching and experience execution. To incorporate emotion into HumDPM, we introduce an emotion appraisal process in situation assessment for emotion elicitation. In HumDPM, the decision making process of an agent may be affected by its emotional states when: 1) deciding whether it is necessary to do a re-match of experience cases, 2) determining the situational context, and 3) selecting experience cases. We illustrate the effectiveness of HumDPM in crowd simulation. A case study for emergency evacuation in a subway station scenario is conducted, which shows how a varied crowd composition leads to different evacuation behaviors, due to the retrieval of different experiences and the variation of agents' emotional states."", 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 14, 'citationCount': 17, 'journal': {'pages': '360-367', 'name': '2010 International Conference on Cyberworlds'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Luo2010ModelingHD,\n author = {Linbo Luo and Suiping Zhou and Wentong Cai and M.

This has led to a truly interdisciplinary, mutually beneficial partnership between emotion research in psychology and in computational science, of which this volume is an exemplar. To understand this partnership and its potential for transforming existing practices in emotion research across disciplines and for disclosing important novel areas of research, we explore in this chapter the history of work in computational models of emotion including the various uses to which they have been put, the theoretical traditions that have shaped their development, and how these uses and traditions are reflected in their underlying architectures. For an outsider to the field, the last 15 years have seen the development of a seemingly bewildering array of competing and complementary computational models. Figure 1.2.1 lists a ‘family tree’ of a few of the significant models and the theoretical traditions from which they stem. Although there has been a proliferation of work, the field is far from mature: the goals that a model is designed to achieve are not always clearly articulated; research is rarely incremental, more often returning to motivating theories rather than extending prior computational approaches; and rarely are models contrasted with each other in terms of their ability to achieve their set goals. Contributing to potential confusion is the reality that computational models are complex systems embodying a number of, sometimes unarticulated, design decisions and assumptions inherited from the psychological and computational traditions from which they emerged, a circumstance made worse by the lack of a commonly accepted lexicon even for designating these distinctions. In this chapter, we lay out the work on computational models of emotion in an attempt to reveal the common uses to which they may be put and the underlying techniques and assumptions from which the models are built. Our aim is to present conceptual distinctions and common terminology that can aid in discussion and comparison of competing models. Our hope is that this will not only facilitate an understanding of the field for outside researchers but work towards a lexicon that can help foster the maturity of the field towards more incremental research. In characterizing different computational models of emotion, we begin by describing interdisciplinary uses to which computational models may be put, including their uses in improving human–computer interaction, in enhancing general models of intelligence, and as methodological tools for furthering our understanding of human behaviour. We next discuss how models have been built, including the underlying theoretical traditions that have shaped their development. These differing theoretical perspectives often conceptualize emotion in quite different ways, emphasizing different scenarios and proposed functions, different component processes, and different linkages between these components.

The inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and posterior parietal cortex have been considered to compose a mirror neuron system (MNS) for the motor components of facial expressions, while the amygdala and insula may represent an “additional” MNS for emotional states. Together, these systems may contribute to our understanding of facial expressions. Here we further examine this possibility. In three separate event-related fMRI experiment, subjects had to (1) observe (2) discriminate and (3) imitate facial expressions. Stimuli were dynamic neutral, happy, fearful and disgusted facial expressions, and in Experiments 1 and 2, an additional pattern motion condition. Importantly, during each experiment, subjects were unaware of the nature of the next experiments. Results demonstrate that even passive viewing of facial expressions activates a wide network of brain regions that were also involved in the execution of similar expressions, including the IFG/insula and the posterior parietal cortex. Only a subset of these regions responded more during the observation of facial than pattern motion (bilateral ventral IFG, bilateral STS/MTG, bilateral amygdala, SMA). While the viewing of facial expressions recruited similar brain regions in all three experiments, adding an active task (discrimination, imitation) augmented the magnitude of these activations. Brain activations reflected differences in observed facial expressions, with emotional expressions activating relatively more the insula/frontal operculum, and neutral ones (blowing up the cheeks) the somatosensory cortices (SII). Using movies, fear activated the amygdala and disgust the insula, but other emotions activated these structures to a similar degree.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 93, 'citationCount': 280, 'journal': {'volume': '2', 'pages': '179 - 222', 'name': 'Social Neuroscience'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Gaag2007FacialEW,\n author = {Christiaan van der Gaag and R.

The detection of a minimal threshold stimulatory concentration of an autoinducer leads to an alteration in gene expression. Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria use quorum sensing communication circuits to regulate a diverse array of physiological activities. These processes include symbiosis, virulence, competence, conjugation, antibiotic production, motility, sporulation, and biofilm formation. In general, Gram-negative bacteria use acylated homoserine lactones as autoinducers, and Gram-positive bacteria use processed oligo-peptides to communicate. Recent advances in the field indicate that cell-cell communication via autoinducers occurs both within and between bacterial species. Furthermore, there is mounting data suggesting that bacterial autoinducers elicit specific responses from host organisms. Although the nature of the chemical signals, the signal relay mechanisms, and the target genes controlled by bacterial quorum sensing systems differ, in every case the ability to communicate with one another allows bacteria to coordinate the gene expression, and therefore the behavior, of the entire community. Presumably, this process bestows upon bacteria some of the qualities of higher organisms. The evolution of quorum sensing systems in bacteria could, therefore, have been one of the early steps in the development of multicellularity.', 'year': 2001, 'referenceCount': 193, 'citationCount': 4495, 'journal': {'volume': '55', 'pages': '\n          165-99\n        ', 'name': 'Annual review of microbiology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Miller2001QuorumSI,\n author = {Melissa B.

These outcomes may range from a peaceful mingling of the two groups to the occurrence of fights and riots. Because the group processes leading to these outcomes are difficult to study experimentally, we developed a multi-agent simulation model in which the approach-avoidance conflict has been formalised in simulated actors. We worked with three different kinds of agents: hardcore, hangers-on and bystanders, the difference between them consisting in the frequency with which they scan their surroundings. Data on clustering, and 'fights' are presented for 80 simulation runs, in which group size, size symmetry and group composition were varied. The conclusions are that fights especially happen in asymmetrical large groups with relatively large proportions of hardcore members. Moreover, it appears that it are especially the hardcore group members and the hangers-on that attack other agents, whereas bystanders are victimised. The paper ends with a discussion on the validity of these findings, leading us to conclude that basic aspects of rioting behaviour are quite realistically represented in our simulation model."", 'year': 2001, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 80, 'journal': {'volume': '4', 'name': 'J.

The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle systems, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the ""animator.""

The key concept is that of ""threshold"": the number or proportion of others who must make one decision before a given actor does so; this is the point where net benefits begin to exceed net costs for that particular actor. Beginning with a frequency distribution of thresholds, the models allow calculation of the ultimate or ""equilibrium"" number making each decision. The stability of equilibrium results against various possible changes in threshold distributions is considered. Stress is placed on the importance of exact distributions distributions for outcomes. Groups with similar average preferences may generate very different results; hence it is hazardous to infer individual dispositions from aggregate outcomes or to assume that behavior was directed by ultimately agreed-upon norms.

There is an increased need for novel methods and tools that can provide information on the sentiments of crowds as an input for crowd management.

None of them, however, aimed at deriving the sentiments of crowds using social media in city events, and no existing event-based dataset is available for such studies. This paper investigates how social media can be used to estimate the sentiments of crowds in city events. First, some lexicon-based and machine learning-based methods were selected to perform sentiment analyses, then an event-based sentiment annotated dataset was constructed. The performance of the selected methods was trained and tested in an experiment using common and event-based datasets. Results show that the machine learning method LinearSVC achieves the lowest estimation error for sentiment analysis on social media in city events.

Antagonistic emotions, which is the typical psychological state of agents in different roles (i.e., cops, activists, and civilians) in crowd violence scenes, and the way they spread through contagion in a crowd are important causes of crowd antagonistic behaviors. Moreover, games, which refers to the interaction between opposing groups adopting different strategies to obtain higher benefits and less casualties, determine the level of crowd violence. We present an antagonistic crowd simulation model (ACSEE), which is integrated with antagonistic emotional contagion and evolutionary game theories. Our approach models the antagonistic emotions between agents in different roles using two components: mental emotion and external emotion. We combine enhanced susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) and game approaches to evaluate the role of antagonistic emotional contagion in crowd violence. Our evolutionary game theoretic approach incorporates antagonistic emotional contagion through deterrent force, which is modelled by a mixture of emotional forces and physical forces defeating the opponents. Antagonistic emotional contagion and evolutionary game theories influence each other to determine antagonistic crowd behaviors. We evaluate our approach on real-world scenarios consisting of different kinds of agents. We also compare the simulated crowd behaviors with real-world crowd videos and use our approach to predict the trends of crowd movements in violence incidents.

Yet decisions and the underlying principles of decision-making have been difficult to integrate into the classical population-level models of ecology. Certainly, there is a long history of modeling individuals’ searching behavior, diet selection, or conflict dynamics within social interactions. When all individuals are given certain simple rules to govern their decision-making processes, the resultant population–level models have yielded important generalizations and theory. But it is also recognized that such models do not represent the way real individuals decide on actions. Factors that influence a decision include the organism’s environment with its dynamic rewards and risks, the complex internal state of the organism, and its imperfect knowledge of the environment. In the case of animals, it may also involve complex social factors, and experience and learning, which vary among individuals. The way that all factors are weighed and processed to lead to decisions is a major area of behavioral theory. While classic population-level modeling is limited in its ability to integrate decision-making in its actual complexity, the development of individual- or agent-based models (IBM/ABMs) (we use ABM throughout to designate both ‘agent-based modeling’ and an ‘agent-based model’) has opened the possibility of describing the way that decisions are made, and their effects, in minute detail. Over the years, these models have increased in size and complexity. Current ABMs can simulate thousands of individuals in realistic environments, and with highly detailed internal physiology, perception and ability to process the perceptions and make decisions based on those and their internal states. The implementation of decision-making in ABMs ranges from fairly simple to highly complex; the process of an individual deciding on an action can occur through the use of logical and simple (if-then) rules to more sophisticated neural networks and genetic algorithms. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the ways in which decisions are integrated into a variety of ABMs and to give a prospectus on the future of modeling of decisions in ABMs.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 134, 'citationCount': 79, 'journal': {'name': 'Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{DeAngelis2019DecisionMakingIA,\n author = {D.

The model is motivated by related social psychological theories of group behavior and is implemented by incorporating the epidemiological emotion contagion mechanism with crowd's game-theoretic behaviors with an agent-based approach. Our simulation model generates some crowd patterns, including local outbursts of collective violence with grievance contagion, dynamic spatial clustering of violent civilians and the nonlinear evolution of collective violence. We also explore the variations of violence evolution by varying some parameters of our model. Results show that the high-density crowds and the widespread of grievance promote violence outburst.

In this paper, we propose a novel crowd simulation method by modeling the generation and contagion of panic emotion under multihazard circumstances. In order to depict the effect from hazards and other agents to crowd movement, we first classify hazards into different types (transient and persistent, concurrent and nonconcurrent, and static and dynamic) based on their inherent characteristics. Second, we introduce the concept of perilous field for each hazard and further transform the critical level of the field to its invoked-panic emotion. After that, we propose an emotional contagion model to simulate the evolving process of panic emotion caused by multiple hazards. Finally, we introduce an emotional reciprocal velocity obstacles (RVOs) model to simulate the crowd behaviors by augmenting the traditional RVO model with emotional contagion, which for the first time combines the emotional impact and local avoidance together. Our experimental results demonstrate that the overall approach is robust, can better generate realistic crowds and the panic emotion dynamics in a crowd. Furthermore, it is recommended that our method can be applied to various complex multihazard environments.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 57, 'citationCount': 88, 'journal': {'volume': '51', 'pages': '1567-1581', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Xu2018CrowdBS,\n author = {Mingliang Xu and Xiaozhen Xie and Pei Lv and Jiangwei Niu and Hua Wang and Chaochao Li and Ruijie Zhu and Z.

In this paper, we propose an emotion-based crowd simulation model integrating physical strength consumption. Inspired by the theory of “the devoted actor,” the movements of each individual in our model are determined by modeling the influence of physical strength consumption and the emotion of panic. In particular, human physical strength consumption is computed using a physics-based numerical method. Inspired by the James-Lange theory, panic levels are estimated by means of an enhanced emotional contagion model that leverages the inherent relationship between physical strength consumption and panic. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first method integrating physical strength consumption into an emotion-based crowd simulation model by exploiting the relationship between physical strength consumption and emotion. We highlight the performance on different scenarios and compare the resulting behaviors with real-world video sequences.

In disaster management scenaria, such as emergency evacuations, simulations are developed to demonstrate the behaviour of people acting under emotional pressure. It is implied that the models of agents in such simulations demand the integration of emotions and how these affect individuals. An issue present in any model development is to prove the validity of the model. More precisely, it is necessary to create experiments with models comparing their behaviour to known situations, e.g. real incidents that have been recorded in the past. Such comparisons usually involve calibrating model parameters with values so that model output maps to the real data acquired, as for example data from video footage. However, modelling emotional agents is an extremely challenging task because behaviour under the influence of emotions is affected by numerous factors, e.g. personality trait, emotion contagion, distortion of perception, noisy communication etc. Although there are various models that address these issues separately, there are very few models that integrate all of them. It is therefore invalid to calibrate partial emotional models against real data, and consequently, the similar to the real world behaviour obtained, would be a result of a careful selection of parameters. The present work aims at presenting arguments that believability should be used instead of validity, since the later will require a complete implementation of emotional agents to compare with complete real data.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 24, 'citationCount': 4, 'journal': {'name': 'Proceedings of the 8th Balkan Conference in Informatics'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Kefalas2017TheIO,\n author = {P.

This emotional dialogue between admins and users generated a process of emotional contagion that helped establish propitious psychological conditions for mass protest participation.

One consequence of this is a difficulty in distinguishing between affect diffusion and several other affective influence phenomena that look similar but have very different consequences. There is also a growing body of evidence that action synchrony is unlikely to be the only, or indeed the most important, pathway for affect diffusion. This paper has 2 key aims: (a) to craft a formal definition of affect diffusion that does justice to the core of the phenomenon while distinguishing it from other phenomena with which it is frequently confounded and (b) to advance a theory of the mechanisms of affect diffusion. This theory, which we call the multimodal theory of affect diffusion, identifies 3 parallel multimodal mechanisms that may act as routes for affect diffusion. It also provides a basis for novel predictions about the conditions under which affect is most likely to diffuse.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 264, 'citationCount': 43, 'journal': {'volume': '141 5', 'pages': '\n          966-92\n        ', 'name': 'Psychological bulletin'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Peters2015AMT,\n author = {K.

It means that in a similar situation, a same person will have a different behavior regarding to its emotional state. Therefore, this incidence from emotions toward individual's behavior also has an impact on groups [16] especially because of emotional contagion [7--15]. Actually, the way emotions may impact crowds' behavior has already been studied and even implemented [22] into multi-agent systems. However, what we are suggesting is a model of influence based on scale [37]: individual, group, crowd or multiple crowds, where the emotion propagation is different according to the relation between each levels. This way, we may first be able to model the contagion phenomenon between agents as it is already being done but also from crowd to agent or from crowd to crowd. Such propagations will then allow us to simulate panicking crowds but also hostiles and aggressive crowds in a multi-agent system.

Second, the emotional interaction of the group is realized based on OCEAN (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) personality trait and the improved CA-SIRS (Cellular Automaton-Susceptible Infected Recovered Susceptible) model. Third, after the perception of the external environment changes, the accident experience and panic level are used as factors of emotion update. At last, the environmental familiarity and nearby flow factors are introduced to path planning process.

The importance of public security in modern life can be seen in the epidemic outbreak in 2020. In particular, the epidemic can affect people’s psychology and emotions and change people’s behavior. Therefore, how to effectively improve people’s positive emotions in a panic has become an urgent problem. In social relations, most behaviors are produced by peer interaction. To simulate the interactions among peers more realistically, this paper studies the diversity and efficiency of evacuation behaviors from the trust of peers, the strength of social relations and empathy. First, a general framework of peer relationships is constructed based on asymmetric intimacy, including the relationship between intimacy relationship modeling. Then, the problem of the dynamic formation of peer groups is studied by employing the calculation method of asymmetric intimacy. The effect of positive emotion transmission mechanism on peer interaction behaviors is explored through asymmetric intimacy. Finally, the companion behaviors of the peers in several scenarios are simulated. The proposed method is compared with different emotion contagion models and the behavioral simulation models. Experimental results show that the positive emotions contagion of the peer behavior simulation method can concrete the macro group behavior and effectively simulate the peer group in an evacuation.

Traditionally, evacuation drills have been, and still are, being used to assess evacuation plans.

Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) is the preferred type of simulation for evacuation scenarios, due to its ability to model individual decision-making and social behaviour. In this paper we conduct meta-analysis of eighty-one peer-reviewed papers published between 2009 and 2019 that used ABS to model pedestrian evacuation. Our analysis assesses the current state-of-art and identifies opportunities for improvement. We identify seven dimensions over which the surveyed papers agree or differ. The dimensions include purpose of the simulation, type of emergency and environment considerations, type and scale of evacuated space, simulation software used, agents’ characteristics and behaviour, support of evacuation policies, and analysis and validation. We conduct meta-analysis of the surveyed papers along the identified dimensions.

After summarizing existing studies, a new simulation method is discussed in this paper. First, 3D virtual scenes are constructed with the proposed platform. Second, an individual cognitive architecture, which integrates perception, motivation, behavior, emotion, and personality, is proposed. Typical behaviors are analyzed and individual evacuation animations are realized with data captured by motion capture devices. Quantitative descriptions are presented to describe emotional changes in individual evacuation. Facial expression animation is used to represent individuals’ emotions. Finally, a crowd behavior model is designed on the basis of a social force model. Experiments are carried out to validate the proposed method. Results showed that individuals’ behavior, emotional changes, and crowd aggregation can be well simulated. Users can learn evacuation processes from many angles.

Prof. Dr. Uğur Güdükbay July, 2010 Crowd simulation has a wide range of application areas such as biological and social modeling, military simulations, computer games and movies. Simulating the behavior of animated virtual crowds has been a challenging task for the computer graphics community. As well as the physical and the geometrical aspects, the semantics underlying the motion of real crowds inspire the design and implementation of virtual crowds. Psychology helps us understand the motivations of the individuals constituting a crowd. There has been extensive research on incorporating psychological models into the simulation of autonomous agents. However, in our study, instead of the psychological state of an individual agent as such, we are interested in the overall behavior of the crowd that consists of virtual humans with various psychological states. For this purpose, we incorporate the three basic constituents of affect: personality, emotion and mood. Each of these elements contribute variably to the emergence of different aspects of behavior. We thus examine, by changing the parameters, how groups of people with different characteristics interact with each other, and accordingly, how the global crowd behavior is influenced. In the social psychology literature, crowds are classified as mobs and audiences. Audiences are passive crowds whereas mobs are active crowds with emotional, irrational and seemingly homogeneous behavior. In this thesis, we examine how audiences turn into mobs and simulate the common properties of mobs to create collective misbehavior. So far, crowd simulation research has focused on panicking crowds among all types of mobs. We extend the state of the art to simulate different types of mobs based on the taxonomy. We demonstrate various scenarios that realize the behavior of distinct mob types.

This volume represents a preliminary effort to identify the relevant variables involved and fit them into a systematic framework. Furthermore, it presents extensive sets of measures for investigating the theory and implementing it in a variety of everyday environments.Basically, the framework outlined here proposes that environmental stimuli are linked to behavioral responses by the primary emotional responses of arousal, pleasure, and dominance. By considering the impact of the environment on these basic emotional responses, the effects of diverse stimulus components within or across sense modalities can be readily compared. An additional concept, information rate, is used to compare the effects of different environments, each with stimulation in many sense modalities.

We evaluated the users' affective reactions to a crowd of VHs that exhibited distinct emotional expressions. A total of four emotions were presented, which were Positive, Negative, Neutral, and Mixed. The VHs performed verbal and non-behaviors accordingly. Under the Mixed condition, the VHs were divided into three groups equally and each group was uniquely assigned one of the three emotions (i.e., positive, negative, and neutral). Users collected ten items from a virtual reality market. To complete the tasks, they interacted using natural speech with the emotional VHs. Three language conditions were investigated: one condition in USA and another two conditions in Taiwan. The group of participants in USA interacted with the VHs in English; and the two groups of participants in Taiwan interacted with the VHs using a foreign (English) language and a native (Mandarin) language respectively. We discovered that the medium of communication or language familiarity had a strong influence on participants' emotional reactions. When participants interacted in a foreign language with VHs with a positive emotional disposition, we found their positive emotional reactions were subdued and negative reactions were elevated. However, this was not the case when participants interacted with VHs in their native language, as their emotional reactions were contingent on the emotional disposition of the VHs.",2021,75,4,"{'name': '2021 IEEE Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (VR)', 'pages': '188-197'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Volonte2021EffectsOL,\n author = {Matias Volonte and Chang-Chun Wang and Elham Ebrahimi and Yu-Chun Hsu and Kuan-Yu Liu and Sai-Keung Wong and Sabarish V.

We tested the effects of various background factors (i.e., age, sex, education, body mass index, nationality, civilization, and language) on the bodily sensation maps.

The existence of broad biases which favor more efficient processing of positive or negative emotions is still a controversial matter. While so far this question has been investigated separately for each modality, in this narrative review of the literature we focus on valence effects in processing both words and facial expressions. In order to identify the factors underlying positivity and negativity effects, and to uncover whether these effects depend on modality and age, we present and analyze three representative overviews of the literature concerning valence effects in word processing, face processing, and combinations of word and face processing. Our analysis of word processing studies points to a positivity bias or a balanced processing of positive and negative words, whereas the analysis of face processing studies showed the existence of separate positivity and negativity biases depending on the experimental paradigm. The mixed results seem to be a product of the different methods and types of stimuli being used. Interestingly, we found that children exhibit a clear positivity advantage for both word and face processing, indicating similar processing biases in both modalities. Over the course of development, the initial positivity advantage gradually disappears, and in some face processing studies even reverses into a negativity bias. We therefore conclude that there is a need for future research that systematically analyses the impact of age and modality on the emergence of these valence effects. Finally, we discuss possible explanations for the presence of the early positivity advantage and its subsequent decrease.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 115, 'citationCount': 82, 'journal': {'volume': '10', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Kauschke2019TheRO,\n author = {C.

Antagonistic emotions, which is the typical psychological state of agents in different roles (i.e., cops, activists, and civilians) in crowd violence scenes, and the way they spread through contagion in a crowd are important causes of crowd antagonistic behaviors. Moreover, games, which refers to the interaction between opposing groups adopting different strategies to obtain higher benefits and less casualties, determine the level of crowd violence. We present an antagonistic crowd simulation model (ACSEE), which is integrated with antagonistic emotional contagion and evolutionary game theories. Our approach models the antagonistic emotions between agents in different roles using two components: mental emotion and external emotion. We combine enhanced susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) and game approaches to evaluate the role of antagonistic emotional contagion in crowd violence. Our evolutionary game theoretic approach incorporates antagonistic emotional contagion through deterrent force, which is modelled by a mixture of emotional forces and physical forces defeating the opponents. Antagonistic emotional contagion and evolutionary game theories influence each other to determine antagonistic crowd behaviors. We evaluate our approach on real-world scenarios consisting of different kinds of agents. We also compare the simulated crowd behaviors with real-world crowd videos and use our approach to predict the trends of crowd movements in violence incidents.

It then presents a conceptual framework which builds upon recurring themes within the literature, including students’ beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours. The framework was developed by adopting a constant comparison method to analyse the literature, and to search for and identify current and emerging themes. The framework identifies indicators for five key elements of online engagement, and the authors propose that the framework provides a guide for researchers and academics when exploring online engagement from a conceptual, practical and research basis. Finally, the paper provides recommendations for practice, outlining how the framework might be used to reflect critically upon the effectiveness of online courses and their ability to engage students.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 64, 'citationCount': 215, 'journal': {'volume': '22', 'pages': '183-204', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Redmond2018AnOE,\n author = {P.

In this paper, we propose a novel crowd simulation method by modeling the generation and contagion of panic emotion under multihazard circumstances. In order to depict the effect from hazards and other agents to crowd movement, we first classify hazards into different types (transient and persistent, concurrent and nonconcurrent, and static and dynamic) based on their inherent characteristics. Second, we introduce the concept of perilous field for each hazard and further transform the critical level of the field to its invoked-panic emotion. After that, we propose an emotional contagion model to simulate the evolving process of panic emotion caused by multiple hazards. Finally, we introduce an emotional reciprocal velocity obstacles (RVOs) model to simulate the crowd behaviors by augmenting the traditional RVO model with emotional contagion, which for the first time combines the emotional impact and local avoidance together. Our experimental results demonstrate that the overall approach is robust, can better generate realistic crowds and the panic emotion dynamics in a crowd. Furthermore, it is recommended that our method can be applied to various complex multihazard environments.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 57, 'citationCount': 88, 'journal': {'volume': '51', 'pages': '1567-1581', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Xu2018CrowdBS,\n author = {Mingliang Xu and Xiaozhen Xie and Pei Lv and Jiangwei Niu and Hua Wang and Chaochao Li and Ruijie Zhu and Z.

Are these signals reliant on culturally learned cues or are they intelligible across individuals lacking exposure to a common culture? To find out, we traveled to a remote Kreung village in Ratanakiri, Cambodia. First, we recorded Kreung portrayals of 5 emotions through bodily movement. These videos were later shown to American participants, who matched the videos with appropriate emotional labels with above chance accuracy (Study 1). The Kreung also viewed Western point-light displays of emotions. After each display, they were asked to either freely describe what was being expressed (Study 2) or choose from 5 predetermined response options (Study 3). Across these studies, Kreung participants recognized Western point-light displays of anger, fear, happiness, sadness, and pride with above chance accuracy. Kreung raters were not above chance in deciphering an American point-light display depicting love, suggesting that recognizing love may rely, at least in part, on culturally specific cues or modalities other than bodily movement. In addition, multidimensional scaling of the patterns of nonverbal behavior associated with each emotion in each culture suggested that similar patterns of nonverbal behavior are used to convey the same emotions across cultures. The considerable cross-cultural intelligibility observed across these studies suggests that the communication of emotion through movement is largely shaped by aspects of physiology and the environment shared by all humans, irrespective of differences in cultural context.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 65, 'citationCount': 26, 'journal': {'volume': '17', 'pages': '459–477', 'name': 'Emotion'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Parkinson2017EmotionsAU,\n author = {Carolyn Parkinson and Trent Walker and Sarah Memmi and T.

Furthermore, most of the models that address crowd disasters belong to the physical or the cognitive approaches.

However, in this work, based on a behavioral rules approach, we aim to model emergent emotion, behavior and influence in a crowd, taking into account particularly the personality of members of the crowd. For this purpose, we have combined the OCEAN (Openness, Consciousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) personality model with the OCC (Ortony, Clore, and Collins) emotional model to indicate the susceptibility of each of the five personality factors to feeling every emotion. Then we proposed an approach that uses first fuzzy logic for the emotional modeling of critical emotions of members of the crowd at the announcement or the presence of unusual events, in order to quantify emotions. Then, we model the behavior and the tendency towards actions using probability theory. Finally, the influence among the members of the crowd is modeled using the neighborhood principle and cellular automata.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 26, 'citationCount': 16, 'journal': {'volume': '24', 'pages': '428 - 445', 'name': 'Adaptive Behavior'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Saifi2016AnAF,\n author = {Lynda Saifi and Abdelhak Boubetra and Farid Nouioua},\n journal = {Adaptive Behavior},\n pages = {428 - 445},\n title = {An approach for emotions and behavior modeling in a crowd in the presence of rare events},\n volume = {24},\n year = {2016}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '7619490', 'name': 'Lynda Saifi'}, {'authorId': '1967138', 'name': 'Abdelhak Boubetra'}, {'authorId': '1783796', 'name': 'Farid Nouioua'}]}, {'paperId': 'e02648627d288b07e7ee83e3bf80ae447514ad3f', 'title': 'WarpDriver: context-aware probabilistic motion prediction for crowd simulation', 'abstract': 'Microscopic crowd simulators rely on models of local interaction (e.g. collision avoidance) to synthesize the individual motion of each virtual agent. The quality of the resulting motions heavily depends on this component, which has significantly improved in the past few years. Recent advances have been in particular due to the introduction of a short-horizon motion prediction strategy that enables anticipated motion adaptation during local interactions among agents. However, the simplicity of prediction techniques of existing models somewhat limits their domain of validity. In this paper, our key objective is to significantly improve the quality of simulations by expanding the applicable range of motion predictions. To this end, we present a novel local interaction algorithm with a new context-aware, probabilistic motion prediction model. By context-aware, we mean that this approach allows crowd simulators to account for many factors, such as the influence of environment layouts or in-progress interactions among agents, and has the ability to simultaneously maintain several possible alternate scenarios for future motions and to cope with uncertainties on sensing and other agent\'s motions. Technically, this model introduces ""collision probability fields"" between agents, efficiently computed through the cumulative application of Warp Operators on a source Intrinsic Field. We demonstrate how this model significantly improves the quality of simulated motions in challenging scenarios, such as dense crowds and complex environments.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 38, 'citationCount': 46, 'journal': {'volume': '35', 'pages': '164:1-164:11', 'name': 'ACM Trans.

To efficiently compute feasible movement directions for each agent, we discretize the movement direction field of the agent and use a bit string to estimate the set of movement directions. Each bit of the bit string represents a span of movement directions. The proposed approach enables the agents to move around simple objects without using expensive global search techniques.

We empirically evaluated the effects of near visually realistic vs. non-realistic stylized appearance of virtual humans on the emotional response of participants in a medical virtual reality system that was designed to educate users in recognizing the signs and symptoms of patient deterioration. In a between-subjects experiment protocol, participants interacted with one of three different appearances of a virtual patient, namely visually realistic, cartoon-shaded and charcoal-sketch like conditions in a mixed reality simulation. Emotional impact were measured via a combination of quantitative objective measures were gathered using skin Electrodermal Activity (EDA) sensors, and quantitative subjective measures such as the Differential Emotion Survey (DES IV), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and Social Presence questionnaire. The emotional states of the participants were analyzed across four distinct time steps during which the medical condition of the virtual patient deteriorated (an emotionally stressful interaction), and were contrasted to a baseline affective state. Objective EDA results showed that in all three conditions, male participants exhibited greater levels of arousal as compared to female participants. We found that negative affect levels were significantly lower in the visually realistic condition, as compared to the stylized appearance conditions. Furthermore, in emotional dimensions of interest-excitement, surprise, anger, fear and guilt participants in all conditions responded similarly. However, in social emotional constructs of shyness, presence, perceived personality, and enjoyment-joy, we found that participants responded differently in the visually realistic condition as compared to the cartoon and sketch conditions.

The fundamental building blocks of gaze behaviors are gaze shifts: coordinated movements of the eyes, head, and body toward objects and information in the environment. In this article, we present a novel computational model for gaze shift synthesis for ECAs that supports parametric control over coordinated eye, head, and upper body movements. We employed the model in three studies with human participants. In the first study, we validated the model by showing that participants are able to interpret the agent’s gaze direction accurately. In the second and third studies, we showed that by adjusting the participation of the head and upper body in gaze shifts, we can control the strength of the attention signals conveyed, thereby strengthening or weakening their social and cognitive effects. The second study shows that manipulation of eye--head coordination in gaze enables an agent to convey more information or establish stronger affiliation with participants in a teaching task, while the third study demonstrates how manipulation of upper body coordination enables the agent to communicate increased interest in objects in the environment.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 86, 'citationCount': 49, 'journal': {'volume': '5', 'pages': '1 - 34', 'name': 'ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS)'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Pejsa2015GazeAA,\n author = {T.

One application concerns forensic investigations. Compared to emotional phrases in a native language, emotional phrases heard or read in a foreign language elicit weaker skin-conductance responses (SCRs). In one study involving a mock crime, SCRs elicited by a foreign language were high and insensitive to emotionality, suggesting a stress response. A second application is decision making, given recent findings that judgments in a foreign language are influenced by emotional content. This raises the question of how to assess the real-world importance of this provocative laboratory finding. A third application is the emotional and logical appeal of advertising slogans.

By modulating the set of available behavior parameters in this framework for controlling pose and motion dynamics, the gestures performed by the humanoid robot NAO were adjusted to display either a positive or negative mood. In the study performed, we varied both mood as well as task difficulty. Our results show that participants are able to differentiate between positive and negative robot mood. Moreover, self-reported mood matches the mood of the robot in the easy task condition. Additional evidence for mood contagion is provided by the fact that we were able to replicate an expected effect of negative mood on task performance: in the negative mood condition participants performed better on difficult tasks than in the positive mood condition, even though participants' self-reported mood did not match that of the robot."", 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 41, 'citationCount': 48, 'journal': {'pages': '973-980'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Xu2014RobotMI,\n author = {Junchao Xu and J.

Our objective measures included the use of psycho-physical Electro Dermal Activity (EDA) sensors, and subjective measures inspired by social psychology research included the Differential Emotions Survey (DES IV) and Positive and Negative Affect Survey (PANAS). We analyzed the quantitative and qualitative measures associated with participants' emotional state at four distinct time-steps in the simulated interpersonal experience as the virtual patient's medical condition deteriorated. Results suggest that participants in the dynamic condition with animations exhibited a higher sense of co-presence and greater emotional response as compared to participants in the static condition, corresponding to the deterioration in the medical condition of the virtual patient. Negative affect of participants in the dynamic condition increased at a higher rate than for participants in the static condition.

Twenty-six fourth-year medical students practiced performing a prostate exam on a prostate exam simulator. Participants in the experimental condition examined a simulator augmented with a virtual human. Other participants examined a standard unaugmented simulator. Participants reactions were assessed using self-reported, behavioral, and physiological metrics. Participants who examined the virtual human experienced significantly more stress, measured via skin conductance. Participants stress was correlated with previous experience performing real prostate exams; participants who had performed more real prostate exams were more likely to experience stress while examining the virtual human. Participants who examined the virtual human showed signs of greater engagement; non-stressed participants performed better prostate exams while stressed participants treated the virtual human more realistically. Results indicated that stress evoked by virtual humans is linked to similar previous real-world stressful experiences, implying that learners real-world experience must be taken into account when using virtual humans to prepare them for stressful interpersonal experiences.', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 29, 'citationCount': 25, 'journal': {'volume': '19', 'pages': '662-670', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Robb2013LeveragingVH,\n author = {Andrew C.

Our model accounts for permanent, stable disposition and the dynamic nature of human behaviors that change in response to the situation. The resulting approach accounts for changes in behavior in response to external stressors based on well-known theories in psychology. We combine this model with recent techniques on personality modeling for multi-agent simulations to capture a wide variety of behavioral changes and stressors. The overall formulation allows different stressors, expressed as functions of space and time, including time pressure, positional stressors, area stressors and inter-personal stressors. This model can be used to simulate dynamic crowd behaviors at interactive rates, including walking at variable speeds, breaking lane-formation over time, and cutting through a normal flow.

Humans use a range of different cues to communicate to others how they feel, including facial, vocal, and gestural signals. Although much is known about facial expressions of emotion, less research has focused on affect in the voice. We compare British listeners to individuals from remote Namibian villages who have had no exposure to Western culture, and examine recognition of non-verbal emotional vocalizations, such as screams and laughs. We show that a number of emotions can be universally recognized from non-verbal vocal signals. In addition we demonstrate the specificity of this pattern, with a set of additional emotions only recognized within, but not across these cultural groups. Our findings indicate that a small set of primarily negative emotions have evolved signals across several modalities, while most positive emotions are communicated with culture-specific signals. Keywords: emotion; voice; happiness; affective signals. Background Some human traits are shared by all human beings, despite differences in language, culture and ecology. These psychological universals tell us what features of the human mind are part of our shared biological heritage and which are products of culture and language. Because all humans share the vast majority of their genetic makeup with all other humans, there is great similarity in the physical features that are typical for our species, while minor characteristics vary between individuals. Similarly to physical features, many aspects of the human psychology are shared. For example, all human societies have complex systems of communication to convey their thoughts, feelings, and intentions to those around them (Hauser, Chomsky & Fitch, 2002). But although there are some commonalities between different communicative systems, speakers of different languages cannot understand each other. Or rather, they cannot understand either other’s words and sentences. Other aspects of communicative systems do not rely on common lexical codes and may be shared across linguistic and cultural borders. One candidate of communicative systems for constituting a psychological universal is emotional signals. Humans use a range of signals to communicate emotions, including vocalizations, facial expressions, and postural cues. Auditory signals allows for affective communication when the recipient cannot see the sender, for example, across a distance or at night. In addition, young infants are sensitive to vocal cues from the very beginning of life, when their visual system is still relatively immature (Mehler, Bertoncini & Barrier, Vocal signals of emotions can occur overlaid on speech in the form of affective prosody (Scherer, Banse & Wallbott, 2001). However, humans also make use of a range of non- verbal vocalizations to communicate how they feel, such as screams and laughs. In this study we investigate whether these kinds of non-verbal emotional vocalizations communicate the same affective states regardless of the listener’s culture. Currently, the only available cross-cultural data comes from studies of emotional prosody in speech (e.g., Scherer et al., 2001). This work has indicated that listeners can infer some affective states from emotionally inflected speech across cultural boundaries. However, emotional information overlaid on speech (or nonsense-speech) is restricted by the segmental and supra-segmental structure of speech.

Typical approaches either look like particle simulations (where agents 'vibrate' back and forth) or are conservative in the range of motion possible (agents aren't allowed to 'push' each other). Our HiDAC system (High Density Autonomous Crowds) focuses on the problem of simulating the local motion behaviors of crowds moving in a natural manner within dynamically changing virtual environments. This is achieved by applying a combination of psychological and geometrical rules layered on top of a social forces model. The results show: elimination of agent 'shaking' behavior, fast perception, and a wide variety of emergent behaviors including: bi-directional flows, overtaking, emergent queuing with different line widths, agents being 'pushed' and 'falling', and panic propagation. These behaviors emerge based on the current situation, agent personality and perceived density of the crowd. \nTo accurately simulate crowds in large, complex environments, it is not enough to only model local motion; agents must also have the ability to navigate the unknown virtual environment. We therefore address the problems that arise during crowd navigation where not all individuals have complete knowledge of the building's internal structure. In addition, we simulate the effects of communication on the behavior of autonomous agents while exploring the building. We have developed a system called MACES (Multi-Agent Communication for Evacuation Simulation) which combines local motion with wayfinding using inter-agent communication and different roles. Together they automatically augment an agent's mental map of the environment to produce empirically better maze evacuation performance. \nWe study the emergent behavior during building evacuation under different conditions such as agents using communication to share their knowledge of the building routes and hazards, psychological factors driving different navigation skills, and agents taking different roles such as trained personnel, leaders and followers. The experimental results show significant improvements in evacuation rates with inter-agent communication and demonstrate that only a relatively small percentage of trained leaders yield evacuation rates comparable to the case where all are trained. \nThe framework presented in this dissertation combines decision making, including communication and roles (MACES), with local motion (HiDAC). The two systems interact in real-time while being driven by a set of psychological and physiological parameters that allow the user to have control over the final behavior exhibited by the crowd."", 'year': 2006, 'referenceCount': 93, 'citationCount': 16, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Badler2006ModelingRH,\n author = {N.

By means of molecular-dynamic-like microsimulations based on a generalized force model of interactive pedestrian dynamics, the spatio-temporal patterns in pedestrian crowds are successfully reproduced and interpreted as self-organized phenomena. In contrast to previous socio-psychological approaches, this allows a physical understanding of the observations. Despite the significantly different phenomena occuring in normal and panic situations, the main effects can be described by a unified model containing only well interpretable and plausible terms. The transition between the “rational” normal behavior and the apparently “irrational” panic behavior is controlled by a single parameter, the “nervousness”, which influences fluctuation strengths, desired speeds, and the tendency of herding. Thereby, it causes paradoxial effects like “freezing by heating”, “faster is slower”, and the ignorance of available exits. Nevertheless, there are measures to improve pedestrian flows, both in normal and panic situations. For example, the suitable placement of columns can help, although they reduce the accessible space.', 'year': 2002, 'referenceCount': 158, 'citationCount': 933, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'pages': '21-58', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Helbing2002SimulationOP,\n author = {D.

We provide experimental evidence that emotional contagion occurs without direct interaction between people (exposure to a friend expressing an emotion is sufficient), and in the complete absence of nonverbal cues. Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’ positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 15, 'citationCount': 2555, 'journal': {'volume': '111', 'pages': '8788 - 8790', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Kramer2014ExperimentalEO,\n author = {Adam D.

Yet in spite of the rapid growth of computational affective modeling, no systematic guidelines exist for model design and analysis. Lack of systematic guidelines contributes to ad hoc design practices, hinders model sharing and re-use, and makes systematic comparison of existing models and theories challenging. Lack of a common computational terminology also hinders cross-disciplinary communication that is essential to advance our understanding of emotions. In this chapter the author proposes a computational analytical framework to provide a basis for systematizing affective model design by: (1) viewing emotion models in terms of two core types: emotion generation and emotion effects, and (2) identifying the generic computational tasks necessary to implement these processes. The chapter then discusses how these computational ‘building blocks’ can support the development of design guidelines, and a systematic analysis of distinct emotion theories and alternative means of their implementation. 1.0 INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES The past 15 years have witnessed a rapid growth in computational models of emotion and affective agent architectures. Researchers in cognitive science, AI, HCI, robotics and gaming are developing ‘models of emotion’, primarily to create more believable and effective synthetic characters and robots, and to enhance human-computer interaction. Less frequently, these models are being developed for basic research purposes, to help elucidate the nature of the mechanisms mediating affective a variety of affective phenomena.

Safety officers can spread positive emotions and reduce crowd panic by issuing information or appeasement, which is an effective way to ensure evacuation safety. However, how to deploy safety officers appropriately and maximize positive emotional contagion to cover the largest number of chaotic individuals is still a challenging problem. To solve this problem, we propose an IoT-based positive emotional contagion (IoT-PEC) method for crowd evacuation. First, we employ IoT technologies to capture the attributes of crowd movement, such as position and velocity. Based on these attributes, the crowd chaos can be quantified by calculating the macroscopic and microscopic entropies. Second, we propose an entropy-based anisotropic emotional contagion model (E-AECM) to achieve the nonuniform positive emotional contagion considering the influence of chaos on the propagation rate.

In this study, we simulate an emergency situation in an open square area with three exits considering Adults and Children agents with different behavior. Also, Security agents are considered in order to guide Adults and Children for finding the exits and be calm. Six levels of emotion levels are considered for each agent in different scenarios and situations.

One of the earliest epidemic models conceived was by Daniel Bernoulli in 1760, which was motivated by studying the spread of smallpox [1]. In addition to Bernoulli, there were many different researchers also working on mathematical epidemic models around this time [2]. These initial models were quite simplistic, and the further development and study of such models dates back to the 1900s [3]-[6], where still-simple models were studied to provide insight into how various diseases can spread through a population. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in these problems as the concept of ""networks"" becomes increasingly prevalent in modeling many different aspects of the world today.

We provide experimental evidence that emotional contagion occurs without direct interaction between people (exposure to a friend expressing an emotion is sufficient), and in the complete absence of nonverbal cues. Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’ positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 15, 'citationCount': 2555, 'journal': {'volume': '111', 'pages': '8788 - 8790', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Kramer2014ExperimentalEO,\n author = {Adam D.

Then, we trained regression models to bridge low‐level traffic simulation parameters and high‐level perceived traffic behaviors (i.e., adjectives according to the PEN model and the three PEN traits). We also conducted an additional user study to validate the effectiveness and usefulness of our approach, in particular, high correlation coefficients and the Pearson values between users’ feedback and our model predictions prove the effectiveness of our approach.

18,ea8467e1d26f472a5fc8579d0fc8372149283acc,Socially Supported by an Embodied Agent: The Development of a Virtual-Reality Paradigm to Study Social Emotion Regulation,"Social emotion regulation, which can be understood as the intentional efforts by one person to regulate emotions of another person, is something we encounter and benefit from every day, and becomes especially important when a person is unable to handle an emotion or an emotional event by themselves. A paradigm that examines whether someone can perceive and benefit from regulatory efforts by another person, represented here by a virtual agent, would be highly relevant for experimental studies investigating social emotion regulation, as well as for interventions in the clinical and sub-clinical context. Virtual reality (VR) provides perhaps the ideal opportunity to test social interactions and difficulties with them, as it counters typical methodological problems of behavioral experiments, such as the trade-off between ecological validity and experimental control, as well as the difficulty of replicating social situations. The goal of the present methods paper is twofold: to provide a detailed description of the development of a novel paradigm consisting of two scenarios in VR designed to test the efficacy of social emotion regulation, and to present the anticipated results for the target populations of typically developing and autistic youth. Participants are presented with a virtual school environment and take part in two activities with a class of students and a teacher, all of whom are virtual agents. In both scenarios, participants experience a potentially stressful situation and are subsequently offered emotional support by a friendly student. Throughout the experiment, self-reports in the form of virtual smiley scales and psychophysiological measurements are collected as markers of the participants’ emotional states. Pilot results will be discussed in line with anticipated outcomes, to indicate that the experiment will be able to show the efficacy of social support by a virtual agent and provide insight into social emotion regulation for different populations. The school environment and the character of the friendly student also have the potential to be adapted for follow-up experiments on additional aspects of social emotion regulation for a variety of contexts.",2022,53,0,{'volume': '3'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Stallmann2022SociallySB,\n author = {Lina Stallmann and Daniel Dukes and Michel Tran and Valentin Durand de Gevigney and D.

It has been used for assessments and training in social cognition with the use of virtual agents instead of face-to-face interactions – but its potential for the study of social emotion regulation has, perhaps surprisingly, largely remained untapped. The present study evaluates a novel immersive VR scenario designed to study the efficacy of social support by a virtual agent using a modified version of Cyberball, an established paradigm to induce the feeling of ostracism. Participants embodied a new pupil in a virtual school environment and played Cyberball, after which they either did or did not receive emotional support. Self-reports and psychophysiological markers demonstrated that the negative impact of social exclusion in Cyberball was successfully replicated, while participants also reported a significant improvement in emotional state after being supported by the virtual agent. These results indicate the potential of the developed scenario for research on social emotion regulation in immersive VR.

However, direct links between emotional and social stimuli, distinct neural processes and behavioural outcomes are still missing. Using data of 27 female participants, the current study delineated a large-scale process model of social buffering’s neural underpinnings, connecting changes in neural activity to emotional behaviour by means of voxel-wise multilevel mediation analysis. Our results confirmed that three processes underlie human social buffering: (i) social support-related reduction of activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, anterior and mid-cingulate; (ii) downregulation of aversive emotion-induced brain activity in the superficial cortex-like amygdala and mediodorsal thalamus; and (iii) downregulation of reported aversive feelings. Results of the current study provide evidence for a distinct neural process model of aversive emotion regulation in humans by social buffering.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 57, 'citationCount': 8, 'journal': {'volume': '15', 'pages': '561 - 570', 'name': 'Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Bratec2020YourPS,\n author = {Satja Mulej Bratec and Teresa Bertram and G.

The review highlights evidence concerning how relationship processes influence emotion regulation.

But what do empathizers want others to feel? Though psychologists have studied empathy and prosociality for decades, this question has yet to be clearly addressed. This is because virtually all existing research focuses on a model under which improving others' well-being also comprises heightening their positive affect or decreasing their negative affect and helping them reach their own emotional goals. In this review, I argue that real-life empathic goals encompass a broader range-including sometimes worsening targets' affect or contravening their wishes in order to improve their well-being-that can be productively integrated into the framework of interpersonal emotion regulation (IER). I review the empathic IER spectrum in a number of contexts, including close relationships, professional caregiving, and group-based emotions. Integrating empathy and IER provides a synthetic and generative way to ask new questions about how social emotions produce prosocial actions.

An emerging literature highlights the importance of interpersonal ER, which utilizes social cues to facilitate the regulation of emotional states. In cultures that place high value on social interconnectedness as integral to their collectivistic self-construal, including East Asian cultures, interpersonal ER strategies may be particularly effective in reducing negative affect but this has not been previously tested. In this study, two groups comprising East Asian (n = 48) and Western European (n = 38) participants were randomly assigned to receive a priming narration depicting the use of either interpersonal (e.g., social modeling, perspective taking) or intrapersonal (e.g., cognitive reappraisal) ER strategies during a stressful experience. They were then instructed to utilize similar ER strategies in an emotion reactivity task during which they viewed high arousing negative pictorial stimuli while their heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (high frequency power – HF-HRV) and subjective affective states were measured. First we found that the East Asian group reported higher use of interpersonal ER strategies of social modeling and perspective taking in daily life. During the experimental interpersonal prime exposure, the East Asian group showed elevated HF-HRV (relative to baseline) compared to the Western European group, indicating more adaptive ER, but this pattern was not sustained during the reactivity or recovery phases. Instead, the East Asian group demonstrated increased HF-HRV and decreased HR across both prime conditions. The East Asian group also showed greater decreases in positive affect across the course of the experiment. Furthermore, individual differences in social modeling and individualistic self-construal moderated the effect of the ER prime in the East Asian group at trend levels, and main effects for perspective taking and reappraisal were observed in the Western European group. The findings support the notion that engaging in interpersonal ER strategies may be more beneficial for East Asian groups when immediately exposed to a stressful situation, as these strategies are congruent with cultural context and preferences, but our priming methodology may have limited the longer-term benefits.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 76, 'citationCount': 23, 'journal': {'volume': '10', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Liddell2019CulturalDI,\n author = {B.

Interestingly, individuals who self-reported using both high suppression and reappraisal expressed relatively high positive well-being and low depression symptoms.

Regulation is seen as having emerged with the withdrawal by governments from direct provision of many economic and social services, to be replaced by corporatist bureaucracies and quasi-public agencies managing the complex public–private interactions of financialized capitalism. The arguments for ‘smart’ regulation have, in an era fixated on neo-liberalism, generally legitimized delegation of responsibility to big business. Its advocates, having been drawn into policy fields, have perhaps too often lost their critical edge, and allowed it to become instrumentalized, reflecting the technicist character of its practice.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 561, 'journal': {'volume': '26', 'pages': '676 - 699', 'name': 'Social & Legal Studies'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Picciotto2017Regulation,\n author = {S.

Parents of individuals with ASD and TD individuals were interviewed about their child's emotional experience and the use and efficacy of 10 ER strategies. In addition, participants filled out daily diaries on experience and regulation in the same emotional domains.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared to TD individuals, parents reported that individuals with ASD experienced more anger and anxiety and less amusement, made less frequent use of a variety of adaptive ER strategies (e.g. problem solving, cognitive reappraisal), and made more frequent use of maladaptive strategies (e.g. repetitive behavior). Moreover, individuals with ASD were less effective at utilizing adaptive ER strategies. Self-reports showed differences in experience of amusement and in ER strategies for anger and anxiety, but not in experience of anger and anxiety.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study provides evidence that individuals with ASD less frequently use adaptive - but more frequently use maladaptive - ER strategies.

Researchers studying individual differences in social interactions are typically interested in keeping the behavior and the appearance of the interaction partner constant across participants. With IVET researchers have full control over the interaction partners, can standardize them while still keeping the simulation realistic. Virtual simulations are valid: growing evidence shows that indeed studies conducted with IVET can replicate some well-known findings of social psychology. Moreover, IVET allows researchers to subtly manipulate characteristics of the environment (e.g., visual cues to prime participants) or of the social partner (e.g., his/her race) to investigate their influences on participants’ behavior and cognition. Furthermore, manipulations that would be difficult or impossible in real life (e.g., changing participants’ height) can be easily obtained with IVET. Beside the advantages for theoretical research, we explore the most recent training and clinical applications of IVET, its integration with other technologies (e.g., social sensing) and future challenges for researchers (e.g., making the communication between virtual humans and participants smoother).', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 83, 'citationCount': 102, 'journal': {'volume': '6', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Bombari2015StudyingSI,\n author = {Dario Bombari and M.

However, parents and clinicians have long noted the importance of emotional problems in individuals with ASD (e.g. tantrums and “meltdowns”). In this study, 21 high‐functioning children and adolescents with ASD and 22 age and gender group‐matched typically developing (TD) controls completed a Reactivity and Regulation Situation Task. This task assesses emotional reactivity and spontaneous use of emotion regulation strategies (problem solving, cognitive reappraisal, avoidance, distraction, venting, suppression, and relaxation) in the context of age‐appropriate ambiguous and potentially threatening negative scenarios. After the concept of cognitive reappraisal was explained, the scenarios were presented again to participants, and they were prompted to use this strategy. Results indicated that individuals with ASD exhibited the same level of reactivity to negative stimuli as TD participants. Furthermore, youth with ASD had a different emotion regulation profile than TD individuals, characterized by a less frequent use of cognitive reappraisal and more frequent use of suppression. When prompted to use cognitive reappraisal, participants with ASD were less able to implement reappraisal, but benefitted from this strategy when they were able to generate a reappraisal. Findings from this study suggest that cognitive reappraisal strategies may be useful to children and adolescents with ASD. Therefore, the development of treatment programs that focus on enhancing the use of adaptive forms of emotion regulation might decrease emotional problems and optimize long‐term outcomes in youth with ASD.

However, studies assessing physiological reactions to social rejection are rare and results of these studies were found to be ambiguous. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine and specify physiological effects of social rejection. Methods: Participants (n = 50) were assigned to either a social exclusion or inclusion condition of a virtual ball-tossing game (Cyberball). Immediate and delayed physiological [skin conductance level (SCL) and heart rate] reactions were recorded. In addition, subjects reported levels of affect, emotional states, and fundamental needs. Results: Subjects who were socially rejected showed increased heart rates. However, social rejection had no effect on subjects' SCLs. Both conditions showed heightened arousal on this measurement. Furthermore, psychological consequences of social rejection indicated the validity of the paradigm. Conclusions: Our results reveal that social rejection evokes an immediate physiological reaction. Accelerated heart rates indicate that behavior activation rather than inhibition is associated with socially threatening events. In addition, results revealed gender-specific response patterns suggesting that sample characteristics such as differences in gender may account for ambiguous findings of physiological reactions to social rejection."", 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 84, 'citationCount': 49, 'journal': {'volume': '5', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Iffland2014RapidHB,\n author = {Benjamin Iffland and L.

We first map a ""space"" differentiating classes of interpersonal regulation according to whether an individual uses an interpersonal regulatory episode to alter their own or another person\'s emotion.

There have been mixed reactions from audiences to lifelike characters used in movies and games, with some saying that the increased realism highlights subtle imperfections, which can be disturbing. Some developers opt for a stylized rendering (such as cartoon-shading) to avoid a negative reaction [Thompson 2004]. In this paper, we investigate some of the consequences of choosing realistic or stylized rendering in order to provide guidelines for developers for creating appealing virtual characters.

However, we expected people in high-intensity negative situations to show a relative preference to choose to regulate emotions by disengagement distraction, which blocks emotional processing at an early stage before it gathers force. In three experiments, we created emotional contexts that varied in intensity, using either emotional pictures (Experiments 1 and 2) or unpredictable electric stimulation (Experiment 3).

Whilst there has been some progress in testing the relevance and applicability of VR for children on the autism spectrum in educational contexts, there remains a significant challenge in developing robust and usable technologies that can really make a difference in real world classrooms. This article considers the evidence that has been published over the past 10 years to assess how the potential of VR has been explored in practice and reflect on the current state-of-the-art in this field.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 50, 'citationCount': 302, 'journal': {'volume': '26', 'pages': '355 - 366', 'name': 'European Journal of Special Needs Education'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Parsons2011StateoftheartOV,\n author = {S.

Do some emotion regulation strategies have more to recommend them than others? According to Gross's (1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271-299) process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners.

We conducted a feasibility and proof-of-concept study to assess the potential of virtual reality and electroencephalography, with or without an intelligent agent, that adapts the presented material to the emotions elicited by the environment. Method: Older adults with subjective cognitive decline recruited from the community received a virtual reality-based intervention taking place in one of two virtual environments, a train (Part 1, N = 19) or a music theatre, complemented by the intelligent agent (Part 2, N = 19). A comparative control group (N = 19) receiving no intervention was also included. All participants completed measures of affect and cognition before and after the intervention. The intervention groups completed measures of cybersickness and user experience after the intervention. Results: Participants did not suffer from increased cybersickness following either intervention. They also reported a positive to highly positive user experience concerning the following aspects: attractivity, hedonic quality-identity and hedonic quality-stimulation. The measures of affect showed no pre-post change when comparing either intervention to the control condition. However, a reduction of negative affect was observed following the train intervention for participants with a high self-reported negative affect at baseline. Finally, there was a significant improvement in working memory when comparing either intervention group to the control condition. Conclusion: Our results support the feasibility and tolerability of the technology, and a positive impact on cognition, paving the way for a larger-scale randomized clinical trial to confirm efficacy.",2022,45,1,{'volume': '2'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Cuesta2022VirtualRA,\n author = {M.

In older individuals with a mild cognitive impairment, deficits in working memory are frequent and can precede those of episodic memory, in addition to having a strong prognostic value of evolution toward a dementia of Alzheimer type. Because of its implication in numerous cognitive and cognitive-motor tasks, working memory is called upon in a wide range of daily life activities. Impairment in working memory therefore increases the risk of a loss of autonomy. In the current review, we present different working memory training programs. We show how these training programs are associated with specific effects and to near and far transfers towards other cognitive functions in older adults without cognitive impairment or with mild cognitive impairment, as well as in patients with dementia. We show that the benefits are confirmed by neuronal modifications, suggesting an improvement in the neuronal efficiency of the targeted or related trained processes.

VR app studies with older adults have primarily focused on rehabilitation and physical function including gait, balance, fall prevention, pain management, and cognition. Several systematic reviews have previously been conducted, but much of the extant literature is focused on rehabilitation or other institutional settings, and little is known about the effectiveness of VR apps using immersive headsets to target health outcomes among community-dwelling older adults. Objective The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of VR apps delivered using commercially available immersive headsets to improve physical, mental, or psychosocial health outcomes in community-dwelling older adults. Methods Peer-reviewed publications that included community-dwelling older adults aged ≥60 years residing in residential aged care settings and nursing homes were included. This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for systematic reviews of effectiveness evidence. The title of this review was registered with JBI, and the systematic review protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. Results In total, 7 studies that specifically included community-dwelling older adults were included in this review. VR apps using a head-mounted display led to improvements in a number of health outcomes, including pain management, posture, cognitive functioning specifically related to Alzheimer disease, and a decreased risk of falls. A total of 6 studies reported a statistically significant difference post VR intervention, and 1 study reported an improvement in cognitive function to reduce navigational errors. Only one study reported on the usability and acceptability of the interventions delivered through VR. While one study used a distraction mechanism for pain management, none of the studies used gaming technology to promote enjoyment. Conclusions Interventions to improve health outcomes through VR have demonstrated potential; however, the ability to synthesize findings by primary outcome for the older adult population is not possible. A number of factors, especially related to frailty, usability, and acceptability, also need to be explored before more substantial recommendations on the effectiveness of VR interventions for older adults can be made.

One approach to validate these concepts is to investigate the relationship between pathological brain markers and cognition in those individuals. Method We included 126 participants from the Consortium for the Early Identification of Alzheimer’s disease-Quebec (CIMA-Q) cohort (67 SCD, 29 MCI, and 30 cognitively healthy controls [CH]). All participants underwent a complete cognitive assessment and structural magnetic resonance imaging. Group comparisons were done using cognitive data, and then correlated with hippocampal volumes and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). Results Significant differences were found between participants with MCI and CH on episodic and executive tasks, but no differences were found when comparing SCD and CH. Scores on episodic memory tests correlated with hippocampal volumes in both MCI and SCD, whereas performance on executive tests correlated with WMH in all of our groups. Discussion As expected, the SCD group was shown to be cognitively healthy on tasks where MCI participants showed impairment. However, SCD’s hippocampal volume related to episodic memory performances, and WMH to executive functions. Thus, SCD represents a valid research concept and should be used, alongside MCI, to better understand the preclinical/prodromal phase of AD.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 74, 'citationCount': 34, 'journal': {'volume': '75', 'pages': '1382 - 1392', 'name': 'The Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Caillaud2019EvidenceOA,\n author = {Marie Caillaud and C.

The current study investigated the effects of emotional content on working memory capacity (WMC), which involves both short term storage and executive attention control. We tested competing hypotheses in a preregistered experiment (N\u2009=\u2009297). The emotional enhancement hypothesis predicts that emotional stimuli attract attention and additional processing resources relative to neutral stimuli, thereby making it easier to encode and store emotional information in WMC. The emotional impairment hypothesis, by contrast, predicts that emotional stimuli interfere with attention control and the active maintenance of information in working memory. Participants completed a common measure of WMC (the operation span task; Turner, M. L., & Engle, R. W. [1989]. Is working memory capacity task dependent?

Unfortunately, a longer life does not always correspond to a healthier life, as even normal aging is associated with cognitive decline and increased risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases. Episodic memory (EM) is one of the most vulnerable cognitive functions in aging, and its decline is the hallmark of typical Alzheimer’s disease. This memory system is defined as the ability to acquire and recollect personally experienced episodes associated with a specific affective, spatial, and temporal context. However, most of the neuropsychological and experimental tasks currently employed to assess EM consist in learning simple material (e.g., list of words) in highly stereotyped contexts. In the same vein, classical paper-and-pencil or numeric remediation tools have shown their limitations in the transfer of acquired skills to daily life. Virtual reality (VR), thanks to its immersive properties, and the possibility of delivering realistic and complex scenarios, seems a promising tool to address the limitations of the assessment and remediation of EM. Here, we review existing studies employing VR in normal and pathological aging to assess and reeducate EM. Overall, we show that VR has been mainly used via non-immersive systems. Further studies should, therefore, test the impact of different degrees of immersion. Moreover, there is a lack of VR remediation tools specifically targeting EM. We propose that future studies should fill this gap, addressing in particular the adaptivity of VR remediation protocols.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 43, 'citationCount': 35, 'journal': {'volume': '10', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Corte2019EpisodicMA,\n author = {V.

Part 2 addresses its construct validity by investigating correlations between performance in the VR task and on a traditional experimental memory task, and by measuring whether the VR task is sensitive to age-related memory differences. Fifty-seven older and 20 younger adults were assessed in the Virtual Shop, in which they memorised and fetched 12 familiar items. Part 1 showed high levels of presence, higher levels of motivation for the VR than for the traditional task, and negligible cybersickness symptoms. Part 2 indicates that memory performance in the VR task is positively correlated with performance on a traditional memory task for both age groups, and age-related differences were found on the VR and traditional memory tasks. Thus, the use of VR is feasible in older adults and the Virtual Shop is a valid task to assess and train episodic memory in this population.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 53, 'citationCount': 66, 'journal': {'volume': '30', 'pages': '462 - 480', 'name': 'Neuropsychological Rehabilitation'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Lecavalier2018UseOI,\n author = {Nick Corriveau Lecavalier and Émilie Ouellet and Benjamin Boller and S.

Materials and methods Primary studies published between 2007 and 2017 that explored the use of technologies for community-dwelling people with MCI/D were identified through five databases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, AMED, and CINAHL. Twenty-nine out of 359 papers met the criteria for eligibility. We used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool for quality assessment. Results A wide range of technologies was presented in the 29 studies, sorted into four domains: 1) safe walking indoors and outdoors; 2) safe living; 3) independent living; and 4) entertainment and social communication. The current state of knowledge regarding usability and acceptability reveals that even if researchers are aware of these concepts and intend to measure usability and acceptability, they seem difficult to assess. Terms such as “user friendliness” and “acceptance” were used frequently. User participation in the 29 studies was high. Persons with MCI/D, FCs, and staff/other older adults were involved in focus groups, workshops, and interviews as part of the preimplementation process. Conclusion Research regarding technologies to support people with MCI/D seems optimistic, and a wide range of technologies has been evaluated in homes with people with MCI/D and their FCs. A major finding was the importance of including people with MCI/D and their FCs in research, in order to learn about required design features to enhance usability and acceptability.

Sensory information is delivered through a head-mounted display and specialized interface devices. These devices track head movements so that the movements and images change in a natural way with head motion, allowing for a sense of immersion. VR, which allows for controlled delivery of sensory stimulation via the therapist, is a convenient and cost-effective treatment. This review focuses on the available literature regarding the effectiveness of incorporating VR within the treatment of various psychiatric disorders, with particular attention to exposure-based intervention for anxiety disorders. A systematic literature search was conducted in order to identify studies implementing VR-based treatment for anxiety or other psychiatric disorders. This article reviews the history of the development of VR-based technology and its use within psychiatric treatment, the empirical evidence for VR-based treatment, and the benefits for using VR for psychiatric research and treatment.

However, there is a substantial knowledge gap with regard to prevalence rates, neurobiological underpinnings, and effective treatments for apathy in pre-dementia states, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild behavioral impairment (MBI). Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature search using MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO databases to identify available research on apathy in prodromal dementia. Results: Apathy has consistently been detected in individuals with MCI with varying prevalence rates, and only recently has literature discussed the prevalence of apathy in MBI. Few pharmacological treatments have been utilized for apathy, with galantamine and risperidone showing mild reductions in apathetic behaviors. Non-pharmacological interventions in prodromal dementia are beginning to be explored and show promise, but few studies have replicated those results. Discussion: More comprehensive guidelines for diagnosing apathy and further research investigating neurobiological mechanisms of apathy in MCI and MBI are required in order to effectively treat apathetic patients in prodromal dementia.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 64, 'citationCount': 40, 'journal': {'volume': '30', 'pages': '177 - 184', 'name': 'International Psychogeriatrics'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Sherman2017PrevalenceNA,\n author = {Chelsea Sherman and Celina S.

Although stress-related reactions could sometimes provoke impairments in physiological processes due to the frequency of exposure or the stress burden of the event, physiological recovery after coping with stressors is highly implied in the aversive consequences of stress. To analyze the effects of listening to relaxing music (generated by the Melomics computer system) on the cardiovascular recovery and subjective feelings of anxiety after undergoing an acute-stress episode, a double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in healthy adults (N = 24; M = 23.05 years, SD = 2.97). Participants reported their levels of psychiatric symptomatology and anxiety and were then exposed to a stress induction protocol. Afterward, they underwent a period of recovery where they would be exposed to either a relaxing music track or silence, depending on a random assignation. Heart-derived functioning and self-reported anxiety were monitored throughout the study stages. All the participants showed stress-related reactions throughout the study stages, as it was shown for the study outcomes. Regarding the effect of listening to music, participants who listened to relaxing music during the recovery stage showed higher levels of sample entropy than controls, highlighting a large effect size on this difference (η2partial = .59). Relaxing music promotes more adaptive emotional regulation after coping with an acutely stressful event. This study aims to shed light on the actual effects of music interventions, and encourage the use of music-based interventions on health services.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 76, 'citationCount': 30, 'journal': {'volume': '26', 'pages': '124 - 141', 'name': 'Nordic Journal of Music Therapy'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Torre-Luque2017AcuteSR,\n author = {A. de la Torre-Luque and R.

We designed an attentional task to train selective and sustained attention, and we tested a VR and a paper version of this task in a single-session within-subjects design. Results showed that participants with MCI and dementia reported to be highly satisfied and interested in the task, and they reported high feelings of security, low discomfort, anxiety and fatigue.

In line with the arousal hypothesis, high-arousal pictures interfered more with responding and stopping than low-arousing pictures whereas the valence of the pictures had little or no effect. These findings support the hypothesis that emotional stimuli interrupt ongoing cognitively controlled activities because they attract attention away from these ongoing activities.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 27, 'citationCount': 268, 'journal': {'volume': '21', 'pages': '391 - 403', 'name': 'Cognition and Emotion'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Verbruggen2007DoES,\n author = {F.

Competing models of the latent structure of the PANAS were evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis. Regression and correlational analysis were used to determine the influence of demographic variables on PANAS scores as well as the relationship between the PANAS with measures of depression and anxiety (the HADS and the DASS).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe best-fitting model (robust comparative fit index = .94) of the latent structure of the PANAS consisted of two correlated factors corresponding to the PA and NA scales, and permitted correlated error between items drawn from the same mood subcategories (Zevon & Tellegen, 1982). Demographic variables had only very modest influences on PANAS scores and the PANAS exhibited measurement invariance across demographic subgroups. The reliability of the PANAS was high, and the pattern of relationships between the PANAS and the DASS and HADS were consistent with tripartite theory.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe PANAS is a reliable and valid measure of the constructs it was intended to assess, although the hypothesis of complete independence between PA and NA must be rejected.

MBI describes NPS of any severity, which are not captured by traditional psychiatric nosology, persist for at least 6 months, and occur in advance of or in concert with mild cognitive impairment. While the detection and description of MBI has been operationalized in the International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment - Alzheimer's Association (ISTAART-AA) research diagnostic criteria, there is no instrument that accurately reflects MBI as described.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo develop an instrument based on ISTAART-AA MBI criteria.\n\n\nMETHODS\nEighteen subject matter experts participated in development using a modified Delphi process. An iterative process ensured items reflected the five MBI domains of 1) decreased motivation; 2) emotional dysregulation; 3) impulse dyscontrol; 4) social inappropriateness; and 5) abnormal perception or thought content. Instrument language was developed a priori to pertain to non-demented functionally independent older adults.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe present the Mild Behavioral Impairment Checklist (MBI-C), a 34-item instrument, which can easily be completed by a patient, close informant, or clinician.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe MBI-C provides the first measure specifically developed to assess the MBI construct as explicitly described in the criteria. Its utility lies in MBI case detection, and monitoring the emergence of MBI symptoms and domains over time.

20,548b379b9cfb1abc4a135609354dff260394bf0d,Personalized Crowd Emotional Contagion Coupling the Virtual and Physical Cyberspace,"Crowd emotional contagion is affected by physical cyberspace and virtual cyberspace at the same time. In addition, the individual personality also plays an important role in crowd emotional contagion. However, few existing works have investigated the two factors jointly. To solve this problem, we propose a personalized virtual and physical cyberspace-based emotional contagion model (PVP-ECM) to simulate the process of crowd emotional contagion. First, we construct an individual emotion model and propose the personalized emotional contagion rules to consider the influences of the individual personality on crowd emotional contagion coupling the virtual and physical cyberspaces. Second, we use mean field theory to derive an evolution process and obtain mean field equations for the PVP-ECM. Then, we solve the PVP-ECM numerically using the finite difference method. Third, we construct a personalized BA scale-free network for the PVP-ECM simulation to further verify the stability of the model.

Safety officers are often dispatched to scenes of emergencies because their positive emotions can calm the crowd down and avoid serious accidents. However, how to utilize the positive emotional contagion to maximize the “calm-down” effect remains a challenging problem in crowd evacuation. In this paper, we present an approach for optimizing positive emotional contagion in crowd evacuation. First, a computational model of positive emotional contagion is proposed to describe how safety officers calm a crowd down. To capture important influential factors for positive emotional contagion, such as the trust relationships among the individuals involved in a crisis situation and the variations of emotional contagion speed, we construct a trust-based emotional contagion network (Trust-ECN) and a heterogeneous emotional contagion speed computation model (HECS-CM). Based on these models, the emotional contagion process can be analyzed in a parametric way, and the infection probability for each individual in a given time window can be computed analytically with a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). Second, a maximization problem of emotional contagion is formulated. Since this optimization problem is NP-hard, an artificial bee colony optimized emotional contagion (ABCEC) algorithm is used to solve for the optimal positions of safety officers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both synthetic and real-world data at different scales.

To solve this problem, we propose an IoT-based positive emotional contagion (IoT-PEC) method for crowd evacuation. First, we employ IoT technologies to capture the attributes of crowd movement, such as position and velocity. Based on these attributes, the crowd chaos can be quantified by calculating the macroscopic and microscopic entropies.

Moreover, the individuals in a crowd move randomly and often occlude each other. All the above factors make the analysis of crowd aggregation very difficult. In this paper, the authors attempt to solve this problem in three aspects. First, a novel global feature is used to represent the moving crowd. This feature can well describe the spatial and the temporal motion information of points-of-interest. Second, a strategy is adopted to cluster the feature points first and then calculate the collectiveness. This makes the collectiveness computation of individual groups more consistent and effective. Finally, more comprehensive collective crowd descriptors are proposed to provide a detailed description of the crowd status.

In this work, we explore the effect of the heterogeneity in both infection rates and recovery rates on the epidemic threshold through both analysis and simulations. We discover that heterogeneous infection rates and heterogeneous recovery rates have the opposite impact on the epidemic threshold. Specifically, the heterogeneity in infection rates leads to a larger epidemic threshold than in the homogeneous case. Moreover, as the degree of the heterogeneity of infection rates gets higher, the epidemic threshold increases.

In this paper, we propose a novel crowd simulation method by modeling the generation and contagion of panic emotion under multihazard circumstances. In order to depict the effect from hazards and other agents to crowd movement, we first classify hazards into different types (transient and persistent, concurrent and nonconcurrent, and static and dynamic) based on their inherent characteristics. Second, we introduce the concept of perilous field for each hazard and further transform the critical level of the field to its invoked-panic emotion. After that, we propose an emotional contagion model to simulate the evolving process of panic emotion caused by multiple hazards. Finally, we introduce an emotional reciprocal velocity obstacles (RVOs) model to simulate the crowd behaviors by augmenting the traditional RVO model with emotional contagion, which for the first time combines the emotional impact and local avoidance together. Our experimental results demonstrate that the overall approach is robust, can better generate realistic crowds and the panic emotion dynamics in a crowd. Furthermore, it is recommended that our method can be applied to various complex multihazard environments.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 57, 'citationCount': 88, 'journal': {'volume': '51', 'pages': '1567-1581', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Xu2018CrowdBS,\n author = {Mingliang Xu and Xiaozhen Xie and Pei Lv and Jiangwei Niu and Hua Wang and Chaochao Li and Ruijie Zhu and Z.

However, the mechanisms underlying this emotional contagion, for example, whether different feelings spread in unlikely ways or how the spread of emotions relates to the social network, is rarely investigated. Indeed, because of high costs and spatio-temporal limitations, explorations of this topic are challenging using conventional questionnaires or controlled experiments. Because they are collection points for natural affective responses of massive individuals, online social media sites offer an ideal proxy for tackling this issue from the perspective of computational social science. In this paper, based on the analysis of millions of tweets in Weibo, surprisingly, we find that anger is more contagious than joy, indicating that it can spark more angry follow-up tweets. Moreover, regarding dissemination in social networks, anger travels easily along weaker ties than joy, meaning that it can infiltrate different communities and break free of local traps because strangers share such content more often. Through a simple diffusion model, we reveal that greater contagion and weaker ties function cooperatively to speed up anger's spread. The diffusion of real-world events with different dominant emotions provides further testimony to the findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that quantitative long-term evidence has been presented that reveals a difference in the mechanism by which joy and anger are disseminated.

In this paper, we refer the panic of evacuees to their perception of the threat and propose a panic propagation model to model how crowd panic changes during evacuation at an emergency. Combined with the existing social force model, our panic model interprets the self-driven force and interactive forces with others in human mobility. To improve evacuation efficiency, robots are introduced to guide evacuees to escape. Using dynamic environment information, we design an evacuation exit selection algorithm where the optimal exit is automatically selected by the robot with the minimum escape time.

Emotions are a complex state of feeling that results in physical and psychological changes that influence our behavior. In this paper, we study an interesting problem of emotion contagion in social networks. In particular, by employing an image social network (Flickr) as the basis of our study, we try to unveil how users’ emotional statuses influence each other and how users’ positions in the social network affect their influential strength on emotion. We develop a probabilistic framework to formalize the problem into a role-aware contagion model. The model is able to predict users’ emotional statuses based on their historical emotional statuses and social structures. Experiments on a large Flickr dataset show that the proposed model significantly outperforms (+31% in terms of F1-score) several alternative methods in predicting users’ emotional status. We also discover several intriguing phenomena. For example, the probability that a user feels happy is roughly linear to the number of friends who are also happy; but taking a closer look, the happiness probability is superlinear to the number of happy friends who act as opinion leaders (Page et al. 1999) in the network and sublinear in the number of happy friends who span structural holes (Burt 2001). This offers a new opportunity to understand the underlying mechanism of emotional contagion in online social networks.\n \n', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 22, 'citationCount': 43, 'journal': {'pages': '65-71'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Yang2016SocialRE,\n author = {Yang Yang and Jia Jia and Boya Wu and Jie Tang},\n pages = {65-71},\n title = {Social Role-Aware Emotion Contagion in Image Social Networks},\n year = {2016}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2152917186', 'name': 'Yang Yang'}, {'authorId': '144202060', 'name': 'Jia Jia'}, {'authorId': '1773326', 'name': 'Boya Wu'}, {'authorId': '46199760', 'name': 'Jie Tang'}]}, {'paperId': '61304baf78c60651a2a24d4ece53f8718e8d0c9b', 'title': 'A Lagrangian Approach to Modeling and Analysis of a Crowd Dynamics', 'abstract': 'Modeling of crowd and pedestrian dynamics has intrigued engineers, physicists, and sociologists alike, even in recent times. Scientists have long sought to model the collective motion of large groups of individuals and study the mathematical basis of what seems to be apparently random behavior. A large number of macroscopic models have been proposed that describe crowd motion as a whole, much like the partial differential equations of fluid mechanics. This paper proposes a Lagrangian approach to the modeling of crowd dynamics by taking into consideration the various forces that act between the members of a crowd while they are in motion in a 2-D field. We attempt a realistic modeling of the attractive and repulsive forces between the members and seek to give a definite mathematical backbone to the terms “panic” and “evacuation.” That the dynamics is stable is demonstrated by constructing an appropriate Lyapunov energy function. We then linearize the dynamics to obtain mathematical expressions for the small perturbations about an equilibrium point. Through machine simulations and by tracking the motion of actual crowd systems, we show the validity of the mathematics of group formation and evacuation that we have proposed.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 53, 'citationCount': 25, 'journal': {'volume': '45', 'pages': '865-876', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Mukherjee2015ALA,\n author = {Sudipto Mukherjee and Debdipta Goswami and Sarthak Chatterjee},\n journal = {IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems},\n pages = {865-876},\n title = {A Lagrangian Approach to Modeling and Analysis of a Crowd Dynamics},\n volume = {45},\n year = {2015}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1500559043', 'name': 'Sudipto Mukherjee'}, {'authorId': '2755504', 'name': 'Debdipta Goswami'}, {'authorId': '153609700', 'name': 'Sarthak Chatterjee'}]}, {'paperId': '66c36cc2320acca58839295ab5219a61db3a85da', 'title': 'Words on the Web: Noninvasive Detection of Emotional Contagion in Online Social Networks', 'abstract': ""Does semantic expression spread online from person to person?

Using only observational data, the method avoids performing emotional experiments on users of online social networks, a research practice that recently became an object of criticism and concern. Our model combines geographic aggregation and instrumental variables regression to measure the effect of an exogenous variable on an individual's expression and the influence of this change on the expression of others to whom that individual is socially connected. In a previous work, we applied our method to the emotional content of posts generated by a large sample of users over a period of three years. Those results suggest that each post expressing a positive or negative emotion can cause friends to generate one to two additional posts expressing the same emotion, and it also inhibits their use of the opposite emotion. Here, we generalize our method so it can be applied to contexts different than emotional expression and to different forms of content generated by the users of online platforms. The method allows us to determine the usage of words in the same semantic category spread, and to estimate a signed relationship between different semantic categories, showing that an increase in the usage of one category alters the usage of another category in one's social contacts. Finally, it also allows us to estimate the total cumulative effect that a person has on all of her social contacts."", 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 65, 'citationCount': 16, 'journal': {'volume': '102', 'pages': '1911-1921', 'name': 'Proceedings of the IEEE'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Coviello2014WordsOT,\n author = {Lorenzo Coviello and J.

We provide experimental evidence that emotional contagion occurs without direct interaction between people (exposure to a friend expressing an emotion is sufficient), and in the complete absence of nonverbal cues. Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’ positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 15, 'citationCount': 2555, 'journal': {'volume': '111', 'pages': '8788 - 8790', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Kramer2014ExperimentalEO,\n author = {Adam D.

We find the critical relation between the two competing processes for a wide spectrum of parameters representing the interaction between them. We also analyze the consequences of a massive broadcast of awareness (mass media) on the final outcome of the epidemic incidence.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to model heterogeneous traffic behaviors by adapting a well‐established personality trait model (i.e., Eysenck's PEN (psychoticism, extraversion and neuroticism) model) into widely used traffic simulation approaches. First, we collected a large amount of user feedback while users watch a variety of computer‐generated traffic simulation video clips. Then, we trained regression models to bridge low‐level traffic simulation parameters and high‐level perceived traffic behaviors (i.e., adjectives according to the PEN model and the three PEN traits).

The topology corresponds to a multiplex network where two diffusive processes are interacting affecting each other. The analysis using a microscopic Markov chain approach reveals the phase diagram of the incidence of the epidemics and allows us to capture the evolution of the epidemic threshold depending on the topological structure of the multiplex and the interrelation with the awareness process.

We assume all nodes in the network are in the susceptible state initially except the information source which is in the infected state. Susceptible nodes may then be infected by infected nodes, and infected nodes may recover and will not be infected again after recovery. Given a snapshot of the network, from which we know all infected nodes but cannot distinguish susceptible nodes and recovered nodes, the problem is to find the information source based on the snapshot and the network topology. We develop a sample path based approach where the estimator of the information source is chosen to be the root node associated with the sample path that most likely leads to the observed snapshot. We prove for infinite-trees, the estimator is a node that minimizes the maximum distance to the infected nodes. A reverse-infection algorithm is proposed to find such an estimator in general graphs. We prove that for g-regular trees such that gq > 1, where g is the node degree and q is the infection probability, the estimator is within a constant distance from the actual source with high probability, independent of the number of infected nodes and the time the snapshot is taken. Our simulation results show that for tree networks, the estimator produced by the reverse-infection algorithm is closer to the actual source than the one identified by the closeness centrality heuristic.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 24, 'citationCount': 291, 'journal': {'pages': '1-9', 'name': '2013 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Zhu2012InformationSD,\n author = {Kai Zhu and Lei Ying},\n journal = {2013 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)},\n pages = {1-9},\n title = {Information source detection in the SIR model: A sample path based approach},\n year = {2012}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '48442503', 'name': 'Kai Zhu'}, {'authorId': '145404653', 'name': 'Lei Ying'}]}, {'paperId': 'bdf7ad9f7eb4a6555b0b220232a3114d7809813c', 'title': 'The spread of emotion via facebook', 'abstract': 'In this paper we study large-scale emotional contagion through an examination of Facebook status updates.

One interesting finding is that even if there is no percolation in the individual networks, percolation (i.e., information epidemics) can take place in the conjoint social-physical network. We also show, both analytically and experimentally, that the fraction of individuals who receive an item of information (started from an arbitrary node) is significantly larger in the conjoint social-physical network case, as compared to the case where the networks are disjoint.

An important difference between social contagion and traditional infectious diseases, however, is that behavioral phenomena can be acquired by non-social mechanisms as well as through social transmission. We introduce a novel theoretical framework for studying these phenomena (the SISa model) by adapting a classic disease model to include the possibility for ‘automatic’ (or ‘spontaneous’) non-social infection. We provide an example of the use of this framework by examining the spread of obesity in the Framingham Heart Study Network. The interaction assumptions of the model are validated using longitudinal network transmission data. We find that the current rate of becoming obese is 2 per year and increases by 0.5 percentage points for each obese social contact. The rate of recovering from obesity is 4 per year, and does not depend on the number of non-obese contacts. The model predicts a long-term obesity prevalence of approximately 42, and can be used to evaluate the effect of different interventions on steady-state obesity. Model predictions quantitatively reproduce the actual historical time course for the prevalence of obesity. We find that since the 1970s, the rate of recovery from obesity has remained relatively constant, while the rates of both spontaneous infection and transmission have steadily increased over time. This suggests that the obesity epidemic may be driven by increasing rates of becoming obese, both spontaneously and transmissively, rather than by decreasing rates of losing weight. A key feature of the SISa model is its ability to characterize the relative importance of social transmission by quantitatively comparing rates of spontaneous versus contagious infection. It provides a theoretical framework for studying the interpersonal spread of any state that may also arise spontaneously, such as emotions, behaviors, health states, ideas or diseases with reservoirs.', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 52, 'citationCount': 203, 'journal': {'volume': '6', 'name': 'PLoS Computational Biology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Hill2010InfectiousDM,\n author = {A.

The MBMS model utilizes real human motion samples recorded in motion capture experiments as templates for simulating novel motions. Such human motion samples are stored in a motion database. When a user submits an input simulation scenario to the model, a motion search engine termed the ldquoroot motion finderrdquo in the model searches the motion database and retrieves the motion samples that closely match the given scenario. The retrieved motions, referred to as root motions, may significantly differ from one another in the underlying movement technique. Such variability within the root motion set is analyzed and graphically summarized by a model component termed the motion variability analyzer. This analysis helps users rapidly identify alternative movement techniques for the given input simulation scenario and simulate human motions based on alternative movement techniques. Since root motions do not exactly satisfy but only closely match the input simulation scenario, a motion modification (MoM) algorithm adapts them to fit the scenario by systematically deforming them in the joint angle-time domain. The MoM algorithm retains the root motions' fundamental spatial-temporal structure and minimizes deviations from the root motions during such deformations. The MBMS model overcomes limitations of existing simulation models and achieves the following: 1) simulation of categorically different motions based on a single unified model; 2) simple and efficient learning of new motion behaviors; and 3) representation and simulation of human motion variability."", 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 39, 'citationCount': 38, 'journal': {'volume': '38', 'pages': '513-527', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Park2008MemoryBasedHM,\n author = {W.

Spatial models are being used with increasing frequency to help characterize these large-scale patterns and to evaluate the impact of interventions.

The proposed approach implements a computational model inspired by the generalized motor program (GMP) theory. Operationally, when a novel motion scenario is submitted to the MBMS system, its motion database is searched to find relevant existing motions. The selected motions, referred to as ""root motions"", most likely do not meet exactly the novel motion scenario, and therefore, they need to be modified by the MoM algorithm. This algorithm derives a parametric representation of possible variants of a root motion in a GMP-like manner, and adjusts the parameter values such that the new modified motion satisfies the novel motion scenario, while retaining the root motion\'s overall angular movement pattern and inter-joint coordination. An evaluation of the prediction capability of the algorithm, using both seated upper body reaching and whole-body load-transfer motions, indicated that the algorithm can accurately predict various human motions with errors comparable to the inherent variability in human motions when repeated under identical task conditions.', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 51, 'citationCount': 80, 'journal': {'volume': '34', 'pages': '376-386', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Park2004TowardMH,\n author = {W.

This is consistent with the maximum of inverse TMR observed at 20.4 V for Co/STO/LSMO junctions (Fig. 3A). For a positive bias, the TMR is expected to change sign and become normal above 1 V when the Fermi level of LSMO goes down into the energy range of the majority spin d-band of Co. This is also observed in Fig. 3A. For ALO and ALO/STO barriers, a predominant tunneling of s-character electrons (see arrow in Fig. 2B) is the usual explanation of the positive polarization (6–8). The rapid drop with bias (Fig. 3B) is similar to what has been observed in most junctions with ALO barriers, and completely different from what is obtained when the tunneling is predominantly by d-character electrons (Fig. 3A). The origin of this rapid decrease of the TMR at relatively small bias has never been clearly explained. This is roughly consistent with the energy dependence of the DOS induced by sp-d bonding effects on the first atomic layer of ALO in the calculation of Nguyen-Mahn et al. (8) for the Co-ALO interface. But Zhang et al. (13) have also shown that a large part of the TMR drop can be attributed to the excitation of spin waves. The experiments reported here and in several recent publications (3, 4) demonstrate the important role of the electronic structure of the metal-oxide interface in determining the spin polarization of the tunneling electrons. The negative polarization for the Co-STO interface has been ascribed to d-d bonding effects between Al and Ti (4). This interpretation is similar to that proposed to explain, in terms of sp-d bonding, the positive polarization at the Co-ALO interface (8). However, there is no general theory predicting the trend of the experimental results for Co—that is, a negative polarization with oxides of d elements (STO, CLO, Ta2O5) and a positive one when there are only s and p states (ALO). It is likely that the spin polarization should also depend on the position of the Fermi level with respect to the electronic levels of each character above and below the gap of the insulator. In addition, as an evanescent wave in an insulator is a Bloch wave with an imaginary wave vector, one can expect different decay lengths for Bloch waves of different character. This means that the final polarization could also depend on the thickness of the barrier, as illustrated by the calculations of MacLaren et al. for Fe/ZnSe/Fe junctions (14). The influence of the barrier on the spin polarization opens new ways to shape and optimize the TMR. Interesting bias dependencies can be obtained with barriers selecting the d electrons and probing the fine structure of the d-DOS, as in Fig. 3A. The DOS of a d-band can also be easily tailored by alloying (for example, by introduction of virtual bound states) to produce specific bias dependencies. Although here we concentrated on the problem of the spin polarization of the Co electrode and regarded the strongly spin-polarized LSMO only as a useful spin analyzer, the large TMR ratios obtained by combining Co and LSMO electrodes (50% with a STO barrier) are also an interesting result. The drawback arising from the low Curie temperature of LSMO (;350 K) is the reduction of the TMR at room temperature, down to about 5% at 300 K in Co/STO/ LSMO (4). However, other types of oxides of the double-perovskite family (for example, Sr2FeMoO6) combine electronic properties similar to those of manganites with a definitely higher Curie temperature (15). Their use in magnetic tunnel junctions is promising for a new generation of tunnel junctions with very high magnetoresistance for room-temperature applications.', 'year': 1999, 'referenceCount': 11, 'citationCount': 31575, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{McInnes1999EmergenceOS,\n author = {B.

Therefore, we considered a multi-user robot with a virtual agent service which could satisfy user demands. But, several issues need to be solved in order to achieve this purpose. Firstly, there is no general service platform for such robots. Secondly, even if we use the multi-user robot by executing the virtual agent service, the physical shape, and other characteristics of the multi-user robot sometimes creates a strong impression on users. Therefore, we proposed a virtual agent service platform, and the robot features modification for a multi-user robot. The robot can autonomously adjust its position according to each user’s physiological signals, which based on emotion in real-time.

Self-Attachment is a recently introduced psychotherapeutic method in which the patient creates a compassionate and affectional bond with their childhood-self using their childhood photos. The underlying theory and the promising results of the Self-Attachment therapy, in combination with its self-administrable nature, motivate further research in technologies that can enhance the procedure of the therapy. Virtual reality is a technology that has experienced rapid evolution over the last years, yet its ability to replace existing psychotherapeutic techniques remains fairly unexplored. The aim of this thesis is to create a user-friendly and highly interactive virtual reality platform that delivers the Self-Attachment therapy in an efficient way by creating an avatar of the patient’s childhood-self based on a 2D childhood photo. For the fulfillment of this goal, the implemented platform has been equipped with the latest features of the head-mounted Oculus Quest device and interactable components. In addition, the virtual environment features a virtual agent who acts as an assistant and is able to predict the emotional state of the user. The aforementioned achievements have led to the creation of a complete virtual platform, capable of autonomously delivering the Self-Attachment therapy in a personalised experience for the user. During an impact evaluation trial, a version of the platform was tested by seven healthy individuals and the results were promising. The high levels of immersiveness of the platform and its ability to attract and maintain the user’s engagement played a crucial role in obtaining positive feedback from the participants. Furthermore, the platform was successful in triggering participants’ emotions, who in the end preferred the virtual experience over the original therapy which is based on the use of their childhood photo. Consequently, we believe that this project is the beginning of the creation of a tool that will be able to autonomously and effectively treat people with mental disorders in the near future.",2020,50,1,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Edalat2020VirtualRP,\n author = {A.

One of them that is becoming very popular is hand tracking, as the idea to replace controllers for interactions in virtual worlds. This experiment aims to compare different interaction types in VR using either controllers or hand tracking. Participants had to play two simple VR games with various types of tasks in those games — grabbing objects or typing numbers. While playing, they were using interactions with different visualizations of hands and controllers. The focus of this study was to investigate user experience of varying interactions (controller vs. hand tracking) for those two simple tasks. Results show that different interaction types statistically significantly influence reported emotions with Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM), where for hand tracking participants were feeling higher valence, but lower arousal and dominance. Additionally, task type of grabbing was reported to be more realistic, and participants experienced a higher presence. Surprisingly, participants rated the interaction type with controllers where both where hands and controllers were visualized as statistically most preferred. Finally, hand tracking for both tasks was rated with the System Usability Scale (SUS) scale, and hand tracking for the task typing was rated as statistically significantly more usable. These results can drive further research and, in the long term, contribute to help selecting the most matching interaction modality for a task.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 17, 'citationCount': 35, 'journal': {'pages': '1-4', 'name': '2020 Twelfth International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX)'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Voigt-Antons2020InfluenceOH,\n author = {Jan-Niklas Voigt-Antons and Tanja Kojić and Danish Ali and S.

Because there is currently no vaccine or treatment for the underlying infection, current health efforts are focused on providing prevention and screening, maintaining continuity of treatment for other chronic conditions, and ensuring access to appropriately intensive services for those with the most severe symptoms.1 Disasters disproportionately affect poor and vulnerable populations, and patients with serious mental illness may be among the hardest hit. High rates of smoking in this population may raise the risk of infection and confer a worse prognosis among those who develop the illness.2 Residential instability and homelessness can raise the risk of infection and make it harder to identify, follow up, and treat those who are infected.3 Individuals with serious mental illnesses who are employed may have challenges taking time off from work and may lack sufficient insurance coverage to cover testing or treatment. Small social networks may limit opportunities to obtain support from friends and family members should individuals with serious mental illness become ill. Taken together, these factors may lead to elevated infection rates and worse prognoses in this population. What strategies are available to mitigate the outcome of this epidemic among patients with serious mental illness? Federal preparedness policies developed in the wake of complex disasters have increasingly embraced the notion of whole community preparedness, which supports building and supporting structures at multiple levels to prepare and respond, particularly for vulnerable populations.4 Within the public mental health care system, this includes engagement with mental health service users, clinicians, and federal and state policies.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 5, 'citationCount': 371, 'journal': {'name': 'JAMA psychiatry'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Druss2020AddressingTC,\n author = {B.

The subject has obsessive compulsive behavior in the form of using a handbody on the sole of the foot repeatedly. Researchers provide interventions in the form of cognitive behavior therapy as interventions to reduce obsessive compulsive behavior, and to improve mental health in schools. This therapy aims to oppose wrong thoughts and emotions by presenting evidence that contradicts beliefs about the problem at hand. The method used in this research is qualitative with a case study approach. Subjects were female who were 16 years old and had obsessive compulsive behavior for 14 months. The cognitive behavior therapy procedure is first, the subject is asked for relaxation in the form of progressivrizkie muscle relaxation to learn to stretch and relax various muscle groups and learn to notice the difference between tension and relax. Second, cognitive restructuring, reducing the anxiety level of the subject caused by negative thoughts and replacing them with more positive thoughts, and. Third, exposure with response prevention, to overcome obsessive compulsive behavior. Where the subject is faced with a situation of having the belief that must perform the usual ritual behavior but the subject is prevented from doing the ritual. If the subject can prevent not doing the ritual and it turns out that something terrible did not happen, this can help in changing the subject's belief in compulsive behavior. The intervention consisted of eight sessions with two sessions a week and 60 minutes each for each session. The results of this study indicate that cognitive behavior therapy is effectively used to reduce the subject's obsessive compulsive behavior, which is shown by decreasing levels of anxiety, negative thinking and compulsive behavior."", 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 14, 'citationCount': 255, 'journal': {'name': 'Definitions'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Chand2020CognitiveBT,\n author = {S.

A great challenge in this domain is that although the presence of hate speech can be deleterious to the quality of service provided by social platforms, it still comprises only a tiny fraction of the content that can be found online, which can lead to performance deterioration due to majority class overfitting. To this end, we perform a thorough study on the application of deep learning to the hate speech detection problem: a) we propose three text-based data augmentation techniques aimed at reducing the degree of class imbalance and to maximise the amount of information we can extract from our limited resources and b) we apply them on a selection of top-performing deep architectures and hate speech databases in order to showcase their generalisation properties. The data augmentation techniques are based on a) synonym replacement based on word embedding vector closeness, b) warping of the word tokens along the padded sequence or c) class-conditional, recurrent neural language generation. Our proposed framework yields a significant increase in multi-class hate speech detection, outperforming the baseline in the largest online hate speech database by an absolute 5.7% increase in Macro-F1 score and 30% in hate speech class recall.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 50, 'citationCount': 78, 'journal': {'name': 'Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Rizos2019AugmentTP,\n author = {Georgios Rizos and Konstantin Hemker and Björn Schuller},\n journal = {Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management},\n title = {Augment to Prevent: Short-Text Data Augmentation in Deep Learning for Hate-Speech Classification},\n year = {2019}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '40185455', 'name': 'Georgios Rizos'}, {'authorId': '2121244573', 'name': 'Konstantin Hemker'}, {'authorId': '145411696', 'name': 'Björn Schuller'}]}, {'paperId': 'bce809c25d22a601cb1e708a7ffb16dea58651fb', 'title': 'It feels real: physiological responses to a stressful virtual reality environment and its impact on working memory', 'abstract': 'Background: Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly used to study and treat psychiatric disorders. Its fidelity depends in part on the extent to which the VR environment provides a convincing simulation, for example whether a putatively stressful VR situation actually produces a stress response. Methods: We studied the stress response in 28 healthy men exposed either to a stressor VR elevator (which simulated travelling up the outside of a tall building and culminated in the participant being asked to step off the elevator platform), or to a control elevator. We measured psychological and physiological (salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase, blood pressure, pulse, skin conductance) stress indices. We also measured subsequent performance on the N-back task because acute stress has been reported to impact on working memory. Results: Compared to participants in the control elevator, those in the external elevator had increases in skin conductance, pulse and subjective stress and anxiety ratings, altered heart rate variability, and a delayed rise in cortisol. N-back performance was unaffected. Conclusions: A putatively stressful VR elevator produces a physiological as well as a psychological stress response, supporting its use in the investigation and treatment of stress-related disorders, and its potential value as an experimental laboratory stressor.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 53, 'citationCount': 63, 'journal': {'volume': '33', 'pages': '1264 - 1273', 'name': 'Journal of Psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Martens2019ItFR,\n author = {M.

In this paper we introduce CMU Multimodal Opinion Sentiment and Emotion Intensity (CMU-MOSEI), the largest dataset of sentiment analysis and emotion recognition to date. Using data from CMU-MOSEI and a novel multimodal fusion technique called the Dynamic Fusion Graph (DFG), we conduct experimentation to exploit how modalities interact with each other in human multimodal language.

On this basis, we propose a network to capture states of personal distress and (weak and strong forms of) empathic concern, which are particularly relevant for psychotherapists conducting attachment-based interventions. This model is then extended for the case of self-attachment therapy, in which conceptualized components of the self serve as both the source of and target for empathic resonance. In particular, we consider how states of empathic concern involving an other that is perceived as being closely related to the self might enhance the motivation for self-directed bonding (which in turn is proposed to lead the individual toward more compassionate states) in terms of medial prefrontal cortex–mediated activation of these caregiving pathways.

Our proposed platform aims to assist the user in enhancing their capacities for self-regulation of emotion, by means of earning secure attachment through the experience of positive attachment interactions, missed in their childhood. In the virtual environment provided by the platform, the adult-self of the user learns to create and strengthen an affectional and supportive bond with the inner-child.

With virtual reality (VR), computer-generated interactive environments, individuals can repeatedly experience their problematic situations and be taught, via evidence-based psychological treatments, how to overcome difficulties. VR is moving out of specialist laboratories. Our central aim was to describe the potential of VR in mental health, including a consideration of the first 20 years of applications. A systematic review of empirical studies was conducted. In all, 285 studies were identified, with 86 concerning assessment, 45 theory development, and 154 treatment. The main disorders researched were anxiety (n = 192), schizophrenia (n = 44), substance-related disorders (n = 22) and eating disorders (n = 18). There are pioneering early studies, but the methodological quality of studies was generally low. The gaps in meaningful applications to mental health are extensive. The most established finding is that VR exposure-based treatments can reduce anxiety disorders, but there are numerous research and treatment avenues of promise. VR was found to be a much-misused term, often applied to non-interactive and non-immersive technologies. We conclude that VR has the potential to transform the assessment, understanding and treatment of mental health problems. The treatment possibilities will only be realized if – with the user experience at the heart of design – the best immersive VR technology is combined with targeted translational interventions. The capability of VR to simulate reality could greatly increase access to psychological therapies, while treatment outcomes could be enhanced by the technology's ability to create new realities.

We show how exteroceptive cues (in the form of disrupted affective communication from the caregiver) can result in disorganised forms of attachment (as first uncovered by Mary Main) in infants of caregivers who consistently increase stress on approach, but can have an organising (towards ambivalence) effect in infants of inconsistent caregivers.

Poor engagement may lead to worse clinical outcomes, with symptom relapse and rehospitalization. Numerous variables may affect level of treatment engagement, including therapeutic alliance, accessibility of care, and a client's trust that the treatment will address his/her own unique goals. As such, we have found that the concept of recovery‐oriented care, which prioritizes autonomy, empowerment and respect for the person receiving services, is a helpful framework in which to view tools and techniques to enhance treatment engagement. Specifically, person‐centered care, including shared decision making, is a treatment approach that focuses on an individual's unique goals and life circumstances. Use of person‐centered care in mental health treatment models has promising outcomes for engagement. Particular populations of people have historically been difficult to engage, such as young adults experiencing a first episode of psychosis, individuals with coexisting psychotic and substance use disorders, and those who are homeless. We review these populations and outline how various evidence‐based, recovery‐oriented treatment techniques have been shown to enhance engagement. Our review then turns to emerging treatment strategies that may improve engagement. We focus on use of electronics and Internet, involvement of peer providers in mental health treatment, and incorporation of the Cultural Formulation Interview to provide culturally competent, person‐centered care.

Aims To investigate whether the effects of self-identification with virtual bodies within immersive virtual reality could be exploited to increase self-compassion in patients with depression. Method We developed an 8-minute scenario in which 15 patients practised delivering compassion in one virtual body and then experienced receiving it from themselves in another virtual body. Results In an open trial, three repetitions of this scenario led to significant reductions in depression severity and self-criticism, as well as to a significant increase in self-compassion, from baseline to 4-week follow-up.

The proposed self-attachment therapeutic technique is distinguished by its intervention to create an internal and passionate affectional bond within the individual between the “adult self”, representing the logical and cognitive faculty, and the “inner child”, representing the unregulated and undeveloped emotional circuits. The aim is to create more optimal circuits for emotional regulation. The proposed self-attachment protocols internally emulate within the individual the interactions of a good enough primary care-giver and child in order to moderate the child's arousal level, minimise its negative affects and maximize its positive affects. These interactions are assumed, in developmental neuroscience and in developmental psychology, to be the basis of secure attachment of children with their parents, which leads to an optimal regulation of neurotransmitters, hormones, and the emotional dynamics of the individual. We report on several case studies of this technique in recent years.

Therapeutic approaches have traditionally involved medication and physiotherapy but such approaches are limited over time by their cost and side effects. This review seeks to critically evaluate the evidence for and against IVR as an adjunctive therapy for acute clinical pain applications. Methods:A rapid evidence assessment (REA) strategy was used. CINAHL, Medline, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, and the Cochrane Library databases were screened in from December 2012 to March 2013 to identify studies exploring IVR therapies as an intervention to assist in the management of pain. Main outcome measures were for acute pain and functional impairment. Results:Seventeen research studies were included in total including 5 RCTs, 6 randomized crossover studies, 2 case series studies, and 4 single-patient case studies. This included a total of 337 patients. Of these studies only 4 had a low risk of bias. There was strong overall evidence for immediate and short-term pain reduction, whereas moderate evidence was found for short-term effects on physical function. Little evidence exists for longer-term benefits. IVR was not associated with any serious adverse events. Discussion:This review found moderate evidence for the reduction of pain and functional impairment after IVR in patients with acute pain. Further high-quality studies are required for the conclusive judgment of its effectiveness in acute pain, to establish potential benefits for chronic pain, and for safety.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 77, 'citationCount': 143, 'journal': {'volume': '30', 'pages': '1089–1098', 'name': 'The Clinical Journal of Pain'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Garrett2014ARE,\n author = {Bernie Garrett and T.

One of its main goals is for the user to develop a bond and reparent a child avatar representing one’s childhood self. To do so efficiently, the emotions, felt by the user when discussing their childhood, should be transferred to this child avatar. This project aims to train an emotion recognition model to allow the detection of multiple emotions. In addition, it aims to implement the self-attachment theory scenario to manage the dialogue between a user and a virtual therapist. The two parts of the project are to be integrated within the proposed virtual reality application. The devised multimodal and multi-emotion recognition model trained on CMUMOSEI dataset, achieves state-of-the-art results on happiness detection and competitive results for other emotions.

In this article, we perform an extensive review of the literature regarding the impact of the gender of pedagogical agents on academic outcomes. Based on a detailed review of 59 articles, we analyze the influence of pedagogical agents' gender on students' academic self-evaluations and achievements to answer the following questions: (1) Do students perceive virtual agents differently depending on their own gender and the gender of the agent? (2) Does the gender of pedagogical agents influence students' academic performance and self-evaluations? (3) Are there tasks or academic situations to which a male virtual agent is better suited than a female virtual agent, and vice versa, according to empirical evidence? (4) How do a virtual agent's pedagogical roles impact these results? (5) How do a virtual agent's appearance and interactive capacities impact these results? (6) Are androgynous virtual agents a potential solution to combatting gender stereotypes?

To attract people with ASD who have communicative, social, emotional and attention deficit disorders to behavioral treatments, an attractive environment is needed that ensures continuity during treatment. The aim of the current work is to efficiently examine systematic reviews and relevant primary studies on ASD solutions from 2015 to 2020, particularly those using the traditional Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS), the application of augmented reality and those that propose serious games, thereby providing an overview of existing evidence and to identify strategies for future research. Five databases were searched for keywords that may be included within the broad Autism Spectrum Disorder ‘ASD’ umbrella term, alongside ‘augmented reality’, ‘serious games’ and ‘PECS’. We screened 1799 titles and abstracts, read, and retained 12 reviews and 43 studies. The studies scrutinized in our systematic review were examined to answer four primary and four sub-research questions, which we formulated to better understand general trends in the use of approaches for attracting people with ASD to behavioral therapies. Additionally, our systematic review also presents ongoing issues in this area of research and suggests promising future research directions. Our review is useful to researchers in this field as it facilitates the comparison of existing studies with work currently being conducted, based on the availability of a wide range of studies in three different areas (AR, SG and PECS).', 'year': 2022, 'referenceCount': 123, 'citationCount': 18, 'journal': {'volume': '22', 'name': 'Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Almurashi2022AugmentedRS,\n author = {Haneen Almurashi and Rahma Bouaziz and Wallaa Alharthi and Mohammed Al-Sarem and Mohammed Hadwan and Slim Kammoun},\n journal = {Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)},\n title = {Augmented Reality, Serious Games and Picture Exchange Communication System for People with ASD: Systematic Literature Review and Future Directions},\n volume = {22},\n year = {2022}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2091329259', 'name': 'Haneen Almurashi'}, {'authorId': '2620898', 'name': 'Rahma Bouaziz'}, {'authorId': '2153809321', 'name': 'Wallaa Alharthi'}, {'authorId': '1397312292', 'name': 'Mohammed Al-Sarem'}, {'authorId': '2058429', 'name': 'Mohammed Hadwan'}, {'authorId': '9286494', 'name': 'Slim Kammoun'}]}, {'paperId': '8d1ad01630963e10749c827cfc9f9265e9adb66a', 'title': 'Game-Based Learning Application for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder using Participatory Design', 'abstract': 'This paper aimed to devise a means to design game-based learning and develop an application game for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using the participatory design (PD) method.

Literature showing that individuals with ASD display deficits in ToM is extensive and robust. However, some related issues deserve more research: the heterogeneous profile of ToM abilities in children with ASD and the association between different levels of ToM development and social, pragmatic, and adaptive behaviors in everyday life. The first objective of this study was to identify profiles of children with ASD without intellectual disability (ID), based on explicit and applied ToM knowledge, and compare these profiles with a group of children with typical development (TD). A second objective was to determine differences in symptom severity, adaptive/social behavior, and pragmatic abilities between the profiles identified. Fifty-two children with a clinical diagnosis of ASD without ID and 37 children with TD performed neuropsychological ToM tasks and two vocabulary and memory tests. In addition, all of their mothers completed different questionnaires about applied ToM abilities, severity of ASD symptoms, adaptive/social skills, and pragmatic competence. Two subgroups were identified in the cluster analysis carried out with explicit and applied ToM indicators. The “Lower ToM abilities” profile obtained significantly lower scores than the “Higher ToM abilities” profile on all the ToM measures. Furthermore, the analysis of covariance, controlling for vocabulary and working memory (ANCOVAs), showed statistically significant differences in applied ToM abilities between the two groups of children with ASD without ID and the group with TD. However, only the group with “Higher ToM abilities” achieved similar performance to the TD group on the verbal task of explicit ToM knowledge. Finally, the “Lower ToM abilities” cluster obtained significantly higher scores on autism symptoms (social and communication domains) and lower scores on adaptive behavior and pragmatic skills than the cluster with “Higher ToM abilities.” Taken together, these findings have implications for understanding the heterogeneity in ToM skills in children with ASD without ID, and their differential impact on social, communicative, and adaptive behaviors.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 100, 'citationCount': 33, 'journal': {'volume': '11', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Roselló2020TheoryOM,\n author = {B.

Several serious games have been computed to help them dealing with facial expression recognition but very few focused on facial expression production adapted to a given social context. Method: JEMImE is a new serious game which aims to help the player to learn how to produce happiness, anger and sadness in a 3D virtual environment with social situations that should be resolved by producing the correct facial expression. He is guided in the game thanks to facial expression feedback and gauges that help him evaluating the quality of his/her production in real time. The feedbacks on the children productions are timely given by a facial expression recognition algorithm integrated in JEMImE architecture. Specific attention was paid to the visual and motivational aspects of the game. Using a brief feasibility study with children with ASD (N = 23), we evaluated the impression of the players on the game aspect and the possibility to insert algorithmic feedbacks in real time inside JEMImE. Results: During the training phase, children with ASD showed a significant progression during training for facial expression production after algorithmic autonomous feedbacks. This means children understand the challenge and that the algorithmic feedbacks are transparent enough to allow gaming. They expressed an overall good subjective experience with JEMImE in terms of ergonomics, playability, visual aspect and motivation.

This review highlights that while individuals with ASD traditionally show deficits on a wide range of ToM tests, such as recognizing facial emotions, such ToM deficits may be ameliorated if the stimuli presented is cartoon or animal-like rather than in human form. Individuals with ASD show a greater interest in anthropomorphic characters and process the features of these characters using methods typically reserved for human stimuli. Personal accounts of individuals with ASD also suggest they may identify more closely with animals than other humans. It is shown how the social motivations hypothesized to underlie the anthropomorphizing of non-human targets may lead those on the spectrum to seek social connections and therefore gain ToM experience and expertise amongst unlikely sources.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 186, 'citationCount': 42, 'journal': {'volume': '9', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Atherton2018SeeingMT,\n author = {Gray Atherton and Liam B.

MMORPGs can be applied to enhancing language learning, which is drawing researchers’ attention from different fields and many studies have validated MMORPGs’ positive effect on language learning. However, there are few studies on the underlying behavioral or neural mechanism of such effect. This paper reviews the educational application of the MMORPGs based on relevant macroscopic and microscopic studies, showing that gamers’ overall language proficiency or some specific language skills can be enhanced by real-time online interaction with peers and game narratives or instructions embedded in the MMORPGs. Mechanisms underlying the educational assistant role of MMORPGs in second language learning are discussed from both behavioral and neural perspectives. We suggest that attentional bias makes gamers/learners allocate more cognitive resources toward task-related stimuli in a controlled or an automatic way. Moreover, with a moderating role played by activation of reward circuit, playing the MMORPGs may strengthen or increase functional connectivity from seed regions such as left anterior insular/frontal operculum (AI/FO) and visual word form area to other language-related brain areas.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 89, 'citationCount': 24, 'journal': {'volume': '11', 'name': 'Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Zhang2017LanguageLE,\n author = {Yongjun Zhang and Hongwen Song and Xiaoming Liu and D.

Semi-structured interviews with three participants, diagnosed with ASD between the ages of 16–21 years, yielded four themes that illustrated the social experiences of participants in this study. Emerging themes and participant comments identified in this study parallel those identified in the most recent research literature that has also sought to identify experiences and attributes that may lead to successful interpersonal relationships for individuals identified with ASD. Participants in this study articulated the desire to socialize, interact, and frequently communicate in a virtual environment; challenges with being misunderstood; issues with identification and perceptions of friends; and awareness of rules specific to face-to-face and virtual environments. A review of the current research literature related to adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) revealed a focus on adolescent social challenges and language development as well as strategies to increase the acquisition of functional social skills. However, there was a notable absence of research on the social and relational impact of the use of virtual environments and online gaming for individuals with ASD. The focus of this study was the examination of the social interactions of adolescents with ASD as they engaged in massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG). This article begins by providing context for the development of the study rationale through a review of the extant literature on individuals with ASD and participation in virtual environments and online gaming. Next the study’s purpose is connected to the documented social and relational needs of individuals with ASD and the potential of virtual environments and online gaming to meet those needs. A description of the research study and methodology follows along with a summary of results and implications for individuals with ASD. Concluding remarks address the potential implications of an expanded research effort in this area on the postsecondary outcomes of adolescents and young adults with ASD. Autism Spectrum Disorder A defining characteristic of ASD is the lack of appropriate social skills, lack of appropriate responses during a conversation, limited social interactions, low to no maintained friendships or interactions outside of school or work that include phone calls or face-to-face interactions (Cihak, 2011; Seltzer, Greenberg, Floyd, & Hong, 2004). An increasing number of individuals are being diagnosed with ASD. Current estimates indicate that 1:68 individuals have some form of ASD (Center for Disease Control, 2014). This increase in prevalence has lead to revision and refinement in Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to Jennifer Gallup, 749 Jefferson Ave., Pocatello, ID 83201. E-mail: jgallup321@gmail.com Education and Training in Autism and Developmental Disabilities, 2016, 51(3), 223–237 © Division on Autism and Developmental Disabilities Adolescents with Autism Engaged in Online Gaming / 223 definitions of ASD including these that describe the disorder as: ● A developmental disorder of the human nervous system, (Mintz, Branch, March, & Lerman, 2012) that currently affects 1% of the global population (Charman & Gotham, 2013). ● A developmental disorder categorized by deficits in social interactions and communication skills as well as the presence of stereotypic and repetitive behaviors (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). ● A complex disorder (Schafer et al., 2013) with the degree of challenge individualized and specific to each person – with severity ranging from mild to severe impairment (National Institute of Mental Health, 2012). In addition to social challenges, individuals with ASD also experience challenges with awareness and emotional recognition that leads to debility of self (Duff & Flattery, 2014). Unaware of how others think and perceive them, individuals with ASD have ever-present difficulties with socialization that often result in social rejection, that follows them throughout their lives, resulting in barriers and challenges in education, postsecondary education, and other aspects of daily living (Carrington, Papinczak, & Templeton, 2003). The purpose of this study was to (1) describe the social interactions of adolescents with ASD in the context of a virtual environment, (2) identify if they are socializing, and (3) describe how they socialized and related information pertaining to their daily living. Absence of Interventions for Adolescents and Young Adults with ASD As early as elementary school, educators and other practitioners attempt to remediate social skill difficulties in individuals with ASD. Much of the current research focuses on the impact of early intervention, through techniques such as Discrete Trial Training, for basic communication skills. The National Professional Development Center (2014) and National Research Council have identified 27 evidence-based practices used to support social and behavioral challenges for individuals with ASD. Of the 27, 19 have been evidence based for adolescents and 11 for young adults with ASD up to the age of 22 years. However, these strategies have not proven to be as successful in helping adolescents and young adults with high functioning ASD engage with peers, learn complex communication, and achieve transition post-high school (Schall & McDonough, 2010). Although childhood research is valuable, research on social skill and communication development beyond this period has been neglected (Schall & McDonough, 2010). Few studies discuss the need to reach adolescents; and even fewer studies have targeted those with high functioning autism as defined by the DSM-V (2014) who would require level one support. Social and Relational Deficits Adolescents with ASD have social and relational deficits that differ dramatically from students with other disabilities. Adolescents with ASD are significantly more likely to never see friends outside of school (43.3%), never get called by friends (54.4%), and never be invited to activities (50.4%) “when compared to those with other disabilities such as intellectual disabilities, speech and language impairment, or learning disabilities” (Shattuck, Orsmond, Wagner, & Cooper, 2011, p. 5). In addition, adolescents with ASD are less likely to participate in social activities with friends, or community activities with peers than those in other disability categories (Shattuck et al., 2011). Social challenges remain problematic through adulthood affecting their postsecondary transitions to college and careers (Church, Alisanski, & Amanullah, 2000). For example, nearly 85% of individuals with ASD live with a family member (NLTS-2 W-5, 2009), only 54% graduate high school (Shattuck et al., 2011) and as a result only 13% go onto postsecondary education, which contributes to having the lowest average wage amongst all other disability categories at $8.70/hr (Wei et al., 2013). Transition to Adulthood A large population of individuals with ASD is maturing into adolescence and adulthood; however, there exists a paucity of research on 224 / Education and Training in Autism and Developmental Disabilities-September 2016 postsecondary supports and interventions to support success in postsecondary settings (Shattuck et al., 2011). Due to their unique characteristics, individuals with ASD often possess strengths in the area of complex problem solving, attention to detail, the ability to hyper focus on a given task, conceptualization of solutions to often complex problems, and are often high achieving in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Burtenshaw, & Hobson, 2007; Fessenden, 2013; Shattuck et al., 2011; Wei et al., 2013). Adolescents and young adults with ASD choose majors in STEM at a much higher rate than their typically developing peers, yet fail to achieve commensurate with their peers (Wei et al., 2013). As a result of the persistent deficit in social communication and interactions within a group, individuals with ASD hold the third lowest matriculation rate to college and are the lowest of all diverse populations in the area of STEM. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Predisposed to experience persistent challenges in social skill and soft skill development, individuals with ASD possess a high level of interest and hold the potential to contribute to future science breakthroughs in STEM (Grandin, 2012). However, reports on postsecondary outcomes for individuals with ASD indicate these students have the third lowest matriculation rate (into college) and as a result, are chronically underrepresented in STEM careers (Wei et al., 2013). Many of the characteristics of ASD that often present challenges in social situations can benefits students with ASD in STEM areas. For example, their ability to hyper focus on a specific analytical task and critically and systematically conceptualize solutions to complex problems (Wei et al., 2013) all can enhance their acquisition of STEM knowledge. Despite their demonstrated aptitude for STEM fields, individuals with ASD are not being assimilated into STEM professions (Grandin, 2012). Postsecondary outcomes for individuals with ASD remain grim (Shattuck et al., 2012). One contributing factor in poor postsecondary outcomes is a persistent deficit in social skills that impedes the ability of adolescents with ASD to socially connect and develop supportive friendships; a highly desirable soft skill that predicates success in securing and maintaining employment (Alpern & Zager, 2007; Baron-Cohen et al., 2007; Fessenden, 2013; Wei et al., 2013).

It helps SpEd teachers to design meaningful solutions to deal with their challenges ranging in scope and scale from curriculum to physical space and resources to processes and systems and to address problems in classroom, throughout the school and even across an entire district.

This paper relies on the assumption that the fundamental aspect of SG design consists in the translation of learning goals/practices into mechanical element of gameplay, serving to an instructional purpose beside that of play and fun. This paper proposes the Learning Mechanics–Game Mechanics (LM-GM) model, which supports SG analysis and design by allowing reflection on the various pedagogical and game elements in an SG. The LM-GM model includes a set of pre-defined game mechanics and pedagogical elements that we have abstracted from literature on game studies and learning theories. \n \nDesigners and analysts can exploit these mechanics to draw the LM-GM map for a game, so as to identify and highlight its main pedagogical and entertainment features, and their interrelations. The tool may also be useful for teachers to evaluate the effectiveness of a given game and better understand how to implement it in educational settings. A case study is reported to illustrate the framework's support in determining how gameplay and pedagogy intertwine in an SG.

I describe the contribution that different theories of autism (e.g., theory of mind, executive function, weak central coherence theory) have made and can make, as well as the potential of other non-autism-specific theories (e.g., embodied cognition). These technologies not only illuminate our understanding of autism, but they can also be used to develop new technologies for people without autism. So, as well as being an area of specialism, I argue that VE research in autism has extended ‐ and will go onto ‐ the boundaries of human‐computer interaction more generally.

The purpose of this study was to examine the interactions of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with an adult and their typically-developing peers in the presence of animals (two guinea pigs) compared to toys. Methods Ninety-nine children from 15 classrooms in 4 schools met the inclusion criteria and participated in groups of three (1 child with ASD and 2 typically-developing peers). Each group was video-recorded during three 10-minute, free-play sessions with toys and three 10-minute, free-play sessions with two guinea pigs. Two blinded observers coded the behavior of children with ASD and their peers. To account for the nested study design, data were analyzed using hierarchical generalized linear modeling. Results Participants with ASD demonstrated more social approach behaviors (including talking, looking at faces, and making tactile contact) and received more social approaches from their peers in the presence of animals compared to toys. They also displayed more prosocial behaviors and positive affect (i.e., smiling and laughing) as well as less self-focused behaviors and negative affect (i.e., frowning, crying, and whining) in the presence of animals compared to toys.

In fact, from data collected with 262 end users across different geographic locations testing two related oilfield product releases, one Web-based and one desktop-based, we found results that were quite close to early assessment studies: Users having a more extensive experience with a product tended to provide higher, more favorable, SUS scores over users with either no or limited experience with a product---and by as much as 15-16%, regardless of the domain product type.

This is the very same issue that student have been facing no matter the level of education that they are in, and this is the reason why Math Maze Zone or also known as MMZ had been developed. MMZ is a mathematical game-based learning tool for primary school students to help them prepare for their final examination for the mathematics subject. The proposed game will consist of mathematical questions and the game design will be focusing on a maze where user will have to search for a way out from the maze while going through the checkpoint within the maze. The checkpoint will consist of mathematical questions and when user answered correctly, they will be able to continue their journey to explore the maze. MMZ focused on 1 chapter only for now which is Chapter 8: Space and Shape. Although the game only consists of one-chapter, primary school students can play the game to enhance their knowledge and to help them to be more engaged with mathematics subject by playing the game. The results will be taken from the perspective of adult who have close relationship with standard six students. Five main sections will also be identified along with MMZ to ensure getting a good result.', 'year': 2023, 'referenceCount': 18, 'citationCount': 2, 'journal': {'name': 'International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Sulaiman2023MMZAS,\n author = {Nur Syaheera Binti Sulaiman and H.

The proposed system intelligently investigates the learner, recommends an exclusive learning dyscalculia path and after tutoring assesses learning gain, and retention. Learner experience and effects of the pedagogical agent on types of cognitive loads are discussed on basis of post tutoring analysis. Samples of 82 learners have been studied, experimental findings based on research questions have been reported and conclusions discussed. Our assumption that ‘a well-articulated and well-designed instructional design exerts a minimal extraneous cognitive load on learners and facilitates learning gain and retention’ is consistent with the obtained results.

While previous research provides evidence for the motivational impact of mobile learning, not many pedagogical frameworks exist for the design of mobile-assisted learning and assessment. The current study is grounded in the Self-Determination Theory of motivation and proposes a pedagogical framework for mobile-assisted formative assessment, aiming at enhancing student motivation. For a preliminary evaluation of the framework, fifty-one students from a public European high school participated in a series of formative assessment activities. The tasks that were implemented according to the proposed mobile-based formative assessment framework had a significant positive impact on student perceived levels of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, enhancing students’ intrinsic motivation levels. Study findings highlighted the capacity of the proposed framework to guide the design of mobile-based formative assessment activities that enhance and promote student motivation. The study makes a theoretical contribution by proposing a framework that aligns mobile learning and assessment with elements of the Self-Determination Theory of motivation and also has a practical contribution by implementing mobile learning and assessment practices that have the potential to promote student motivation.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 79, 'citationCount': 6, 'journal': {'volume': '13', 'pages': '116', 'name': 'Future Internet'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': ""@Article{Nikou2021AFF,\n author = {S.

They can be used to improve the children’s learning skills to grasp new concepts rapidly in an enjoyable manner. Fun, motivation, and engagement are the most important features in designing attractive serious games. Therefore, designers should always find the best strategies and techniques to keep children playing the game with motivation and enthusiasm. The process is very long and requires different expertise from all the stakeholders. Arcade games are the most played games for fun and amusement in the last decades. Their approach is based on simplicity, easiness, repetitiveness, and soft challenges. The players of arcade games need only to improve their scores in every episode and avoid frustration and hard challenges as in other games. Hence, this arcade-based approach can be used in designing attractive serious games for young children and adolescents. We propose in this research a new serious game for diabetic children to teach them about the disease in a very easy manner. The game uses the arcade approach coupled with useful information about diabetes where the children discover them incrementally during the play. The longer time the child spends on the game, the most she/he can learn and enhance her/his knowledge on the disease. The game success came from its design and implementation with the presence of diabetes children, advisors, and nutritionists. We compare the game with the well-known DEX pet-based game for diabetes awareness on different aspects including user experience, usability, and learning outcomes. The study is conducted on twenty children from a diabetes camp who accepted voluntarily to participate in this research. We evaluate their educational aspects, using an improved version of the MEEGA+ model.

We assess the prototype game regarding motivation to play and game usability, and also participants’ emotional recognition abilities and technology usage. People with autism are less likely to gaze at faces and are also impaired in face discrimination tasks. Recently, technology plays an active role in helping these individuals to understand emotions and recognise facial expressions. LIFEisGAME prototype was played during a 15 minute game session by 11 children with ASD, with ages varying from 5-15 years old (M=9.27, SD=2.97), 91% were male and 9% were female, 82% were verbal ASD and 18% were non-verbal ASD. We video recorded each child and the footage was analysed according to game usability and motivation to play. Parents (n=11) filled out a parental consent form and a questionnaire about their child ́s technology usage and their emotional understanding. Therapists' opinions (n=8) about the game were given during an unstructured interview. The game was presented on an Ipad 4 (9.7 inches, 2048x1536). Participants enjoyed the prototype but it still needs to be simplified. All participants had experience with computer games. Fear, disgust and surprise were the most challenging emotions to recognise. Parents suggested adding musical stimuli to promote motivation and therapists recommended to include visual game instructions. Technology is a useful resource for autism and LIFEisGAME utilises technology to promote emotional understanding, bringing positive outcomes to quality of life for children with autism.

For an agent to achieve affective communication with a wide range of users, understanding emotion recognition of an agent's expression is important. In previous studies, age has had an obvious effect on emotion recognition. However, the effect of age on emotion recognition in the context of non-human agents is not yet well understood. In this study, we investigated emotion recognition of young and elderly users when confronted with a non-human agent's expressions. A questionnaire with a seven-emotion alternative forced choice task was used to analyze emotion recognition in 62 young and 39 elderly users. Dynamically formed virtual agent expressions were used to analyze the effect of non-human expressions on emotion recognition. The elderly users had a higher variability of emotion recognition compared with the young users. Studying the individual characteristics of emotion recognition should be prioritized would allow for more affective communication between elderly users and non-human agents.",2019,14,4,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Human-Agent Interaction'},"{'bibtex': ""@Book{Numata2019YoungAE,\n author = {Takashi Numata and Yasuhiro Asa and T.

However, scant availability of well-controlled emotional face stimuli from non-Western populations limit the evaluation of cultural differences in face emotion perception and how this might be modulated by age and sex differences. We present a database of East Asian face expression stimuli, enacted by young and older, male and female, Taiwanese using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). Combined with a prior database, this present database consists of 90 identities with happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgusted, surprised and neutral expressions amounting to 628 photographs. Twenty young and 24 older East Asian raters scored the photographs for intensities of multiple-dimensions of emotions and induced affect. Multivariate analyses characterized the dimensionality of perceived emotions and quantified effects of age and sex. We also applied commercial software to extract computer-based metrics of emotions in photographs. Taiwanese raters perceived happy faces as one category, sad, angry, and disgusted expressions as one category, and fearful and surprised expressions as one category. Younger females were more sensitive to face emotions than younger males. Whereas, older males showed reduced face emotion sensitivity, older female sensitivity was similar or accentuated relative to young females. Commercial software dissociated six emotions according to the FACS demonstrating that defining visual features were present. Our findings show that East Asians perceive a different dimensionality of emotions than Western-based definitions in face recognition software, regardless of age and sex. Critically, stimuli with detailed cultural norms are indispensable in interpreting neural and behavioral responses involving human facial expression processing.

Research suggests that older adults often perform better under conditions that better mimic real-world social contexts. We assessed emotion recognition in young, middle-aged, and older adults using two traditional methods (single emotion judgments of static images of faces and eyes) and an additional method in which participants made continuous emotion judgments of dynamic, multimodal stimuli (videotaped interactions between young, middle-aged, and older couples). Results revealed an Age × Test interaction. Largely consistent with prior research, we found some evidence that older adults performed worse than young adults when judging single emotions from images of faces (for sad and disgust faces only) and eyes (for older eyes only), with middle-aged adults falling in between. In contrast, older adults did better than young adults on the test involving continuous emotion judgments of dyadic interactions, with middle-aged adults falling in between.

26,d94cec033bed702a104818125e777ab132a35ff7,From Public Gatherings to the Burst of Collective Violence: An Agent-based Emotion Contagion Model,"Understanding how collective actions evolve into violence is critical for guiding public safety decisions. While real- world observations of collective violence are difficult and rare, simulation models can help us to explore its evolution process. We propose an Agent-Based Emotion Contagion (ABEC) model that simulates the spread of group violence when the mechanism of contagious grievance is at work. The model is motivated by related social psychological theories of group behavior and is implemented by incorporating the epidemiological emotion contagion mechanism with crowd's game-theoretic behaviors with an agent-based approach. Our simulation model generates some crowd patterns, including local outbursts of collective violence with grievance contagion, dynamic spatial clustering of violent civilians and the nonlinear evolution of collective violence. We also explore the variations of violence evolution by varying some parameters of our model. Results show that the high-density crowds and the widespread of grievance promote violence outburst.

Although common-sense explanations of violence focus on actors’ motivations and strategies, a situational turn is underway, emphasizing the relevance of the violent situation itself. This article assesses this situational approach, examining whether the emergence of violence can be explained by focusing on what occurs during a protest. Method: The article comparatively analyzes 30 protests occurring in the United States and Germany between 1960 and 2010. Using a triangulation of visual and document data, as well as participant observation, it analyzes over 1,000 data pieces, uses 2 samples, and conducts 3 steps of analysis: The article develops a situational approach using meticulous case reconstructions (employing Video Data Analysis), tests the approach by comparatively analyzing a random sample of violent and peaceful protests (employing Qualitative Comparative Analysis), and revisits cases to identify crucial dynamics and paths to protest violence. Results: The study identifies 5 behaviors by protesters and police during protests crucial for leading to violence if they occur in one of the following three combinations: a loss of control path, a missing information path, and an offense path. All 3 combinations trigger violence by changing actors’ situational interpretations and emotional dynamics. Conclusions: Findings suggest a purely situational approach—focusing on what happens during demonstrations—can provide a consistent and meaningful explanation for the emergence of violence. Alternative explanations are discussed, such as the relevance of background and context factors as risk factors to the emergence of violence.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 83, 'citationCount': 20, 'journal': {'volume': '8', 'pages': '293–304', 'name': 'Psychology of Violence'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Nassauer2018SituationalDA,\n author = {Anne Nassauer},\n journal = {Psychology of Violence},\n pages = {293–304},\n title = {Situational Dynamics and the Emergence of Violence in Protests},\n volume = {8},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '114353587', 'name': 'Anne Nassauer'}]}, {'paperId': '85d906d3f2bf6482d71f8b0a12b13c9a26d8987a', 'title': 'Simulating Civil Disorder:AnAgent-based Modeling Approach', 'abstract': 'This paper introduces a preliminary agent-based simulation model that seeks to analyze individual-level behaviors.

Our results replicated previous findings by showing that instrumentality, identity, and ideology together with group-based anger motivates people to participate in protest. Importantly, our study extended previous findings by showing that these factors account for variance in motivation among actual participants. More specifically, ideology appeared to be the strongest motivator of protest participation, followed by identity and instrumentality. Next to these main effects, we obtained interaction effects between the three motives and group-based anger, demonstrating the need for complex and sophisticated models."", 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 47, 'citationCount': 109, 'journal': {'volume': '26', 'pages': '104 - 91', 'name': 'Revista de Psicología Social'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Stekelenburg2011CombiningMA,\n author = {Jacquelien van Stekelenburg and B.

This article presents a solution to the problem based on status as a selective incentive motivating contribution. Contributors to collective action signal their motivation to help the group and consequently earn diverse benefits from group members–in particular, higher status–and these rewards encourage greater giving to the group in the future. In Study 1, high contributors to collective action earned higher status, exercised more interpersonal influence, were cooperated with more, and received gifts of greater value. Studies 2 and 3 replicated these findings while discounting alternative explanations. All three studies show that giving to the group mattered because it signaled an individual's motivation to help the group.

We worked with three different kinds of agents: hardcore, hangers-on and bystanders, the difference between them consisting in the frequency with which they scan their surroundings. Data on clustering, and 'fights' are presented for 80 simulation runs, in which group size, size symmetry and group composition were varied. The conclusions are that fights especially happen in asymmetrical large groups with relatively large proportions of hardcore members. Moreover, it appears that it are especially the hardcore group members and the hangers-on that attack other agents, whereas bystanders are victimised.

27,2a69e806a42bf401017c9c9b6b1c1efb1430c541,Effects of Virtual Human Appearance Fidelity on Emotion Contagion in Affective Inter-Personal Simulations,"Realistic versus stylized depictions of virtual humans in simulated inter-personal situations and their ability to elicit emotional responses in users has been an open question for artists and researchers alike. We empirically evaluated the effects of near visually realistic vs. non-realistic stylized appearance of virtual humans on the emotional response of participants in a medical virtual reality system that was designed to educate users in recognizing the signs and symptoms of patient deterioration. In a between-subjects experiment protocol, participants interacted with one of three different appearances of a virtual patient, namely visually realistic, cartoon-shaded and charcoal-sketch like conditions in a mixed reality simulation. Emotional impact were measured via a combination of quantitative objective measures were gathered using skin Electrodermal Activity (EDA) sensors, and quantitative subjective measures such as the Differential Emotion Survey (DES IV), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and Social Presence questionnaire. The emotional states of the participants were analyzed across four distinct time steps during which the medical condition of the virtual patient deteriorated (an emotionally stressful interaction), and were contrasted to a baseline affective state. Objective EDA results showed that in all three conditions, male participants exhibited greater levels of arousal as compared to female participants. We found that negative affect levels were significantly lower in the visually realistic condition, as compared to the stylized appearance conditions. Furthermore, in emotional dimensions of interest-excitement, surprise, anger, fear and guilt participants in all conditions responded similarly. However, in social emotional constructs of shyness, presence, perceived personality, and enjoyment-joy, we found that participants responded differently in the visually realistic condition as compared to the cartoon and sketch conditions.

Participants rated how strong or powerful they perceived virtual characters of varying body shapes that were displayed in different poses. Our results show that perception of physical strength was mainly driven by the shape of the body. However, the social attribute of power was influenced by an interaction between pose and shape. Specifically, the effect of pose on power ratings was greater for weak body shapes. These results demonstrate that a character with a weak shape can be perceived as more powerful when in a high-power pose.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 27, 'citationCount': 11, 'journal': {'name': 'Proceedings of the ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Applied Perception'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Wellerdiek2015PerceptionOS,\n author = {Anna C.

A theory called the 'Uncanny Valley' has been used to describe the phenomenon that the appearance of a virtual character can contribute to negative/positive audience reactions to that character [Mori 1970]. Since the style used to render a character strongly changes the appearance, we investigate whether a difference in render style can indirectly influence audience reaction, which we measure based on perception of personality. Based on psychology research, we first scripted original character dialogues in order to convey a range of ten typical personality types. Then, a professional actor was recruited to act out these dialogues, while his face and body motion and audio were recorded. The performances were mapped onto a virtual character rendered in two styles that differ in appearance: an appealing cartoon style and unappealing ill style (Figure 1).

When these characters display appropriate emotions for their context, they can be particularly effective. Characters can display emotions by accurately mimicking the facial expressions and vocal cues that people display or by damping or exaggerating the emotionality of the expressions. In this work, we explored which of these strategies would be most effective for animated characters. We investigated the effects of altering the auditory and facial levels of expressiveness on emotion recognition accuracy and ratings of perceived emotional intensity and naturalness. We ran an experiment with emotion (angry, happy, sad), auditory emotion level (low, high), and facial motion magnitude (damped, unaltered, exaggerated) as within-subjects factors. Participants evaluated animations of a character whose facial motion matched that of an actress we tracked using an active appearance model. This method of tracking and animation can capture subtle facial motions in real-time, a necessity for many interactive animated characters. We manipulated auditory emotion level by asking the actress to speak sentences at varying levels, and we manipulated facial motion magnitude by exaggerating and damping the actress's spatial motion. We found that the magnitude of auditory expressiveness was positively related to emotion recognition accuracy and ratings of emotional intensity. The magnitude of facial motion was positively related to ratings of emotional intensity but negatively related to ratings of naturalness."", 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 30, 'citationCount': 16, 'journal': {'name': 'Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Applied Perception'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Hyde2014AssessingNA,\n author = {Jennifer Hyde and E.

There have been mixed reactions from audiences to lifelike characters used in movies and games, with some saying that the increased realism highlights subtle imperfections, which can be disturbing.

Rapid advances in performance capture and advanced rendering techniques have allowed the movie industry in particular to create characters that appear very human-like. However, with these new capabilities has come the realization that such characters are yet not quite “right.” One possible hypothesis is that these virtual humans fall into an “Uncanny Valley”, where the viewer's emotional response is repulsion or rejection, rather than the empathy or emotional engagement that their creators had hoped for. To explore these issues, we created three animated vignettes of an arguing couple with detailed motion for the face, eyes, hair, and body. In a set of perceptual experiments, we explore the relative importance of different anomalies using two different methods: a questionnaire to determine the emotional response to the full-length vignettes, with and without facial motion and audio; and a 2AFC (two alternative forced choice) task to compare the performance of a virtual “actor” in short clips (extracts from the vignettes) depicting a range of different facial and body anomalies.

We also evaluated the choice of electrode material by comparing conductive fabric with Ag/AgCl electrodes and discuss the limitations found.

Most Officers, however, develop their interpersonal skills on the job. Further, what formal training they receive consists primarily of live role-play sessions, which can fail to provide consistent practice, effective feedback, or accurate skill assessment and improvement. To address these issues, we have created a virtual-human-based roleplaying environment. The Virtual Officer Leadership Trainer (VOLT) is a controlled practice environment that allows instructor management and facilitates throughput. Trainees learn interpersonal skills, see demonstrations of the skills being used correctly, and then practice the skills interacting with a virtual human via branching, scripted dialogue that allows the trainee to apply specific skills. The trainees in the classroom observe this interaction in real time. At each decision point in the interaction, trainees use personal response systems (“clickers”) to indicate what they believe to be the correct course of action. These data are available to an instructor who monitors the class’s performance and conducts an after-action review. VOLT thus allows an entire class to participate in a single roleplay exercise, stimulating discussion, and facilitating peer and instructor evaluation in real time. VOLT’s instructional design is based on cognitive task analyses with expert leaders, which identified a set of learning objectives. This paper discusses VOLT’s educational goals, instructional design, technological approach, and program evaluation plan.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 28, 'citationCount': 26, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Campbell2011InterpersonalAL,\n author = {Julia Campbell and M.

It is well established, for example, that the placement of pillars at proper locations can often facilitate pedestrian flow during the evacuation of a building. Such considerations are therefore important for architects, game level developers, and others whose domains involve agents navigating through buildings. In this paper, we take the first steps towards developing a simulation framework that can be used to study the optimal placement of architectural elements, such as pillars or doors, for the purposes of facilitating dense pedestrian flow during the evacuation of a building. In particular, we show that the steering algorithms used to model the local navigation abilities of the agents significantly affect the results, which motivates the need for a statistically valid approach and further study.

Since indoor evacuation behaviour is closely related to spatial features of the building, effective representation of indoor space is essential for the simulation of building evacuation. The traditional cell-based representation has limitations in reflecting spatial structure and is not suitable for topology analysis. Aiming at incorporating powerful topology analysis functions of GIS to facilitate agent-based simulation of building evacuation, we used a grid graph-based model in this study to represent the indoor space. Such model allows us to establish an evacuation network at a micro level. Potential escape routes from each node thus could be analysed through GIS functions of network analysis considering both the spatial structure and route capacity. This would better support agent-based modelling of evacuees' behaviour including route choice and local movements. As a case study, we conducted a simulation of emergency evacuation from the second floor of an official building using Agent Analyst as the simulation platform. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, as well as the potential of GIS in visualizing and analysing simulation results."", 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 10, 'citationCount': 11, 'journal': {'volume': '18', 'pages': '012123', 'name': 'IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Tan2014AgentbasedSO,\n author = {L.

The scalability of influence maximization is a key factor for enabling prevalent viral marketing in large-scale online social networks. Prior solutions, such as the greedy algorithm of Kempe et al. (2003) and its improvements are slow and not scalable, while other heuristic algorithms do not provide consistently good performance on influence spreads. In this paper, we design a new heuristic algorithm that is easily scalable to millions of nodes and edges in our experiments. Our algorithm has a simple tunable parameter for users to control the balance between the running time and the influence spread of the algorithm. Our results from extensive simulations on several real-world and synthetic networks demonstrate that our algorithm is currently the best scalable solution to the influence maximization problem: (a) our algorithm scales beyond million-sized graphs where the greedy algorithm becomes infeasible, and (b) in all size ranges, our algorithm performs consistently well in influence spread --- it is always among the best algorithms, and in most cases it significantly outperforms all other scalable heuristics to as much as 100%--260% increase in influence spread.', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 24, 'citationCount': 1678, 'journal': {'name': 'Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Chen2010ScalableIM,\n author = {Wei Chen and Chi Wang and Yajun Wang},\n journal = {Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining},\n title = {Scalable influence maximization for prevalent viral marketing in large-scale social networks},\n year = {2010}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': None, 'name': 'Wei Chen'}, {'authorId': '2116625588', 'name': 'Chi Wang'}, {'authorId': '2115646925', 'name': 'Yajun Wang'}]}, {'paperId': '299b18527711595652a8775d7450a5bc16222502', 'title': 'A Multi-agent Model for Emotion Contagion Spirals Integrated within a Supporting Ambient Agent Model', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 25, 'citationCount': 77, 'journal': {'pages': '48-67'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Bosse2009AMM,\n author = {T.

There is an abundant literature on sex differences in spatial abilities and object location that follow from the specific navigational strategies associated with hunting and gathering in the ancestral environment. In addition to sex differences in navigational strategies, the unique features of hunting and gathering may have influenced other aspects of foraging psychology that underlie sex differences in modern male and female shopping experiences and behaviors. Scales were developed to assess several aspects of shopping psychology that may be based on sexually differentiated ancestral adaptations. Results generally confirmed the predicted directions of sex differences. Compared to men, women relied more on object oriented navigation strategies and scored higher on skills and behaviors associated with gathering, the degree to which shopping is seen as recreational, the degree to which shopping is a social activity, and the tendency to see new locations as opportunities for shopping. Men scored higher on skills and behaviors thought to be associated with hunting. Most effect sizes were moderate or strong. These results suggest that shopping experiences and behaviors are influenced by sexually divergent adaptations for gathering and hunting.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 43, 'citationCount': 50, 'journal': {'volume': '3', 'pages': '328-342', 'name': 'The Journal of Social, Evolutionary, and Cultural Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Kruger2009EvolvedFP,\n author = {D.

There is a large and growing number of approaches for steering, and it is becoming increasingly important to ask a fundamental question: how can we objectively compare steering algorithms? To our knowledge, there is no standard way of evaluating or comparing the quality of steering solutions. This paper presents SteerBench: a benchmark framework for objectively evaluating steering behaviors for virtual agents. We propose a diverse set of test cases, metrics of evaluation, and a scoring method that can be used to compare different steering algorithms. Our framework can be easily customized by a user to evaluate specific behaviors and new test cases. We demonstrate our benchmark process on two example steering algorithms, showing the insight gained from our metrics. We hope that this framework can grow into a standard for steering evaluation.

While opinions and abilities may, at first glance, seem to be quite different things, there is a close functional tie between them. They act together in the manner in which they affect behavior. A person’s cognition (his opinions and beliefs) about the situation in which he exists and his appraisals of what he is capable of doing (his evaluation of his abilities) will together have bearing on his behavior. The holding of incorrect opinions and/or inaccurate appraisals of one’s abilities can be punishing or even fatal in many situations. It is necessary, before we proceed, to clarify the distinction between opinions and evaluations of abilities since at first glance it may seem that one’s evaluation of one’s own ability is an opinion about it. Abilities are of course manifested only through performance which is assumed to depend upon the particular ability. The clarity of the manifestation or performance can vary from instances where there is no clear ordering criterion of the ability to instances where the performance which reflects the ability can be clearly ordered. In the former case, the evaluation of the ability does function like other opinions which are not directly testable in “objective reality’. For example, a person’s evaluation of his ability to write poetry will depend to a large extent on the opinions which others have of his ability to write poetry. In cases where the criterion is unambiguous and can be clearly ordered, this furnishes an objective reality for the evaluation of one’s ability so that it depends less on the opinions of other persons and depends more on actual comparison of one’s performance with the performance of others. Thus, if a person evaluates his running ability, he will do so by comparing his time to run some distance with the times that other persons have taken. In the following pages, when we talk about evaluating an ability, we shall mean specifically the evaluation of that ability in situations where the performance is unambiguous and is known. Most situations in real life will, of course, present situations which are a mixture of opinion and ability evaluation. In a previous article (7) the author posited the existence of a drive to determine whether or not one’s opinions were “correct”. We are here stating that this same drive also produces behavior in people oriented toward obtaining an accurate appraisal of their abilities. The behavioral implication of the existence of such a drive is that we would expect to observe behaviour on the part of persons which enables them to ascertain whether or not their opinions are correct and also behavior which enables them accurately to evaluate their abilities.

Thus higher cognitive levels of perception and behaviour improve simulation quality. Furthermore, giving an agent the possibility to choose the nature of its interactions with the others can not only improve simulation realism but also bring heterogeneity in the simulated population because each agent individually perceives the situation according to its own characteristics. In this paper, we aim at providing the pedestrian agent the ability to obtain an individual representation of the environment that allows him to adapt its behaviour according to the situation. We base our work on the analysis and interpretation of the environment, which makes the agent decide the behaviour it is going to adopt. We focus on two kinds of behaviours, following and group avoidance behaviours, and on their integration in classical avoidance simulations. We integrate recent works about following behaviour and propose to model interactions directly with groups of people instead of individuals. We aim at providing perception rules totally independent from the collision avoidance model used in the simulation. Because of the improved perception process, we observe emerging speed waves, group behaviours and lane formation in our simulations. Our results demonstrate the interest of modelling such behaviours to obtain more realistic simulations and show that specific patterns and collective behaviours emerge when using several types of behaviours in simulations.

We present a data-driven method of simulating a crowd of virtual humans that exhibit behaviors imitating real human crowds. To do so, we record the motion of a human crowd from an aerial view using a camcorder, extract the two-dimensional moving trajectories of each individual in the crowd, and then learn an agent model from observed trajectories. The agent model decides each agent's actions based on features of the environment and the motion of nearby agents in the crowd. Once the agent model is learned, we can simulate a virtual crowd that behaves similarly to the real crowd in the video. The versatility and flexibility of our approach is demonstrated through examples in which various characteristics of group behaviors are captured and reproduced in simulated crowds."", 'year': None, 'referenceCount': 16, 'citationCount': 310, 'journal': None, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Misc{None,\n author = {Dimitris N.

However, a comprehensive model that considers up-to-date ﬁndings and multiple online social media mechanisms is still missing. To bridge this vital gap, an agent-based model, which concurrently considers emotion inﬂuence and tie strength preferences, is presented to simulate the emotion contagion and competition. Our model well reproduces patterns observed in the empirical data, like anger’s preference on weak ties, anger-dominated users’ high vitalities and angry tweets’ short retweet intervals, and anger’s competitiveness in negative events. The comparison with a previously presented baseline model further demonstrates its eﬀectiveness in modeling online emotion contagion. It is also surprisingly revealed by our model that as the ratio of anger approaches joy with a gap less than 12%, anger will eventually dominate the online social media and arrives the collective outrage in the cyber space. The critical gap disclosed here can be indeed warning signals at early stages for outrage control. Our model would shed lights on the study of multiple issues regarding emotion contagion and competition in terms of computer simulations.",2018,0,0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Fan2018AnAM,\n author = {Rui Fan and Jichang Zhao},\n title = {An agent-based model for emotion contagion and competition in online media},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2089733995', 'name': 'Rui Fan'}, {'authorId': '1886666', 'name': 'Jichang Zhao'}]",[],[]

However, the mechanism of complex emotion influencing decision making, especially in the environment of sudden confrontation, has not yet been explored clearly. In this paper, we propose one new antagonistic crowd simulation model by combing emotional contagion and deep reinforcement learning (ACSED). Firstly, we build a group emotional contagion model based on the improved SIS contagion disease model, and estimate the emotional state of the group at each time step during the simulation. Then, the tendency of group antagonistic behavior is modeled based on Deep Q Network (DQN), where the agent can learn the combat behavior autonomously, and leverages the mean field theory to quickly calculate the influence of other surrounding individuals on the central one. Finally, the rationality of the predicted behaviors by the DQN is further analyzed in combination with group emotion, and the final combat behavior of the agent is determined. The method proposed in this paper is verified through several different settings of experiments. The results prove that emotions have a vital impact on the group combat, and positive emotional states are more conducive to combat. Moreover, by comparing the simulation results with real scenes, the feasibility of the method is further verified, which can provide good reference for formulating battle plans and improving the winning rate of righteous groups battles in a variety of situations.",2021,44,0,"{'name': 'ArXiv', 'volume': 'abs/2105.00854'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lv2021AntagonisticCS,\n author = {Pei Lv and Boya Xu and Chaochao Li and Qingqing Yu and Bing Zhou and Mingliang Xu},\n booktitle = {arXiv.org},\n journal = {ArXiv},\n title = {Antagonistic Crowd Simulation Model Integrating Emotion Contagion and Deep Reinforcement Learning},\n volume = {abs/2105.00854},\n year = {2021}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '144470801', 'name': 'Pei Lv'}, {'authorId': '2109511600', 'name': 'Boya Xu'}, {'authorId': '7431398', 'name': 'Chaochao Li'}, {'authorId': '2087411234', 'name': 'Qingqing Yu'}, {'authorId': '2118869098', 'name': 'Bing Zhou'}, {'authorId': '2285442', 'name': 'Mingliang Xu'}]",[],"[{'paperId': 'ece6e13bdc17cb11ce1cfdf75e3ae5cb3f5c05c0', 'title': 'Multi-Robot Path Planning Method Based on Prior Knowledge and Q-learning Algorithms', 'abstract': 'The path planning method based on prior knowledge and Q-learning algorithm proposed in this paper solves the problems of low operating efficiency and slow learning speed in existing multi-robot coordination and collision avoidance.

Safety officers are often dispatched to scenes of emergencies because their positive emotions can calm the crowd down and avoid serious accidents. However, how to utilize the positive emotional contagion to maximize the “calm-down” effect remains a challenging problem in crowd evacuation. In this paper, we present an approach for optimizing positive emotional contagion in crowd evacuation. First, a computational model of positive emotional contagion is proposed to describe how safety officers calm a crowd down. To capture important influential factors for positive emotional contagion, such as the trust relationships among the individuals involved in a crisis situation and the variations of emotional contagion speed, we construct a trust-based emotional contagion network (Trust-ECN) and a heterogeneous emotional contagion speed computation model (HECS-CM). Based on these models, the emotional contagion process can be analyzed in a parametric way, and the infection probability for each individual in a given time window can be computed analytically with a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). Second, a maximization problem of emotional contagion is formulated. Since this optimization problem is NP-hard, an artificial bee colony optimized emotional contagion (ABCEC) algorithm is used to solve for the optimal positions of safety officers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both synthetic and real-world data at different scales. Finally, we implement a crowd simulation system to visualize the results of our theoretical analysis in a graphical manner.

However, the existing solution is still not satisfactory due to the problem in the mutual influence of agents. Therefore, an improved multi-agent reinforcement learning method (IMARL algorithm) is introduced. In this method, the intersection of the pedestrian trajectory extracted from the real video is first used as the state space for reinforcement learning. The crowd is grouped and the leader is selected. A bulletin board is added to the reinforcement learning algorithm of multi-agent to store the empirical knowledge of the learning process, and the navigation agent passes information between the leader and the bulletin board. The original social force model was improved, and the cohesive force of visual factors was added to the force formula. The IMARL algorithm is combined with the improved social force model for crowd evacuation simulation. Using a two-layer control mechanism, the leader in the upper layer uses the decision process based on the IMARL algorithm to select the path, and the individuals in the bottom group use the improved social force model to evacuate. The method of this paper not only solves the dimensionality disaster problem of reinforcement learning but also improves the convergence speed.

Antagonistic emotions, which is the typical psychological state of agents in different roles (i.e., cops, activists, and civilians) in crowd violence scenes, and the way they spread through contagion in a crowd are important causes of crowd antagonistic behaviors. Moreover, games, which refers to the interaction between opposing groups adopting different strategies to obtain higher benefits and less casualties, determine the level of crowd violence. We present an antagonistic crowd simulation model (ACSEE), which is integrated with antagonistic emotional contagion and evolutionary game theories. Our approach models the antagonistic emotions between agents in different roles using two components: mental emotion and external emotion. We combine enhanced susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) and game approaches to evaluate the role of antagonistic emotional contagion in crowd violence. Our evolutionary game theoretic approach incorporates antagonistic emotional contagion through deterrent force, which is modelled by a mixture of emotional forces and physical forces defeating the opponents. Antagonistic emotional contagion and evolutionary game theories influence each other to determine antagonistic crowd behaviors. We evaluate our approach on real-world scenarios consisting of different kinds of agents. We also compare the simulated crowd behaviors with real-world crowd videos and use our approach to predict the trends of crowd movements in violence incidents.

The spread of passengers’ panic is simulated by use of Matlab, which draws the rules of how group panic spreads dynamically. The trend of stable point of the infection ratio is analyzed by changing different parameters, which help to draw a conclusion that immunization rate, spontaneous immune loss rate, and passenger number have a great influence on the final infected ratio. Finally, we propose an integrated control strategy and find the peak of passengers’ panic and the final infected ratio is greatly improved through the numerical simulation.

It was with a view to obtaining more insight regarding the effects of the various factors which govern the spread of contagious epidemics that the present investigation was undertaken. Reference may here be made to the work of Ross and Hudson (1915-17) in which the same problem is attacked. The problem is here carried to a further stage, and it is considered from a point of view which is in one sense more general. The problem may be summarised as follows: One (or more) infected person is introduced into a community of individuals, more or less susceptible to the disease in question. The disease spreads from the affected to the unaffected by contact infection. Each infected person runs through the course of his sickness, and finally is removed from the number of those who are sick, by recovery or by death. The chances of recovery or death vary from day to day during the course of his illness. The chances that the affected may convey infection to the unaffected are likewise dependent upon the stage of the sickness. As the epidemic spreads, the number of unaffected members of the community becomes reduced. Since the course of an epidemic is short compared with the life of an individual, the population may be considered as remaining constant, except in as far as it is modified by deaths due to the epidemic disease itself. In the course of time the epidemic may come to an end. One of the most important probems in epidemiology is to ascertain whether this termination occurs only when no susceptible individuals are left, or whether the interplay of the various factors of infectivity, recovery and mortality, may result in termination, whilst many susceptible individuals are still present in the unaffected population. It is difficult to treat this problem in its most general aspect. In the present communication discussion will be limited to the case in which all members of the community are initially equally susceptible to the disease, and it will be further assumed that complete immunity is conferred by a single infection.', 'year': 1927, 'referenceCount': 2, 'citationCount': 9984, 'journal': {'volume': '115', 'pages': '700-721', 'name': 'Proceedings of The Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Kermack1927ACT,\n author = {W.

However, the mechanisms underlying this emotional contagion, for example, whether different feelings spread in unlikely ways or how the spread of emotions relates to the social network, is rarely investigated. Indeed, because of high costs and spatiotemporal limitations, explorations of this topic are challenging using conventional questionnaires or controlled experiments. Because they are collection points for natural affective responses of massive individuals, online social media sites offer an ideal proxy for tackling this issue from the perspective of computational social science. In this paper, based on the analysis of millions of tweets in Weibo, surprisingly, we find that anger is more contagious than joy, indicating that it can spark more angry follow-up tweets. Moreover, regarding dissemination in social networks, anger travels easily along weaker ties than joy, meaning that it can infiltrate different communities and break free of local traps because strangers share such content more often. Through a simple diffusion model, we reveal that greater contagion and weaker ties function cooperatively to speed up anger’s spread. The diffusion of real-world events with different dominant emotions provides further testimony to the findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that quantitative long-term evidence has been presented that reveals a difference in the mechanism by which joy and anger are disseminated.

Here, we study the dynamics of emotional contagion using a random sample of Twitter users, whose activity (and the stimuli they were exposed to) was observed during a week of September 2014. Rather than manipulating content, we devise a null model that discounts some confounding factors (including the effect of emotional contagion). We measure the emotional valence of content the users are exposed to before posting their own tweets. We determine that on average a negative post follows an over-exposure to 4.34% more negative content than baseline, while positive posts occur after an average over-exposure to 4.50% more positive contents. We highlight the presence of a linear relationship between the average emotional valence of the stimuli users are exposed to, and that of the responses they produce. We also identify two different classes of individuals: highly and scarcely susceptible to emotional contagion. Highly susceptible users are significantly less inclined to adopt negative emotions than the scarcely susceptible ones, but equally likely to adopt positive emotions. In general, the likelihood of adopting positive emotions is much greater than that of negative emotions.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 66, 'citationCount': 349, 'journal': {'volume': '10', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Ferrara2015MeasuringEC,\n author = {Emilio Ferrara and Zeya Yang},\n journal = {PLoS ONE},\n title = {Measuring Emotional Contagion in Social Media},\n volume = {10},\n year = {2015}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '48898287', 'name': 'Emilio Ferrara'}, {'authorId': '121937545', 'name': 'Zeya Yang'}]}, {'paperId': '2be01d8928d40c45250f63e7354e3e532b2c78e2', 'title': 'ESIS: Emotion-based spreader-ignorant-stifler model for information diffusion', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 37, 'citationCount': 53, 'journal': {'volume': '81', 'pages': '46-55', 'name': 'Knowl.

We provide experimental evidence that emotional contagion occurs without direct interaction between people (exposure to a friend expressing an emotion is sufficient), and in the complete absence of nonverbal cues. Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks.

Weibo, a Twitter-like online social network in China, has attracted more than 300 million users in less than three years, with more than 1000 tweets generated in every second. These tweets not only convey the factual information, but also reflect the emotional states of the authors, which are very important for understanding user behaviors. However, a tweet in Weibo is extremely short and the words it contains evolve extraordinarily fast. Moreover, the Chinese corpus of sentiments is still very small, which prevents the conventional keyword-based methods from being used. In light of this, we build a system called MoodLens, which to our best knowledge is the first system for sentiment analysis of Chinese tweets in Weibo. In MoodLens, 95 emoticons are mapped into four categories of sentiments, i.e. angry, disgusting, joyful, and sad, which serve as the class labels of tweets. We then collect over 3.5 million labeled tweets as the corpus and train a fast Naive Bayes classifier, with an empirical precision of 64.3%. MoodLens also implements an incremental learning method to tackle the problem of the sentiment shift and the generation of new words. Using MoodLens for real-time tweets obtained from Weibo, several interesting temporal and spatial patterns are observed. Also, sentiment variations are well captured by MoodLens to effectively detect abnormal events in China. Finally, by using the highly efficient Naive Bayes classifier, MoodLens is capable of online real-time sentiment monitoring.

The results indicate that positive content is more viral than negative content, but the relationship between emotion and social transmission is more complex than valence alone. Virality is partially driven by physiological arousal. Content that evokes high-arousal positive (awe) or negative (anger or anxiety) emotions is more viral. Content that evokes low-arousal, or deactivating, emotions (e.g., sadness) is less viral. These results hold even when the authors control for how surprising, interesting, or practically useful content is (all of which are positively linked to virality), as well as external drivers of attention (e.g., how prominently content was featured).

However, users in online social networks rarely categorize their contacts into ""family"", ""colleagues"", or ""classmates"". While a bulk of research has focused on inferring particular types of relationships in a specific social network, few publications systematically study the generalization of the problem of inferring social ties over multiple heterogeneous networks. In this work, we develop a framework for classifying the type of social relationships by learning across heterogeneous networks. The framework incorporates social theories into a factor graph model, which effectively improves the accuracy of inferring the type of social relationships in a target network by borrowing knowledge from a different source network. Our empirical study on five different genres of networks validates the effectiveness of the proposed framework. For example, by leveraging information from a coauthor network with labeled advisor-advisee relationships, the proposed framework is able to obtain an F1-score of 90% (8-28% improvements over alternative methods) for inferring manager-subordinate relationships in an enterprise email network.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 38, 'citationCount': 296, 'journal': {'pages': '743-752'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Tang2012InferringST,\n author = {Jie Tang and Tiancheng Lou and J.

Those who are exposed are significantly more likely to spread information, and do so sooner than those who are not exposed. We further examine the relative role of strong and weak ties in information propagation. We show that, although stronger ties are individually more influential, it is the more abundant weak ties who are responsible for the propagation of novel information.

As with face-to-face meetings, Internet exchanges may not only include factual information but also emotional information – how participants feel about the subject discussed or other group members. Emotions in turn are known to be important in affecting interaction partners in offline communication in many ways. Could emotions in Internet exchanges affect others and systematically influence quantitative and qualitative aspects of the trajectory of e-communities? The development of automatic sentiment analysis has made large scale emotion detection and analysis possible using text messages collected from the web. However, it is not clear if emotions in e-communities primarily derive from individual group members' personalities or if they result from intra-group interactions, and whether they influence group activities. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, for the first time, we show the collective character of affective phenomena on a large scale as observed in four million posts downloaded from Blogs, Digg and BBC forums. To test whether the emotions of a community member may influence the emotions of others, posts were grouped into clusters of messages with similar emotional valences. The frequency of long clusters was much higher than it would be if emotions occurred at random. Distributions for cluster lengths can be explained by preferential processes because conditional probabilities for consecutive messages grow as a power law with cluster length. For BBC forum threads, average discussion lengths were higher for larger values of absolute average emotional valence in the first ten comments and the average amount of emotion in messages fell during discussions. Conclusions/Significance Overall, our results prove that collective emotional states can be created and modulated via Internet communication and that emotional expressiveness is the fuel that sustains some e-communities."", 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 57, 'citationCount': 208, 'journal': {'volume': '6', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Chmiel2011CollectiveEO,\n author = {A.

The system shows an unusual dynamical transition between dominance of one disease and dominance of the other as a function of their relative rates of growth. Close to this transition the final outcomes show strong dependence on stochastic fluctuations in the early stages of growth, dependence that decreases with increasing network size, but does so sufficiently slowly as still to be easily visible in systems with millions or billions of individuals.

Since emotions play such an important role in human decision making, how online networks modulate human collective mood states has become a matter of considerable interest. In spite of the increasing societal importance of online social networks, it is unknown whether assortative mixing of psychological states takes place in situations where social ties are mediated solely by online networking services in the absence of physical contact. Here, we show that the general happiness, or subjective well-being (SWB), of Twitter users, as measured from a 6-month record of their individual tweets, is indeed assortative across the Twitter social network. Our results imply that online social networks may be equally subject to the social mechanisms that cause assortative mixing in real social networks and that such assortative mixing takes place at the level of SWB. Given the increasing prevalence of online social networks, their propensity to connect users with similar levels of SWB may be an important factor in how positive and negative sentiments are maintained and spread through human society.

However, due to its unique complexity, the mechanism of the diffusion in online social networks is different from the ones in other types of networks and remains unclear to us. Meanwhile, few works have been done to reveal the coupled dynamics of both the structure and the diffusion of online social networks. To this end, in this paper, we propose a model to investigate how the structure is coupled with the diffusion in online social networks from the view of weak ties. Through numerical experiments on large-scale online social networks, we find that in contrast to some previous research results, selecting weak ties preferentially to republish cannot make the information diffuse quickly, while random selection can achieve this goal. However, when we remove the weak ties gradually, the coverage of the information will drop sharply even in the case of random selection. We also give a reasonable explanation for this by extra analysis and experiments. Finally, we conclude that weak ties play a subtle role in the information diffusion in online social networks. On one hand, they act as bridges to connect isolated local communities together and break through the local trapping of the information. On the other hand, selecting them as preferential paths to republish cannot help the information spread further in the network. As a result, weak ties might be of use in the control of the virus spread and the private information diffusion in real-world applications.', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 24, 'citationCount': 128, 'journal': {'volume': '82 1 Pt 2', 'pages': '\n          016105\n        ', 'name': 'Physical review.

As a consequence, the attention capacities and processing abilities of individuals often saturate.

Moreover, recent work shows that individuals are naturally attracted by what other people are interested in. This imitative behaviour gives rise to various herding phenomena, such as the spread of ideas or the outbreak of commercial trends, turning the understanding of collective attention an important issue of our society. In this article, we propose an individual-based model of collective attention. In a situation where a group of people is facing a steady flow of novel information, the model naturally reproduces the log-normal distribution of the attention each news item receives, in agreement with empirical observations. Furthermore, the model predicts that the popularity of a news item strongly depends on the number of concurrent news appearing at approximately the same moment. We confirmed this prediction by means of empirical data extracted from the website digg.com. This result can be interpreted from the point of view of competition between the news for the limited attention capacity of individuals.

In this paper, we study the efficient influence maximization from two complementary directions. One is to improve the original greedy algorithm of [5] and its improvement [7] to further reduce its running time, and the second is to propose new degree discount heuristics that improves influence spread. We evaluate our algorithms by experiments on two large academic collaboration graphs obtained from the online archival database arXiv.org. Our experimental results show that (a) our improved greedy algorithm achieves better running time comparing with the improvement of [7] with matching influence spread, (b) our degree discount heuristics achieve much better influence spread than classic degree and centrality-based heuristics, and when tuned for a specific influence cascade model, it achieves almost matching influence thread with the greedy algorithm, and more importantly (c) the degree discount heuristics run only in milliseconds while even the improved greedy algorithms run in hours in our experiment graphs with a few tens of thousands of nodes.\n Based on our results, we believe that fine-tuned heuristics may provide truly scalable solutions to the influence maximization problem with satisfying influence spread and blazingly fast running time. Therefore, contrary to what implied by the conclusion of [5] that traditional heuristics are outperformed by the greedy approximation algorithm, our results shed new lights on the research of heuristic algorithms.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 13, 'citationCount': 2096, 'journal': {'pages': '199-208'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Chen2009EfficientIM,\n author = {Wei Chen and Yajun Wang and Siyu Yang},\n pages = {199-208},\n title = {Efficient influence maximization in social networks},\n year = {2009}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': None, 'name': 'Wei Chen'}, {'authorId': '2115646925', 'name': 'Yajun Wang'}, {'authorId': '2108974485', 'name': 'Siyu Yang'}]}, {'paperId': '4a2aa332717c803a104d3684e2eafae1cc31f23e', 'title': 'Gesundheit!

While reasonable under some conditions, this assumption may not hold for social media networks, where user engagement is high and information may enter a system from multiple disconnected sources. Using a dataset of 262,985 Facebook Pages and their associated fans, this paper provides an empirical investigation of diffusion through a large social media network. Although Facebook diffusion chains are often extremely long (chains of up to 82 levels have been observed), they are not usually the result of a single chain-reaction event. Rather, these diffusion chains are typically started by a substantial number of users. Large clusters emerge when hundreds or even thousands of short diffusion chains merge together. This paper presents an analysis of these diffusion chains using zero-inflated negative binomial regressions. We show that after controlling for distribution effects, there is no meaningful evidence that a start node’s maximum diffusion chain length can be predicted with the user's demographics or Facebook usage characteristics (including the user's number of Facebook friends). This may provide insight into future research on public opinion formation.\n \n"", 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 21, 'citationCount': 253, 'journal': {'name': 'Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Sun2009GesundheitMC,\n author = {Eric Sun and Itamar Rosenn and Cameron A.

Recently, motivated by the design of viral marketing strategies, Domingos and Richardson posed a fundamental algorithmic problem for such social network processes: if we can try to convince a subset of individuals to adopt a new product or innovation, and the goal is to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions, which set of individuals should we target?We consider this problem in several of the most widely studied models in social network analysis. The optimization problem of selecting the most influential nodes is NP-hard here, and we provide the first provable approximation guarantees for efficient algorithms. Using an analysis framework based on submodular functions, we show that a natural greedy strategy obtains a solution that is provably within 63% of optimal for several classes of models; our framework suggests a general approach for reasoning about the performance guarantees of algorithms for these types of influence problems in social networks.We also provide computational experiments on large collaboration networks, showing that in addition to their provable guarantees, our approximation algorithms significantly out-perform node-selection heuristics based on the well-studied notions of degree centrality and distance centrality from the field of social networks.', 'year': 2003, 'referenceCount': 45, 'citationCount': 8024, 'journal': {'pages': '137-146'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Kempe2003MaximizingTS,\n author = {D.

Design Longitudinal social network analysis. Setting Framingham Heart Study social network. Participants 4739 individuals followed from 1983 to 2003. Main outcome measures Happiness measured with validated four item scale; broad array of attributes of social networks and diverse social ties. Results Clusters of happy and unhappy people are visible in the network, and the relationship between people’s happiness extends up to three degrees of separation (for example, to the friends of one’s friends’ friends). People who are surrounded by many happy people and those who are central in the network are more likely to become happy in the future. Longitudinal statistical models suggest that clusters of happiness result from the spread of happiness and not just a tendency for people to associate with similar individuals. A friend who lives within a mile (about 1.6 km) and who becomes happy increases the probability that a person is happy by 25% (95% confidence interval 1% to 57%). Similar effects are seen in coresident spouses (8%, 0.2% to 16%), siblings who live within a mile (14%, 1% to 28%), and next door neighbours (34%, 7% to 70%). Effects are not seen between coworkers. The effect decays with time and with geographical separation. Conclusions People’s happiness depends on the happiness of others with whom they are connected.

In the past years, the main focus of research in mobile services has aimed at the anytime, anywhere principle (ubiquitous computing). However, there is more to it than that. The increasing demand for distributed problem solving led to the development of multi-agent systems. The latter are formed from a collection of independent software entities whose collective skills can be applied in complex and real-time domains. The target of such systems is to demonstrate how goal-directed, robust and optimal behavior can arise from interactions between individual autonomous intelligent software agents. These software entities exhibit characteristics like autonomy, responsiveness, pro-activeness and social ability. Their functionality and effectiveness has proven to be highly dependent on the design and development of the application domain or context. Context is the set of suitable environmental states and settings concerning a user, which is relevant for a situation-sensitive application in the process of adapting the services and information offered to the user. Agent technology seems to be the right technology to offer the possibility of exploring the dynamic context of the user in order to provide value-added services or to execute more and complex tasks. In this respect, agent-based ubiquitous computing can benefit from marrying the agent-based technology with the extensive use of distributed functionality, to be deployed for lightweight devices. It also enables the combination of ubiquity and intelligence in different application areas and enables to approach multiple research topics in computer science, artificial intelligence and engineering from a new perspective.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 26, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'pages': '216-216', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Mangina2009AgentbasedUC,\n author = {E.

A mesolevel network is a social network that differs in three important respects from interpersonal microlevel networks directly linking prior and potential adopters of a practice to one another: (1) it is generated by a different causal process than the microlevel network; (2) it tends to be much sparser than the microlevel network; and (3) the typical edge of a mesolevel network bridges much longer sociometric and geographic distances than the typical edge of a microlevel network. These types of mesolevel networks are important because they can dramatically influence the speed at which a contagious practice will diffuse. The mesolevel network focused upon in this article is the network that emerged out of the travel routes of political agitators affiliated with the Social Democratic Party. Computational modeling shows that the diffusion of the Social Democratic Party is likely to have been considerably influenced by the structure of this network. Empirical analyses of the founding of party organizations during the period 1894–1911 support these theoretical predictions and suggest that this mesolevel network was of considerable importance for the diffusion of the Swedish Social Democratic Party.', 'year': 2000, 'referenceCount': 49, 'citationCount': 242, 'journal': {'volume': '106', 'pages': '145 - 172', 'name': 'American Journal of Sociology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Hedström2000MesolevelNA,\n author = {P.

This article discusses the time-scale analysis problem in feature extraction for emotional speech processing. We describe a computational framework for combining segmental and supra-segmental features for emotional speech detection. The statistical fusion is based on the estimation of local a posteriori class probabilities and the overall decision employs weighting factors directly related to the duration of the individual speech segments. This strategy is applied to a real-world application: detection of Italian motherese in authentic and longitudinal parent-infant interaction at home. The results suggest that short- and long-term infor- mation, respectively, represented by the short-term spec- trum and the prosody parameters (fundamental frequency and energy) provide a robust and efficient time-scale analysis. A similar fusion methodology is also investigated by the use of a phonetic-specific characterization process. This strategy is motivated by the fact that there are varia- tions across emotional states at the phoneme level. A time- scale based on both vowels and consonants is proposed and it provides a relevant and discriminant feature space for acted emotion recognition. The experimental results on two different databases Berlin (German) and Aholab (Basque) show that the best performance are obtained by our pho- neme-dependent approach. These findings demonstrate the relevance of taking into account phoneme dependency (vowels/consonants) for emotional speech characterization.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 45, 'citationCount': 1, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Chetouani2009AppliedTH,\n author = {M.

In a series of imaging studies we have described a minimal neural architecture for imitation. This architecture comprises a brain region that codes an early visual description of the action to be imitated, a second region that codes the detailed motor specification of the action to be copied, and a third region that codes the goal of the imitated action. Neural signals predicting the sensory consequences of the planned imitative action are sent back to the brain region coding the early visual description of the imitated action, for monitoring purposes (""my planned action is like the one I have just seen""). The three brain regions forming this minimal neural architecture belong to a part of the cerebral cortex called perisylvian, a critical cortical region for language. This suggests that the neural mechanisms implementing imitation are also used for other forms of human communication, such as language. Indeed, imaging data on warping of chimpanzee brains onto human brains indicate that the largest expansion between the two species is perisylvian. Functional similarities between the structure of actions and the structure of language as it unfolds during conversation reinforce this notion. Additional data suggest also that empathy occurs via the minimal neural architecture for imitation interacting with regions of the brain relevant to emotion. All in all, we come to understand others via imitation, and imitation shares functional mechanisms with language and empathy.', 'year': 2002, 'referenceCount': 73, 'citationCount': 186, 'journal': None, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Iacoboni2002UnderstandingOI,\n author = {M.

The goal is to help those interested in constructing more realistic software agents for use in simulations, in virtual reality environments, and in training and performance aiding settings such as on the web or in embedded applications. This paper pursues this goal by providing a framework for better integrating the theories and models contained in the diverse human behavior modeling literatures, such as those that straddle physiological, cognitive and emotive processes; individual differences; emergent group and crowd behavior; and (punctuated) equilibria in social settings. The framework is based on widely available ontologies of world values and how these and physiological factors might be construed emotively into subjective expected utilities to guide the reactions and deliberations of agents. For example what makes one set of opponent groups differ from another? This framework serves as an extension of Markov decision processes appropriate for iterative play in game-theoretic settings, with particular emphasis on agent capabilities for redefining drama and for finding meta-games to counter the human player. This article presents the derivation of the framework and some initial results and lessons learned about integrating behavioral models into interactive dramas and meta-games that stimulate (systemic) thought and training doctrine.

Agents have rudimentary personalities, including an interpretive component which causes them to construe the world in idiosyncratic ways leading to emotional states, and an expressive component which give agents a unique profile for manifesting their emotions. Agents keep internal models of the concerns of other agents which allow them to explain the emotional episodes of other agents by classifying them as instances in which one or more of the twenty-four emotion types arise. \nThe implementation is simulation-based. It has been run with up to forty agents at a time. Situations arise in the modeled world, agents respond to some of these in their own unique, emotional, ways.

Self-Attachment is an alternative form of therapy intended to assist individuals so they can regulate their emotional state through developing and maintaining a bond with their childhood self. In this project, we create a chatbot to suggest Self-Attachment protocols based on a user’s emotion and description of recent events leading to that emotion. The chatbot will assist in the scaling of the delivery of Self-Attachment protocols. We utilise a rule-based model within this chatbot to determine which suggestions should be presented to users and ensure that dialogue presented to users is safe and fully controllable to avoid the possibility of harming the user through potentially harmful dialogue being presented by the model. We discuss a trial of the chatbot we performed with 9 participants from the non-clinical population with prior knowledge of Self-Attachment protocols, which shows the chatbot can provide suitable suggestions for Self-Attachment protocols. The chatbot is evaluated by 3 clinicians who had not previously practised Self-Attachment protocols. We also discuss a survey produced during this project, where users were asked to rewrite prompts to be more empathetic. We discuss how it has contributed to the formation of a dataset that can be utilised to enhance the chatbot’s responses to be more empathetic and engaging.",2021,48,2,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{None,\n title = {Evaluation of a Virtual Agent in Guiding Users from the Non-Clinical Population in Self-Attachment Intervention},\n year = {2021}\n}\n'}",[],"[{'paperId': '5f110c3a0c22ec1245b6abcb84a142faa9925c8b', 'title': 'An Empathetic AI Coach for Self-Attachment Therapy'}, {'paperId': '20c3d9ab04cc01e605ebc2b656c573d75d3133fb', 'title': 'A deep-learning assisted empathetic guide for self-attachment therapy'}]","[{'paperId': '2e4ca3d95ffb83870661dd66deee143e782f0706', 'title': 'Curious Case of Language Generation Evaluation Metrics: A Cautionary Tale', 'abstract': 'Automatic evaluation of language generation systems is a well-studied problem in Natural Language Processing.

In this paper, we first propose and evaluate plug-and-play methods for controllable response generation, which does not require dialogue specific datasets and does not rely on fine-tuning a large model.

However, coding patient language is a resource-intensive exercise and difficult to perform at scale. Our aim was to develop a deep learning model to automatically identify patient utterances during text-based internet-enabled Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and to determine the association between utterances and clinical outcomes. Method: Using 340 manually annotated transcripts we trained a deep learning model to categorize patient utterances into one or more of five categories. The model was used to automatically code patient utterances from our entire data set of transcripts (∼34,000 patients), and logistic regression analyses used to determine the association between both reliable improvement and engagement, and patient responses. Results: Our model reached human-level agreement on three of the five patient categories. Regression analyses revealed that increased counter change-talk (movement away from change) was associated with lower odds of both reliable improvement and engagement, while increased change-talk (movement towards change or self-exploration) was associated with increased odds of improvement and engagement. Conclusions: Deep learning provides an effective means of automatically coding patient utterances at scale. This approach enables the development of a data-driven understanding of the relationship between therapist and patient during therapy.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 36, 'citationCount': 19, 'journal': {'volume': '31', 'pages': '300 - 312', 'name': 'Psychotherapy Research'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Ewbank2020UnderstandingTR,\n author = {M.

With the progress in natural language processing (NLP), extracting valuable information from biomedical literature has gained popularity among researchers, and deep learning has boosted the development of effective biomedical text mining models. However, directly applying the advancements in NLP to biomedical text mining often yields unsatisfactory results due to a word distribution shift from general domain corpora to biomedical corpora. In this article, we investigate how the recently introduced pre-trained language model BERT can be adapted for biomedical corpora. Results We introduce BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining), which is a domain-specific language representation model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical corpora. With almost the same architecture across tasks, BioBERT largely outperforms BERT and previous state-of-the-art models in a variety of biomedical text mining tasks when pre-trained on biomedical corpora. While BERT obtains performance comparable to that of previous state-of-the-art models, BioBERT significantly outperforms them on the following three representative biomedical text mining tasks: biomedical named entity recognition (0.62% F1 score improvement), biomedical relation extraction (2.80% F1 score improvement) and biomedical question answering (12.24% MRR improvement).

Objective The objective of the study was to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a fully automated conversational agent to deliver a self-help program for college students who self-identify as having symptoms of anxiety and depression. Methods In an unblinded trial, 70 individuals age 18-28 years were recruited online from a university community social media site and were randomized to receive either 2 weeks (up to 20 sessions) of self-help content derived from CBT principles in a conversational format with a text-based conversational agent (Woebot) (n=34) or were directed to the National Institute of Mental Health ebook, “Depression in College Students,” as an information-only control group (n=36). All participants completed Web-based versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale at baseline and 2-3 weeks later (T2). Results Participants were on average 22.2 years old (SD 2.33), 67% female (47/70), mostly non-Hispanic (93%, 54/58), and Caucasian (79%, 46/58). Participants in the Woebot group engaged with the conversational agent an average of 12.14 (SD 2.23) times over the study period. No significant differences existed between the groups at baseline, and 83% (58/70) of participants provided data at T2 (17% attrition). Intent-to-treat univariate analysis of covariance revealed a significant group difference on depression such that those in the Woebot group significantly reduced their symptoms of depression over the study period as measured by the PHQ-9 (F=6.47; P=.01) while those in the information control group did not. In an analysis of completers, participants in both groups significantly reduced anxiety as measured by the GAD-7 (F1,54= 9.24; P=.004). Participants’ comments suggest that process factors were more influential on their acceptability of the program than content factors mirroring traditional therapy.

Contrary to rule- or template-based domain-specific dialog systems, open-domain conversation usually requires data-driven approaches, which can be roughly divided into two categories: retrieval-based and generation-based systems. Retrieval systems search a user-issued utterance (called a query) in a large database, and return a reply that best matches the query. Generative approaches, typically based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), can synthesize new replies, but they suffer from the problem of generating short, meaningless utterances. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based dialog systems in the open domain. In our approach, the retrieved candidate, in addition to the original query, is fed to an RNN-based reply generator, so that the neural model is aware of more information.

The underlying ideas include findings and paradigms in developmental psychology and neuroscience, neuroplasticity and long term term potentiation, fMRI studies on human bond making and religious experience, and experiments in energy based artificial neural networks. The proposed self-attachment therapeutic technique is distinguished by its intervention to create an internal and passionate affectional bond within the individual between the “adult self”, representing the logical and cognitive faculty, and the “inner child”, representing the unregulated and undeveloped emotional circuits. The aim is to create more optimal circuits for emotional regulation. The proposed self-attachment protocols internally emulate within the individual the interactions of a good enough primary care-giver and child in order to moderate the child's arousal level, minimise its negative affects and maximize its positive affects. These interactions are assumed, in developmental neuroscience and in developmental psychology, to be the basis of secure attachment of children with their parents, which leads to an optimal regulation of neurotransmitters, hormones, and the emotional dynamics of the individual. We report on several case studies of this technique in recent years. Finally, we propose a simple mathematical model to capture the impact of self-attachment protocols using the notion of strong patterns in energy based neural networks and employ a recently developed mathematical model to examine the impact of self-attachment using emotional and cognitive neural pathways for decision making."", 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 71, 'citationCount': 19, 'journal': {'pages': '1-8', 'name': '2015 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Edalat2015IntroductionTS,\n author = {A.

The flexibility of the model allows us to apply it to tasks as diverse as (synthetic) question answering [22] and to language modeling.

Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster.

For more realistic multi-agent systems in simulations of emergency evacuations, it is important to incorporate emotions and their effects on the agents. In few words, emotional contagion is a process in which a person or group influences the emotions or behavior of another person or group through the conscious or unconscious induction of emotion states and behavioral attitudes. In this study, we simulate an emergency situation in an open square area with three exits considering Adults and Children agents with different behavior. Also, Security agents are considered in order to guide Adults and Children for finding the exits and be calm. Six levels of emotion levels are considered for each agent in different scenarios and situations. The agent-based simulated model initialize with the random scattering of agent populations and then when an alarm occurs, each agent react to the situation based on its and neighbors current circumstances. The main goal of each agent is firstly to find the exit, and then help other agents to find their ways. Numbers of exited agents along with their emotion levels and damaged agents are compared in different scenarios with different initialization in order to evaluate the achieved results of the simulated model.

The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle systems, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the ""animator."" The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.', 'year': 1987, 'referenceCount': 42, 'citationCount': 8228, 'journal': {'name': 'Seminal graphics: pioneering efforts that shaped the field'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Reynolds1987FlocksHA,\n author = {Craig W.

This includes lane formation in corridors and oscillations at bottlenecks in normal situations, while different kinds of blocked states are produced in panic situations. By means of molecular-dynamic-like microsimulations based on a generalized force model of interactive pedestrian dynamics, the spatio-temporal patterns in pedestrian crowds are successfully reproduced and interpreted as self-organized phenomena. In contrast to previous socio-psychological approaches, this allows a physical understanding of the observations. Despite the significantly different phenomena occuring in normal and panic situations, the main effects can be described by a unified model containing only well interpretable and plausible terms. The transition between the “rational” normal behavior and the apparently “irrational” panic behavior is controlled by a single parameter, the “nervousness”, which influences fluctuation strengths, desired speeds, and the tendency of herding. Thereby, it causes paradoxial effects like “freezing by heating”, “faster is slower”, and the ignorance of available exits. Nevertheless, there are measures to improve pedestrian flows, both in normal and panic situations. For example, the suitable placement of columns can help, although they reduce the accessible space.', 'year': 2002, 'referenceCount': 158, 'citationCount': 933, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'pages': '21-58', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Helbing2002SimulationOP,\n author = {D.

However, for the most part, the effect of different types of agents on the human brain is unknown, and the neuroscience of human-agent interactions is rarely studied. In this study, we examine the underlying neural systems involved in processing and responding to different types of negotiating agents. More specifically, we show that different brain patterns are observed for various types of virtual agents; consequently, we can decode the strategy and emotional display of the agent based on the counterpart’s brain activity. Using fMRI data, we analyzed participants’ brain activity during negotiations with agents who show three different emotional expressions and use two different types of negotiation strategies. We demonstrate that, using Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis, we can reliably decode agents’ emotional expressions based on the activity in the left dorsal anterior insula, and also agents’ strategies based on the activity in the frontal pole.",2017,28,1,"{'name': 'Cognitive Science', 'volume': ''}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Kim2017DecodingVA,\n author = {Eunkyung Kim and Sarah I.

We identified 3 insular subregions with distinct patterns of connectivity: a posterior region, functionally connected with primary and secondary somatomotor cortices; a dorsal anterior to middle region, connected with dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, along with other regions of a previously described control network; and a ventral anterior region, primarily connected with pregenual anterior cingulate cortex. Applying these regions to a separate task data set, we found that dorsal and ventral anterior insula responded selectively to disgusting images, while posterior insula did not.

Emotions, such as anger and happiness, affect concession-making, not only in human vs. human negotiations but also in human vs. agent negotiations. Recent research has demonstrated the impact of emotional expressions in morally-charged negotiations. Thus, taking people’s moral concerns into account is crucial for building agents that operate in morally sensitive domains. This paper explores the interplay between people’s moral concerns, emotional expressions and concession-making during a morally charged negotiation. Our results demonstrate that participants who had stronger concerns for the Individualizing foundations (Harm and Fairness) make greater concessions for sacred negotiation items when faced with a sad opponent than an angry opponent. Also, we find that participants who had high Binding foundations (In-group, Authority and Purity) are more sensitive to social status, and make greater concessions in scenarios that involve agents in a higher social status. Keywords: Emotion; Moral Foundations Theory; Sacred values; Negotiation; Agent Modeling. Introduction With the growing interest in understanding the role of emotional expressions in negotiation (e.g., Barry, Fulmer & Goates, 2006; Van Kleef et al., 2010), many studies have investigated how emotional expression affects negotiation processes and outcomes (Ames & Johar, 2009; Choi et al., 2012; de Melo et al., 2014). For instance, negotiators concede more when their opponent expresses anger instead of happiness (Van Kleef, De Dreu & Manstead, 2004a, 2004b). Sinaceur & Tiedens (2006) further reveal that the effect of anger on concession works only when anger recipients have poor alternatives. The past works on emotional expression suggest that emotion plays an important role as a signal (e.g., anger indicates a negotiator’s dissatisfaction with his opponent’s offer). Furthermore, negotiators respond to emotional expressions depending on their own conditions (e.g., alternatives). Thus, it is important to understand what moderates a negotiator’s reaction to emotional expression. Past studies have shown that positive moods in negotiation foster concession-making (e.g., Carnevale & Isen, 1986). Mood effects may be mediated by expression of positive emotion, for example, a positive-mood induction procedure may lead negotiators to smile more and this smiling may have an impact on perceptions and concession- making. Regardless, the possible interaction of emotion and other variables, for example, cognition as in decision frame (Carnevale, 2008), or motivation as in moral concerns, is a domain highly worthy of inquiry. Although some studies have tried to understand how people’s innate personality interacts with their emotion during negotiation games (Bolton, Katok, & Zwick, 1998; Batson & Moran, 1999), little research has paid attention to how moral concerns impact reactions to emotional expressions and affect concession-making. Our recent research demonstrates that emotional expressions can potentially shift moral concerns during a negotiation, such that displays of anger would backfire if the negotiator associates moral significance to the objects of the negotiation, whereas displays of sadness promote higher concession-making (Dehghani, Gratch and Carnevale, 2012). Because morality significantly influences decision- making (e.g., Sjoberg & Winroth, 1986; Gintis et al., 2003), the present research aims to examine the role of people’s moral concerns on how they react to emotional expressions and make concessions. Adapting the Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt & Graham, 2007; Haidt & Joseph, 2007; Graham, 2013), we examine effects of two different types of foundations (i.e., Individualizing foundations and Binding foundations) on concession-making. We predict that people who have stronger Individualizing foundations would react more to emotional expressions because the Individualizing foundations indicate the tendency to care about other people’s emotions (whether others are emotionally or physically suffering, or being treated fairly) and therefore, that would effect their concession-making. On the other hand, we predict that people with stronger Binding foundations be more sensitive to their negotiation partner’s social status because Binding foundations indicate concern about other people’s roles in the group (whether negotiation partner is their boss or co-worker). Understanding the interaction between moral concerns and emotion are crucial in designing autonomous decision- making agents that operate in morally sensitive domains. Progress in agent research has enabled us to work closely with software agents in morally sensitive situations where agents’ actions may lead to significant results, such as loss of life (Tambe, 2011; Dehghani et al., 2013). Therefore, it is important to better understand the interactions between people’s moral concerns, emotion and agent decision- making strategies. Our results suggest that incorporating', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 26, 'citationCount': 4, 'journal': {'volume': '36', 'name': 'Cognitive Science'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Kim2014EffectsOM,\n author = {Eunkyung Kim and Morteza Dehghani and Y.

In social psychology, rapport is described as the establishment of a positive relationship among interaction partners by rapidly detecting and responding to each other’s nonverbal behavior (Gratch et al., 2007a). This includes displaying behaviors that indicate positive emotions (such as head nods and smiles), showing mutual attentiveness (such as mutual gaze) and certain coordination behaviors (such as postural mimicry and synchronized movement) (Tickle-Degnan & Rosenthal, 1990). Niewiadomski et al. (2010) reports that when an agent displays appropriate and socially adapted emotional expressions, he is perceived as more human-like than an agent that shows human expressions which are inappropriate or not socially adapted. Garau et al. (2005) conducted a study showing that only participants who interacted with an agent that was responsive to their movements, experienced a sense of personal contact with the agent which influenced them to behave more socially considerate as opposed to interacting with a static or moving but unresponsive agent. This indicates that rapport is an important feature in order for the agent to be perceived as human-like and for any social effects, such as social facilitation, to occur. Previous research on social facilitation/inhibition illustrates how the presence of others affects an individuals’ task performance either positively or negatively (Guerin & Innes, 1982; Zanjonc, 1965; Sanders, Baron & Moore, 1978). Whether or not similar facilitation/inhibition effects occur in presence of virtual agents has been subject to several studies. Rickenberg and Reeves (2000) found that tasks are facilitated or inhibited by the “social” presence of a virtual agent. A study by Zanbaka et al. (2004) indicates that when asked to perform a task, participants reacted similarly to the presence of a virtual agent as they would have in the presence of another human. A follow-up study by Zanbaka et al. (2007) demonstrates that the presence of a virtual agent inhibits the performance of participants on a mathematical task. The limitation of this study was that the sample consisted of only female participants being confronted with an agent of matching gender. Hayes et al. (2010) found a similar decrease in performance with regard Abstract The purpose of the present research is to investigate whether virtual agents can help enhance participants’ performance, effort and motivation in mathematics. We hypothesize that a minimal amount behavioral realism induced by display of rapport is necessary for any social effects to occur in human- computer interaction. Further, we examine whether social facilitation effects occur depending on the gender of the participants and the interacting virtual agents. In a 2x2 between subjects design, participants interacted with a male or female virtual agent that either displayed rapport or no rapport. Our results confirm that gender plays a role when interacting with virtual agents that are capable of establishing rapport. Participants’ performance and effort were significantly enhanced when interacting with an agent of opposite gender that displayed rapport . Our results have implications on designing agents for education and training purposes. Keywords: social facilitation, STEM, rapport, virtual agents Introduction There is considerable interest in factors that enhance science and math performance. Recently, there has been an upsurge of interest in educational technology that exploits social and motivational factors that enhance math performance in general, and reduce gender inequality in particular (Kim, 2004; Baylor & Ryu, 2003). This work builds on the phenomena that people often treat computers as social actors. Therefore, psychological factors that improve people's performance in traditional face-to-face settings can be simulated by technologies in form of virtual learning companions or virtual instructors. In this paper, we seek to address two related goals. First, we aim to show that certain social psychological phenomena can enhance math performance in a human-computer setting. Specifically, we show that a form of social facilitation can improve performance on standardized math tests. Second, we seek to provide further evidence that people do treat computers as social actors and help elucidate the design principles that foster this effect. We specifically demonstrate that virtual agents must possess a minimum level of behavioral realism to achieve any social effects."", 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 22, 'citationCount': 21, 'journal': {'volume': '34', 'name': 'Cognitive Science'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': ""@Article{Karacora2012TheIO,\n author = {Bilge Karacora and Morteza Dehghani and Nicole Krämer-Mertens and J.

 The development of virtual enterprise is inseparable from the support of partners. Due to information asymmetry, the choice of virtual enterprise partners is blind, and simple matching formula is difficult to meet. At the same time, the psychology of the matching subject is based on the maximization of its own interests rather than the maximization of collective interests. There are interest contradictions and conflicts between subjects, and they may eventually fall into a “prisoner's dilemma”. Therefore, how to carry out the research on emotion regulation based on multi-agent heterogeneous game preference and bilateral partner preference is very important.
 
 
 
 Aiming at the contradictions and interest conflicts between subjects in the process of virtual enterprise partner matching, combined with the basic characteristics of subject language preference evaluation, the game idea is introduced into the process of virtual enterprise partner bilateral matching analysis, a bilateral matching game model of heterogeneous multi-attribute preference and subjects' psychological behavior is proposed, and the influence of the changes of subjects' psychological behavior on the evolution law of bilateral matching game system is analyzed, The Nash equilibrium strategy of bilateral matching is discussed. In order to verify the impact of the algorithm on emotion, this study uses relevant scales to investigate. (1) Positive emotion scale. The Panas emotion scale developed by Watson et al. Is widely used to measure emotion. The scale includes two dimensions: positive emotion and negative emotion. There are 6 questions in this dimension, and Likert scores 5 points (1 means “very inconsistent”, 5 means “very consistent”, the same below). The Cronbach coefficient of this questionnaire is 0.90. (2) Motivation. The problem of measuring motivation is mainly the motivation scale compiled by Phan, which has 8 questions and is scored with Likert 5 points. (3) Social support scale. The scale is adapted from the social support scale compiled by Ye Yuemei et al. It has eight questions, using Likert's five points scoring method. Clonbach α the coefficient of the scale is 0.87. (4) Behavioral propensity scale. Propensity dimension in intention measurement. The scale has 6 questions, and Likert scores 5 points. The clonbach coefficient of the scale is 0.95.
 
 
 
 The results of case analysis show that the model can make full use of the multi-attribute preference information of heterogeneous subjects, describe the mechanism of psychological behavior affecting the evolution of game system, and help virtual enterprises match business partners; This has important value and significance for the establishment of virtual enterprises and their industrial agglomeration effect. In the influence process of cooperative anxiety, emotional response plays an intermediary role, psychological elasticity plays a regulatory role, and emotional response to life events plays an intermediary role. That is, the higher the psychological elasticity, the higher the excessive coping style of the game, and vice versa.
 
 
 
 Various stable matching solutions can be obtained by solving the model, and the conclusion is more suitable for the matching decision-making process of both parties in the actual process, which makes the model can be applied to various scenarios, such as the selection of battery suppliers of new energy vehicles and smart phone screen suppliers, which has greater practical value and significance. It should be pointed out that there are some deficiencies in the setting conditions of the model method, mainly because some individuals in the group cooperate to form an alliance, so as to form a community of interests. In the process of game, the individual experience in the group is constrained by more conditions, which makes the results of the model deviate.

Participants were presented with one of two virtual human conditions in a between-subjects experiment, static (non-animated) and dynamic (animated). Our objective measures included the use of psycho-physical Electro Dermal Activity (EDA) sensors, and subjective measures inspired by social psychology research included the Differential Emotions Survey (DES IV) and Positive and Negative Affect Survey (PANAS). We analyzed the quantitative and qualitative measures associated with participants' emotional state at four distinct time-steps in the simulated interpersonal experience as the virtual patient's medical condition deteriorated. Results suggest that participants in the dynamic condition with animations exhibited a higher sense of co-presence and greater emotional response as compared to participants in the static condition, corresponding to the deterioration in the medical condition of the virtual patient. Negative affect of participants in the dynamic condition increased at a higher rate than for participants in the static condition. The virtual human animations elicited a stronger response in negative emotions such as anguish, fear, and anger as the virtual patient's medical condition worsened.",2014,29,48,"{'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics', 'pages': '626-635', 'volume': '20'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wu2014EffectsOV,\n author = {Yanxiang Wu and Sabarish V.

Thus in this work, we perform three experiments to gain a better understanding of how motion editing might affect the emotional content of a captured performance, particularly changes in posture and dynamics, two factors shown to be important perceptual indicators of bodily emotions. In these studies, we analyse the properties (angles and velocities) and perception (recognition rates and perceived intensities) of a varied set of full-body motion clips representing the six emotions anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise.

Participants reactions were assessed using self-reported, behavioral, and physiological metrics. Participants who examined the virtual human experienced significantly more stress, measured via skin conductance. Participants stress was correlated with previous experience performing real prostate exams; participants who had performed more real prostate exams were more likely to experience stress while examining the virtual human. Participants who examined the virtual human showed signs of greater engagement; non-stressed participants performed better prostate exams while stressed participants treated the virtual human more realistically. Results indicated that stress evoked by virtual humans is linked to similar previous real-world stressful experiences, implying that learners real-world experience must be taken into account when using virtual humans to prepare them for stressful interpersonal experiences.', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 29, 'citationCount': 25, 'journal': {'volume': '19', 'pages': '662-670', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Robb2013LeveragingVH,\n author = {Andrew C.

For example, humans make greater concessions in negotiation to an opposing human who expresses anger, and they make fewer concessions to an opponent who expresses happiness, compared to a no-emotion-expression control. However, in AI, despite the wide interest in negotiation as a means to resolve differences between agents and humans, emotion has been largely ignored. This paper explores whether expression of anger or happiness by computer agents, in a multi-issue negotiation task, can produce effects that resemble effects seen in human-human negotiation. The paper presents an experiment where participants play with agents that express emotions (anger vs. happiness vs. control) through different modalities (text vs. facial displays). An important distinction in our experiment is that participants are aware that they negotiate with computer agents. The data indicate that the emotion effects observed in past work with humans also occur in agent-human negotiation, and occur independently of modality of expression. The implications of these results are discussed for the fields of automated negotiation, intelligent virtual agents and artificial intelligence.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 77, 'citationCount': 125, 'journal': {'pages': '937-944'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Melo2011TheEO,\n author = {C.

Rapid advances in performance capture and advanced rendering techniques have allowed the movie industry in particular to create characters that appear very human-like. However, with these new capabilities has come the realization that such characters are yet not quite “right.” One possible hypothesis is that these virtual humans fall into an “Uncanny Valley”, where the viewer's emotional response is repulsion or rejection, rather than the empathy or emotional engagement that their creators had hoped for. To explore these issues, we created three animated vignettes of an arguing couple with detailed motion for the face, eyes, hair, and body. In a set of perceptual experiments, we explore the relative importance of different anomalies using two different methods: a questionnaire to determine the emotional response to the full-length vignettes, with and without facial motion and audio; and a 2AFC (two alternative forced choice) task to compare the performance of a virtual “actor” in short clips (extracts from the vignettes) depicting a range of different facial and body anomalies.

We evaluated the performance of our device against a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved system for the measurement of EDA during physical, cognitive, as well as emotional stressors at both palmar and distal forearm sites, and found high correlations across all the tests. We also evaluated the choice of electrode material by comparing conductive fabric with Ag/AgCl electrodes and discuss the limitations found. An important result presented in this paper is evidence that the distal forearm is a viable alternative to the traditional palmar sites for EDA measurements.

Recent efforts in this domain havelooked for the modelling of emotional emergence and socialinteraction inside a crowd of virtual agents, but further investigation is still needed in aspects such as simulation of emotional awareness and emotion contagion. Also, in relation to perception of emotions, many questions remain about perception of emotional behaviour in the context of virtual crowds.This thesis investigates the current state-of-the-art of emotional characters in virtual crowds and presents the implementation of a computational model able to generate expressive full-body motion behaviour and emotion contagion in a crowd of virtual agents. Also, as a second part of the thesis, this project presents a perceptual study in which the perception of emotional behaviour is investigated in the context of virtual crowds. The results of this thesis reveal some interesting findings in relation to the perception and modelling of virtual crowds, including some relevant effectsin relation to the influence of emotional crowd behaviourin viewers, specially when virtual crowds are not the mainfocus of a particular scene.

Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in the emotion contagion phenomenon in order to model emerging group behaviour. \n \nStemming from works on multi-agent systems environments, we propose an architecture to manage both internal and external emotion dynamics. Emotions evolve in function of three influences: punctual events, temporal dynamics and external influences. In an embodied agent approach, the first is the responsibility of the agent's mind, the second of the agent's body, and the third of the environment. This functional architecture is then adapted to a multi-agent architecture, adding a control responsibility to the agent body. Finally, we show the results of several experiments to examine the properties of the architecture and its efficiency by comparing it to a full agent approach."", 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 27, 'citationCount': 22, 'journal': {'pages': '645-652'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Saunier2014MixedAD,\n author = {Julien Saunier and H.

The copying of aspects of the other's behavior, at different levels, seems central to establishing and maintaining such empathic connections.

This paper presents a perceptual study in which emotional gestures conducted by an actor were mapped onto synthesized versions generated by an embodied virtual agent. Copying is at the expressive level, where qualities such as the fluidity or expansiveness of gestures are considered, rather than exact low-level motion matching. Participants were later asked to rate the emotional content of video recordings of both the original and the synthesized gestures. A statistical analysis shows that, in most cases, participants associated the emotional content of the agent's gestures with that intended to be expressed by the original actor. The results suggest that a combination of the type of movement performed and its quality is important for successfully communicating emotions."", 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 55, 'citationCount': 52, 'journal': {'volume': '42', 'pages': '776-783', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Castellano2012ExpressiveCB,\n author = {Ginevra Castellano and M.

It is an interdisciplinary field spanning the computer sciences, psychology, and cognitive science. Affective computing is a rapidly developing field within industry and science. There is now a great drive to make technologies such as robotic systems, avatars in service-related human computer interaction, e-learning, game characters, or companion devices more marketable by endowing the 'soulless' robots or agents with the ability to recognize and adjust to the user's feelings as well as to be able to communicate appropriate emotional signals.A Blueprint for Affective Computing: A sourcebook and manual is the very first attempt to ground affective computing within the disciplines of psychology, affective neuroscience, and philosophy. This book illustrates the contributions of each of these disciplines to the development of the ever-growing field of affective computing. In addition, it demonstrates practical examples of cross-fertilization between disciplines in order to highlight the need for integration of computer science, engineering and the affective sciences.

Totally 214 color samples were evaluated on 12 emotion variables by subjects from seven different region groups in the psychophysical experiment. By factor analysis, it was found that three factors were sufficient to represent 80 11 ""region-emotion"" variables. For each variable, there is no distinct difference among different region groups. The 12 emotion variables could be divided into four categories, namely, activity index, potency index, definition index, and temperature index. Factor scores were further calculated to study the determinants on each factor. The analysis showed that the three factors were mainly related to chroma, lightness, and hue, respectively. It was concluded that chroma and lightness were the most important factors on color emotion, whereas the influences of hue and cultural background were very limited.

As a result of the manner in which partners perceive and behave toward one another, each person enjoys greater or lesser success at attaining his or her ideal-self goals. Affirmation of one another’s ideal-self goals yields diverse benefits, both personal and relational. The Michelangelo model and supportive empirical evidence are reviewed, the phenomenon is distinguished from related interpersonal processes, and directions for future work are outlined. KEYWORDS—Michelangelo phenomenon; interdependence; ideal self; relationships People have dreams and aspirations, or mental representations of the skills, traits, and resources that they ideally would like to acquire. These aspirations include diverse goals: People may want to acquire desirable traits such as warmth, confidence, or decisiveness; to achieve professional success in the form of advancement, peer respect, or financial benefits; or to advance important pursuits involving religion, travel, or athletics. Most explanations of how people acquire new skills, traits, and resources are intrapersonal, examining the individual in isolation (cf. Carver& Scheier, 1998). But granting that people sometimes achieve desirable goals through their own actions, this personcentric approach ignores the important role that close partners play in helping people achieve their dreams and aspirations. In the following pages we review theory and research regarding the ‘‘Michelangelo phenomenon,’’ one of the most prominent interpersonal models of how close partners promote versus inhibit each person’s pursuit of ideal self goals (Drigotas, Rusbult, Wieselquist, & Whitton, 1999). THE IDEAL SELF AND PARTNER AFFIRMATION Michelangelo Buonarroti described sculpting as a process whereby the artist releases an ideal figure from the block of stone in which it slumbers. The sculptor’s task is simply to chip away at the stone so as to reveal the ideal form (Gombrich, 1995). Figure 1 depicts one of Michelangelo’s unfinished captives, vividly illustrating this process. One can readily feel the force with which the ideal form strives to emerge from the stone, shedding its imperfections. The sculptor chisels, carves, and polishes the stone to reveal the ideal form slumbering within. Humans, too, possess ideal forms. The ideal self describes an individual’s dreams and aspirations, or the constellation of skills, traits, and resources that an individual ideally wishes to acquire (Higgins, 1987; Markus & Nurius, 1986). For example, Mary’s ideal self might include goals such as completing medical school, becoming more sociable, or learning to speak fluent Dutch. Whether images of the ideal self constitute vague yearnings or clearly articulated mental representations, dreams and aspirations serve a crucial function, providing direction to personal growth strivings and thereby helping people reduce the discrepancy between the actual self and the ideal self (Higgins, 1987). Although people sometimes achieve ideal-relevant goals solely through their own actions, the acquisition of new skills, traits, and resources is also shaped by interpersonal experience. People adapt to one another during the course of interaction, changing their behavior so as to coordinate with one another and respond to each person’s needs and expectations (Kelley et al., 2003). For example, John may help Mary become more sociable by subtly directing conversation during a dinner party, leading Mary to tell one of her most charming stories. Adaptation may transpire in interactions with diverse types of partner, including romantic partners, kin, friends, or colleagues. However, adaptation ismost probable, powerful, and enduring in highly interdependent relationships, in that the mutual dependence of close partners provides good opportunities for exerting strong, frequent, and benevolent influence across diverse behavioral domains (Kelley et al., 1983). Over time, adaptations that begin as temporary, interaction-specific adjustments become stable components of the self, such that over the course of extended interaction, close partners sculpt one another’s selves: People come to reflect what their partners ‘‘see in them’’ and ‘‘elicit from them’’ (Rusbult & Van Lange, 2003).

CURRENT DIRECTIONS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE Volume 18—Number 6 305 Copyright r 2009 Association for Psychological Science at Vrije Universiteit 34820 on November 24, 2010 cdp.sagepub.com Downloaded from Is such adaptation a good thing or a bad thing? The concept of partner affirmation describes whether the partner is an ally, neutral party, or foe in individual goal pursuits (Drigotas et al., 1999). As noted in Figure 2, affirmation has two components: Partner perceptual affirmation describes the extent to which a partner consciously or unconsciously perceives the target in ways that are compatible with the target’s ideal self. For example, Johnmay deliberately consider the character of Mary’s ideal self, consciously developing benevolent interpretations of disparities between her actual self and ideal self. Alternatively, if John and Mary possess similar life goals or values, John may rather automatically perceive and display faith in Mary’s ideal goal pursuits. Partner behavioral affirmation describes the extent to which a partner consciously or unconsciously behaves in ways that elicit ideal-congruent behaviors from the target. For example, John may rather automatically communicate confidence in Mary’s abilities, hemay consciously or unconsciously react in a positive manner when she enacts ideal congruent behaviors, or he may provide direct assistance in her goal pursuits. Of course, John may also disaffirm Mary by communicating indifference, pessimism, or disapproval, by undermining her ideal pursuits, or by affirming qualities that are antithetical to Mary’s ideal self. The model proposes that partner affirmation yields target movement toward the ideal self (see Fig. 2): Because John affirms Mary’s ideals, Mary increasingly comes to resemble her ideal self. Prior research has revealed good support for this claim. For example, in one study we videotaped married partners while they discussed a goal relevant to each person’s ideal self. Trained coders rated the extent to which the partner exhibited affirming behaviors (e.g., helped target clarify plans, offered assistance, or praised goal pursuits). Four months later, we asked targets whether they had achieved the goals they discussed in the conversations.Analyses revealed thatwhenpartnersweremoreaffirming during goal-relevant conversations, targets were more likely to achieve their ideal-self goals (Rusbult, Coolsen, et al., 2009). In another study we asked pairs of friends to provide complementary questionnaire data wherein (a) one friend served as ‘‘target,’’ rating his or her own experiences of partner affirmation and target movement (how affirming is your dating partner?; how successful are you at your goal pursuits?), and (b) the second friend served as ‘‘observer,’’ also rating partner affirmation and target movement (how affirming is the target’s dating partner?; how successful is the target at his or her goal pursuits?). Analyses revealed sizable across-friend associations—for example, when friends (as observers) described the target’s partner as highly affirming, individuals themselves (as targets) reported greater movement toward their ideal selves (Drigotas et al., 1999). Of what consequence is the Michelangelo phenomenon? Growth striving is a primary human motive (cf. Deci & Ryan, 2000)—a motive that is directly gratified by movement toward the ideal self. Accordingly, when a partner is affirming and a target moves closer to his or her ideals, the target enjoys enhanced personal well-being, including greater life satisfaction and psychological health (e.g., Drigotas, 2002). Moreover, when a partner serves as an ally in promoting target growth, the target enjoys enhanced couple well-being, including greater adjustment and probability of persistence (e.g., Drigotas et al., 1999; Kumashiro, Rusbult, Finkenauer, & Stocker, 2007). PARTNER AFFIRMATION AND RELATED INTERPERSONAL PROCESSES Partner Enhancement In what ways does partner affirmation differ from related interpersonal processes? To begin with, how does partner affirmation relate to partner enhancement, which describes the extent to which a partner perceives the target and behaves toward the target in ways that are more positive than may be ‘‘realistically’’ warranted—for example, in a manner that is more positive than the target perceives the self. Numerous studies have revealed that partner enhancement is beneficial to individuals and to relationships: For example, when partners perceive one another more positively than each person perceives himself or herself, relationships exhibit superior functioning (e.g.,Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 1996).

In particular, are positive partner thoughts and acts most helpful to the extent that they concern attributes that are part of the target’s ideal self?We conducted several studies to pit two forms of partner positivity against each other—normative positivity (general social desirability) versus ideal positivity (relevanc', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 20, 'citationCount': 260, 'journal': None, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Rusbult2009CurrentDI,\n author = {Caryl E.

Recent efforts in this domain havelooked for the modelling of emotional emergence and socialinteraction inside a crowd of virtual agents, but further investigation is still needed in aspects such as simulation of emotional awareness and emotion contagion. Also, in relation to perception of emotions, many questions remain about perception of emotional behaviour in the context of virtual crowds.This thesis investigates the current state-of-the-art of emotional characters in virtual crowds and presents the implementation of a computational model able to generate expressive full-body motion behaviour and emotion contagion in a crowd of virtual agents. Also, as a second part of the thesis, this project presents a perceptual study in which the perception of emotional behaviour is investigated in the context of virtual crowds. The results of this thesis reveal some interesting findings in relation to the perception and modelling of virtual crowds, including some relevant effectsin relation to the influence of emotional crowd behaviourin viewers, specially when virtual crowds are not the mainfocus of a particular scene.

Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in the emotion contagion phenomenon in order to model emerging group behaviour. \n \nStemming from works on multi-agent systems environments, we propose an architecture to manage both internal and external emotion dynamics. Emotions evolve in function of three influences: punctual events, temporal dynamics and external influences. In an embodied agent approach, the first is the responsibility of the agent's mind, the second of the agent's body, and the third of the environment. This functional architecture is then adapted to a multi-agent architecture, adding a control responsibility to the agent body.

The copying of aspects of the other's behavior, at different levels, seems central to establishing and maintaining such empathic connections. Yet, many questions remain unanswered, particularly how it is possible to reflect the same affective content back to the other when the actual motion itself is not exactly the same as theirs. This paper presents a perceptual study in which emotional gestures conducted by an actor were mapped onto synthesized versions generated by an embodied virtual agent. Copying is at the expressive level, where qualities such as the fluidity or expansiveness of gestures are considered, rather than exact low-level motion matching. Participants were later asked to rate the emotional content of video recordings of both the original and the synthesized gestures. A statistical analysis shows that, in most cases, participants associated the emotional content of the agent's gestures with that intended to be expressed by the original actor. The results suggest that a combination of the type of movement performed and its quality is important for successfully communicating emotions."", 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 55, 'citationCount': 52, 'journal': {'volume': '42', 'pages': '776-783', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Castellano2012ExpressiveCB,\n author = {Ginevra Castellano and M.

Totally 214 color samples were evaluated on 12 emotion variables by subjects from seven different region groups in the psychophysical experiment. By factor analysis, it was found that three factors were sufficient to represent 80 11 ""region-emotion"" variables. For each variable, there is no distinct difference among different region groups. The 12 emotion variables could be divided into four categories, namely, activity index, potency index, definition index, and temperature index. Factor scores were further calculated to study the determinants on each factor. The analysis showed that the three factors were mainly related to chroma, lightness, and hue, respectively. It was concluded that chroma and lightness were the most important factors on color emotion, whereas the influences of hue and cultural background were very limited.

As a result of the manner in which partners perceive and behave toward one another, each person enjoys greater or lesser success at attaining his or her ideal-self goals. Affirmation of one another’s ideal-self goals yields diverse benefits, both personal and relational. The Michelangelo model and supportive empirical evidence are reviewed, the phenomenon is distinguished from related interpersonal processes, and directions for future work are outlined. KEYWORDS—Michelangelo phenomenon; interdependence; ideal self; relationships People have dreams and aspirations, or mental representations of the skills, traits, and resources that they ideally would like to acquire. These aspirations include diverse goals: People may want to acquire desirable traits such as warmth, confidence, or decisiveness; to achieve professional success in the form of advancement, peer respect, or financial benefits; or to advance important pursuits involving religion, travel, or athletics. Most explanations of how people acquire new skills, traits, and resources are intrapersonal, examining the individual in isolation (cf. Carver& Scheier, 1998). But granting that people sometimes achieve desirable goals through their own actions, this personcentric approach ignores the important role that close partners play in helping people achieve their dreams and aspirations. In the following pages we review theory and research regarding the ‘‘Michelangelo phenomenon,’’ one of the most prominent interpersonal models of how close partners promote versus inhibit each person’s pursuit of ideal self goals (Drigotas, Rusbult, Wieselquist, & Whitton, 1999). THE IDEAL SELF AND PARTNER AFFIRMATION Michelangelo Buonarroti described sculpting as a process whereby the artist releases an ideal figure from the block of stone in which it slumbers. The sculptor’s task is simply to chip away at the stone so as to reveal the ideal form (Gombrich, 1995). Figure 1 depicts one of Michelangelo’s unfinished captives, vividly illustrating this process. One can readily feel the force with which the ideal form strives to emerge from the stone, shedding its imperfections. The sculptor chisels, carves, and polishes the stone to reveal the ideal form slumbering within. Humans, too, possess ideal forms. The ideal self describes an individual’s dreams and aspirations, or the constellation of skills, traits, and resources that an individual ideally wishes to acquire (Higgins, 1987; Markus & Nurius, 1986). For example, Mary’s ideal self might include goals such as completing medical school, becoming more sociable, or learning to speak fluent Dutch. Whether images of the ideal self constitute vague yearnings or clearly articulated mental representations, dreams and aspirations serve a crucial function, providing direction to personal growth strivings and thereby helping people reduce the discrepancy between the actual self and the ideal self (Higgins, 1987). Although people sometimes achieve ideal-relevant goals solely through their own actions, the acquisition of new skills, traits, and resources is also shaped by interpersonal experience. People adapt to one another during the course of interaction, changing their behavior so as to coordinate with one another and respond to each person’s needs and expectations (Kelley et al., 2003). For example, John may help Mary become more sociable by subtly directing conversation during a dinner party, leading Mary to tell one of her most charming stories. Adaptation may transpire in interactions with diverse types of partner, including romantic partners, kin, friends, or colleagues. However, adaptation ismost probable, powerful, and enduring in highly interdependent relationships, in that the mutual dependence of close partners provides good opportunities for exerting strong, frequent, and benevolent influence across diverse behavioral domains (Kelley et al., 1983). Over time, adaptations that begin as temporary, interaction-specific adjustments become stable components of the self, such that over the course of extended interaction, close partners sculpt one another’s selves: People come to reflect what their partners ‘‘see in them’’ and ‘‘elicit from them’’ (Rusbult & Van Lange, 2003).

CURRENT DIRECTIONS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE Volume 18—Number 6 305 Copyright r 2009 Association for Psychological Science at Vrije Universiteit 34820 on November 24, 2010 cdp.sagepub.com Downloaded from Is such adaptation a good thing or a bad thing? The concept of partner affirmation describes whether the partner is an ally, neutral party, or foe in individual goal pursuits (Drigotas et al., 1999). As noted in Figure 2, affirmation has two components: Partner perceptual affirmation describes the extent to which a partner consciously or unconsciously perceives the target in ways that are compatible with the target’s ideal self. For example, Johnmay deliberately consider the character of Mary’s ideal self, consciously developing benevolent interpretations of disparities between her actual self and ideal self. Alternatively, if John and Mary possess similar life goals or values, John may rather automatically perceive and display faith in Mary’s ideal goal pursuits. Partner behavioral affirmation describes the extent to which a partner consciously or unconsciously behaves in ways that elicit ideal-congruent behaviors from the target. For example, John may rather automatically communicate confidence in Mary’s abilities, hemay consciously or unconsciously react in a positive manner when she enacts ideal congruent behaviors, or he may provide direct assistance in her goal pursuits. Of course, John may also disaffirm Mary by communicating indifference, pessimism, or disapproval, by undermining her ideal pursuits, or by affirming qualities that are antithetical to Mary’s ideal self. The model proposes that partner affirmation yields target movement toward the ideal self (see Fig. 2): Because John affirms Mary’s ideals, Mary increasingly comes to resemble her ideal self. Prior research has revealed good support for this claim. For example, in one study we videotaped married partners while they discussed a goal relevant to each person’s ideal self. Trained coders rated the extent to which the partner exhibited affirming behaviors (e.g., helped target clarify plans, offered assistance, or praised goal pursuits). Four months later, we asked targets whether they had achieved the goals they discussed in the conversations.Analyses revealed thatwhenpartnersweremoreaffirming during goal-relevant conversations, targets were more likely to achieve their ideal-self goals (Rusbult, Coolsen, et al., 2009). In another study we asked pairs of friends to provide complementary questionnaire data wherein (a) one friend served as ‘‘target,’’ rating his or her own experiences of partner affirmation and target movement (how affirming is your dating partner?; how successful are you at your goal pursuits?), and (b) the second friend served as ‘‘observer,’’ also rating partner affirmation and target movement (how affirming is the target’s dating partner?; how successful is the target at his or her goal pursuits?). Analyses revealed sizable across-friend associations—for example, when friends (as observers) described the target’s partner as highly affirming, individuals themselves (as targets) reported greater movement toward their ideal selves (Drigotas et al., 1999). Of what consequence is the Michelangelo phenomenon? Growth striving is a primary human motive (cf. Deci & Ryan, 2000)—a motive that is directly gratified by movement toward the ideal self. Accordingly, when a partner is affirming and a target moves closer to his or her ideals, the target enjoys enhanced personal well-being, including greater life satisfaction and psychological health (e.g., Drigotas, 2002). Moreover, when a partner serves as an ally in promoting target growth, the target enjoys enhanced couple well-being, including greater adjustment and probability of persistence (e.g., Drigotas et al., 1999; Kumashiro, Rusbult, Finkenauer, & Stocker, 2007). PARTNER AFFIRMATION AND RELATED INTERPERSONAL PROCESSES Partner Enhancement In what ways does partner affirmation differ from related interpersonal processes? To begin with, how does partner affirmation relate to partner enhancement, which describes the extent to which a partner perceives the target and behaves toward the target in ways that are more positive than may be ‘‘realistically’’ warranted—for example, in a manner that is more positive than the target perceives the self. Numerous studies have revealed that partner enhancement is beneficial to individuals and to relationships: For example, when partners perceive one another more positively than each person perceives himself or herself, relationships exhibit superior functioning (e.g.,Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 1996).

In particular, are positive partner thoughts and acts most helpful to the extent that they concern attributes that are part of the target’s ideal self?We conducted several studies to pit two forms of partner positivity against each other—normative positivity (general social desirability) versus ideal positivity (relevanc', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 20, 'citationCount': 260, 'journal': None, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Rusbult2009CurrentDI,\n author = {Caryl E.

If true, it is possible that mimicry could extend to other parts of the body, even in the absence of visual information from that body part. Indeed, we found that passively viewing anger and fear expressions, without accompanying information from the body, voice or other channels, produced both facial mimicry and corresponding responses in arm muscles that make a fist or a defensive posture.

Neuroimaging studies have shown that, when participants believe they are interacting via a virtual interface with another human agent, they show different patterns of brain activity compared to when they know that their virtual partner is computer-controlled. The suggestion is that users adopt an “intentional stance” by attributing mental states to their virtual partner. However, it remains unclear how beliefs in the agency of a virtual partner influence participants’ behaviour and subjective experience of the interaction. We investigated this issue in the context of a cooperative “joint attention” game in which participants interacted via an eye tracker with a virtual onscreen partner, directing each other’s eye gaze to different screen locations. Half of the participants were correctly informed that their partner was controlled by a computer algorithm (“Computer” condition). The other half were misled into believing that the virtual character was controlled by a second participant in another room (“Human” condition). Those in the “Human” condition were slower to make eye contact with their partner and more likely to try and guide their partner before they had established mutual eye contact than participants in the “Computer” condition. They also responded more rapidly when their partner was guiding them, although the same effect was also found for a control condition in which they responded to an arrow cue. Results confirm the influence of human agency beliefs on behaviour in this virtual social interaction context. They further suggest that researchers and developers attempting to simulate social interactions should consider the impact of agency beliefs on user experience in other social contexts, and their effect on the achievement of the application’s goals.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 24, 'citationCount': 25, 'journal': {'volume': '5', 'name': 'PeerJ'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Caruana2017HumanAB,\n author = {N.

Mind perception also modulates the attitudes we have toward others, and determines the degree of empathy, prosociality, and morality invested in social interactions. Seeing mind in others is not exclusive to human agents, but mind can also be ascribed to non-human agents like robots, as long as their appearance and/or behavior allows them to be perceived as intentional beings. Previous studies have shown that human appearance and reliable behavior induce mind perception to robot agents, and positively affect attitudes and performance in human–robot interaction. What has not been investigated so far is whether different triggers of mind perception have an independent or interactive effect on attitudes and performance in human–robot interaction. We examine this question by manipulating agent appearance (human vs. robot) and behavior (reliable vs. random) within the same paradigm and examine how congruent (human/reliable vs. robot/random) versus incongruent (human/random vs. robot/reliable) combinations of these triggers affect performance (i.e., gaze following) and attitudes (i.e., agent ratings) in human–robot interaction. The results show that both appearance and behavior affect human–robot interaction but that the two triggers seem to operate in isolation, with appearance more strongly impacting attitudes, and behavior more strongly affecting performance.

However, we lack an integrative framework for understanding how different emotion-related functions are organized across the entire expanse of the PFC, as prior reviews have generally focused on specific emotional processes (e.g., decision making) or specific anatomical regions (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex). Additionally, psychological theories and neuroscientific investigations have proceeded largely independently because of the lack of a common framework. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of functional neuroimaging, electrophysiological, lesion, and structural connectivity studies on the emotion-related functions of 8 subregions spanning the entire PFC. We introduce the appraisal-by-content model, which provides a new framework for integrating the diverse range of empirical findings. Within this framework, appraisal serves as a unifying principle for understanding the PFC’s role in emotion, while relative content-specialization serves as a differentiating principle for understanding the role of each subregion. A synthesis of data from affective, social, and cognitive neuroscience studies suggests that different PFC subregions are preferentially involved in assigning value to specific types of inputs: exteroceptive sensations, episodic memories and imagined future events, viscero-sensory signals, viscero-motor signals, actions, others’ mental states (e.g., intentions), self-related information, and ongoing emotions. We discuss the implications of this integrative framework for understanding emotion regulation, value-based decision making, emotional salience, and refining theoretical models of emotion.

When tested independently, both of these processes have been usually observed to be atypical in individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC). However, it is not known how these processes interact with each other in relation to autistic traits. This study addresses this question by testing the impact of JA on SFM of happy faces using a truly interactive paradigm. Sixty‐two neurotypical participants engaged in gaze‐based social interaction with an anthropomorphic, gaze‐contingent virtual agent. The agent either established JA by initiating eye contact or looked away, before looking at an object and expressing happiness or disgust. Eye tracking was used to make the agent's gaze behavior and facial actions contingent to the participants' gaze. SFM of happy expressions was measured by Electromyography (EMG) recording over the Zygomaticus Major muscle. Results showed that JA augments SFM in individuals with low compared with high autistic traits. These findings are in line with reports of reduced impact of JA on action imitation in individuals with ASC. Moreover, they suggest that investigating atypical interactions between empathic processes, instead of testing these processes individually, might be crucial to understanding the nature of social deficits in autism.

From this, we derive recommendations for a research agenda with a stronger focus on the most common forms of encounters, actual interactions with known others, and on assessing potential mediators of facial mimicry.

Mirror visual feedback (MVF), a phenomenon where movement of one limb is perceived as movement of the other limb, has the capacity to alleviate phantom limb pain or promote motor recovery of the upper limbs after stroke. The tool has received great interest from health professionals; however, a clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying the neural recovery owing to MVF is lacking. Objective. We performed a systematic review to assess the effect of MVF on brain activation during a motor task. Methods. We searched PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases for neuroimaging studies investigating the effect of MVF on the brain. Key details for each study regarding participants, imaging methods, and results were extracted. Results. The database search yielded 347 article, of which we identified 33 suitable for inclusion. Compared with a control condition, MVF increases neural activity in areas involved with allocation of attention and cognitive control (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, S1 and S2, precuneus). Apart from activation in the superior temporal gyrus and premotor cortex, there is little evidence that MVF activates the mirror neuron system. MVF increases the excitability of the ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1) that projects to the “untrained” hand/arm. There is also evidence for ipsilateral projections from the contralateral M1 to the untrained/affected hand as a consequence of training with MVF. Conclusion. MVF can exert a strong influence on the motor network, mainly through increased cognitive penetration in action control, though the variance in methodology and the lack of studies that shed light on the functional connectivity between areas still limit insight into the actual underlying mechanisms.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 88, 'citationCount': 158, 'journal': {'volume': '29', 'pages': '349 - 361', 'name': 'Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Deconinck2015ReflectionsOM,\n author = {F.

A paradigm is introduced in which participants interact over a computer setup with a confederate whose prerecorded facial displays of emotion are synchronized with participants’ behavior to create the illusion of social interaction. In Experiment 1, the confederate did or did not mimic participants’ facial displays of various subsets of basic emotions. Mimicry promoted greater liking for the confederate regardless of which emotions were mimicked. Experiment 2 reversed these roles: participants were instructed to mimic or not to mimic the confederate’s facial displays.

The present study is the first to examine the impact of the attribution of mind to others on gaze-guided attentional orienting and its ERP correlates. Using a paradigm in which attention was guided to a location by the gaze of a centrally presented face, we manipulated participants' beliefs about the gazer: gaze behavior was believed to result either from operations of a mind or from a machine. In Experiment 1, beliefs were manipulated by cue identity (human or robot), while in Experiment 2, cue identity (robot) remained identical across conditions and beliefs were manipulated solely via instruction, which was irrelevant to the task. ERP results and behavior showed that participants' attention was guided by gaze only when gaze was believed to be controlled by a human. Specifically, the P1 was more enhanced for validly, relative to invalidly, cued targets only when participants believed the gaze behavior was the result of a mind, rather than of a machine. This shows that sensory gain control can be influenced by higher-order (task-irrelevant) beliefs about the observed scene.

An evaluative conditioning paradigm was used to associate different reward values with neutral target faces. Subsequently, electromyographic activity over the Zygomaticus Major was measured whilst participants watched video clips of the faces making happy expressions.

Despite its significance, the neural basis remains elusive. To investigate the neural correlates of joint attention, we developed a novel, interactive research paradigm in which participants' gaze behavior—as measured by an eye tracking device—was used to contingently control the gaze of a computer-animated character. Instructed that the character on screen was controlled by a real person outside the scanner, 21 participants interacted with the virtual other while undergoing fMRI. Experimental variations focused on leading versus following the gaze of the character when fixating one of three objects also shown on the screen. In concordance with our hypotheses, results demonstrate, firstly, that following someone else's gaze to engage in joint attention resulted in activation of anterior portion of medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) known to be involved in the supramodal coordination of perceptual and cognitive processes. Secondly, directing someone else's gaze toward an object activated the ventral striatum which—in light of ratings obtained from participants—appears to underlie the hedonic aspects of sharing attention. The data, therefore, support the idea that other-initiated joint attention relies upon recruitment of MPFC previously related to the “meeting of minds.” In contrast, self-initiated joint attention leads to a differential increase of neural activity in reward-related brain areas, which might contribute to the uniquely human motivation to engage in the sharing of experiences."", 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 58, 'citationCount': 372, 'journal': {'volume': '22', 'pages': '2702-2715', 'name': 'Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Schilbach2010MindsMF,\n author = {L.

Our results indicate that being imitated compared to not being imitated activates brain areas that have been associated with emotion and reward processing, namely medial orbitofrontal cortex/ventromedial prefrontal cortex (mOFC/vmPFC, GLM whole-brain contrast). Moreover mOFC/vmPFC shows higher effective connectivity with striatum and mid-posterior insula during being imitated compared to not being imitated.', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 58, 'citationCount': 74, 'journal': {'volume': '5', 'pages': '384 - 392', 'name': 'Social Neuroscience'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Kühn2010WhyDI,\n author = {S.

The framework is based on constructs from control theory (forward models) and signal processing (Kalman filters). The idea is that in addition to simply engaging with the body and environment, the brain constructs neural circuits that act as models of the body and environment. During overt sensorimotor engagement, these models are driven by efference copies in parallel with the body and environment, in order to provide expectations of the sensory feedback, and to enhance and process sensory information. These models can also be run off-line in order to produce imagery, estimate outcomes of different actions, and evaluate and develop motor plans. The framework is initially developed within the context of motor control, where it has been shown that inner models running in parallel with the body can reduce the effects of feedback delay problems. The same mechanisms can account for motor imagery as the off-line driving of the emulator via efference copies. The framework is extended to account for visual imagery as the off-line driving of an emulator of the motor-visual loop. I also show how such systems can provide for amodal spatial imagery. Perception, including visual perception, results from such models being used to form expectations of, and to interpret, sensory input.

The detection of mechanical contingency between shapes whose movement was inanimate engaged the middle temporal gyrus and right intraparietal sulcus. The detection of intentional contingency between shapes whose movement was animate activated superior parietal networks bilaterally. These activations were unaffected by attention to contingency. Additional regions, the right middle frontal gyrus and left superior temporal sulcus, became activated by the animate-contingent stimuli when subjects specifically attended to the contingent nature of the stimuli. Our results help to clarify neural networks previously associated with 'theory of mind' and agency detection.

L. Collins et al., 1998, Trans. Med. Imag. 17, 463-468) was performed. The MNI single-subject main sulci were first delineated and further used as landmarks for the 3D definition of 45 anatomical volumes of interest (AVOI) in each hemisphere. This procedure was performed using a dedicated software which allowed a 3D following of the sulci course on the edited brain. Regions of interest were then drawn manually with the same software every 2 mm on the axial slices of the high-resolution MNI single subject. The 90 AVOI were reconstructed and assigned a label. Using this parcellation method, three procedures to perform the automated anatomical labeling of functional studies are proposed: (1) labeling of an extremum defined by a set of coordinates, (2) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by a sphere centered by a set of coordinates, and (3) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by an activated cluster.

The standard approach is to calculate a statistic relating the experimental effect of interest to the data for each brain voxel. This method has the advantage that it can detect strong effects without apriori constraint on the area that activation will occur. Problems arise when we wish to ask the question whether a particular brain area has been activated: if we know the shape and location of the expected activity, then voxel by voxel approaches have low power, because of the multiple comparisons across voxels. Whole brain analyses usually use image smoothing in order to increase signal to noise; however, the best smoothing filter will depend on the shape of the activation, which may well not be matched by a standard kernel such as a Gaussian. The most direct answer to the question ""has this area been activated"" is to use a region of interest analysis. Here we define a region, and perform the statistical test on the mean time course of the voxels within the region. The contribution of the voxels may be weighted using the expected shape of the activation. This approach has two advantages. First, we increase power by avoiding the multiple comparison problem. Second, if we are correct about the shape and location of the region, the process of taking the mean is equivalent to using the best smoothing kernel to recover the signal. This method has proved very powerful in analysing the activation in well defined regions. For example, Kanwisher et al have used screening tasks and voxel by voxel statistics to define regions of interest, and used these regions to investigate the nature of the original activation in further experiments of visual analysis of faces, scenes, objects and body parts. We have implemented a toolbox called ""MarsBar"" for region of interest analysis within the SPM99 software package (available for free download from http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/marsbar.html). The user can define regions using activations from previous SPM analyses, binary or weighted images, or simple shapes (boxes or spheres). Regions can be combined using a full range of algebra to give new regions. Functions include overlap between regions (logical and) or combination (logical or). The software can then extract raw or filtered time courses from the region for futher analysis outside SPM. It can also use new or previous SPM analysis files to analyze the regional time course. t or F statistics for multiple regions can be computed, and the results plotted using the SPM graphical interface. We are currently working on estimation of percentage signal change for the region data. Region of interest analyses are likely to become more important as prior hypotheses about the location of activation become more specific. This may have many advantages in terms of statistical power and the ease of interpretation of neuroimaging data.

The terms thoughts, feelings, and behaviors include all psychological variables that are measurable in a human being. The statement that others\' presence may be imagined or implied suggests that we are prone to social influence even when no other people are present, such as when watching television, or following internalized cultural norms. Social psychologists typically explain human behavior as a result of the interaction of mental states and immediate social situations. In general, social psychologists have a preference for laboratory-based, empirical findings. Social psychology theories tend to be specific and focused, rather than global and general. Social psychology is an interdisciplinary domain that bridges the gap between psychology and sociology. During the years immediately following World War II, there was frequent collaboration between psychologists and sociologists.[2] However, the two disciplines have become increasingly specialized and isolated from each other in recent years, with sociologists focusing on ""macro variables"" (e.g., social structure) to a much greater extent. Nevertheless, sociological approaches to social psychology remain an important counterpart to psychological research in this area. In addition to the split between psychology and sociology, there has been a somewhat less pronounced difference in emphasis between American social psychologists and European social psychologists. As a broad generalization, American researchers traditionally have focused more on the individual, whereas Europeans have paid more attention to group level phenomena (see group dynamics).[3]', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 524, 'citationCount': 6078, 'journal': {'volume': '214 4524', 'pages': '\n          1020-1\n        ', 'name': 'Science'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Barone2018SocialP,\n author = {Miranda Barone},\n journal = {Science},\n pages = {\n          1020-1\n        },\n title = {Social psychology.},\n volume = {214 4524},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2262745055', 'name': 'Miranda Barone'}]}, {'paperId': 'b8fcf53efd84b6372c57d5968371b0c3aeb93f9f', 'title': 'An AmI-based and privacy-preserving shopping mall model', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 37, 'citationCount': 7, 'journal': {'volume': '7', 'pages': '1-28', 'name': 'Human-centric Computing and Information Sciences'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Blundo2017AnAA,\n author = {C.

In this paper, we present a new definition of influence that is tailored uniquely for online contexts and an associated methodology for gauging influence. According to our definition, influence entails the capacity to shift the patterns of emotion levels expressed by social media users. The source of influence may be the content of a user's message or the context of the relationship between exchanging users. Regardless of the source, measuring influence requires first identifying shifts in the patterns of emotion levels expressed by users and then studying the extent that these shifts can be associated with a user. This paper presents a new quantitative approach that combines the use of a text analysis program with a mathematical algorithm to derive trends in levels of emotions expressed in social media and, more importantly, detect breakpoints when those trends changed abruptly. First steps have also been taken to predict future trends in expressions (as well as quantify their accuracy). These methods constitute a new approach to quantifying influence in social media that focuses on detecting the impact of influence (e.g., shifts in levels of emotions expressed) as opposed to focusing on the dynamics of simple social media counts, e.g., retweets, followers, or likes."", 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 62, 'citationCount': 21, 'journal': {'volume': '1', 'pages': '180-190', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Servi2014AMA,\n author = {L.

Very often, the users look at the web as a place where they can find an individual or group of people with the same or similar interests, or even find new friends. Such situation is reflected in one of the aspects of the web 2.0 called tagging. Tagging is a process of labeling (annotating) digital items-resources-by users. The labels-tags-assigned to those resources reflect users' ways of seeing, categorizing, and perceiving particular items. In general, a single user can label a number of items with a number of different tags. The results of this activity-labeled items and used tags-can be perceived as information characterizing the user. This paper describes an approach for constructing a user signature representing her interests and opinions based on used items and tags. The signature is determined as a fuzzy relation built on two fuzzy sets proposed here: a fuzzy set representing resource attractiveness, and a fuzzy set representing tag popularity. Furthermore, users' signatures are used to determine similarity between users, and potentially give users a method to find new web friends with similar interests and opinions. The paper also describes a process of building different signatures representing a group of users. Signatures of users that are members of the group are aggregated using OWA operator and different linguistic quantifiers to describe the group in a number of ways.

A major challenge in the application of probabilistic rough set models is their inability to formulate a method of decreasing the size of the boundary region through further explorations of the data. To decrease the size of this region, objects must be moved to either the positive or negative regions. Game theory allows a solution to this decision problem by having the regions compete or cooperate with each other in order to find which is best fit to be selected for the move. There are two approaches discussed in this article. First, the region parameters that define the minimum conditional probabilities for region inclusion can either compete or cooperate in order to increase their size. The second approach is formulated by having classification approximation measures compete against each other.

Fully aware we are simplifying the subject, we can say that the communication satisfies the need of humans to share their emotional experiences. Thus we can say that also the formulation and interpretation of messages exchanged in CMC is influenced by the emotions. Moreover the reduced physical presence in CMC implies a lack of social norms or social control which is amplified in the Online Social Networks (OSN) scenario. Motivated by these näıve considerations and the massive use of OSN, we introduce a Virtual Counselor as a contribution, from a technical point of view, to augment the quality of communication among users of OSN. The implementation of this Virtual Counselor is based on technologies by now mature like wearable devices to measure physical parameters, on artificial emotional intelligence, and on interactive tutoring systems, strongly used in online learning environments. We propose an abstract model of the communication scenario in OSN containing the Virtual Counselor to help the interpretation of the messages and of the emotional states in order to improve the communication among parties. The goal is to align the emotional states of senders and receivers to form dynamic groups of target friends in the OSN to send the posts to. The dynamism of the groups is both spatial (that is the composition of receivers can change for a given sender and a given message) and temporal (for example the sending of a message can be postponed in time). We think that this model is the basis for defining a new class of tools to improve the communication in OSN.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 15, 'citationCount': 1, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Orciuoli2019AVC,\n author = {F.

Greenberg and Paivio reviewed a large number of taped interviews of emotionally focused therapies that were successful. The clients had a wide range of complaints, including depression, anxiety, and problems of living. The authors discovered through this research three important steps in successful treatment: 1) bonding, 2) evoking and exploring emotional experiences, and 3) restructuring the emotional schema. These steps are synonymous with the working alliance; the development of the transference and its past components; and the working-through and resolution phase of classical psychoanalytic treatment. \n \nThe first part of the book sets forth the theoretical framework for emotions and the idea of core maladaptive emotion schemas. The authors discuss the role of emotion not as an irrational feeling state, but instead as an organizer of past interactive experiences, memories, hopes, fears, and dreams that are specific for each person and arise from relationships past and present. These schemas are organizers not only of emotion, but of identity and of the subjectively felt meaning of one's self. I think this is the most important piece of their work. The notion that “bad fits” organize emotions and hence organize one's identity is a major component of my clinical experience. These authors do not specifically talk of bad fits in early life, particularly preverbal life, but the concept is inherent in their work and their book. The passion of the bad fit or the emotions that are aroused by a bad fit help to organize and concretize the emotions in the identity. \n \nThe authors' experience is that if the maladaptive emotional schemas can be restructured, clients will develop a different relationship to these emotions that have plagued them. They will also develop a different sense of themselves, in terms of how they deal with emotions generated through their relationships. In this section, emotions are broken down according to their adaptive and maladaptive functions and are differentiated as primary, secondary, or instrumental emotions. This classification is useful to all therapists; we work with emotions every day but may not have realized the importance of differentiating them as to their origins, effects, and functions. \n \nThe second section deals with the types of interventions that occur in Emotional Focused Therapy (EFT.) Emphasis is placed on the specific moment-to-moment intervention of the therapist as he or she stays attuned to the slightest changes and shifts in the emotional makeup of the client. Through this attunement the therapist and client build a working alliance, and the resultant bonding accentuates a validation of the client's feelings. Emotional evocation, which is central to their EFT, relies heavily on the “empty chair dialogue.” This dialogue is Gestalt in origin and is not meant to be just a cathartic emotional experience: restructuring and validation of the new self follows. \n \nIn the third section, the authors describe in great detail the working of EFT with different emotions, and they present a clear picture of how the therapist attempts to deal with clients in this modality. They end with a brief chapter on research and supervision. \n \nThis book carries some important assumptions that need to be examined. Is it possible for the therapist to achieve such carefully fine attunement with the client as they suggest? I doubt it, and what is not talked about is the rupture in attunement and how that affects the process and transference issues in EFT. There should be a whole chapter focused on this issue alone. The whole issue of transference and countertransference is not addressed, and it is not clear how long the clients have to be in treatment for the EFT to be effective. I think it is dangerous to assume that a therapist can stay attuned to moment-to-moment changes in a person's emotional schema, since that assumption sets up an unrealistic expectation for both parties. It makes ruptures more difficult to heal because of the mutual narcissistic injuries. And is it difficult to train new therapists to do what clearly the authors do with a long-standing natural ease? \n \nFor people who are interested in cognitive and experiential work with emotions, this book is invaluable. For those with an analytic bent, the chapters on the emotional schema will only help them to formulate what they have already been doing every day in their offices; even so, such readers will find these chapters interesting and important."", 'year': 1999, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 233, 'journal': {'volume': '8', 'pages': '249-250', 'name': 'The journal of psychotherapy practice and research'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Aledort1999WorkingWE,\n author = {S.

The issue of emotion contagion has been gaining attention. Humans can share emotions, for example, through gestures, through speech, or even through online text via social media. There have been computational models trying to capture emotion contagion. However, these models are limited as they tend to represent agents in a very simplified way. There exist also more complex models of agents and their emotions, but they are not yet addressing emotion contagion. We use a more psychologically realistic and better validated model – the Clarion cognitive architecture – as the basis to model emotion and emotion contagion in a more psychologically realistic way. In particular, we use Clarion to capture and explain human data from typical human experiments on emotion contagion. This approach may open up avenues for more nuanced understanding of emotion contagion and more realistic capturing of its effects in different circumstances.",2022,0,0,{'name': 'Journal of Cognition and Culture'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Sun2022ModelingEC,\n author = {R.

Gross (Ed.). New York, NY: Guilford Press, 2013. 669 Pages, $95.00Reviewed by ALEXANDER L. CHAPMANDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/cap0000012The scientific field of emotion regulation has grown considerably over the past two decades. Researchers are using a variety of methods to better understand how emotions are regulated (either automatically or with conscious effort) from self-report to ecological momentary assessment, psychophysiological, neuro-imaging, and other methods. The growth of this field is attributable at least in part to the seminal work, theory, and frameworks established by the editor of the Handbook of Emotion Regulation, 2nd ed., Dr. James Gross (e.g., see Gross, 1998). Development in research and theory on emotion regulation has further influenced and, in some cases, has formed the backbone of existing empirically supported treatments for a variety of clinical problems (e.g., Barlow et al., 2011; Gratz & Gunderson, 2006; Linehan, 1993a, 1993b, 2014). The Handbook of Emotion Regulation, 2nd ed., provides a vivid snapshot of the well-established and growing field of emotion regulation across many domains.Covering a broad range of topics related to emotions and emotion regulation, this book will appeal to people with expertise in this area as well as to students, researchers, and clinicians who wish to know more about the field of emotion regulation. Chapters cover the conceptual and empirical foundations of emotions and emotion regulation, biological bases and models of emotion regulation, cognitive factors, the development of emotion regulation from childhood through older adulthood, social factors (including cultural considerations), personality and temperament, psychopathology, treatment, and health. Some of the chapters, such as those addressing biological factors, might require some background information on brain structure and functioning, but the chapters are generally written in a manner that should be accessible to readers with a variety of background knowledge.This reader will find this book useful either as a start-to-finish read, or as a reference book, where chapters are read when in isolation when applicable. One advantage of reading this book from start to finish is that the earlier chapters, which focus on theory and biological bases of emotion regulation, set the stage for the rest of the book. Once the theory and biological frameworks are established, the reader can relate material in subsequent chapters to these frameworks. This approach, in my experience, promotes an integrative view of the field of emotion regulation and sparks interesting research questions that cut across disciplines. That said, the individual chapters all follow a logical structure and are very useful independently as references or snapshots of the research in each respective domain.Although it is not possible in this review to highlight the many excellent contributions made by all 36 chapters, I would like to comment on a few highlights. In the opening chapter, Dr. Gross does an excellent job of defining and discussing the importance of emotions and the growing field of emotion regulation. This chapter is written in a sophisticated but user-friendly manner that I believe will appeal to audiences both intimately familiar with this area of research and those with less familiarity. I particularly appreciated the discussion of the dynamic interplay of emotions and situations. A situation might elicit an emotion, and the sequelae of the emotion and related actions create a new situation, sparking a new emotion. This chapter provides a framework, the modal model of emotions, which is largely consistent with and helps the reader integrate the material in the remaining chapters.In Chapter 2, the authors describe a valuation-based theory related to the neural bases of emotion and emotion regulation. They define emotion as a perception-valuation-action sequence. …', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 96, 'journal': {'volume': '56', 'pages': '268', 'name': 'Canadian Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Chapman2015TheHO,\n author = {A.

This process involves a gradual reduction in the capacity of a fear-conditioned stimulus to elicit fear by presenting the conditioned stimulus repeatedly on its own. Fear extinction is context-dependent and is generally considered to involve the establishment of inhibitory control of the prefrontal cortex over amygdala-based fear processes. In this paper, we review research progress on the neural basis of fear extinction with a focus on the role of the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. We evaluate two competing hypotheses for how the medial prefrontal cortex inhibits amygdala output. In addition, we present new findings showing that lesions of the basal amygdala do not affect fear extinction. Based on this result, we propose an updated model for integrating hippocampal-based contextual information with prefrontal-amygdala circuitry.', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 187, 'citationCount': 413, 'journal': {'volume': '11 5', 'pages': '\n          525-35\n        ', 'name': 'Learning & memory'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Sotres-Bayon2004EmotionalPA,\n author = {Francisco Sotres-Bayon and D.

For this reason, there is a growing need for a comprehensive understanding of their dynamical properties. Using a combination of elementary analysis and numerical studies, this article begins a systematic examination of the dynamics of continuous-time recurrent neural networks. Specifically, a fairly complete description of the possible dynamical behavior and bifurcations of one- and two-neuron circuits is given, along with a few specific results for larger networks. This analysis provides both qualitative insight and, in many cases, quantitative formulas for predicting the dynamical behavior of particular circuits and how that behavior changes as network parameters are varied. These results demonstrate that even small circuits are capable of a rich variety of dynamical behavior (including chaotic dynamics). An approach to understanding the dynamics of circuits with time-varying inputs is also presented. Finally, based on this analysis, several strategies for focusing evolutionary searches into fruitful regions of network parameter space are suggested.', 'year': 1995, 'referenceCount': 53, 'citationCount': 439, 'journal': {'volume': '3', 'pages': '469 - 509', 'name': 'Adaptive Behavior'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Beer1995OnTD,\n author = {R.

Although seminal research in this area was performed in the artificial intelligence (AI) community, more recently it has attracted the attention of optimization theorists because of several noteworthy success stories from operations management. It is on large-scale and complex problems of dynamic optimization, in particular the Markov decision problem (MDP) and its variants, that the power of RL becomes more obvious. It has been known for many years that on large-scale MDPs, the curse of dimensionality and the curse of modeling render classical dynamic programming (DP) ineffective. The excitement in RL stems from its direct attack on these curses, which allows it to solve problems that were considered intractable via classical DP in the past. The success of RL is due to its strong mathematical roots in the principles of DP, Monte Carlo simulation, function approximation, and AI. Topics treated in some detail in this survey are temporal differences, Q-learning, semi-MDPs, and stochastic games. Several recent advances in RL, e.g., policy gradients and hierarchical RL, are covered along with references. Pointers to numerous examples of applications are provided. This overview is aimed at uncovering the mathematical roots of this science so that readers gain a clear understanding of the core concepts and are able to use them in their own research.

This article addresses these questions by examining the interaction between representation and intelligence in user interfaces. The rubric representation covers at least three topics in this context: (1) how a computational system is represented in its user interface, (2) how the interface conveys its representations of information and the world to human users, and (3) how the system's internal representation affects the human user's interaction with the system. I argue that each of these kinds of representation (of the system, information and the world, the interaction) is key to how users make the kind of attributions of intelligence that facilitate their interactions with intelligent systems. In this vein, it makes sense to represent a systmem as a human in those cases where social collaborative behavior is key and for the system to represent its knowledge to humans in multiple ways on multiple modalities. I demonstrate these claims by discussing issues of representation and intelligence in an embodied conversational agent -- an interface in which the system is represented as a person, information is conveyed to human users by multiple modalities such as voice and hand gestures, and the internal representation is modality independent and both propositional and nonpropositional."", 'year': 2001, 'referenceCount': 34, 'citationCount': 299, 'journal': {'volume': '22', 'pages': '67-84', 'name': 'AI Mag.'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Cassell2001EmbodiedCA,\n author = {Justine Cassell},\n journal = {AI Mag.},\n pages = {67-84},\n title = {Embodied Conversational Agents: Representation and Intelligence in User Interfaces},\n volume = {22},\n year = {2001}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145431806', 'name': 'Justine Cassell'}]}, {'paperId': '1c5024b54d2cc3e68800756d27ddcd34f039910f', 'title': 'Smart Broker Agent Learning How to Reach Appropriate Goal by Making Appropriate Compromises', 'abstract': 'In this paper a new Smart Broker Learning Agent (SBLA) has been proposed, which trains to find the most acceptable solution to a given problem, according to the individual requirements and emotions of a particular user.

49,cdcee1355981de99b93608ab61b09a249da728b6,A perception‐based emotion contagion model in crowd emergent evacuation simulation,"With the increasing number of emergencies, the crowd simulation technology has attracted wide attention in the recent years. Existing emergencies have shown that individuals are easy to be influenced by others' emotion during the evacuation. This will make it easier for people to aggregate together and increase security risks. Some of the existing evacuation models without considering emotion are therefore not suitable for describing crowd behaviors in emergencies. We propose a perception‐based emotion contagion model and use multiagent technology to simulate crowd behaviors. Navigation points are introduced to guide the movement of the agents. Based on the proposed model, a prototype simulation system for crowd emotion contagion is developed. The comparative simulation experiments verify that the model can effectively deduct the evacuation time and crowd emotion contagion. The proposed model could be an assistant analysis method for crowd management in emergencies.",2018,34,18,"{'name': 'Computer Animation and Virtual Worlds', 'volume': '29'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Liu2018APE,\n author = {Zhen Liu and Tingting Liu and M.

An important aspect of individual behaviour is emotion which plays a significant role in all aspects of human decision making.

One popular motivation for simulation of virtual crowds is to generate believable characters in movies and computer games. Recently the concept of serious games has been introduced in both academic and industrial circles. In this paper, we propose an emotion engine, based on modern appraisal theory, that is able to model various emotional crowd characteristics. This appraisal engine is capable of capturing the dynamics of emotional contagion and we show how different crowd composition can lead to different patterns of emotional contagion. In addition, we describe a serious game designed for training military personnel in peaceful crowd control. We evaluate this engine in the context of a property protection protest scenario where the players or soldiers are tasked to maintain a peaceful protest without violence.

In this paper, we explore a novel vision-based approach of collision avoidance between walkers that fits the requirements of interactive crowd simulation. By simulating humans based on cognitive science results, we detect future collisions as well as the level of danger from visual stimuli. The motor-response is twofold: a reorientation strategy prevents future collision, whereas a deceleration strategy prevents imminent collisions.

The social group and crowd‐related behaviors are modeled according to the findings and theories observed from social psychology (e.g., social attachment theory).

50,dad5698954e962c010aaa837049aa4a771e78e92,Validation of Enhanced Emotion Enabled Cognitive Agent Using Virtual Overlay Multi-Agent System Approach,"Making roads safer by avoiding road collisions is one of the main reasons for inventing Autonomous vehicles (AVs). In this context, designing agent-based collision avoidance components of AVs which truly represent human cognition and emotions look is a more feasible approach as agents can replace human drivers. However, to the best of our knowledge, very few human emotion and cognition-inspired agent-based studies have previously been conducted in this domain. Furthermore, these agent-based solutions have not been validated using any key validation technique. Keeping in view this lack of validation practices, we have selected state-of-the-art Emotion Enabled Cognitive Agent (EEC_Agent), which was proposed to avoid lateral collisions between semi-AVs. The architecture of EEC_Agent has been revised using Exploratory Agent Based Modeling (EABM) level of the Cognitive Agent Based Computing (CABC) framework and real-time fear emotion generation mechanism using the Ortony, Clore & Collins (OCC) model has also been introduced. Then the proposed fear generation mechanism has been validated using the Validated Agent Based Modeling level of CABC framework using a Virtual Overlay MultiAgent System (VOMAS). Extensive simulation and practical experiments demonstrate that the Enhanced EEC_Agent exhibits the capability to feel different levels of fear, according to different traffic situations and also needs a smaller Stopping Sight Distance (SSD) and Overtaking Sight Distance (OSD) as compared to human drivers.",2017,34,0,"{'name': 'ArXiv', 'volume': 'abs/1708.01628'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Riaz2017ValidationOE,\n author = {F.

Virtual agents offering real-time error feedback may influence performance under stereotype threat by shaping the performers\' attributional perception of errors they commit. We explored this possibility with female drivers, considering the prevalence of the ""women-are-bad-drivers"" stereotype. Specifically, we investigated how in-vehicle voice agents offering error feedback based on responsibility attribution (internal vs. external) and outcome attribution (ability vs. effort) influence female drivers\' performance under stereotype threat. In addressing this question, we conducted an experiment in a virtual driving simulation environment that provided moment-to-moment error feedback messages. Participants performed a challenging driving task and made mistakes preprogrammed to occur. Results showed that the agent\'s error feedback with outcome attribution moderated the stereotype threat effect on driving performance. Participants under stereotype threat had a smaller number of collisions when the errors were attributed to effort than to ability.

In other words, the research question that remains unanswered is: how exactly do these measures perform in the real world? So, as an example, if a centrality of a particular node identifies it to be important, is the node actually important? Purpose The goal of this paper is not just to perform a traditional social network analysis but rather to evaluate different centrality measures by conducting an empirical study analyzing exactly how do network centralities correlate with data from published multidisciplinary network data sets. Method We take standard published network data sets while using a random network to establish a baseline. These data sets included the Zachary's Karate Club network, dolphin social network and a neural network of nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Each of the data sets was analyzed in terms of different centrality measures and compared with existing knowledge from associated published articles to review the role of each centrality measure in the determination of influential nodes. Results Our empirical analysis demonstrates that in the chosen network data sets, nodes which had a high Closeness Centrality also had a high Eccentricity Centrality. Likewise high Degree Centrality also correlated closely with a high Eigenvector Centrality. Whereas Betweenness Centrality varied according to network topology and did not demonstrate any noticeable pattern. In terms of identification of key nodes, we discovered that as compared with other centrality measures, Eigenvector and Eccentricity Centralities were better able to identify important nodes."", 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 35, 'citationCount': 87, 'journal': {'volume': '9', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Batool2014TowardsAM,\n author = {Komal Batool and M.

In this paper, we propose the SimConnector Emulator, a novel approach for the testing of real-world systems using agent-based simulations as a means of validation. The basic idea is to use agent-based simulations to generate event data to allow the testing of responses of the software system to real-time events.

For example, they have been used in a range of domains ranging from modeling of tumor growth, immune systems, molecules to models of social networks, crowds and computer and mobile self-organizing networks. One reason for their success is their intuitiveness and similarity to human cognition. However, with this power of abstraction, in spite of being easily applicable to such a wide number of domains, it is hard to validate agent-based models. In addition, building valid and credible simulations is not just a challenging task but also a crucial exercise to ensure that what we are modeling is, at some level of abstraction, a model of our conceptual system; the system that we have in mind. In this paper, we address this important area of validation of agent based models by presenting a novel technique which has broad applicability and can be applied to all kinds of agent-based models. We present a framework, where a virtual overlay multi-agent system can be used to validate simulation models. In addition, since agent-based models have been typically growing, in parallel, in multiple domains, to cater for all of these, we present a new single validation technique applicable to all agent based models. Our technique, which allows for the validation of agent based simulations uses VOMAS: a Virtual Overlay Multi-agent System. This overlay multi-agent system can comprise various types of agents, which form an overlay on top of the agent based simulation model that needs to be validated. Other than being able to watch and log, each of these agents contains clearly defined constraints, which, if violated, can be logged in real time. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we show its broad applicability in a wide variety of simulation models ranging from social sciences to computer networks in spatial and non-spatial conceptual models.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 31, 'citationCount': 51, 'journal': {'volume': 'abs/1708.02361', 'name': 'ArXiv'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Niazi2009VerificationV,\n author = {M.

Existing models for evaluating sight distance are applicable only to two-dimensional (213), separate horizontal, and vertical alignments or simple elements of these separate alignments (vertical curve, horizontal curve).

Piecewise parametric equations in the form of cubic B-splines are used to represent the highway surface and sight obstructions, including tangents (grades), horizontal curves, and vertical curves. The available sight distance is found analytically by examining the intersection between the sight line and the elements representing the highway surface and sight obstructions. A profile of available sight distance can be established and used to evaluate sight-distance deficiency. Application of the new model is illustrated using actual GPS data for highway K-177 in Kansas (United States). The model has been tested and verified on most of the highways in Kansas.

It has been used for assessments and training in social cognition with the use of virtual agents instead of face-to-face interactions – but its potential for the study of social emotion regulation has, perhaps surprisingly, largely remained untapped. The present study evaluates a novel immersive VR scenario designed to study the efficacy of social support by a virtual agent using a modified version of Cyberball, an established paradigm to induce the feeling of ostracism. Participants embodied a new pupil in a virtual school environment and played Cyberball, after which they either did or did not receive emotional support. Self-reports and psychophysiological markers demonstrated that the negative impact of social exclusion in Cyberball was successfully replicated, while participants also reported a significant improvement in emotional state after being supported by the virtual agent. These results indicate the potential of the developed scenario for research on social emotion regulation in immersive VR. Future studies could aim to test the efficacy of social support for people with difficulties in self-regulation, for example individuals with high social anxiety, with a view to developing training programs in VR.",2023,0,1,"{'name': 'Int.

A band that was on the platform that night, during its performance, used pyrotechnics that ignited polyurethane foam insulation lining the walls and ceiling of the platform. The fire spread quickly along the walls and ceiling area over the dance floor. Smoke was visible in the exit doorways in a little more than one minute, and flames were observed breaking through a portion of the roof in less than five minutes. Egress from the nightclub, which was not equipped with sprinklers, was hampered by crowding at the main entrance to the building. One hundred people lost their lives in the fire. On Feb. 27, 2003, under the authority of the National Construction Safety Team (NCST) Act, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) established a National Construction Safety Team to determine the likely technical cause or causes of the building failure that led to the high number of casualties in that fire. This report documents the procedures, findings, and issues that were raised by the investigation. Volume I contains the main report and Volume II contains appendix material. The investigation concluded that strict adherence to 2003 model codes available at the time of the fire would go a long way to preventing similar tragedies in the future. Changes to the codes subsequent to the fire made them stronger. By making some additional changes – and state and local agencies adopting and enforcing them – we can strengthen occupant safety even further. Ten recommendations to improve model building and fire codes, standards and practices (as they existed in February 2003) resulted from the investigation, including (i) urging state and local jurisdictions to (a) adopt and update building and fire codes covering nightclubs based on one of the model codes and (b) enforce those codes aggressively; (ii) strengthening the requirements for the installation of automatic fire sprinklers; (iii) increasing the factor of safety on the time for occupants to egress; (iv) tightening the restriction on the use of flexible polyurethane foam -and other materials that ignite as easily and propagate flames as rapidly as non-fire retarded foam -as an interior finish product; (v) further limiting the use of pyrotechnics; and (vi) conducting research in specific areas to underpin the recommended changes.', 'year': 2005, 'referenceCount': 1, 'citationCount': 46, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Grosshandler2005ReportOT,\n author = {W.

In particular, “Mikulus”[15] provides an environment where a CG agent is always sitting next to users. In this paper, we focused on the experience of evoking fear and revealed the difference in emotional evoked from experience by CG agent in the virtual space. In the experiment, we used film to evoke fear emotion, we compared conditions for viewing with one participant with the condition of CG agent. We investigated the emotion evoked from the experience by rating the valence/arousal dimension scales and 18 emotion intensity scales. Experimental results showed that there is a difference in the emotion evoked from the experience by CG agent in the virtual space.",2016,2,0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Takai2016InfluenceBC,\n author = {Nanako Takai and Homei Miyashita},\n title = {Influence by CG Agent in the Virtual Space to Emotion at the Time of Viewing Fear Video},\n year = {2016}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2075020479', 'name': 'Nanako Takai'}, {'authorId': '1796760', 'name': 'Homei Miyashita'}]",[],"[{'paperId': '49fc6a156e6c0c7f00ab4309f133adb99f1c3530', 'title': 'Emotion elicitation using films', 'abstract': ""Abstract Researchers interested in emotion have long struggled with the problem of how to elicit emotional responses in the laboratory.

55,a03ab390f8aa1ca2d104fa7532b75291648a22cd,Effect of Group Identity on Emotional Contagion in Dyadic Human Agent Interaction,"Emotional contagion is the process by which emotions unconsciously spread between people, often via emotional mimicry, a process in which we mimic others’ emotional displays, and consequently, converge with their emotions. The social context theory of emotional mimicry in human-human interactions suggests that these processes are modulated by social factors, such as the group membership identities of interactants (whether the interactants belong to the same social group or not). However, the social factors that modulate the emotional contagion between humans and artificial agents are not known yet. Hence, this research attempts to understand the process of emotional contagion in human-agent interaction by conducting an interaction experiment in a competitive in-group/out-group context. Emotional contagion as well as the social attitudes of trust, empathy, liking, bonding, and pro-social orientation were found to be significantly higher in the in-group than in the out-group setting. Furthermore, these social attitudes were highly correlated with emotional contagion, which demonstrates the potential of using emotional contagion as an unobtrusive proxy measurement of people’s social attitudes.",2022,58,0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Human-Agent Interaction'},"{'bibtex': '@Book{Joby2022EffectOG,\n author = {Nora Elizabeth Joby and H.

A closer look at the empirical evidence, however, reveals that although these two phenomena often co-occur, the changes in emotional expressions may not necessarily be causally linked to the changes in subjective emotional experience. Here, we directly investigate this link, by testing a model in which facial activity served as a mediator between the observed emotional displays and subsequently felt emotions (i.e. emotional contagion). Participants watched videos of different senders displaying happiness, anger, or sadness, while their facial activity was recorded. After each video, participants rated their own emotions and assessed the senders’ likeability and competence. Participants both mimicked and reported feeling the emotions displayed by the senders. Moreover, their facial activity partially explained the association between the senders’ emotional displays and self-reported emotions, thereby supporting the notion that facial mimicry may be involved in emotional contagion.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 33, 'citationCount': 50, 'journal': {'volume': '34', 'pages': '367 - 376', 'name': 'Cognition and Emotion'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Olszanowski2020MimickingAS,\n author = {M.

Perceivers’ reactions to others’ facial expressions often represent a match or mirroring (e.g., they smile to a smile). However, the information conveyed by an expression depends on context. Thus, when shown by an opponent, a smile conveys bad news and evokes frowning. The availability of anthropomorphic agents capable of facial actions raises the question of how people respond to such agents in social context. We explored this issue in a study where participants played a strategic game with or against a facially expressive android. Electromyography (EMG) recorded participants’ reactions over zygomaticus muscle (smiling) and corrugator muscle (frowning). We found that participants’ facial responses to android’s expressions reflect their informational value, rather than a direct match. Overall, participants smiled more, and frowned less, when winning than losing. Critically, participants’ responses to the game outcome were similar regardless of whether it was conveyed via the android’s smile or frown.

In this research, we conducted an experiment to determine which properties cause this phenomenon between anthropomorphic agents and users. We prepared two kinds of agents. One is a cartoon-like agent, and the other is a concrete agent. The cartoon-like agent smiled exaggeratedly, and the concrete agent smiled modestly.

We empirically evaluated the effects of near visually realistic vs. non-realistic stylized appearance of virtual humans on the emotional response of participants in a medical virtual reality system that was designed to educate users in recognizing the signs and symptoms of patient deterioration. In a between-subjects experiment protocol, participants interacted with one of three different appearances of a virtual patient, namely visually realistic, cartoon-shaded and charcoal-sketch like conditions in a mixed reality simulation. Emotional impact were measured via a combination of quantitative objective measures were gathered using skin Electrodermal Activity (EDA) sensors, and quantitative subjective measures such as the Differential Emotion Survey (DES IV), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and Social Presence questionnaire. The emotional states of the participants were analyzed across four distinct time steps during which the medical condition of the virtual patient deteriorated (an emotionally stressful interaction), and were contrasted to a baseline affective state. Objective EDA results showed that in all three conditions, male participants exhibited greater levels of arousal as compared to female participants. We found that negative affect levels were significantly lower in the visually realistic condition, as compared to the stylized appearance conditions. Furthermore, in emotional dimensions of interest-excitement, surprise, anger, fear and guilt participants in all conditions responded similarly. However, in social emotional constructs of shyness, presence, perceived personality, and enjoyment-joy, we found that participants responded differently in the visually realistic condition as compared to the cartoon and sketch conditions.

Robot mood controls pose and motion parameters, while those parameters modulate behavior appearance. We applied the model to two concrete behaviors - waving and pointing - of the NAO robot, and conducted a user study in which participants (N=24) were asked to design the expression of positive, neutral, and negative moods by modulating the parameters of the two behaviors. Results show that participants created different parameter settings corresponding with different moods, and the settings were generally consistent across participants.

According to the classic view on emotional mimicry (the Matched Motor Hypothesis), people mimic the specific facial movements that comprise a discrete emotional expression. However, little evidence exists for the mimicry of discrete emotions; rather, the extant evidence supports only valence-based mimicry. We propose an alternative Emotion Mimicry in Context view according to which emotional mimicry is not based on mere perception but rather on the interpretation of signals as emotional intentions in a specific context. We present evidence for the idea that people mimic contextualized emotions rather than simply expressive muscle movements. Our model postulates that (implicit or explicit) contextual information is needed for emotional mimicry to take place.

It is generally believed that the greater the size of the crowd of bystanders, the less the chance that any of them will intervene. A complementary model is that social identity is critical as an explanatory variable. For example, when the bystander shares common social identity with the victim the probability of intervention is enhanced, other things being equal. However, it is generally not possible to study such hypotheses experimentally for practical and ethical reasons. Here we show that an experiment that depicts a violent incident at life-size in immersive virtual reality lends support to the social identity explanation. 40 male supporters of Arsenal Football Club in England were recruited for a two-factor between-groups experiment: the victim was either an Arsenal supporter or not (in-group/out-group), and looked towards the participant for help or not during the confrontation. The response variables were the numbers of verbal and physical interventions by the participant during the violent argument. The number of physical interventions had a significantly greater mean in the in-group condition compared to the out-group. The more that participants perceived that the Victim was looking to them for help the greater the number of interventions in the in-group but not in the out-group. These results are supported by standard statistical analysis of variance, with more detailed findings obtained by a symbolic regression procedure based on genetic programming. Verbal interventions made during their experience, and analysis of post-experiment interview data suggest that in-group members were more prone to confrontational intervention compared to the out-group who were more prone to make statements to try to diffuse the situation.', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 41, 'citationCount': 156, 'journal': {'volume': '8', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Slater2013BystanderRT,\n author = {M.

Second, we expect that in spontaneous interactions not mimicry, but empathic feelings with the other predict the accurateness of emotion recognition. Data were collected in a pseudo-experimental setting, during an event organized for subscribers of a large Dutch women’s magazine. One woman (expresser) was exposed to two emotional stimuli (i.e., a vile smell, a compliment) in order to evoke disgust and pride respectively. Another woman (observer: intimate or stranger) was sitting opposite of her. We collected self-report measures on emotions and empathy, and coded facial expressions of disgust and smiling on the basis of FACS. The results show that participants do not mimic disgust. In contrast, smiles displayed after the vile smell and the compliment were mimicked, but only among intimates.

Effects on congruent reactions were found to be mediated by cognitive empathy, indicating that the state of empathy plays an important role in the situational modulation of congruent reactions. Further, incongruent reactions to sad and angry faces in a competition setting were mediated by the emotional reaction of joy, supporting the assumption that incongruent facial reactions are mainly based on affective processes.

Our overall objective is to enhance the ability of embod-ied conversational agents (ECAs) to bond with humans. To reach such an objective, we have endowed an ECA with the capacity to touch and be touched in a social interaction with a human in an immersive environment. By drawing inspiration from literature on human-human social touch and related works on human-agent tactile interactions, we have developed a framework for a touching ECA able to perceive when and how a user touches it and decide when and how to respond accordingly. This paper focuses on going beyond a simple bi-directional touch interaction through a decision model that actually adapts its behaviour to the content of the interaction, the level of rapport and the human’s touch avoidance sensibility. This enables an actual interactive loop between the agent and the human.",2021,57,3,{'pages': '232-241'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Boucaud2021DecisionMF,\n author = {Fabien Boucaud and C.

However, such studies tend to explore each factor in isolation. This paper aims to better understand the inter-relations among these three factors by conducting a subjective matching experiment. In the presented experiment ($\\mathrm{n}=40$), participants had to match a given “optimal” SoE avatar configuration (realistic avatar, full-body motion capture, first-person point of view), starting by a “minimal” SoE configuration (minimal avatar, no control, third-person point of view), by iteratively increasing the level of each factor. The choices of the participants provide insights about their preferences and perception over the three factors considered. Moreover, the subjective matching procedure was conducted in the context of four different interaction tasks with the goal of covering a wide range of actions an avatar can do in a VE. The paper also describes a baseline experiment ($\\mathrm{n}=20$) which was used to define the number and order of the different levels for each factor, prior to the subjective matching experiment (e.g. different degrees of realism ranging from abstract to personalised avatars for the visual appearance). The results of the subjective matching experiment show that point of view and control levels were consistently increased by users before appearance levels when it comes to enhancing the SoE. Second, several configurations were identified with equivalent SoE as the one felt in the optimal configuration, but vary between the tasks. Taken together, our results provide valuable insights about which factors to prioritize in order to enhance the SoE towards an avatar in different tasks, and about configurations which lead to fulfilling SoE in VE.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 49, 'citationCount': 69, 'journal': {'volume': '26', 'pages': '2062-2072', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Fribourg2020AvatarAS,\n author = {Rebecca Fribourg and F.

Prior efforts have used visual observation to distinguish emotional touch communications by certain gestures tied to one’s hand contact, velocity and position. The work herein describes an automated approach to eliciting the essential features of these gestures. First, a tracking system records the timing and location of contact interactions in 3-D between a toucher’s hand and a receiver’s forearm. Second, data post-processing algorithms extract dependent measures, derived from prior visual observation, tied to the intensity and velocity of the toucher’s hand, as well as areas, durations and parts of the hand in contact. Third, behavioral data were obtained from five couples who sought to convey a variety of emotional word cues. We found that certain combinations of six dependent measures well distinguish the touch communications. For example, a typical sadness expression invokes more contact, evolves more slowly, and impresses less deeply into the forearm than a typical attention expression. Furthermore, cluster analysis indicates 2-5 distinct expression strategies are common per word being communicated. Specifying the essential features of touch communications can guide haptic devices in reproducing naturalistic interactions.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 20, 'citationCount': 38, 'journal': {'pages': '407-412', 'name': '2019 IEEE World Haptics Conference (WHC)'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Hauser2019UncoveringHP,\n author = {Steven C.

By contrast, there has been less work on modeling observers’ understanding of emotional states. We propose an intuitive theory framework to studying affective cognition—how humans reason about emotions—and derive a taxonomy of inferences within affective cognition. Using this taxonomy, we review formal computational modeling work on such inferences, including causal reasoning about how others react to events, reasoning about unseen causes of emotions, reasoning with multiple cues, as well as reasoning from emotions to other mental states. In addition, we provide a roadmap for future research by charting out inferences—such as hypothetical and counterfactual reasoning about emotions—that are ripe for future computational modeling work. This framework proposes unifying these various types of reasoning as Bayesian inference within a common “intuitive Theory of Emotion.” Finally, we end with a discussion of important theoretical and methodological challenges that lie ahead in modeling affective cognition.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 117, 'citationCount': 77, 'journal': {'volume': '11', 'pages': '338 - 357', 'name': 'Topics in Cognitive Science'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Ong2018ComputationalMO,\n author = {Desmond C.

Perceived stigma prevents many from reporting their symptoms. Stigma is a particularly pervasive problem among military service members, preventing them from reporting symptoms of combat-related conditions like posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, research shows increased reporting by service members when anonymous assessments are used. For example, service members report more symptoms of PTSD when they anonymously answer the Post-Deployment Health Assessment (PDHA) symptom checklist compared to the official PDHA, which is identifiable and linked to their military records. To investigate the factors that influence reporting of psychological symptoms by service members, we used a transformative technology: automated virtual humans that interview people about their symptoms. Such virtual human interviewers allow simultaneous use of two techniques for eliciting disclosure that would otherwise be incompatible; they afford anonymity while also building rapport. We examined whether virtual human interviewers could increase disclosure of mental health symptoms among active-duty service members that just returned from a year-long deployment in Afghanistan. Service members reported more symptoms during a conversation with a virtual human interviewer than on the official PDHA. They also reported more to a virtual human interviewer than on an anonymized PDHA. A second, larger sample of active-duty and former service members found a similar effect that approached statistical significance. Because respondents in both studies shared more with virtual human interviewers than an anonymized PDHA -even though both conditions control for stigma and ramifications for service members’ military records- virtual human interviewers that build rapport may provide a superior option to encourage reporting.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 71, 'citationCount': 164, 'journal': {'volume': '4', 'pages': '51', 'name': 'Frontiers Robotics AI'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Lucas2017ReportingMH,\n author = {Gale M.

The adults’ responses to crying involve embraces, stroking, and patting. Haptic soothing is managed by calibrating the bodily proximity and postural orientations between the participants, including haptic—embracing or face-to-face—formations that are coordinated with particular forms of talk. Haptic formations configure specific affordances for embodied participation by actualizing the availability of tactile, aural, and visual modalities. The interactional organization of soothing in an embracing formation involves: an initiation/invitation and response, submergence of two bodies into a close haptic contact, and coordinated withdrawal from haptic contact. The embracing formation temporarily suspends the requirements for the distressed person to act like a responsive listener and speaker. The caregiver uses the face-to-face formation to reestablish conditions for the child’s interactional co-presence.

Many real-time interactive systems feature virtual anthropomorphic characters in order to simulate conversing groups and add plausibility and believability to the simulated environments. However, only a few have dealt with autonomous behavior generation, and in those cases, the agents’ exhibited behavior should be evaluated by users in terms of appropriateness, believability, and conveyed meaning (e.g., attitudes). In this article we present an integrated intelligent interactive system for generating believable nonverbal behavior exhibited by virtual agents in small simulated group conversations. The produced behavior supports group formation management and the expression of interpersonal attitudes (friendly vs. unfriendly) both among the agents in the group (i.e., in-group attitude) and towards an approaching user in an avatar-based interaction (out-group attitude). A user study investigating the effects of these attitudes on users’ social presence evaluation and proxemics behavior (with their avatar) in a three-dimensional virtual city environment is presented. We divided the study into two trials according to the task assigned to users, that is, joining a conversing group and reaching a target destination behind the group. Results showed that the out-group attitude had a major impact on social presence evaluations in both trials, whereby friendly groups were perceived as more socially rich. The user’s proxemics behavior depended on both out-group and in-group attitudes expressed by the agents. Implications of these results for the design and implementation of similar intelligent interactive systems for the autonomous generation of agents’ multimodal behavior are briefly discussed.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 80, 'citationCount': 26, 'journal': {'volume': '6', 'pages': '12:1-12:33', 'name': 'ACM Trans.

However, it has remained unknown to what extent social touch would maintain and establish social bonds. We asked a total of 1,368 people from five countries to reveal, using an Internet-based topographical self-reporting tool, those parts of their body that they would allow relatives, friends, and strangers to touch. These body regions formed relationship-specific maps in which the total area was directly related to the strength of the emotional bond between the participant and the touching person. Cultural influences were minor. We suggest that these relation-specific bodily patterns of social touch constitute an important mechanism supporting the maintenance of human social bonds. Nonhuman primates use social touch for maintenance and reinforcement of social structures, yet the role of social touch in human bonding in different reproductive, affiliative, and kinship-based relationships remains unresolved. Here we reveal quantified, relationship-specific maps of bodily regions where social touch is allowed in a large cross-cultural dataset (N = 1,368 from Finland, France, Italy, Russia, and the United Kingdom). Participants were shown front and back silhouettes of human bodies with a word denoting one member of their social network. They were asked to color, on separate trials, the bodily regions where each individual in their social network would be allowed to touch them. Across all tested cultures, the total bodily area where touching was allowed was linearly dependent (mean r2 = 0.54) on the emotional bond with the toucher, but independent of when that person was last encountered. Close acquaintances and family members were touched for more reasons than less familiar individuals. The bodily area others are allowed to touch thus represented, in a parametric fashion, the strength of the relationship-specific emotional bond. We propose that the spatial patterns of human social touch reflect an important mechanism supporting the maintenance of social bonds.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 42, 'citationCount': 265, 'journal': {'volume': '112', 'pages': '13811 - 13816', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Suvilehto2015TopographyOS,\n author = {Juulia T.

We have designed an ecological paradigm where romantic partners interact only via touch and we manipulate their empathic states. Simultaneously, we collected their autonomic activity (skin conductance, pulse, respiration). Fourteen couples participated to the experiment. We found that interpersonal touch increased coupling of electrodermal activity between the interacting partners, regardless the intensity and valence of the emotion felt. In addition, physical touch induced strong and reliable changes in physiological states within individuals. These results support an instrumental role of interpersonal touch for affective support in close relationships.

We measured 30 subjects' affective response to vibrations varying in rhythm and frequency, then examined how differences in demographic, everyday use of touch, and tactile processing abilities contribute to variations in affective response. To this end, we developed five affective and sensory rating scales and two tactile performance tasks, and also employed a published `Need for Touch' (NFT) questionnaire. Subjects' ratings, aggregated, showed significant correlations among the five scales and significant effect of the signal content (rhythm and frequency). Ratings varied considerably among subjects, but this variation did not coincide with demographic, NFT score or tactile task performance. The linkages found among the rating scales confirm this as a promising approach. The next step towards a comprehensive picture of individuals' patterns of affective response to tactile sensations entails pruning, integration and redundancy reduction of these scales, then their formal validation."", 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 24, 'citationCount': 54, 'journal': {'pages': '605-610', 'name': '2013 World Haptics Conference (WHC)'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': ""@Article{Seifi2013AFL,\n author = {H.

This paper expands on recent work which allowed unidirectional touch from human to VH, by evaluating bidirectional touch as a new channel for nonverbal communication. A VH augmented with a haptic interface is able to touch her interaction partner using a pseudo-haptic touch or an active-haptic touch from a co-located mechanical arm. Within the context of a simulated doctor-patient interaction, two user studies (n = 54) investigate how touch can be used by both human and VH to communicate. Results show that human-to-VH touch is used for the same communication purposes as human-to-human touch, and that VH-to-human touch (pseudo-haptic and active-haptic) allows the VH to communicate with its human interaction partner. The enhanced nonverbal communication provided by bidirectional touch has the potential to solve difficult problems in VH research, such as disambiguating user speech, enforcing social norms, and achieving rapport with VHs.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 16, 'citationCount': 29, 'journal': {'pages': '175-178', 'name': '2009 IEEE Virtual Reality Conference'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Kotranza2009VirtualHT,\n author = {Aaron Kotranza and Benjamin C.

This model stands in contrast to theories of basic emotions, which posit that a discrete and independent neural system subserves every emotion. We propose that basic emotion theories no longer explain adequately the vast number of empirical observations from studies in affective neuroscience, and we suggest that a conceptual shift is needed in the empirical approaches taken to the study of emotion and affective psychopathologies. The circumplex model of affect is more consistent with many recent findings from behavioral, cognitive neuroscience, neuroimaging, and developmental studies of affect.

Some experiments are performed using a game application of a train station after an explosion. The participants of this experiment have to move inside the environment, while receiving several stimuli to check if any improvement in presence or realism in that environment is reflected on the vest. This is done by comparing the experimental results with those similar scenarios, obtained without haptic feedback. These experiments are carried out by three groups of participants who are classified on the basis of their experience in haptics and virtual reality devices. Some differences among the groups have been found, which can be related to the levels of realism and synchronization of all the elements in the multimodal environment that fulfill the expectations and maximum satisfaction level.

In our digital age, human social interaction is often mediated. However, even though there is increasing evidence that mediated touch affords affective communication, current communication systems (such as videoconferencing) still do not support communication through the sense of touch. As a result, mediated communication does not provide the intense affective experience of co-located communication. The need for ICT mediated or generated touch as an intuitive way of social communication is even further emphasized by the growing interest in the use of touch-enabled agents and robots for healthcare, teaching, and telepresence applications. Here, we review the important role of social touch in our daily life and the available evidence that affective touch can be mediated reliably between humans and between humans and digital agents. We base our observations on evidence from psychology, computer science, sociology, and neuroscience with focus on the first two. Our review shows that mediated affective touch can modulate physiological responses, increase trust and affection, help to establish bonds between humans and avatars or robots, and initiate pro-social behavior. We argue that ICT mediated or generated social touch can (a) intensify the perceived social presence of remote communication partners and (b) enable computer systems to more effectively convey affective information. However, this research field on the crossroads of ICT and psychology is still embryonic and we identify several topics that can help to mature the field in the following areas: establishing an overarching theoretical framework, employing better research methodologies, developing basic social touch building blocks, and solving specific ICT challenges.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 204, 'citationCount': 140, 'journal': {'volume': '2', 'pages': '2', 'name': 'Frontiers Digit.

There are no systematic guidelines for development of computational models of emotions. This paper deconstructs the often vague term 'emotion modeling' by suggesting the view of emotion models in terms of two fundamental categories of processes: emotion generation and emotion effects. Computational tasks necessary to implement these processes are also identified. The paper addresses how computational building blocks provide a basis for the development of more systematic guidelines for affective model development.

We demonstrate that when touch is used alone, hand squeeze pressure and number of squeezes are associated with user perceptions of affect arousal conveyed by an agent, while number of squeezes and squeeze duration are associated with affect valence. We also show that, when affect-relevant cues are present in facial display, speech prosody, and touch used simultaneously by the agent, facial display dominates user perceptions of affect valence, and facial display and prosody are associated with affect arousal, while touch had little effect.

This volume represents a preliminary effort to identify the relevant variables involved and fit them into a systematic framework. Furthermore, it presents extensive sets of measures for investigating the theory and implementing it in a variety of everyday environments.Basically, the framework outlined here proposes that environmental stimuli are linked to behavioral responses by the primary emotional responses of arousal, pleasure, and dominance. By considering the impact of the environment on these basic emotional responses, the effects of diverse stimulus components within or across sense modalities can be readily compared. An additional concept, information rate, is used to compare the effects of different environments, each with stimulation in many sense modalities.

As a result, some people are too busy to communicate with their families. In this paper, we propose an Augmented Reality (AR) system using smartphone. The system allows us to leave emotional notes in the real environment using Virtual-Agent. The crucial part of the system focuses on the emotional short voice message exchange with the Virtual-Agents. Spatial note system is based on two parts, one is the virtual agent services and the other is the AR system. The virtual agent services allow users to make a voice message by recording user’s voice. Then, a Virtual-Agent with the appropriate facial expression is generated. User can also change the facial expressions as he likes. There are 4 emotions of the virtual agents: happy, sorrow, angry and calm. Each emotion has 4 levels to express. The AR system will detect planes from the smartphone view of the real world.

Unlike previous methods based on phoneme level unit selection or hidden Markov model (HMM), etc., the hybrid concatenation method uses a frame level-based unit selection method combined with a fused HMM, and is able to generate more expressive and stable facial animations. The fused HMM can be used to explicitly model the loose synchronization of tightly coupled streams, with much better results than a normal HMM for audiovisual mapping. After fused HMM is created, facial animation is generated via the unit selection method at the frame level by using the fused HMM output probabilities. To accelerate the computing efficiency of the unit selection on a large corpus, this paper also proposes a two-layer Viterbi search method in which only the subsets that have been selected in the first layer are further checked in the second layer. Using this idea, the system has been successfully integrated into real-time applications. Furthermore, the paper also proposes a mapping method to generate emotional facial expressions from neutral facial expressions based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs).

Our perspective on this problem is shaped by our interest in the role of emotion and emotional behaviors in such forms of learning. In recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in the role of emotion in the design of virtual humans. The techniques and motivations underlying these various efforts can seem, from an outsider's perspective, as bewildering and multifaceted as the concept of emotion itself is generally accused of being.

Although several approaches have been proposed to recognize human emotions based on facial expressions or speech, relatively limited work has been done to fuse these two, and other, modalities to improve the accuracy and robustness of the emotion recognition system. This paper analyzes the strengths and the limitations of systems based only on facial expressions or acoustic information. It also discusses two approaches used to fuse these two modalities: decision level and feature level integration. Using a database recorded from an actress, four emotions were classified: sadness, anger, happiness, and neutral state. By the use of markers on her face, detailed facial motions were captured with motion capture, in conjunction with simultaneous speech recordings. The results reveal that the system based on facial expression gave better performance than the system based on just acoustic information for the emotions considered. Results also show the complementarily of the two modalities and that when these two modalities are fused, the performance and the robustness of the emotion recognition system improve measurably.', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 24, 'citationCount': 880, 'journal': {'pages': '205-211'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Busso2004AnalysisOE,\n author = {C.

In this paper, we present a framework that systematically addresses facial deformation modeling, automatic facial motion analysis, and real-time speech-driven face animation with expression using neural networks. Based on this framework, we learn a quantitative visual representation of the facial deformations, called the motion units (MUs). A facial deformation can be approximated by a linear combination of the MUs weighted by MU parameters (MUPs). We develop an MU-based facial motion tracking algorithm which is used to collect an audio-visual training database. Then, we construct a real-time audio-to-MUP mapping by training a set of neural networks using the collected audio-visual training database. The quantitative evaluation of the mapping shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The aim is to create virtual humans that can interact spontaneously using a natural language, emotions and gestures. This paper discusses a system that allows the design of personality for emotional virtual human. We adopt the Five Factor Model (FFM) of personality from psychology studies. To realize the model, we use Bayesian Belief Network. We introduce a layered approach for modeling personality, moods and emotions. In order to demonstrate a virtual human with emotional personality, we integrate the system into a chat application. Thus, the system enables the developer to design and implement personalities and enables the user to interact with them.', 'year': 2002, 'referenceCount': 13, 'citationCount': 232, 'journal': {'pages': '107-115'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Kshirsagar2002AMP,\n author = {S.

We recorded several hours of speech and measured the locations of the speakers' main facial features as well as their head poses. The text was evaluated with a prosody prediction tool, identifying phrase boundaries and pitch accents. Characteristic for most speakers are simple motion patterns that are repeatedly applied in synchrony with the main prosodic events. Direction and strength of head movements vary widely from one speaker to another, yet their timing is typically well synchronized with the spoken text. Understanding quantitatively the correlations between head movements and spoken text is important for synthesizing photo-realistic talking heads.

Such prototypic expressions, however, occur rather infrequently. Human emotions and intentions are more often communicated by changes in one or a few discrete facial features. In this paper, we develop an Automatic Face Analysis (AFA) system to analyze facial expressions based on both permanent facial features (brows, eyes, mouth) and transient facial features (deepening of facial furrows) in a nearly frontal-view face image sequence. The AFA system recognizes fine-grained changes in facial expression into action units (AUs) of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), instead of a few prototypic expressions. Multistate face and facial component models are proposed for tracking and modeling the various facial features, including lips, eyes, brows, cheeks, and furrows. During tracking, detailed parametric descriptions of the facial features are extracted. With these parameters as the inputs, a group of action units (neutral expression, six upper face AUs and 10 lower face AUs) are recognized whether they occur alone or in combinations. The system has achieved average recognition rates of 96.4 percent (95.4 percent if neutral expressions are excluded) for upper face AUs and 96.7 percent (95.6 percent with neutral expressions excluded) for lower face AUs.

(1997) studied human subjects' ability to recognize emotions from viewing video clips of facial expressions and listening to the corresponding emotional speech stimuli.

Thus the lip image synthesis plays an important role to realize a natural human-like face of computer agents.

We propose a novel lip movement synthesis method based on mapping from input speech based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM). This paper compares the HMM-based method and a conventional method using vector quantization (VQ). In the experiment, error and time differential error between synthesized lip movement images and original ones are used for evaluation. The result shows that the error of the HMM based method is 8.7% smaller than that of the VQ-based method. Moreover, the HMM-based method reduces time differential error by 32% than the VQ's. The result also shows that the errors are mostly caused by phoneme /h/ and /Q/. Since lip shapes of those phonemes are strongly dependent on succeeding phoneme, the context dependent synthesis on the HMM-based method is applied to reduce the error. The improved HMM-based method realizes reduction of the error (differential error) by 10.5% (11%) compared with the original HMM-based method."", 'year': 1998, 'referenceCount': 23, 'citationCount': 136, 'journal': {'pages': '154-159', 'name': 'Proceedings Third IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Yamamoto1998LipMS,\n author = {E.

Most of these research paradigms are devoted purely to visual or purely to auditory human emotion detection. However we found that it is very interesting to consider both these auditory and visual information together, for processing, since we hope this kind of multi-modal information processing will become a datum of information processing in future multimedia era. By several intensive subjective evaluation studies we found that human beings recognise anger, happiness, surprise and dislike by their visual appearance, compared to voice only detection. When the audio track of each emotion clip is dubbed with a different type of auditory emotional expression, still anger, happiness and surprise were video dominant. However the dislike emotion gave mixed responses to different speakers. In both studies we found that sadness and fear emotions were audio dominant. As a conclusion, we propose a method of facial emotion detection by using a hybrid approach, which uses multi-modal information for facial emotion recognition.', 'year': 1997, 'referenceCount': 12, 'citationCount': 233, 'journal': {'volume': '1', 'pages': '397-401 vol.1', 'name': 'Proceedings of ICICS, 1997 International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing.

It is more problematic to apply modelbased methods to images of objects whose appearance can vary, though a number of approaches based on the use of flexible templates have been proposed. The problem with existing methods is that they sacrifice model specificity in order to accommodate variability, thereby compromising robustness during image interpretation. We argue that a model should only be able to deform in ways characteristic of the class of objects it represents. We describe a method for building models by learning patterns of variability from a training set of correctly annotated images. These models can be used for image search in an iterative refinement algorithm analogous to that employed by Active Contour Models (Snakes). The key difference is that our Active Shape Models can only deform to fit the data in ways consistent with the training set. We show several practical examples where we have built such models and used them to locate partially occluded objects in noisy, cluttered images.

We dismiss the traditional dichotomy between reactive and symbolic architectures.

Regulatory agents are implementable as control systems or automata, and represent the ideal case in which the agent has all the knowledge it needs. We nd that each type of agent is best suited for a particular kind of behavior. The diierent kinds of behavior form a hierarchy in terms of frequency of occurrence and response time, and do not gracefully reduce to each other. This suggests implementing agents as hierarchies of simpler agents, each specialized in the kind of behavior it implements. In this scheme, agents at one level act through agents at the next lower level. We introduce the concept of drive to address the issue of where an agent's goals come from.

59,d9d395b2f3dedfbe46a7e815767d5ee91da16b15,Using SIR Model to Simulate Emotion Contagion in Dynamic Crowd Aggregation Process,"Emotion contagion is an indispensable behavior in a dynamic crowd, especially in an evacuation situation. As a consequence, generating emotion contagion results is very useful in the crowd simulation field. However, because the topology of the crowd usually keeps changing dynamically, computing the contagion process is a challenge. In this paper, we represented our research about the emotion contagion effects on the virtual pedestrian dynamic aggregation process. First of all, we calculated individuals’ moving parameters based on their prefixed expectations according to the social force theory. After this, we made an adjacent test for each individual to generate nearer neighbors for further emotional contagions computing between neighbors. We then treated the emotional contagions between individuals and their neighbors as the information spreading process so that we can adopt the emotional information spreading model SIR (Susceptible Infective Removal) to calculate emotional influences, which are represented as their changing moving velocities during aggregation. Social force for computing low level moving parameters and SIR model for generating emotional influences were integrated by our method to simulate the dynamic pedestrian aggregation. Experimental results showed that the SIR model can effectively improve the fidelity of the emotional interaction process and crowd aggregation.",2018,25,6,"{'name': 'International journal of performability engineering', 'pages': '134', 'volume': '14'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Xiang2018UsingSM,\n author = {Nan Xiang and Zehong Zhou and Zhigeng Pan},\n journal = {International journal of performability engineering},\n pages = {134},\n title = {Using SIR Model to Simulate Emotion Contagion in Dynamic Crowd Aggregation Process},\n volume = {14},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '49604749', 'name': 'Nan Xiang'}, {'authorId': '2112445952', 'name': 'Zehong Zhou'}, {'authorId': '145086315', 'name': 'Zhigeng Pan'}]","[{'paperId': '1e00df7dfcb8aba79c8a1694b5f4359b62309d2c', 'title': 'What Makes Groups Emotional?'}, {'paperId': 'c362173e43b2d16a5c65b0dadc19d3c639b81ac5', 'title': 'Rumor Transmission in Online Social Networks Under Nash Equilibrium of a Psychological Decision Game'}, {'paperId': '1509fed8069b17b35471a439ef4be99513888d36', 'title': ""The Transfer Model and Guidance Strategy of Netizens' Emotions""}, {'paperId': '327e79ffe4a193a31e92ccbc069d6be84b4445a9', 'title': ""A deep reinforcement learning based decision‐making approach for avoiding crowd situation within the case of Covid'19 pandemic""}, {'paperId': '9dc9d0b6af060b508b378ecbd3fdc2e6cfe152dd', 'title': 'Sentiment mutation and negative emotion contagion dynamics in social media: A case study on the Chinese Sina Microblog'}, {'paperId': '351cd1ef51d5611299c73f17722e204dee2bbb16', 'title': 'Virus Propagation in Wireless Sensor Networks with Media Access Control Mechanism'}]","[{'paperId': '933362ae750f237930b69d48cb20dd2d7aa9e7e8', 'title': 'An Overview of Crowd Evacuation Simulation', 'abstract': 'Emergency scenario is an unforeseen situation that threated human life.

The value of exit width should be bigger than the critical value in order to ensure a dilute pedestrian flow, but the value doesn’t need to be too big. The bigger the original occupant density, the longer the evacuation time is. They can be fitted as a linear relationship. The principle of taking the shortest route is not always useful.

Even the most simple of living organisms, like slime mould, is typically under intense selective pressure to evolve a response to ensure their evolution and safety in the best possible way. On the other hand, evacuation of a place can be easily characterized as one of the most stressful situations for the individuals taking part on it. Taking inspiration from the slime mould behaviour, we are introducing a computational bio-inspired model crowd evacuation model. Cellular Automata (CA) were selected as a fully parallel advanced computation tool able to mimic the Physarum’s behaviour. In particular, the proposed CA model takes into account while mimicking the Physarum foraging process, the food diffusion, the organism’s growth, the creation of tubes for each organism, the selection of optimum tube for each human in correspondence to the crowd evacuation under study and finally, the movement of all humans at each time step towards near exit. To test the model’s efficiency and robustness, several simulation scenarios were proposed both in virtual and real-life indoor environments (namely, the first floor of office building B of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of Democritus University of Thrace). The proposed model is further evaluated in a purely quantitative way by comparing the simulation results with the corresponding ones from the bibliography taken by real data. The examined fundamental diagrams of velocity–density and flow–density are found in full agreement with many of the already published corresponding results proving the adequacy, the fitness and the resulting dynamics of the model. Finally, several real Physarum experiments were conducted in an archetype of the aforementioned real-life environment proving at last that the proposed model succeeded in reproducing sufficiently the Physarum’s recorded behaviour derived from observation of the aforementioned biological laboratory experiments.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 98, 'citationCount': 36, 'journal': {'volume': '44', 'pages': '354 - 391', 'name': 'International Journal of General Systems'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Kalogeiton2015CellularAM,\n author = {Vicky S.

For this class of dynamic networks, we derive an epidemic threshold, considering the susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model. First, an epidemic probabilistic model is developed assuming independence between states of nodes. We identify the conditions under which the epidemic dies out by linearizing the underlying dynamical system and analyzing its asymptotic stability around the origin. The concept of joint spectral radius is then used to derive the epidemic threshold, which is later validated using several networks (Watts-Strogatz, Barabasi-Albert, MIT reality mining graphs, Regular, and Gilbert). A simplified version of the epidemic threshold is proposed for undirected networks. Moreover, in the case of static networks, the derived epidemic threshold is shown to match conventional analytical results. Then, analytical results for the epidemic threshold of dynamic networks are proved to be applicable to periodic networks. For dynamic regular networks, we demonstrate that the epidemic threshold is identical to the epidemic threshold for static regular networks.

A modified exponentially weighted average computational model of affective adaptation, which predicts its time course and the resulting affective dynamics, is presented. In addition to capturing the primary features of affective adaptation, it is shown that the model is consistent with several previously reported characteristics of affective dynamics. For instance, the model shows that elicited emotion is determined by the position, displacement, velocity, and acceleration of the stimulus. It also demonstrates that affective after-reaction correlates positively with stimulus intensity and duration and that the duration-of-current-ownership, duration-of-prior-ownership, and time-elapsed-since-loss effects can be explained by it. The model exhibits the region-β paradox that refers to the observation that stronger emotions sometimes abate faster than the weaker ones. The model also predicts that the proposed mechanisms underlying the paradox may have other effects on affective dynamics as well. Besides offering an explanation for the contradicting reports on emotion intensity-duration relationship, it is also proposed that adaptation processes activate quickly but deactivate slowly.

We infer the inten-sities of the following primary emotional states: happy, surprised, angry, sad, disgusted, fearful by using the known AU combinations. Additionally, an AI algorithm was trained and tested on the DAiSEE dataset to infer the following secondary emotional states: engaged, bored, confused and frustrated.

The choice of technologies for modeling the agent and the task environment is considered. The properties of the task environment are discussed. The agent’s behavior when a risky situation occurs is investigated. For this purpose, an IVA behavior model, based on psychological theories of motivation, emotions, and power is proposed. A change in the IVA priorities and, as a consequence, a change in its goal is modeled. Results of a survey, studying the trust, which the IVA receives from the students, are presented. To have a more realistic IVA, the model includes knowledge of the environment, the shortest evacuation route learning, visitor training locations, priorities, emotions, social power strategy, set goals, abilities to learn, abilities to change priorities and goals when a risk occurs, and a role of a specialist – electrician.",2023,58,0,{'pages': '189-198'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Budakova2023VirtualAB,\n author = {D.

In order to make the Q-learning agent find the optimal path to the goal by meeting particular complex criteria, the use of measures model (a model of environment criteria), represented as a new memory matrix, is introduced. If the goal cannot be reached by following the pre-set criteria, the learning agent can compromise a given criterion. The agent makes the least possible number of tradeoffs in order to reach the goal. If the criteria are arranged by their level of importance, then the agent can choose more in number and more acceptable compromises. The aim of the modification is to empower the learning agent to control the way of reaching a goal. The modified algorithm has been applied to training smart shopping-cart learning agents.

In this study, we propose a learning-based approach to modeling driver behavior, aiming to predict and compensate for the speed tracking errors in real time. Subject drivers are first classified into different types according to their driving behaviors using the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. A nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) neural network is then adopted to predict the speed tracking errors generated by each driver. A specific traffic scenario has been created in a Unity game engine-based driving simulator platform, where ASA system provides advisory driving speed to the driver via a head-up display (HUD). A human-in-the-loop simulation study is conducted by 17 volunteer drivers, revealing a 53% reduction in the speed error variance and a 3% reduction in the energy consumption with the compensation of the speed tracking errors.

Mainly because the technologies allow training complex threatening tasks within a safe environment. The interactive three-dimensional (3D) representation of a real world seems to be a more effective learning medium than other traditional tools. This paper presents the development and implementation of a training environment based on VR, applied to the maintenance of medium-tension overhead live-lines in power distribution networks. The architecture of the virtual environment includes three main components: the virtual warehouse of equipment, materials and tools; the interactive 3D environments; and a course management system. The system consists of 43 maintenance maneuvers, including the application of different techniques and equipment. It has three operation modes: learning, practice, and evaluation, which can be accessed according to the trainee’s level of knowledge. The virtual environment is currently used to support training of thousands of power line operators with excellent results. The aim of the system is to improve the technical skills of operators and minimize safety risks while operating power distribution networks. The system has allowed a substantial reduction of the accident rates during live-line maintenance.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 58, 'citationCount': 21, 'journal': {'volume': '29', 'pages': '527 - 544', 'name': 'Interactive Learning Environments'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Pérez-Ramírez2019TheUO,\n author = {Miguel Pérez-Ramírez and G.

To curb the resulting complexity of models, Axelrod promoted the KISS principle: ‘Keep It Simple, Stupid’. But the community is divided and a new principle appeared: KIDS, ‘Keep It Descriptive, Stupid’. Richer models were thus developed for a variety of phenomena, while agent cognition still tends to be modelled with simple reactive particle-like agents. This is not always appropriate, in particular in the social sciences trying to account for the complexity of human behaviour. One solution is to model humans as belief, desire and intention (BDI) agents, an expressive paradigm using concepts from folk psychology, making it easier for modellers and users to understand the simulation.

A substation is one of the most critical facilities of the electrical distribution system, so it is mandatory to keep its normal operation to deliver high standards of service, power quality and avoid blackouts to consumers. Therefore, it is necessary to give an effective training to the electricians who will operate the equipment in the substation and to prepare them to face emergencies on daily basis. The main purpose of the proposed Immersive Virtual Environment is to provide a realistic experience to trainees in a safe environment where they can interact with equipment, explore the facility and, mainly, practice basic and complex maneuvers to recover substation operations. Users can interact with this Immersive Virtual Environment using HMDs, joysticks or even an ordinary keyboard, mouse and monitor.

The term virtual reality is credited to Jaron Lanier, founder of VPL Research; earlier experimenters, like Myron Krueger in the mid-1970s, used phrases like artificial reality. William Gibson coined cyberspace in his 1984 science fiction novel. Neuromancer. Few technologies in recent years have evoked such fiery discussions in the technical community, and fewer still have sparked such passionate involvement of the humanities and the cultural sector. Maybe the humanities community reacts because the VR interaction is so tightly coupled to the human senses. Perhaps the cultural sector clamours for a role in the evolution of VR because the technology is finally interfacing with the human, rather than the human interfacing with the technology. Whatever the reasons, VR is more a convergence of previously disparate disciplines than a whole new branch of technology. It simply takes a fresh look at human interaction. Evolving from user interface design, flight and visual simulation, and telepresence technologies, VR is unique in its emphasis on the experience of the human participant. VR focuses the user's attention on the experience while suspending disbelief about the method of creating it. We feel that neither the devices used nor the level of interactiveness or fidelity determine whether a system is VR. The quality of the experience is crucial. To stimulate creativity and productivity. the virtual experience must be credible. The reality must both react to the human participants in physically and perceptually appropriate ways, and conform to their personal cognitive representations of the microworld in which they are engrossed. The experience does not necessarily have to be realistic/spl minus/just consistent.<<ETX>>"", 'year': 1994, 'referenceCount': 9, 'citationCount': 1783, 'journal': {'volume': '14', 'pages': '15-16', 'name': 'IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Machover1994VirtualR,\n author = {C.

We developed a game-based story generation system that automatically generates scripts in real time by using a player's emotions and actions. The system has two functions: a game-based experiential learning environment and automatic story generation. The system provides the player with a virtual world and a virtual tool operated by using a hand controller and a display. The system recognizes the player's real-time emotions through facial expressions, and it outputs reactions based on these emotions and actions via a knowledge-based system when the player operates the tool. Then, it outputs scripts based on the emotions and the history of actions. We evaluated the system by conducting experiments with university students as subjects. As a result, subjects found the stories generated by this system interesting because they were based on the player's experience in the game and used the player's behavioral history and emotions. If we consider this as a record of the learning experience, the learning history is an impressive record accompanied by emotions. Thus, historical information that records the actions and emotions of the learner in real time is considered effective because it allows the learner to recall his or her own experiences after the game experience. The results suggest that the historical information, including the learner's real-time actions and emotions, is helpful for review in learning. There is a possibility that experiential learning through games using virtual spaces, such as the one used in this study, will become widespread in the future. In such cases, it will be necessary to examine the learning effects of using historical information with emotions. Therefore, we believe that the results and discussions in this study will be useful for experiential learning using virtual spaces."", 'year': 2022, 'referenceCount': 26, 'citationCount': 1, 'journal': {'volume': '5', 'name': 'Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': ""@Article{Sumi2022ExperiencesOG,\n author = {Kaoru Sumi and Shusuke Sato},\n journal = {Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence},\n title = {Experiences of Game-Based Learning and Reviewing History of the Experience Using Player's Emotions},\n volume = {5},\n year = {2022}\n}\n""}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145441214', 'name': 'Kaoru Sumi'}, {'authorId': '152639869', 'name': 'Shusuke Sato'}]}, {'paperId': '31b3f2048fc05c652456ce1a189888dcd04d0397', 'title': 'Analysis and Prediction of Student Emotions While Doing Programming Exercises', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 19, 'citationCount': 18, 'journal': {'pages': '24-33'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Tiam-Lee2019AnalysisAP,\n author = {Thomas James Z.

We contribute to the PS investigations by presenting the results of a controlled experiment in a CAVE, focusing on German males in the age of 18 to 30 years. The PS preferences of 27 participants have been sampled while they were approached by either a single embodied, computer-controlled virtual agent (VA) or by a group of three VAs. In order to investigate the influence of a VA's emotions, we altered their facial expression between angry and happy. Our results indicate that the emotion as well as the number of VAs approaching influence the PS: larger distances are chosen to angry VAs compared to happy ones; single VAs are allowed closer compared to the group.

Yet, the neural mechanisms implicated in approach‐avoidance tendencies to distinct emotional expressions have not been fully described. Here, we investigated the neural systems implicated in regulating the distance to different emotions, and how they vary as a function of empathy. Twenty‐three healthy participants assessed for psychopathic traits underwent fMRI scanning while they viewed approaching and withdrawing angry, fearful, happy, sad and neutral faces. Participants were also asked to set the distance to those faces on a computer screen, and to adjust the physical distance from the experimenter outside the scanner. Participants kept the greatest distances from angry faces, and shortest from happy expressions. This was accompanied by increased activation in the dorsomedial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices, inferior frontal gyrus, and temporoparietal junction for angry and happy expressions relative to the other emotions. Irrespective of emotion, longer distances were kept from approaching faces, which was associated with increased activation in the amygdala and insula, as well as parietal and prefrontal regions. Amygdala activation was positively correlated with greater preferred distances to angry, fearful and sad expressions. Moreover, participants scoring higher on coldhearted psychopathic traits (lower empathy) showed reduced amygdala activation to sad expressions. These findings elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying social approach‐avoidance, and how they are related to variations in empathy.

Interpersonal distance is an important nonverbal behavior, and is used to regulate personal space in a complex interplay with other nonverbal behaviors such as eye gaze. In social anxiety, studies regarding the impact of interpersonal distance on within-situation avoidance behavior are so far rare. Thus the present study aimed to scrutinize the relationship between gaze direction, sex, interpersonal distance, and social anxiety in social interactions. Social interactions were modeled in a virtual-reality (VR) environment, where 20 low and 19 high socially anxious women were confronted with approaching male and female characters, who stopped in front of the participant, either some distance away or close to them, and displayed either a direct or an averted gaze. Gaze and head movements, as well as heart rate, were measured as indices of avoidance behavior and fear reactions. High socially anxious participants showed a complex pattern of avoidance behavior: when the avatar was standing farther away, high socially anxious women avoided gaze contact with male avatars showing a direct gaze. Furthermore, they showed avoidance behavior (backward head movements) in response to male avatars showing a direct gaze, regardless of the interpersonal distance. Overall, the current study proved that VR social interactions might be a very useful tool for investigating avoidance behavior of socially anxious individuals in highly controlled situations. This might also be the first step in using VR social interactions in clinical protocols for the therapy of social anxiety disorder.', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 48, 'citationCount': 85, 'journal': {'volume': '13 5', 'pages': '\n          547-54\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Wieser2010VirtualSI,\n author = {M.

In a virtual supermarket, twenty-three female participants differing in social anxiety approached computer-generated persons (avatars) under the pretext of a cover story. During the task, different aspects of approach and avoidance were measured.

It was premised on the basis of proxemics theory that the closer the approach of the virtual characters to the participant, the greater the level of physiological arousal. Physiological arousal was measured by the number of skin conductance responses within a short time period after the approach, and the maximum change in skin conductance level 5 s after the approach. The virtual characters were each either female or a cylinder of human size, and one or four characters approached each subject a total of 12 times. Twelve male subjects were recruited for the experiment. The results suggest that the number of skin conductance responses after the approach and the change in skin conductance level increased the closer the virtual characters approached toward the participants. Moreover, these response variables were inversely correlated with the number of visits, showing a typical adaptation effect. There was some evidence to suggest that the number of characters who simultaneously approached (one or four) was positively associated with the responses. Surprisingly there was no evidence of a difference in response between the humanoid characters and cylinders on the basis of this physiological data. It is suggested that the similarity in this quantitative arousal response to virtual characters and virtual objects might mask a profound difference in qualitative response, an interpretation supported by questionnaire and interview results. Overall the experiment supported the premise that people exhibit heightened physiological arousal the closer they are approached by virtual characters.', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 32, 'citationCount': 133, 'journal': {'volume': '8', 'pages': '3:1-3:12', 'name': 'ACM Trans.

Throughout the model's approach, HR showed a signiﬁcant triphasic change (an initial decrease, a subsequent increase, and then a secondary decrease), whereas subjective feelings of anxiety and tension showed signiﬁcant, gradual increases.

As the BP elevated to a moderate degree in spite of the modest HR changes, total peripheral resistance must have been increasing during the model's approach.

We provide experimental evidence that emotional contagion occurs without direct interaction between people (exposure to a friend expressing an emotion is sufficient), and in the complete absence of nonverbal cues. Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’ positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 15, 'citationCount': 2555, 'journal': {'volume': '111', 'pages': '8788 - 8790', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Kramer2014ExperimentalEO,\n author = {Adam D.

Firstly, using Five Factor Model of personality, another function, personality, is introduced, and its interactions with other functions are explained. Secondly, effective sociality is constructed among agents with different personalities to improve sharing of knowledge and subsequently helpful cooperation. This is important since the fundamental benefit of multi-agent environment is decentralized exploration. Finally, this architecture is implemented in a predator-prey environment, and its selective applications are discussed.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 25, 'citationCount': 7, 'journal': {'pages': '1-6', 'name': '2014 Iranian Conference on Intelligent Systems (ICIS)'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Tavakoli2014ThreeLO,\n author = {Maryam Tavakoli and M.

Recently the concept of serious games has been introduced in both academic and industrial circles. In this paper, we propose an emotion engine, based on modern appraisal theory, that is able to model various emotional crowd characteristics. This appraisal engine is capable of capturing the dynamics of emotional contagion and we show how different crowd composition can lead to different patterns of emotional contagion. In addition, we describe a serious game designed for training military personnel in peaceful crowd control. We evaluate this engine in the context of a property protection protest scenario where the players or soldiers are tasked to maintain a peaceful protest without violence.

Yet in spite of the rapid growth of computational affective modeling, no systematic guidelines exist for model design and analysis. Lack of systematic guidelines contributes to ad hoc design practices, hinders model sharing and re-use, and makes systematic comparison of existing models and theories challenging. Lack of a common computational terminology also hinders cross-disciplinary communication that is essential to advance our understanding of emotions. In this chapter the author proposes a computational analytical framework to provide a basis for systematizing affective model design by: (1) viewing emotion models in terms of two core types: emotion generation and emotion effects, and (2) identifying the generic computational tasks necessary to implement these processes. The chapter then discusses how these computational ‘building blocks’ can support the development of design guidelines, and a systematic analysis of distinct emotion theories and alternative means of their implementation. 1.0 INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES The past 15 years have witnessed a rapid growth in computational models of emotion and affective agent architectures. Researchers in cognitive science, AI, HCI, robotics and gaming are developing ‘models of emotion’, primarily to create more believable and effective synthetic characters and robots, and to enhance human-computer interaction. Less frequently, these models are being developed for basic research purposes, to help elucidate the nature of the mechanisms mediating affective a variety of affective phenomena.

Riots are an increasingly common outcome of sports celebrations, and pose the potential for harm to participants, bystanders, property, and the reputation of the groups with whom participants are associated. Rioting cannot necessarily be attributed to the negative emotions of individuals, such as anger, rage, frustration and despair. For instance, the celebratory behavior (e.g., chanting, cheering, singing) during UConn’s “Spring Weekend” and after the 2004 NCAA Championships resulted in several small fires and overturned cars. Further, not every individual in the area of a riot engages in violence, and those who do, do not do so continuously. Instead, small groups carry out the majority of violent acts in relatively short-lived episodes. Agent-based computer simulations are an ideal method for modeling complex group-level social phenomena, such as celebratory gatherings and riots, which emerge from the interaction of relatively “simple” individuals. By making simple assumptions about individuals’ decision-making and behaviors and allowing actors to affect one another, behavioral patterns emerge that cannot be predicted by the characteristics of individuals. The computer simulation developed here models celebratory riot behavior by repeatedly evaluating a single algorithm for each individual, the inputs of which are affected by the characteristics of nearby actors. Specifically, the simulation assumes that (a) actors possess 1 of 5 distinct social identities (group memberships), (b) actors will congregate with actors who possess the same identity, (c) the degree of social cohesion generated in the social context determines the stability of relationships within groups, and (d) actors’ level of aggression is affected by the aggression of other group members.

This is consistent with the maximum of inverse TMR observed at 20.4 V for Co/STO/LSMO junctions (Fig. 3A). For a positive bias, the TMR is expected to change sign and become normal above 1 V when the Fermi level of LSMO goes down into the energy range of the majority spin d-band of Co. This is also observed in Fig. 3A. For ALO and ALO/STO barriers, a predominant tunneling of s-character electrons (see arrow in Fig. 2B) is the usual explanation of the positive polarization (6–8). The rapid drop with bias (Fig. 3B) is similar to what has been observed in most junctions with ALO barriers, and completely different from what is obtained when the tunneling is predominantly by d-character electrons (Fig. 3A). The origin of this rapid decrease of the TMR at relatively small bias has never been clearly explained. This is roughly consistent with the energy dependence of the DOS induced by sp-d bonding effects on the first atomic layer of ALO in the calculation of Nguyen-Mahn et al. (8) for the Co-ALO interface. But Zhang et al. (13) have also shown that a large part of the TMR drop can be attributed to the excitation of spin waves. The experiments reported here and in several recent publications (3, 4) demonstrate the important role of the electronic structure of the metal-oxide interface in determining the spin polarization of the tunneling electrons. The negative polarization for the Co-STO interface has been ascribed to d-d bonding effects between Al and Ti (4). This interpretation is similar to that proposed to explain, in terms of sp-d bonding, the positive polarization at the Co-ALO interface (8). However, there is no general theory predicting the trend of the experimental results for Co—that is, a negative polarization with oxides of d elements (STO, CLO, Ta2O5) and a positive one when there are only s and p states (ALO). It is likely that the spin polarization should also depend on the position of the Fermi level with respect to the electronic levels of each character above and below the gap of the insulator. In addition, as an evanescent wave in an insulator is a Bloch wave with an imaginary wave vector, one can expect different decay lengths for Bloch waves of different character. This means that the final polarization could also depend on the thickness of the barrier, as illustrated by the calculations of MacLaren et al. for Fe/ZnSe/Fe junctions (14). The influence of the barrier on the spin polarization opens new ways to shape and optimize the TMR. Interesting bias dependencies can be obtained with barriers selecting the d electrons and probing the fine structure of the d-DOS, as in Fig. 3A. The DOS of a d-band can also be easily tailored by alloying (for example, by introduction of virtual bound states) to produce specific bias dependencies. Although here we concentrated on the problem of the spin polarization of the Co electrode and regarded the strongly spin-polarized LSMO only as a useful spin analyzer, the large TMR ratios obtained by combining Co and LSMO electrodes (50% with a STO barrier) are also an interesting result. The drawback arising from the low Curie temperature of LSMO (;350 K) is the reduction of the TMR at room temperature, down to about 5% at 300 K in Co/STO/ LSMO (4). However, other types of oxides of the double-perovskite family (for example, Sr2FeMoO6) combine electronic properties similar to those of manganites with a definitely higher Curie temperature (15). Their use in magnetic tunnel junctions is promising for a new generation of tunnel junctions with very high magnetoresistance for room-temperature applications.', 'year': 1999, 'referenceCount': 11, 'citationCount': 31575, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{McInnes1999EmergenceOS,\n author = {B.

However, as the individuals often moving dynamically, then computing the contagion process becomes a challenge. In this paper, we focused on the emotion contagion effects on dynamic aggregation process of the virtual pedestrian. Firstly, according to the social force theory, we constructed individuals' moving velocities based on their expectations. Secondly, made an adjacent test to generate the nearer neighbors as emotional contagions usually occurred between neighbors. And then we treated the emotional contagions between individuals and their neighbors as the information spreading process so that we calculated the influences on their moving directions through the emotional information spreading model SIR (Susceptible Infective Removal). Social force for simulating moving individuals and SIR model were adopted by our method to simulate the emotional contagion of the crowd.

We submit that in order to enhance believability, the agent's affective state should be accurately modeled and should realistically influence the agent's behavior. We propose a computational model of affect which incorporates an empirically-based interplay between its various affective components - personality, motivation, emotion, and mood. Further, our model captures a number of salient mechanisms that are observable in humans and that influence the agent's behavior. We are therefore hopeful that our model will facilitate more engaging and meaningful human-agent interactions.

Multi-modal social signal classification is insufficient for understanding emotional expressions. Mainly, because many communicative, emotional expressions are not directly related to internal emotional states. Moreover, the recognition of the expression's direction is neglected so far. Even if social signals reveal emotional aspects, the recognition with signal classifiers cannot explain internal appraisal or regulation processes. Using that information is one approach for building cognitive empathic agents with the ability to address observations and motives in an empathic dialogue. In this paper, we introduce a computational model of user emotions for empathic agents. It combines a simulation of appraisal and regulation processes with a social signal interpretation taking directions of expressions into account. Our evaluation shows that social signal sequences can be related to emotion regulation processes.

It integrates three major affective characteristics: emotions, moods and personality that cover short, medium, and long term affect. The use of this model consists of two phases: In the preparation phase appraisal rules and personality profiles for characters must be specified with the help of AffectML - our XML based affect modeling language. In the runtime phase, the specified appraisal rules are used to compute real-time emotions and moods as results of a subjective appraisal of relevant input.

Interactive narrative allows the user to participate in a dynamically unfolding story, by playing a character or by exerting directorial control. By allowing the user to interact, interactive narrative provides a richer and potentially more engaging experience than traditional narrative. Moreover, because different choices of the user lead to different paths through the story, the author of interactive narrative can tailor the experience for the user or user groups. \nThe design of interactive narrative faces many challenges. The central challenge comes from the integration of interactivity into the narrative. Instead of presenting one well-crafted static story, the author has to design the characters' behaviors along many paths through the story in response to possible user interactions. The amount of work can easily overwhelm an author. \nIn this thesis, I present a multi-agent approach to modeling and simulating interactive narrative, implemented as the Thespian framework. Thespian utilizes a two-layer runtime system to drive the characters' interactions with the user. At the base is a multi-agent system comprised of goal-oriented autonomous agents that realize the characters in the story. Above this layer is a proactive director agent that continuously monitors the progress of the story and directs the characters toward the author's plot design goals. In addition to the two-layer runtime system, Thespian contains offline authoring procedures to facilitate the author in configuring the characters. \nThe evaluation of the Thespian framework has been performed at different levels. Various components within Thespian have been individually evaluated or validated. In addition, Thespian's generality in practice for authoring a range of stories has been demonstrated through its many applications in different domains."", 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 11, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Marsella2010ThespianAD,\n author = {S.

This has led to a truly interdisciplinary, mutually beneficial partnership between emotion research in psychology and in computational science, of which this volume is an exemplar. To understand this partnership and its potential for transforming existing practices in emotion research across disciplines and for disclosing important novel areas of research, we explore in this chapter the history of work in computational models of emotion including the various uses to which they have been put, the theoretical traditions that have shaped their development, and how these uses and traditions are reflected in their underlying architectures. For an outsider to the field, the last 15 years have seen the development of a seemingly bewildering array of competing and complementary computational models. Figure 1.2.1 lists a ‘family tree’ of a few of the significant models and the theoretical traditions from which they stem. Although there has been a proliferation of work, the field is far from mature: the goals that a model is designed to achieve are not always clearly articulated; research is rarely incremental, more often returning to motivating theories rather than extending prior computational approaches; and rarely are models contrasted with each other in terms of their ability to achieve their set goals. Contributing to potential confusion is the reality that computational models are complex systems embodying a number of, sometimes unarticulated, design decisions and assumptions inherited from the psychological and computational traditions from which they emerged, a circumstance made worse by the lack of a commonly accepted lexicon even for designating these distinctions. In this chapter, we lay out the work on computational models of emotion in an attempt to reveal the common uses to which they may be put and the underlying techniques and assumptions from which the models are built. Our aim is to present conceptual distinctions and common terminology that can aid in discussion and comparison of competing models. Our hope is that this will not only facilitate an understanding of the field for outside researchers but work towards a lexicon that can help foster the maturity of the field towards more incremental research. In characterizing different computational models of emotion, we begin by describing interdisciplinary uses to which computational models may be put, including their uses in improving human–computer interaction, in enhancing general models of intelligence, and as methodological tools for furthering our understanding of human behaviour. We next discuss how models have been built, including the underlying theoretical traditions that have shaped their development. These differing theoretical perspectives often conceptualize emotion in quite different ways, emphasizing different scenarios and proposed functions, different component processes, and different linkages between these components.

The provision of data alongside its consequent processing has further sought to extend and expand our reasoning faculties as well as effectively aid proper decision making. But data is daily, produced at an exponential rapid rate and the volume in amount of data churned out to be processed even more so that we now require data storage optimization techniques to process such humongous volume of data. These have today, necessitated the need for advancement in data mining process. With the tremendous advances made in data mining, machine learning, storage virtualization and optimization – amongst other fields of computing – researchers now seek a new paradigm and platform called data science. This field today has become quite imperative as it seeks to provide beneficial support in constructing models and algorithms that can effectively assist domain experts and practitioners to make comprehensive and sound decisions regarding potential problematic cases. We focus on modeling social graph using implicit suggest algorithm in medical diagnosis to effectively respond to problematic cases of Tuberculosis (TB) in Nigeria. We introduce spectral clustering and Bayesian Network, construct algorithms cum models for predicting potential problematic cases in Tuberculosis as well as compare the algorithms based on data samples collected from an Epidemiology laboratory at the Federal Medical Center Asaba in Delta State of Nigeria. The volume of data was collated and divided into two data sets which are the training dataset and the investigation dataset.

Conventionally, GAs are neutralized to improve culture yields of mycobacteria. However, there are limited data to support this practice. To study the utility of neutralization of GAs with sodium bicarbonate in children with intrathoracic tuberculosis, a total of 116 children of either sex, aged 6 months to 14 years (median age, 120 months; interquartile range [IQR], 7 to 192 months), underwent gastric aspiration on 2 consecutive days. Gastric aspirates were divided into two aliquots, and only one aliquot was neutralized with 1% sodium bicarbonate. Both aliquots were processed for smear and culture examinations. Out of the 232 gastric aspirates, 12 (5.17%) were acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear positive. There were no differences in smear positivity rates from samples with or without neutralization. The yield of Mycobacterium tuberculosis on a Bactec MGIT 960 culture system was significantly lower in the neutralized samples (16.3% [38/232]) than in the nonneutralized samples (21.5% [50/232]) (P = 0.023). There was no significant difference between the neutralized and the nonneutralized samples in time to detection using the MGIT 960 system (average, 24.6 days; IQR, 12 to 37 days) (P = 0.9).

These disease descriptions remain invaluable for guiding public health policy and research, as the introduction of effective chemotherapy radically changed the history of disease. Specific high-risk groups were identified. Primary infection before 2 years of age frequently progressed to serious disease within the first 12 months without significant prior symptoms. Primary infection between 2 and 10 years of age rarely progressed to serious disease, and such progression was associated with significant clinical symptoms. In children aged >3 years the presence of symptoms represented a window of opportunity in which to establish a clinical diagnosis before serious disease progression. Primary infection after 10 years of age frequently progressed to adult-type disease. Early effective intervention in this group will reduce the burden of cavitating disease and associated disease transmission in the community. Although the pre-chemotherapy literature excluded the influence of human immune deficiency virus (HIV) infection, recent disease descriptions in HIV-infected children indicate that immune-compromised children behave in a similar fashion to immune immature children (less than 2 years of age).

One third of the world population has Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (1). Despite recent progress in the United States, tuberculosis infection remains prevalent in immigrants, immunosuppressed persons, and other high-risk groups (3). Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the most prevalent form of tuberculosis in the United States (2). LTBI can progress to active tuberculosis disease, especially in individuals with a suppressed cell-mediated immunity. Active tuberculosis disease in immuno-suppressed patients can be difficult to diagnose and can progress to disseminated forms of tuberculosis disease associated with high mortality (4). New methods of diagnosing tuberculosis disease have entered practice in recent years (5), but the diagnosis of LTBI can be challenging in some high-risk populations (6, 7). The introduction of directly observed therapy with first-line antituberculous regimens (8) was an important advance in therapy, but multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and the extensively resistant form of MDR-TB remain significant threats to international and local tuberculosis control efforts (9, 10). Screening and Prevention Who should be screened for tuberculosis? Clinicians should screen all individuals at risk for tuberculosis infection, including close contacts of persons who have active pulmonary tuberculosis. Table 1 identifies asymptomatic individuals who should be screened because they are at high risk for exposure to active tuberculosis or at high risk for disease once infected. Table 1. Risk Factors for Tuberculosis Infection or Progression to Disease After Infection What tests are used to screen for tuberculosis? The tuberculin skin test (TST) with purified protein derivative (PPD) and the Mantoux method have been in use for more than 100 years to screen for tuberculosis. The TST result may not become positive for 8 to 10 weeks after exposure to active tuberculosis. The TST can give false-positive results in patient with previous bacille Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccination or other mycobacterial infections and false-negative results in anergic or immunosuppressed patients; however, previous BCG vaccination should not change the interpretation of the TST in most adults. The newer interferon- release assays (IGRAs), including the 2 U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved commercial tests (T-SPOT.TB [Oxford Immunotec, Oxford, United Kingdom], and QuantiFERON-TB Gold and its In-tube version [Cellestis, Valencia, California]) can also be used in circumstances in which the TST is currently used (11). IGRAs assess the T-cell lymphocyte response to specific M. tuberculosis antigens (for example, ESAT-6 and CFP-10) and are more specific, and possibly more sensitive, than TST (12, 13). However, information about IGRA performance is limited in immunocompromised patients and patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy (6, 14). The commercially available IGRAs also have limitations; indeterminate results can occur in immunosuppressed patients, more so with QuantiFERON TB Gold than T-SPOT.TB (6). Discordant results between TST and IGRA testing also occur in about 20% of individuals (13), which could be related, at least in part, to differences in performance characteristics of these tests (5) and to characteristics of the studied populations, such as the prevalence of persons previously vaccinated with BCG and the proportion of persons born outside the United States (15, 16). In addition to their improved specificity compared with TST, IGRAs have several practical advantages. They do not require a second visit for reading and they do not trigger amnestic responses. Longitudinal data supporting the predictive value of IGRA testing is limited, however, in contrast to the many studies of TST for predicting active tuberculosis (17). A recent study from a high-incidence area of tuberculosis in Africa found that initial test results were positive in only 56% of TST testing and 52% of IGRA testing in close household contacts who developed active tuberculosis during 2 years of follow up. Of these close household contacts who developed active tuberculosis, 71% had a positive result with either TST or IGRA during their initial evaluations (18). Another prospective study (19) from a country with a low incidence of tuberculosis suggests that IGRA testing could be more accurate than TST for diagnosing LTBI and for detecting individuals who will progress to active tuberculosis, but more longitudinal data are needed, especially in immunosuppressed individuals. What can patients do to reduce their likelihood of becoming infected with tuberculosis? Tuberculosis is mainly transmitted by the airborne route from a patient with respiratory symptoms, and its ability to infect others decreases significantly after 2 weeks of effective therapy (20, 22). Therefore, prevention of tuberculosis transmission involves promptly identifying and treating patients with active tuberculosis. For hospitalized patients, prevention includes isolating patients with tuberculosis from other patients and strictly applying other hospital infection control practices (23, 24). Patients usually can be removed from airborne infection isolation when they are no longer considered infectious. Patients are no longer infectious when they are on adequate tuberculosis drug therapy, have had a significant clinical response to therapy, and have had negative results on 3 consecutive sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Some patients can be isolated from outsiders at home after appropriate evaluation and the initiation of outpatient treatment. Isolation of patients at home assumes that household contacts already have been exposed and that further exposure will not affect their outcomes. Two studies, one in India and one in Arkansas, showed similar rates of disease or infection in exposed household contacts whether the patient was admitted to the hospital or allowed to remain at home for initial treatment (25, 26). However, if household contacts of the patients with infectious tuberculosis are at high risk (for example, infants or immuno-compromised persons), housing the patient elsewhere until he or she meets noninfectious criteria should be strongly considered. Hospitalization may be required until housing can be obtained (27). Educating health care workers to evaluate exposed persons for active tuberculosis by obtaining sputum for AFB testing when they have respiratory symptoms has been shown to improve the case detection rates in primary care settings (28). What should clinicians tell patients with active tuberculosis to protect household members and other contacts from infection? Clinicians should teach patients to cough into disposable tissues and to cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing to contain droplet nuclei before they are expelled into the air. Patients who are placed in airborne infection isolation rooms should be educated about the transmission of tuberculosis, the reasons for isolation, and the importance of staying in their rooms. Every effort should be made to help the patient follow the isolation policy (29). Hospital employees and physicians who come in contact with an infectious or suspected infectious patient should wear previously fitted particulate respirators certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health for protection against tuberculosis, which does not include surgical masks. What are the physician's public health responsibilities after making a diagnosis of active tuberculosis? All 50 U.S. states require physicians to notify public health authorities about all patients suspected of having active tuberculosis (22, 23), which can enable identification of other cases and potentially prevent further transmission of tuberculosis in the community. Genetic fingerprinting of tuberculosis isolates during an outbreak can help public health authorities detect tuberculosis infection in the community (30). Clinical Bottom Line: Screening and Prevention Clinicians should screen persons who have close contact with a person who has active pulmonary tuberculosis, and screen other persons who are at high risk for infection or for progression to disease once infected. Clinicians should screen with TST or IGRAs and should prevent infection by identifying and treating persons with active pulmonary tuberculosis. Patient airborn infection isolation is an important part of early treatment and prevention of transmission. Persons who provide care to patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis should wear particulate respirators. Clinicians should notify public health authorities about patients with suspected active tuberculosis. Diagnosis What signs and symptoms suggest active tuberculosis? Although tuberculosis can cause disease in many parts of the body, this article focuses on pulmonary tuberculosis because it is the most common form of the disease. Clinicians should consider a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis and evaluate patients for tuberculosis if the patient has constitutional or pulmonary signs and symptoms, such as cough longer than 2 to 3 weeks (may not be productive until later in course of disease), hemoptysis (more likely with cavitation and rarely a presenting symptom), chest pain, fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, easy fatigability, or anorexia. Some patients have classic signs and symptoms, but it is rare for someone to have most of the classic signs and symptoms except in advanced disease, and many patients will have few of them. Some patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis infection can be fairly asymptomatic.

In this paper we describe an AI-based approach that combines inductive learning algorithms and meta-learning methods as a means to compute accurate classification models for detecting electronic fraud. Inductive learning algorithms are used to compute detectors of anomalous or errant behavior over inherently distributed data sets and meta-learning methods integrate their collective knowledge into higher level classification models or meta-classifiers. By supporting the exchange of models or classifier agents among data sites, our approach facilitates the cooperation between financial organizations and provides unified and cross-institution protection mechanisms against fraudulent transactions. Through experiments performed on actual credit card transaction data supplied by two different financial institutions, we evaluate this approach and we demonstrate its utility. Introduction Agent-based learning systems have attracted considerable attention recently. One such system, JAM (Java Agents for Meta-learning) (Stolfo et al. 1997), provides the means of dispatching and executing learning agents at remote database sites, with each learning agent being a Java encapsulated machine learning program. One of JAM ’s key features is meta-learning, a general technique that combines multiple classification models, each of which may have been computed over distributed sites. In this paper, we describe the application of JAM in fraud and intrusion detection in network-based information systems by detailing a comprehensive set of experiments in the real-world application of credit card fraud. Several key new teachniques are reported that address the issues of pruning combined meta-classifiers in order to improve efficiency while maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, experiments are reported on combining classifiers computed over distributed databases with different schemas. We begin with a brief overview of the fraud detection application to highlight the advantages of JAM in distributed learning. Fraud detection A secured and trusted interbanking network for electronic commerce requires high speed verification and authentication mechanisms that allow legitimate users easy access to conduct their business, while thwarting fraudulent transaction attempts by others. Fraudulent electronic transactions are a significant problem, one that grows in importance as the number of access points increase and more services are provided. The traditional way to defend financial information system has been to protect the routers and network infrastructure. Furthermore, to intercept intrusions and fraudulent transactions that inevitably leak through, financial institutions have developed custom fraud detection systems targeted to their own asset bases. Recently however, banks have come to realize that a unified, global approach that involves the periodic sharing of information regarding fraudulent practices is required. In this paper, we describe an AI-based approach that supports the cooperation among different institutions and consists of pattern-directed inference systems that use models of anomalous or errant transaction behaviors to forewarn of fraudulent practices. This approach requires the analysis of large and inherently distributed databases of information about transaction behaviors to produce models of “probably fraudulent” transactions. The key difficulties in this approach are: financial companies don’t share their data for a number of (competitive and legal) reasons; the databases that companies maintain on transaction behavior are huge and growing rapidly; real-time analysis is highly desirable to update models when new events are detected and easy distribution of models in a networked environment is essential to maintain up to date detection capability. To address these difficulties and thereby protect against electronic fraud our approach has two key component technologies: local fraud detection agents that learn how to detect fraud within a single information system, and an integrated meta-learning mechanism that combines the collective knowledge acquired by the An alternative approach to modeling transactions would be to model user behavior. An application of this method, but in cellular phone fraud detection has been examined in (Fawcett & Provost 1997). individual local agents. The fraud detection agents consist of classification models computed by machine learning programs at one or more sites, while meta-learning provides the means to combining a number of separately learned classifiers. Thus, meta-learning allows financial institutions to share their models of fraudulent transactions without disclosing their proprietary data. This way their competitive and legal restrictions can be met, but they can still share information. Furthermore, by supporting the training of classifiers over distributed databases, meta-learning can substantially reduce the total learning time (parallel learning of classifiers over (smaller) subsets of data). The final meta-classifiers (the combined ensemble of fraud detectors) can be used as sentries forewarning of possible fraud by inspecting and classifying each incoming transaction. This paper presents a comprehensive set of experiments evaluating the applicability of our approach in the security of financial information systems. As a test set we use a data set of credit card transactions supplied by two different financial institutions. The task is to compute classification models that accurately discern fraudulent credit card transactions. Our experiments are structured as follows. First we apply several machine learning algorithms on different subsets of data from both banks to establish the potential of inductive learning methods in fraud detection. Then, we overview meta-learning and evaluate its utility by combining the fraud detectors of each bank. In the last part of the paper, we describe the exchange of classifiers between the two banks and provide empirical results for assessing the validity and merit of this approach. By way of summary, we find that pattern-directed inference systems coupled with meta-learning methods constitute a protective shield against fraud with the potential to exceed the performance of existing fraud detection techniques. Computing fraud detectors Machine Learning In this study we employ five different inductive learning programs, Bayes, C4.5, ID3, CART and Ripper. Bayes, implements a naive Bayesian learning algorithm described in (Minksy & Papert 1969), ID3 (Quinlan 1986), its successor C4.5 (Quinlan 1993), and CART (Breiman et al. 1984) are decision tree based algorithms, and Ripper (Cohen 1995) is a rule induction algorithm. Data sets We obtained two large databases from Chase and First Union banks, each with 500,000 records of credit card transaction data spanning one year (Oct.95-Sept.96). Chase bank data consisted, on average, of 42,000 sampled credit card transactions records per month with a 20% fraud and 80% legitimate distribution, whereas First Union data were sampled in a non-uniform (many records from some months, very few from others, very skewed fraud distributions for some months) manner with a total of 15% versus 85% distribution. The schemas of the databases was developed over years of experience and continuous analysis by bank personnel to capture important information for fraud detection. The records have a fixed length of 137 bytes each and about 30 numeric and categorical attributes including the binary class label (fraud/legitimate transaction). Under the terms of the non-disclosure agreement, we can not reveal the details of the schema beyond the following general description: • A (jumbled) account number (no real identifiers) • Scores produced by a COTS authorization/detection system • Date/Time of transaction • Past payment information of the transactor • Amount of transaction • Geographic information: where the transaction was initiated, the location of the merchant and transactor • Codes for validity and manner of entry of the transaction • An industry standard code for the type of merchant • A code for other recent “non-monetary” transaction types by transactor • The age of the account and the card • Other card/account information • Confidential/Proprietary Fields (other potential indicators)', 'year': 1999, 'referenceCount': 14, 'citationCount': 50, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Prodromidis1999AgentBasedDL,\n author = {A.

The organisers of the workshop note that work on emotions “is often carried out in anad hocmanner”, and hope to remedy this by focusing on two themes (a) validation of emotion models and architectures, and (b) relevance of recent findings from affective neuroscience research. I shall focus mainly on (a), but in a manner which, I hope is relevant to (b), by addressing the need for conceptual clarification to remove, or at least reduce, the adhocery, both in modelling and in empirical research. In particular I try to show how a design-based approach can provide an improved conceptual framework and sharpen empirical questions relating to the study of mind and brain. From this standpoint it turns out that what are normally called emotions are a somewhat fuzzy subset of a larger class of states and processes that can arise out of interactions between different mechanisms in an architecture. What exactly the architecture is will determine both the larger class and the subset, since different architectures support different classes of states and processes. In order to develop the design-based approach we need a good ontology for characterising varieties of architectures and the states and processes that can occur in them. At present this too is often a matter of much ad-hocery. We propose steps toward a remedy. Validation vstesting It is good to ask how theories can be validated, though I would rather ask how they can be t sted, and how they can becompared, in various dimensions, such as depth, clarity, generality, precision, explanatory power, etc., since most theories are incomplete, provisional, premature, vague, or just false. So validation is rarely to be expected, even when a theory is the best one available and provides a good basis for further research, a point that is familiar from the writings of Karl Popper (Popper 1934; Magee 1985), and work of Lakatos cited by Dean Petters in this symposium. Copyright c © 2004, American Association for Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. There is, however, a kind of validation of theories of a type Popper did not (as far as I know) admit as science, and many scientists do not acknowledge, partly because of Popper’s influence, namely theories about what is possible (what can occur). Simple logic shows that even a single example validates such a theory. The importance of theories of what is possible and how they are presupposed by the search for laws and regularities which constrain what is possible, was discussed in Sloman (1978, Ch 2). See also (Boden 1990). In particular, contrary to wide-spread views on scientific method, the truth of a statement that something can occur is established by a singleexample – which could be world-shaking (e.g. the discovery that light of low intensity and small wavelength can trigger an electric current when high intensity large wavelength light fails (the photoelectric effect), the discovery in 1919 that light from a star can be deflected by passing near the sun, or Newton’s earlier discovery that white light passing through a prism can be split into beams different colours). However, checking that the description of the example is correct may be non-trivial, especially if it requires the use of concepts that are not yet generally understood or theories that are not yet accepted. For present purposes the study of architectures and the phenomena they support is part of the study of what can exist or occur (deep science) and why, rather than an attempt to discover any new laws about what happens when or what correlates with what (shallow science). But we need to know what we are talking about. What are we talking about? It is sometimes forgotten that the question whether a theory is true or false presupposes an answer to whether it makes sense at all. All theories use concepts , for these are the building blocks of propositions, but insofar as the concepts are obscure, confused, or vague, the theories, and even the questions to which the theories are answers, will be flawed. For instance, if our concept of ‘emotion’ is ambiguous then so also will many questions about emotions be ambiguous, e.g. how emotions evolved, what their functions are, which animals have them, which brain mechanisms produce them, what types there are, whether they are needed for intelligence, whether a foetus has them, etc. Alas, our everyday concept of ‘emotion’ mixes up motivations, attitudes, moods, and other affective states and processes, and is therefore is too deeply flawed to be a useful component of scientific questions and theories for reasons recounted elsewhere. 1 But that does not prevent scientists assuming that these concepts can be used to formulate clear, unambiguous scientific questions or theories. For instance, sometimes people who argue that emotions are needed for intelligence are merely defending the truism that motivation is needed for action, and preferences are needed for selecting between options. However, not everyone would call a motive or preference, however important, an emotion. Wishful thinking isn’t science Sometimes over-generalising the notion of ‘emotion’ is related to a desire to argue that emotions are important in ways not previously acknowledged, e.g. that they are a prerequisite for intelligence. This can be wishful thinking or a trivial truism. If ‘emotion’ is construed so broadly that it covers all goals and preferences the claim that emotions are needed for intelligence is vacuous. On the other hand if it refers more narrowly to the sorts of processes in which one subsystem interferes with or disrupts the normal functioning of another, as happens in many of the states in which people are described as being ‘emotional’ then it is false that emotions arerequiredfor intelligence: on the contrary, emotions of that sort can get in the way of sensible decisions and actions. Monica Croucher and I once argued in 1981 that mechanisms required for intelligence in resource-limited robots in fast-changing environments would inevitably produce thepossibility of emotional states, involving interruption or modulation of one process by another (where the latter is often a fast and therefore relatively stupid process) that detects an urgent need for some change, e.g. using reactive mechanisms labelled ‘alarms’ in Fig. 1. But saying that states of type X can occur as a side-effect of the operation of some mechanism M that is required for intelligence does not imply that states of type X are themselves required for intelligence. Many wishful thinkers misinterpreted that paper as claiming that emotions are requiredfor intelligence, just as they fail to see the obvious flaw in Damasio’s widely quoted reasoning (1994) from the premiss:Damage to frontal lobes impairs both intelligence and emotional capabilitiesto the conclusionEmotions are required for intelligence . A moment’s thought should show that two capabilities could presuppose some common mechanisms without either capability being required for the other. A research community with too much wishful thinking does not advance science. Of course, if I have misread such people and they are merely proposing the truism (noted by Hume, which needs no empirical evidence) that motivation and preferences are required for intelligent thought and actions then that is another manifestation of the ambiguity of the word ‘emotion’. E.g. in (Sloman 2002b; 2002a; 2001; Sloman, Chrisley, & Scheutz To Appear). Figure 1: The CogAff schema defines a crude first-draft division of mechanisms into 9 categories. A particular type of fast, patterndriven, reactive central mechanism, with inputs from and outputs to many other components of the architecture could function as an alarm mechanism able to produce global reorganisation very quickly. Different sorts of alarm systems can produce different sorts of emotions, depending on where the inputs come from where the outputs go, what kinds of decisions are taken and what kinds of output signals are sent. Slower, longer lasting, more easily suppressedispositionalmechanisms can produce long term emotions, such as grief or jealousy. We need finer-grained ontologies We should not put both (i) a general preference for saving effort, and (ii) fear produced by a stampeding herd, in the same conceptual basket when they have so very many differences, including the (relative) permanence of the first and the transience of the second. Or rather, we can put them in a more general basket labelled ‘affect’ which includes sub-categories which might be aptly labelled ‘emotion’, ‘desire’, ‘preference’, ‘attitude’, ‘value’, ‘mood’, etc. I am not claiming that all emotions are short-term (though many emotion theories have that consequence, often not noticed by their proponents). In Wright et al. (1996) we tried to show, at least in outline, how long-term emotions such as grief, could exist in the form of dispositions which only rarely manifest themselves, either because of external triggers (reminders) or because other competing attention-grabbers subside. Many states generally regarded as important human emotions that form the stuff of plays, novels and garden-gate gossip are long term largely dispositional states, including jealousy, vengefulness, family love, obsessive ambition, infatuation, fascination with a mathematical problem, etc. There are other long term affective states such as preferences, and attitudes that are not normally called emotions. Of course, someone who defines an emotion as an episodic state in which there are particular sorts of bodily changes or sensed changes in a body state map will not include some of these long term states as emotions. But that’s just another example of the terminological disarray.

Our aim in this paper is to point the reader at what we perceive to be the most important theoretical and practical issues associated with the design and construction of intelligent agents. For convenience, we divide these issues into three areas (though as the reader will see, the divisions are at times somewhat arbitrary). Agent theory is concerned with the question of what an agent is, and the use of mathematical formalisms for representing and reasoning about the properties of agents. Agent architectures can be thought of as software engineering models of agents; researchers in this area are primarily concerned with the problem of designing software or hardware systems that will satisfy the properties specified by agent theorists. Finally, agent languages are software systems for programming and experimenting with agents; these languages may embody principles proposed by theorists. The paper is not intended to serve as a tutorial introduction to all the issues mentioned; we hope instead simply to identify the most important issues, and point to work that elaborates on them.

With the present tasks, strong evidence was found for an age-related decrement in divided attention performance.

These investigations are carried out by observing group behaviors while the robot interacts with people. Our humanoid robot interacts with children by speaking and making various gestures. It identifies individual children by using a wireless tag system, which helps to promote interaction such as the robot calling a child by name. Accordingly, the robot is capable of interacting with many children, causing spontaneous group behavior from the children around it. Here, group behavior is associated with social relationships among the children themselves. For example, a child may be accompanied by his or her friends and then play together with them. We propose the hypothesis that our interactive robot prompts a child’s friends to accompany him or her; thus, we can estimate their friendship by simply observing their accompanying behaviors.\n \nWe conducted a field experiment for two weeks in a Japanese elementary school to verify this hypothesis. In the experiment, two “Robovie” robots were placed where children could freely interact with them during recesses. As a result, we found that they mostly prompted friend-accompanying behavior. Moreover, we could estimate some of their friendly relationships, in particular among the children who often appeared around the robot. For example, we could estimate 5% of all friendships with 80% accuracy, and 15% of them with nearly 50% accuracy. Thus, this result basically supports our hypothesis on friendship estimation from an interactive humanoid robot. We believe that this ability to estimate human relationships is essential for robots to behave socially.', 'year': 2006, 'referenceCount': 48, 'citationCount': 18, 'journal': {'volume': '7', 'pages': '369-403', 'name': 'Interaction Studies'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Kanda2006AnAF,\n author = {T.

It is certainly indicated for all applications using the user's cognitive processes, such as applications dedicated to training or health. Our study aims to contribute to the design of an expressive virtual human, by identifying and adapting visual factors promoting transcription of emotions. In this paper, we investigate the effect of expressive wrinkles and variation of pupil size. We propose to compare the recognition of basic emotions on a real human and on an expressive virtual human. The virtual human was subject to two different factors: expressive wrinkles and/or pupil size. Our results indicate that emotion recognition rates on the virtual agent are high. Moreover, expressive wrinkles affect emotion recognition. The effect of pupillary size is less significant.

In the current experiments, we tested the hypothesis that the receiver’s perception of mental states is grounded in expressive eye appearance that serves an optical function for the sender. Specifically, opposing features of eye widening versus eye narrowing that regulate sensitivity versus discrimination not only conveyed their associated basic emotions (e.g., fear vs. disgust, respectively) but also conveyed opposing clusters of complex mental states that communicate sensitivity versus discrimination (e.g., awe vs. suspicion). This sensitivity-discrimination dimension accounted for the majority of variance in perceived mental states (61.7%). Further, these eye features remained diagnostic of these complex mental states even in the context of competing information from the lower face.

The challenge stems partly from the complexity and fluidity of this social process, but also from its covert nature. One powerful tool to enhance experimental control over such dynamic social interactions has been the use of avatars in virtual reality (VR); information about an individual in such an interaction can be collected through the analysis of his or her neurophysiological and behavioral responses. We have developed a unique platform, the Empathy-Enhancing Virtual Evolving Environment (EEVEE), which is built around three main components: (1) different avatars capable of expressing feelings and emotions at various levels based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS); (2) systems for measuring the physiological responses of the observer (heart and respiration rate, skin conductance, gaze and eye movements, facial expression); and (3) a multimodal interface linking the avatar's behavior to the observer's neurophysiological response. In this article, we provide a detailed description of the components of this innovative platform and validation data from the first phases of development. Our data show that healthy adults can discriminate different negative emotions, including pain, expressed by avatars at varying intensities. We also provide evidence that masking part of an avatar's face (top or bottom half) does not prevent the detection of different levels of pain.

In this paper, we review theoretical frameworks and empirical findings on age effects on decoding emotional expressions, with an emphasis on age-of-face effects. We conclude that the age of the face plays an important role for facial expression decoding. Lower expressivity, age-related changes in the face, less elaborated emotion schemas for older faces, negative attitudes toward older adults, and different visual scan patterns and neural processing of older than younger faces may lower decoding accuracy for older faces.

These faces can be used as well-controlled, realistic and dynamic stimuli in emotion research. However, the validity of virtual facial expressions in comparison to natural emotion displays still needs to be shown for the different emotions and different age groups. Methodology/Principal Findings Thirty-two healthy volunteers between the age of 20 and 60 rated pictures of natural human faces and faces of virtual characters (avatars) with respect to the expressed emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and neutral. Results indicate that virtual emotions were recognized comparable to natural ones. Recognition differences in virtual and natural faces depended on specific emotions: whereas disgust was difficult to convey with the current avatar technology, virtual sadness and fear achieved better recognition results than natural faces. Furthermore, emotion recognition rates decreased for virtual but not natural faces in participants over the age of 40. This specific age effect suggests that media exposure has an influence on emotion recognition. Conclusions/Significance Virtual and natural facial displays of emotion may be equally effective. Improved technology (e.g. better modelling of the naso-labial area) may lead to even better results as compared to trained actors. Due to the ease with which virtual human faces can be animated and manipulated, validated artificial emotional expressions will be of major relevance in future research and therapeutic applications.', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 46, 'citationCount': 109, 'journal': {'volume': '3', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Dyck2008RecognitionPO,\n author = {M.

In this study, the authors examined how observed pupillary size modulates processing of facial expression, extending the finding that incidentally perceived pupils influence ratings of sadness but not those of happy, angry, or neutral facial expressions. Healthy subjects rated the valence and arousal of photographs depicting facial muscular expressions of sadness, surprise, fear, and disgust. Pupil sizes within the stimuli were experimentally manipulated. Subjects themselves were scored with an empathy questionnaire. Diminishing pupil size linearly enhanced intensity and valence judgments of sad expressions (but not fear, surprise, or disgust). At debriefing, subjects were unaware of differences in pupil size across stimuli. These observations complement an earlier study showing that pupil size directly influences processing of sadness but not other basic emotional facial expressions. Furthermore, across subjects, the degree to which pupil size influenced sadness processing correlated with individual differences in empathy score.

In this questionnaire, subjects had to evaluate explicit mental capacities of target characters (e.g., capacity to feel hunger). However, we sometimes perceive minds in non-living entities, even though we cannot attribute these evidently biological capacities to the entity. In this study, we performed a large-scale web survey to assess mind perception by using the semantic differential scale method. We revealed that two mind dimensions “emotion” and “intelligence,” respectively, corresponded to the two mind dimensions (experience and agency) proposed in a previous mind perception study.

In particular, he hypothesized that a person's response to a humanlike robot would abruptly shift from empathy to revulsion as it approached, but failed to attain, a lifelike appearance. This descent into eeriness is known as the uncanny valley. The essay appeared in an obscure Japanese journal called Energy in 1970, and in subsequent years, it received almost no attention. However, more recently, the concept of the uncanny valley has rapidly attracted interest in robotics and other scientific circles as well as in popular culture. Some researchers have explored its implications for human-robot interaction and computer-graphics animation, whereas others have investigated its biological and social roots. Now interest in the uncanny valley should only intensify, as technology evolves and researchers build robots that look human. Although copies of Mori's essay have circulated among researchers, a complete version hasn't been widely available.

74,50dbf733e1bf8bb210a9c4ddd1d687dade014182,Empirical Evaluation of the Interplay of Emotion and Visual Attention in Human-Virtual Human Interaction,"We examined the effect of rendering style and the interplay between attention and emotion in users during interaction with a virtual patient in a medical training simulator. The virtual simulation was rendered representing a sample from the photo-realistic to the non-photorealistic continuum, namely Near-Realistic, Cartoon or Pencil-Shader. In a mixed design study, we collected 45 participants’ emotional responses and gaze behavior using surveys and an eye tracker while interacting with a virtual patient who was medically deteriorating over time. We used a cross-lagged panel analysis of attention and emotion to understand their reciprocal relationship over time. We also performed a mediation analysis to compare the extent to which the virtual agent’s appearance and his affective behavior impacted users’ emotional and attentional responses. Results showed the interplay between participants’ visual attention and emotion over time and also showed that attention was a stronger variable than emotion during the interaction with the virtual human.",2019,44,5,{'name': 'ACM Symposium on Applied Perception 2019'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Volonte2019EmpiricalEO,\n author = {Matias Volonte and Reza Ghaiumy Anaraky and Bart P.

We empirically evaluated the effects of near visually realistic vs. non-realistic stylized appearance of virtual humans on the emotional response of participants in a medical virtual reality system that was designed to educate users in recognizing the signs and symptoms of patient deterioration. In a between-subjects experiment protocol, participants interacted with one of three different appearances of a virtual patient, namely visually realistic, cartoon-shaded and charcoal-sketch like conditions in a mixed reality simulation. Emotional impact were measured via a combination of quantitative objective measures were gathered using skin Electrodermal Activity (EDA) sensors, and quantitative subjective measures such as the Differential Emotion Survey (DES IV), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and Social Presence questionnaire. The emotional states of the participants were analyzed across four distinct time steps during which the medical condition of the virtual patient deteriorated (an emotionally stressful interaction), and were contrasted to a baseline affective state. Objective EDA results showed that in all three conditions, male participants exhibited greater levels of arousal as compared to female participants. We found that negative affect levels were significantly lower in the visually realistic condition, as compared to the stylized appearance conditions. Furthermore, in emotional dimensions of interest-excitement, surprise, anger, fear and guilt participants in all conditions responded similarly. However, in social emotional constructs of shyness, presence, perceived personality, and enjoyment-joy, we found that participants responded differently in the visually realistic condition as compared to the cartoon and sketch conditions.

A theory called the 'Uncanny Valley' has been used to describe the phenomenon that the appearance of a virtual character can contribute to negative/positive audience reactions to that character [Mori 1970]. Since the style used to render a character strongly changes the appearance, we investigate whether a difference in render style can indirectly influence audience reaction, which we measure based on perception of personality. Based on psychology research, we first scripted original character dialogues in order to convey a range of ten typical personality types. Then, a professional actor was recruited to act out these dialogues, while his face and body motion and audio were recorded. The performances were mapped onto a virtual character rendered in two styles that differ in appearance: an appealing cartoon style and unappealing ill style (Figure 1). In our experiment, participants were asked questions about the character's personality in order for us to test if the difference in render style causes differences in personality perception. Our results found an indirect effect of render style where the cartoon style was rated as having a more agreeable personality than the ill style.

This study used morph continua based on human and highly realistic computer-generated (avatar) faces to represent the DHL. Total number and dwell time of fixations to facial features were recorded while participants (N\u2009=\u200960) judged avatar versus human category membership of the faces in a forced choice categorization task. Fixation and dwell data confirmed the face feature hierarchy (eyes, nose, and mouth in this order of importance) across the DHL. There were no further findings for fixation. A change in the relative importance of these features was found for dwell time, with greater preferential processing of eyes and mouth of categorically ambiguous faces compared with unambiguous avatar faces. There were no significant differences between ambiguous and human faces. These findings applied for men and women, though women generally dwelled more on the eyes to the disadvantage of the nose. The mouth was unaffected by gender. In summary, the relative importance of facial features changed on the DHL’s non-human side as a function of categorization ambiguity.

However, we actually hold considerable sway over our emotions: We influence which emotions we have and how we experience and express these emotions. The process model of emotion regulation described here suggests that how we regulate our emotions matters. Regulatory strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have quite different outcomes than strategies that act later. This review focuses on two widely used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing how we think about a situation in order to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It involves inhibiting the outward signs of emotion. Theory and research suggest that reappraisal is more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases the experience and behavioral expression of emotion, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease the experience of emotion, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding in both the suppressors and their social partners.', 'year': 2001, 'referenceCount': 20, 'citationCount': 1215, 'journal': {'volume': '10', 'pages': '214 - 219', 'name': 'Current Directions in Psychological Science'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Gross2001EmotionRI,\n author = {J.

It therefore opposes the •stance taken by Zajonc, which reflects two widespread misunderstandings about what is meant by cognitive processes in emotion: (a) that a cognitive appraisal of the significance of an encounter for one\'s well-being must occur in fixed stages through the information processing of initially meaningless inputs from the environment; and (b) that such an appraisal is necessarily deliberate, rational, and conscious. Some of the phylogenetic and ontogenetic implications of a cognitive theory of emotion are also discussed briefly. Recent years have seen a major change in the way psychologists view emotion—the rediscovery that emotions are products of cognitive processes. The emotional response is elicited by an evaluative perception in lower animals, and in humans by a complex \'cognitive appraisal of the significance of events for one\'s well-being. Although there are many other issues concerning the relations between emotion and cognition, my comments will focus on the role of thought in the emotional response. I will refer often to Zajonc\'s (1980) challenge to the assumption that cognition occurs prior to emotion. I use his views to illustrate widespread misunderstandings of what it means to speak of cognition as a causal antecedent of emotion; I also use his views as a point of departure for rny argument that cognitive activity is a necessary as well as sufficient condition of emotion. Do Emotions Require Cognitive Mediation? My own position on this question is a variant of a family of theories of emotion centered on the concept of cognitive appraisal. Campos and Sternberg (1981) state, for example, that ""The recent history of the study of emotion has been dominated by approaches stressing cognitive factors. In theories of adult emotional response, cognitive appraisal now functions as the central construct"" (p. 273). Its role is, to mediate the relationship between the person and the environment. The appraisal process gives rise to a particular emotion with greater or lesser intensity depending on how the relationship is evaluated with respect to the person\'s well-being. Cognitive appraisal means that the way one interprets one\'s plight at any given moment is crucial to the emotional response. Cognition and emotion are usually fused in nature (Folkman, Schaefer, & Lazarus, 1979), although they can be dissociated in certain unusual or abnormal states. For example, cognitive coping processes (cf. Lazarus, 1981) such as isolation and intellectualization (or detachment), which are aimed at regulating feelings, can create a dissociation between thoughts and feelings. Moreover, attack can occur without anger, and avoidance without fear. These latter conditions are also instances in which the usual link between thought and feeling has been loosened or broken. Yet such separations are less often a rule of living and more often a product of coping under special circumstances. The full experience of emotion (as opposed to sham rage, for example) normally includes three fused components: thoughts, action impulses, and somatic disturbances. When these components are dissociated we are left with something other than what we mean by a true emotional state. Our theories of emotion must reflect the normal fusion, and separating thoughts, action impulses, and so^ matic disturbances except under certain specifiable conditions (as was done in the old days of faculty psychology—which treated cognition, emotion, and motivation as independent entities) distorts rather than clarifies the structure of the mind (cf. Lazarus, Coyne, & Folkman, 1982). One bit of fallout from the above analysis is the implication, often derived from statements of cognitive theory, that cognitive appraisal is a necessary I wish to thank my research colleague, Susan Folkman, and my secretary, Carol Carr, for providing substantial editorial advice on this article. I appreciate their skill and judgment. Requests for reprints should be sent to Richard S.

AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST • SEPTEMBER 1982 • 1019 0003-066X/82/3709-1019$00.75 I as well as sufficient condition of emotion. Such a position has been criticized trenchantly by Zajonc (1980). He writes that affect is erroneously regarded in contemporary psychological theory as postcognitive, occurring only after extensive cognitive operations have taken place, and that in actuality affective judgments are fairly independent of, and even precede, the perceptual and cognitive activities on which they are said to depend. Zajonc argues that not only can affect occur without extensive perceptual and cognitive encoding—and even before—but that affect and cognition are controlled by separate and partially independent neural systems (see also Tomkins, 1981). Zajonc thus seems to be saying two things contrary to what I have argued: first, that the proposed directionality in which cognition determines affect is wrorig and that the actual direction is affect to cognition; and second, that cognition and affect should be regarded as relatively independent subsystems rather than as fused and highly interdependent. Building his argument, Zajonc cites a stanza of poetry from e. e. cummings (1973): since feeling is first who pays any attention to the syntax of things will never wholly kiss you. (p. 160) He also cites Wundt\'s (1907) concept of affective primacy, and Bartlett (1932), Ittelson (1973), Osgood (1962), and Premack (1976) as having adopted the view that feelings come first. He states, for example: . < In fact, it is entirely possible that the very first stage of the organism\'s reaction to stimuli and the very first elements in retrieval are affective. It is further possible that we can like something or be afraid of it before we know precisely what it is and perhaps even without knowing what it is. (p. 154) The most serious mistake in Zajonc\'s analysis lies in his approach to cognition, which is characteristic of much of present-day cognitive psychology. In this approach information and meaning stem from the conception of mind as an analogue to a computer (Shannon & Weaver, 1962), a view illustrated also by the work of Newell and Simon (1961) and Weiner (I960). This conception has been rebutted by Dreyfus (1972), Polanyi (1958, 1966), and others, although the rebuttal has not affected the mainstream of cognitive psychology. The mainstream stance is that meanings for decision and action are built up from essentially meaningless stimulus display elements or bits and that systematic scanning of this display generates information. Thus, human cognition, like the operations of a computer, proceeds by serially receiving, registering, encoding, storing for the shortor longrun, and ""retrieving meaningless bits—a transformation to meaning that is called ""information processing."" Meanings and their associated emotions, or hot cognitions as Abelson (1963) referred to them, are built through such processing. As Erdelyi (1974) and others (e.g., Neisser, 1967) have suggested, however, emotion can influence the process at any of its stages. With this in mind, it is not surprising that Zajonc might be troubled by the implication that emotion lies at the end of a tortuous cognitive chain of information processing, and therefore find it necessary to suggest an independent system making possible rapid, nonreflective emotional reactions. As many have argued (Folkman et al., 1979; Wrubel, Benner, & Lazarus, 1981), humans are meaning-oriented, meaning-creating creatures who constantly evaluate events from the perspective of their well-being and react emotionally to some of these evaluations. Zajonc is therefore correct in asserting that meanings are immediately inherent in emotionally laden transactions without lengthy or sequential processing, but for the wrong reasons. In my view, the concept of meaning defined by the traditional information processing approach subscribed to by Zajonc has a perfectly reasonable-—and better—alternative. We do not always have to await revelation from information processing to unravel the environmental code. As was argued in the New Look movement in perception, personal factors such as beliefs, expectations, and motives or commitments influence attention and appraisal at the very outset of any encounter. Concern with individual differences leads inevitably to concern with personal meanings and to the factors that shape such meanings. We actively select and shape experience and in some degree mold it to our own requirements (see also Rychlak, 1981). Information processing as an exclusive model of cognition is insufficiently concerned with the person as a source of meaning. The history of debate about the phenomenon of subception is instructive (see Eriksen, 1956, 1960, 1962; Lazarus, 1956; Lazarus & McCleary, 1951). In a controversial experiment, McCleary and I showed that by associating a set of nonsense syllables to the threat of a painful electric shock, subjects would later react with a galvanic skin response selectively to the shock-associated syllables, even when they had misperceived and misreported, them. We referred to this phenomenon as ""autonomic discrimination without awareness,"" or ""sub1020 • SEPTEMBER 1982 • AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST ception,"" arguing that subjects somehow sensed the threat without consciously recognizing the syllables. The debate sparked by this interpretation touched on many complex issues, but it mainly centered on a claim by Bricker and Chapanis (1953) and Eriksen (1956, 1960, 1962) that even though the subjects had misreported what had been flashed on the screen, they probably had registered perceptually some of the structural elements of the syllables and had, in effect, reacted automatica', 'year': 1982, 'referenceCount': 38, 'citationCount': 1439, 'journal': {'volume': '37', 'pages': '1019-1024', 'name': 'American Psychologist'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Lazarus1982ThoughtsOT,\n author = {R.

There is evidence that findings at the level of performance, subjective experience, and neural systems can be linked, even though they are not yet reducible to a single theory. Studies to date reveal some properties of a complex neural mechanism involved in our awareness of a stimulus. The time course of operation of this mechanism can be studied objectively and shown to be related both to changes in performance and to subjective experience. This attentional mechanism is involved in the skilled performance of daily life, but many other systems are also important in determining the degree to which natural tasks can be time shared. The goal of every science is a cumulative development of its theoretical structure so that a larger part of its subject matter is explicable in terms of simpler principles. This traditional view of science has been challenged in psychology from many sources. One argument has been that it is better to view psychology in terms of shifting paradigms (Kuhn, 1962). It often seems to be accepted, almost as a matter of course, that in psychology no cumulative development will take place. A different challenge to the view of psychology as a cumulative science is the notion that nothing new is discovered while the views of Helmholtz, Wundt, or some other elder of the field are being reworked, with no apparent gain in either insight or scope. These two challenges to the cumulative nature of psychological theory are persuasive, but they are hot consistent. If we shift from paradigm to paradigm, it seems puzzling that the current paradigm would so exactly mirror that of 100 years ago. On the other hand, if the solutions of 100 years ago remain, what has happened to paradigm shifts? Another criticism that has been applied to the 168 • FEBRUARY 1982 • AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST study of attention is that psychological theories are sterile, in that they do not illuminate important natural behavior or provide a perspective on the nature of mind (Neisser, 1976). The contention in this article is that one can see emerging from psychological research in the area of attention a cumulative development of theoretical concepts that rely on principles, some over 100 years old, that are now elaborated in ways that were essentially unavailable to earlier researchers. Moreover, taken as a whole these ideas do provide insight into the skills of daily life. If this contention is correct, why is it that the cumulative development of psychological theories of attention arfe so obscure, even to/ researchers in the field? I believe that several facts about the nature of psychological inquiry make its cumulative development obscure even to those who read the psychological literature. The first difficulty in perceiving the cumulative nature of theories arises because much work in psychology is fueled by tests between complex theoretical views that differ in only subtle ways. These theories often have common assumptions, but similarities between them that amount to a common core of agreed principles are overlooked. The view of experiments as tests among competing, wellspecified theories can be contrasted with the more cumulative theoretical approach outlined by Broadbent (1958): The proper road for progress then is to set up theories which are not at first detailed, although they must be capable of disproof. As research advances the theory will become continually more detailed, until one reaches the stage at which further advance is made by giving exact values to constants previously left unspecified in equaThis article was presented as a Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award address at the meeting of the' American Psychological Association, Los Angeles, September 1981.

True experiments control for spuriousness by random assignment, but random assignment limits true experimental studies to independent variables that can be manipulated. Like any statistical method, cross-lagged analysis is based on a set of assumptions: synchronicity and stationarity. Different forms of stationarity have different consequences for both the changes in the synchronous correlations over time and the difference between cross-lags. Homogeneous stability is a necessary assumption in the identification of both the source and direction of a causal effect. Cross-lagged analysis is a low-power test. It is better adapted than either multiple regression or factor analysis for many questions in panel studies. Multiple regression must assume no errors of measurement in the independent variables and no correlated errors, while factor analysis must specify a particular factor structure.

Cross-lagged panel models (CLPM), also referred to as cross-lagged path models and cross-lagged regression models, are estimated using panel data, or longitudinal data where each observation or person is recorded at multiple points in time. The models are considered ""crossed"" because they estimate relationships from one variable to another and vice-versa. They are considered ""lagged"" because they estimate relationships between variables across different time points. Taken together, cross-lagged panel models estimate the directional influence variables have on each other over time. The primary goal of cross-lagged panel models is to examine the causal influences between variables. In essence, cross-lagged panel analysis compares the relationship between variable X at Time 1 and variable Y at Time 2 with the relationship between variable Y at Time 1 and X at Time 2. It is widely used to examine the stability and relationships between variables over time to better understand how variables influence each other over time.

We propose that basic emotion theories no longer explain adequately the vast number of empirical observations from studies in affective neuroscience, and we suggest that a conceptual shift is needed in the empirical approaches taken to the study of emotion and affective psychopathologies. The circumplex model of affect is more consistent with many recent findings from behavioral, cognitive neuroscience, neuroimaging, and developmental studies of affect. Moreover, the model offers new theoretical and empirical approaches to studying the development of affective disorders as well as the genetic and cognitive underpinnings of affective processing within the central nervous system.This work was supported in part by NIMH Grants MH01232, MH59139, MH36197, MHK02-74677, and MH068318; a grant from the National Alliance for Research in Schizophrenia and Affective Disorders (NARSAD); NSF Grant BSC-0421702; and funding from the Thomas D.

However, we actually hold considerable sway over our emotions: We influence which emotions we have and how we experience and express these emotions. The process model of emotion regulation described here suggests that how we regulate our emotions matters. Regulatory strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have quite different outcomes than strategies that act later. This review focuses on two widely used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing how we think about a situation in order to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It involves inhibiting the outward signs of emotion. Theory and research suggest that reappraisal is more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases the experience and behavioral expression of emotion, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease the experience of emotion, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding in both the suppressors and their social partners.', 'year': 2001, 'referenceCount': 20, 'citationCount': 1215, 'journal': {'volume': '10', 'pages': '214 - 219', 'name': 'Current Directions in Psychological Science'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Gross2001EmotionRI,\n author = {J.

Two important aspects of such characters will be that they appear emotional and that they can engage in social interactions. My basic approach to these problems has been to use a broad agent architecture and minimal amounts of modeling of other agent in the environment. This approach is based on an understanding of the artistic nature of the problem. To enable agent-builders (artists) to create emotional agents, I provide a general framework for building emotional agents, default emotion-processing rules, and discussion about how to create quality, emotional characters. My framework gets a lot of its power from being part of a broad agent architecture. The concept is simple: the agent will be emotionally richer if there are more things to have emotions about and more ways to express them. This reliance on breadth has also meant that I have been able to create simple emotion models that rely on perception and motivation instead of deep modeling of other agents and complex cognitive processing. To enable agent builders to create social behaviors for believable agents, I have designed a methodology that provides heuristics for incorporating personality into social behaviors and suggests how to model other agents in the environment. I propose an approach to modeling other agents that calls for limiting the amount of modeling of other agents to that which is sufficient to create the desired behavior. Using this technique, I have been able to build robust social behaviors that use surprisingly little representation. I have used this methodology to build a number of social behaviors, like negotiation and making friends. I have built three simulations containing seven agents to drive and test this work.', 'year': 1996, 'referenceCount': 129, 'citationCount': 488, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Bates1996BelievableSA,\n author = {J.

Taking the concern realisation function as a starting point, it is argued that the major phenomena of emotion follow from considerations of what properties a subsystem implementing that function should have. The major phenomena are: the existence of the feelings of pleasure and pain, the importance of cognitive or appraisal variables, the presence of innate, pre-programmed behaviours as well as of complex constructed plans for achieving emotion goals, and the occurrence of behavioural interruption, disturbance and impulse-like priority of emotional goals. The system properties underlying these phenomena are facilities for relevance detection of events with regard to the multiple concerns, availability of relevance signals that can be recognised by the action system, and facilities for control precedence, or flexible goal priority ordering and shift.

It\'s clear enough why both interests are engaged by the task of building computer tools for human use. But it has not always been obvious how to produce an effective merger of the two. Memory is only too fresh of the days in which programmers programmed only for other programmers, and psychologists only carped. Not long enough gone is the time when human factors specialists were called in to bless a system shortly before it was marketed, and if allowed to do an evaluation at all, took so long and learned so little as to be classified as an expense.

There has been a sea change in attitudes. Designers and programmers have inscribed the words ""user friendly"" on their doorposts, while whole divisions of Fortune 500 companies have focused their efforts on usability. Tools ""such as user interface management systems have been developed to make it easier to focus on the issue, and a number of user-oriented inventions like windows, mice and icons have actually found their way into wide use. Methods for informing the design and development process have also improved dramatically. The most effective improvements have come from the introduction of techniques by which new ideas can be tried and tested for usability quickly, cheaply, and very early in the development cycle. In one, the ""Wizard-of-Oz"" method pioneered by John Gould (Gould, Conti and Hovanyecz, 1983), new system functions or features are evaluated before anything at all is built by having a hidden human play the role of the would-be computer. Another extremely effective methodology that is being applied with increasing frequency and benefit is rapid iterative user testing during development. Feedback from tests of small numbers of representative users suggests modifications of an early prototype which are quickly made, similarly tested, loop. An exemplary application is described by Good, Whiteside and Wixon (1984), who obtained a manyfold reduction in user difficulties by iteratively redesigning an interface on the basis of experience with a prototype installed in a shopping center test facility. Still another promising technique has been the development of approximate computational models of users that allow ""ballpark"" evaluations of certain aspects of interfaces during the design phase itself (Card, Moran and Newell, 1983; Kieras and Polson, 1985) Also, of course, there has been a considerable accumulation of art and wisdom on the part of both human factors people and designers who have been paying attention to these matters, and much of it has been capttlred in compendia of design guidelines (e.g. Smith and Mosier, 1984), and is even beginning to be frozen into requirements and standards. What\'s next? I believe there are important opportunities for a deeper synergy between behavioral analysis and the powerful techniques of computer science for realizing systems that help with intellectual tasks, I believe that we should broaden the conception of our role as workers', 'year': 1986, 'referenceCount': 11, 'citationCount': 50, 'journal': {'pages': '333-335'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Landauer1986PsychologyAA,\n author = {T.

For their aims, it is very important for the PRVAs to be trusted by users. However, trustworthy the PRVA design was not be studied yet. In this paper, we suggest the user’s trust transition model that is consisted by two parameters. One parameter is user’s emotion, and the other is agent’s knowledge. We suggested the transition operators that transited these two parameters by executing when the PRVAs recommend. Emotion transition operators are agent’s smile and gestures. Knowledge transition operators is long product recommendation text. We carried on three experiments to estimate these model and transition operators. In experiment 1, we executed no transition operators. In experiment 2, we executed emotion transition operators and added knowledge transition operators in the latter half. In experiment 3, we executed knowledge transition operators in the first half and added emotion transition operators in the latter half. As a results, it is discovered that transition operators and a transition model are effective. In experiment 1, there are no transition in the participants’ trust state. In experiment 2, the participants’ knowledge perceived and trust for agent transited after executing knowledge transition operators. In experiment 3, the participants’ emotion transited after executing positive emotion operators, however, trust didn’t transited. From these result, we concluded that trust is based on each of the user’s emotion and the agent’s knowledge.",2017,16,0,"{'name': 'Transactions of The Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence', 'volume': '32'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Matsui2017DesignOA,\n author = {T.

In this paper, we address the question whether robot mood displayed during an imitation game can (a) be recognized by participants and (b) produce contagion effects. Robot mood was displayed by applying a generic framework for mood expression using body language. By modulating the set of available behavior parameters in this framework for controlling pose and motion dynamics, the gestures performed by the humanoid robot NAO were adjusted to display either a positive or negative mood. In the study performed, we varied both mood as well as task difficulty. Our results show that participants are able to differentiate between positive and negative robot mood. Moreover, self-reported mood matches the mood of the robot in the easy task condition. Additional evidence for mood contagion is provided by the fact that we were able to replicate an expected effect of negative mood on task performance: in the negative mood condition participants performed better on difficult tasks than in the positive mood condition, even though participants' self-reported mood did not match that of the robot."", 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 41, 'citationCount': 48, 'journal': {'pages': '973-980'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Xu2014RobotMI,\n author = {Junchao Xu and J.

The objective of this study is to apply a social relationship perspective to the design of interfaces for PRAs. We investigate the effects of applying anthropomorphic interfaces—namely, humanoid embodiment and voice output—on users' perceived social relationship with a technological and software-based artifact designed for electronic commerce contexts. The findings from a laboratory experiment indicate that using humanoid embodiment and human voice-based communication significantly influences users' perceptions of social presence, which in turn enhances users' trusting beliefs, perceptions of enjoyment, and ultimately, their intentions to use the agent as a decision aid. These results extend the applicability of theories concerning traditional shopper-salesperson relationships to customers' interactions with technological artifacts residing on Web sites—that is, the recommendation agent software—and provide practitioners with guidelines on how to design Internet stores with the goal of building social relationships with online shoppers and enhancing their overall shopping experiences."", 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 136, 'citationCount': 500, 'journal': {'volume': '25', 'pages': '145 - 182', 'name': 'Journal of Management Information Systems'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Qiu2009EvaluatingAP,\n author = {Lingyun Qiu and I.

Considering emotions of the intended users in the software engineering can uncover new requirements to improve and more accepted the system. While emotion is paying much attention nowadays, there is lacking systematic way to model the emotion based system. Without the systematic approach, it is hard to debug, design and develop an emotion based system. Since the emotional requirement of people has not being fully investigated, the research outcome propose the emotion modelling as part of the complete set of agent-oriented modelling for virtual character in eLearning system, The contribution of this paper is to introduce agent oriented modelling to systematic model an emotion based solution for an eLearning system and instructional video design. With the emotion model, it can serve as a guide to design, redesign, and discuss the emotion elements among the software development team.

It describes an approach for modeling complex systems that consist of people, devices, and software agents in a changing environment (sometimes known as distributed sociotechnical systems). The authors take an agent-oriented view, as opposed to the more common object-oriented approach. Thinking in terms of agents (which they define as the human and man-made components of a system), they argue, can change the way people think of software and the tasks it can perform. The book offers an integrated and coherent set of concepts and models, presenting the models at three levels of abstraction corresponding to a motivation layer (where the purpose, goals, and requirements of the system are described), a design layer, and an implementation layer. It compares platforms by implementing the same models in four different languages; compares methodologies by using a common example; includes extensive case studies; and offers exercises suitable for either class use or independent study.

However, as human behaviour can change under the effect of emotions, it is essential to create models of artificial agents and simulations that mimic such behaviour in order to make prediction of the overall system performance. In emotional agents, the role of emotional contagion is important. Emotional contagion is a result of interaction between agents which could affect each others emotions. It is the case that in emergency situations, emotions (especially calmness, fear and panic) may propagate in various ways, depending on the agents personality type as well as other factors. In this paper, we review various methods of emotional contagion. In order to develop emotional agent simulation, we start from a formal state-based modelling method and devise a number of variations of known emotional contagion methods. NetLogo visual simulation is used, in which a number of experiments is conducted. The results are useful to demonstrate different behaviour of different emotional contagion models in the evacuation of an open square area.",2014,17,8,{'pages': '49:1-49:11'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Ntika2014ExperimentsWE,\n author = {Marina Ntika and I.

Many domain areas require agents to be able to demonstrate an emotional reaction to stimuli, beliefs, goals, communication etc., thus exhibiting a believable behaviour. On the other hand, little has been said on how formal methods could integrate emotions in a form of rigorous mathematical notation. This paper is an initial attempt to infuse a formal modelling method for reactive agents, namely X-machines, with appropriate attributes that model artificial emotions. X-machines are finite state-based models extended with memory as well as functions that are applied on input and memory values. X-machines have been shown to be particularly useful to model reactive agents. The computation, that is the overall behaviour of an agents, is a sequence of states reached through the application of transition functions (actions that an agent performs). This computation is amended when artificial emotions are involved, thus leading to a different overall behaviour when an agent acts under artificial emotions. After discussing basic theories on emotions and their role to creating believable agents, we present the definition of the eX-machine (eχ) and its computation. A simple multi-agent system with emotional reactive agents is used to show the formal modelling process. Additionally, the same example is used to demonstrate how a visual simulation, based on eχ formal modelling, has different behaviour of the overall system, when artificial emotions are applied.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 29, 'citationCount': 6, 'journal': {'pages': '40-45'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Kefalas2012FormalMO,\n author = {P.

These meaningmaking resources are grouped together as the “language of evaluation” on the grounds that they are all means by which the speaker’s/writer’s personal, evaluative involvement in the text is revealed as they adopt stances either toward phenomena (the entities, happenings, or states of affairs being construed by the text) or toward metaphenomena (propositions about these entities, happenings, and states of affairs). Early work on the appraisal framework largely focused on evaluative meanings in English, with this literature noting that no assumptions should be made as to whether the evaluative categories proposed for English necessarily operate in other languages. Subsequently, researchers have employed the descriptive principles that underlie the framework in work on other languages and in work that compares and contrasts evaluative meanings across languages (see, for example, Thomson & White, 2008). The view of language adopted by the architects of the appraisal framework is that of the systemic functional linguistic theory of Halliday and his associates (Halliday, 1994). Accordingly they hold that meaning-making can usefully be divided into three broad modes, or what Halliday terms “metafunctions”: (1) “ideational” meaning by which language construes the world of experience, (2) “interpersonal” meaning by which speakers/writers enact social roles, personas, and relationships, and (3) “textual” meaning by which these ideational and interpersonal meanings are organized into coherent texts appropriate for a given communicative setting. The evaluative meanings described by the appraisal framework provide some of the mechanisms by which the “interpersonal” metafunction operates, in that they present speakers/writers as revealing their feelings, tastes, and opinions with greater or lesser degrees of intensity and directness, as construing propositions as more or as less contentious or warrantable, and as thereby aligning or disaligning with value positions in play in the current communicative context. Within the model of the interpersonal metafunction proposed by Martin (1997) these resources of “appraisal” operate alongside two other interpersonal systems: those communicative resources by which speakers/writers perform speech functions such as asserting, questioning, responding, commanding, advising, and offering,', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 7, 'citationCount': 277, 'journal': {'name': 'Encyclopedia of Personality and Individual Differences'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{White2020AppraisalT,\n author = {P.

Prof. Dr. Uğur Güdükbay July, 2010 Crowd simulation has a wide range of application areas such as biological and social modeling, military simulations, computer games and movies. Simulating the behavior of animated virtual crowds has been a challenging task for the computer graphics community. As well as the physical and the geometrical aspects, the semantics underlying the motion of real crowds inspire the design and implementation of virtual crowds. Psychology helps us understand the motivations of the individuals constituting a crowd. There has been extensive research on incorporating psychological models into the simulation of autonomous agents. However, in our study, instead of the psychological state of an individual agent as such, we are interested in the overall behavior of the crowd that consists of virtual humans with various psychological states. For this purpose, we incorporate the three basic constituents of affect: personality, emotion and mood. Each of these elements contribute variably to the emergence of different aspects of behavior. We thus examine, by changing the parameters, how groups of people with different characteristics interact with each other, and accordingly, how the global crowd behavior is influenced. In the social psychology literature, crowds are classified as mobs and audiences. Audiences are passive crowds whereas mobs are active crowds with emotional, irrational and seemingly homogeneous behavior. In this thesis, we examine how audiences turn into mobs and simulate the common properties of mobs to create collective misbehavior. So far, crowd simulation research has focused on panicking crowds among all types of mobs. We extend the state of the art to simulate different types of mobs based on the taxonomy. We demonstrate various scenarios that realize the behavior of distinct mob types.

We apply a variety of psychology-inspired body language features to describe body motion and posture. We first examine the coordination between the dyad's behavior for two interaction stances: friendly and conflictive. The analysis empirically reveals the dyad's behavior coordination, and helps identify informative interlocutor features with respect to the participant's target body language features. The coordination patterns between the dyad's behavior are found to depend on the interaction stances assumed. We apply a Gaussian-Mixture-Model-based (GMM) statistical mapping in combination with a Fisher kernel framework for automatically predicting the body language of an interacting participant from the speech and gesture behavior of an interlocutor. The experimental results show that the Fisher kernel-based approach outperforms methods using only the GMM-based mapping, and using the support vector regression, in terms of correlation coefficient and RMSE.

In an evaluation, this system was rated as significantly more natural than two systems representing the current state of the art that either ignore the interrupting event or just pause; it also has a lower response time."", 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 24, 'citationCount': 56, 'journal': {'pages': '295-303'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Buschmeier2012CombiningIL,\n author = {Hendrik Buschmeier and Timo Baumann and Benjamin Dosch and S.

The work is motivated by the aim to provide technology with competences in perceiving and producing the emotional and nonverbal behaviors required to sustain a conversational dialogue. We present the Sensitive Artificial Listener (SAL) scenario as a setting which seems particularly suited for the study of emotional and nonverbal behavior since it requires only very limited verbal understanding on the part of the machine. This scenario allows us to concentrate on nonverbal capabilities without having to address at the same time the challenges of spoken language understanding, task modeling, etc. We first report on three prototype versions of the SAL scenario in which the behavior of the Sensitive Artificial Listener characters was determined by a human operator. These prototypes served the purpose of verifying the effectiveness of the SAL scenario and allowed us to collect data required for building system components for analyzing and synthesizing the respective behaviors. We then describe the fully autonomous integrated real-time system we created, which combines incremental analysis of user behavior, dialogue management, and synthesis of speaker and listener behavior of a SAL character displayed as a virtual agent. We discuss principles that should underlie the evaluation of SAL-type systems. Since the system is designed for modularity and reuse and since it is publicly available, the SAL system has potential as a joint research tool in the affective computing research community.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 143, 'citationCount': 204, 'journal': {'volume': '3', 'pages': '165-183', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Schröder2012BuildingAS,\n author = {M.

Texts are generally considered as bags of words without any order. Although these approaches have proven to be efficient, they do not provide users with comprehensive and reusable rules about their data. Such rules are, however, very important for users to describe trends in the data they have to analyze. In this framework, an association-rule based approach has been proposed by Bing Liu (CBA). We propose, in this paper, to extend this approach by using sequential patterns in the SPaC method (Sequential Patterns for Classification) for text categorization. Taking order into account allows us to represent the succession of words through a document without complex and time-consuming representations and treatments such as those performed in natural language and grammatical methods. The original method we propose here consists in mining sequential patterns in order to build a classifier. We experimentally show that our proposal is relevant, and that it is very interesting compared to other methods.

This paper provides an overview of the process of bringing our interactive drama to life as a coherent, engaging, high agency experience, including the design and programming of thousands of joint dialog behaviors in the reactive planning language ABL, and their higher level organization into a collection of story beats sequenced by a drama manager.

This interface application takes physiological data (skin conductance and electromyography) of a user in realtime, interprets them as emotions, and addresses the user's affective states in the form of empathic feedback. The Empathic Companion is conceived as an educational agent that supports job seekers preparing for a job interview. We also present results from an exploratory study that aims to evaluate the impact of the Empathic Companion by measuring users' skin conductance and heart rate. While an overall positive effect of the Empathic Companion could not be shown, the outcome of the experiment suggests that empathic feedback has a positive effect on the interviewee's stress level while hearing the interviewer question."", 'year': 2005, 'referenceCount': 30, 'citationCount': 311, 'journal': {'volume': '19', 'pages': '267 - 285', 'name': 'Applied Artificial Intelligence'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': ""@Article{Prendinger2005THEEC,\n author = {H.

Introduction to Data Mining In the age of information, an enormous amount of data is available in different industries and organizations. The availability of this massive data is of no use unless it is transformed into valuable information. Otherwise, we are sinking in data, but starving for knowledge. The solution to this problem is data mining which is the extraction of useful information from the huge amount of data that is available. Data mining is defined as follows: ‘Data mining is a collection of techniques for efficient automated discovery of previously unknown, valid, novel, useful and understandable patterns in large databases. The patterns must be actionable so they may be used in an enterprise's decision making.’ From this definition, the important take aways are: • Data mining is a process of automated discovery of previously unknown patterns in large volumes of data. • This large volume of data is usually the historical data of an organization known as the data warehouse. • Data mining deals with large volumes of data, in Gigabytes or Terabytes of data and sometimes as much as Zetabytes of data (in case of big data). • Patterns must be valid, novel, useful and understandable. • Data mining allows businesses to determine historical patterns to predict future behaviour. • Although data mining is possible with smaller amounts of data, the bigger the data the better the accuracy in prediction. • There is considerable hype about data mining at present, and the Gartner Group has listed data mining as one of the top ten technologies to watch. Need of Data Mining Data mining is a recent buzz word in the field of Computer Science. It is a computing process that uses intelligent mathematical algorithms to extract the relevant data and computes the probability of future actions. It is also known as Knowledge Discovery in Data (KDD)."", 'year': 2005, 'referenceCount': 71, 'citationCount': 4907, 'journal': {'name': 'Principles of Data Mining'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Larose2005IntroductionTD,\n author = {D.

The evidence from 5 studies supported these two claims. The nonverbal behavior of embarrassment was distinct from a related emotion (amusement), resembled the temporal pattern of facial expressions of emotion, was uniquely related to self-reports of embarrassment, and was accurately identified by observers who judged the spontaneous displays of various emotions. Across the judgment studies, observers were more accurate and attributed more emotion to the embarrassment displays of female and AfricanAmerican targets than those of male and Caucasian targets. Discussion focused on the universality and appeasement function of the embarrassment display. Since universal facial expressions of a limited set of emotions were first documented (Ekman & Friesen, 1971; Ekman, Sorenson, & Friesen, 1969; Izard, 1971), sparse attention has been given to facial expressions of other emotions. The resulting lacuna in the field—that the emotions with identified displays are fewer (7 to 10) than the states that lay people (Fehr & Russell, 1984) and emotion theorists (Ekman, 1992; Izard, 1977; Tomkins, 1963, 1984) label as emotions—presents intriguing possibilities.

It projects a positive and realistic approach to issues confronting disabled people and their families. The lives and aspirations of the disabled are discussed in an easily readable style, which includes such topics as: labeling, accessibility, institutionalization, relationships with the medical field, and representation in the media and technology. Special People is not written for the professional who requires extensive information on a specific topic or exceptionality. Rather, it is a short book (172 pages) that brings together knowledge and thought from several disciplines to deal with the everyday problems of coping. Doctors, clergymen, parents, older students, relatives, and the general reader will find Special People useful and informative. One of the strongest aspects of this book is the author\'s ability to relate her personal experiences and feelings. She is sensitive to the adjustment problems of the nonhandicapped and helps them to understand their own reactions by sharing hers. For example, after realizing that a particular child had Downs\' Syndrome, Ms. Cohen relates, ""The shock stayed with me all afternoon. Even though I had known that this was a program for retarded infants, I hadn\'t been prepared. I was still plagued by my stereotypes"" (p. 117). There are pertinent references throughout the text to professional articles, books for adults, and some for children that expound upon the topics discussed. Regular classroom teachers may be interested in reading, ""Don\'t Feel Sorry for Paul,"" which describes the life of a physically handicapped child. Parents may chose to read, ""About Handicaps,"" to children who are afraid of ""catching handicap germs."" There are also several accounts of innovative programs, such as Sweden\'s consideration of blind, physically, and mentally handicapped persons when traffic patterns were changed. This was done because ""they are passengers ... they are pedestrians ... they are part of the world around the driver .... "" There are several excerpts from autobiographies of disabled people, transcripts of conversations with parents, and reactions of children. Helen Jones describes inconsistencies in the airlines\' willingness to accept disabled passengers: her statement is especially piognant for those who organize service companies for the public. The parent of a physically handicapped child expresses appreciation for a sequence on the ""Mr. Rogers"" television show, which included disabled children. Shirley Cohen does not leave her reader uninvolved. One chapter, entitled ""And Now You,"" presents situations for selfinquiry as well as for discussion. While the general reader and the disabled themselves are asked to think about their own behaviors and feelings, the professional team member can re-examine his own beliefs regarding the equality and worthiness of the people he serves.

We present here AnimalTA, a new program that tracks and analyses animal movement in diverse environments. This program aims to be accessible to everyone, including those without knowledge of coding and image analysis. AnimalTA allows to process rapidly a high number of videos and manage multi‐arena tracking. It is adapted to follow the movement of targets in variable conditions, including heterogenous and complex environments, or in low‐quality videos. AnimalTA provides tools for editing videos and correcting problems caused by camera tremors, light changes or perspective deformation. AnimalTA also allows the user to easily correct tracking errors and repeat the tracking in a subsample of the video. The target's identity can be personalized to facilitate video analysis. The tracking results can be analysed in AnimalTA to obtain many different variables related to the trajectory of each target, such as average speed, total distance travelled, latency to reach defined areas, distance to a defined point, distance to other individuals, number of contacts with others, explored surface, among others.

While a preference for conspecifics has been shown for different species, social novelty has been used as a model for anxiety-like behavior in rodents. The goal of this research was to understand the roles of stimulus salience (numerousness) and novelty in social investigation and social novelty tests in zebrafish (Danio rerio Hamilton 1822). We used a sequential design, in which animals are exposed first to a social investigation test (with dichotomous presentation of novel conspecifics vs. empty tank) and then to a social novelty test (with dichotomous presentation of the already known conspecific and a novel conspecific). In experiment 1, animals were presented to either 1 or 3 (vs. an empty tank) conspecifics as stimuli. In experiment 2, animals were presented to 1 vs. 3 conspecifics as stimuli. In experiment 3, animals were observed in the social investigation and social novelty tests for 3 consecutive days. The results showed equivalence between 1 or 3 conspecifics in the social investigation and social novelty tests, although animals were able to discriminate between different shoal sizes.

We tested to what extent the proximate mechanisms of emotional contagion are evolutionarily conserved by assessing the role of oxytocin, known to regulate empathic behaviors in mammals, in social fear contagion in zebrafish. Using oxytocin and oxytocin receptor mutants, we show that oxytocin is both necessary and sufficient for observer zebrafish to imitate the distressed behavior of conspecific demonstrators. The brain regions associated with emotional contagion in zebrafish are homologous to those involved in the same process in rodents (e.g., striatum, lateral septum), receiving direct projections from oxytocinergic neurons located in the pre-optic area. Together, our results support an evolutionary conserved role for oxytocin as a key regulator of basic empathic behaviors across vertebrates. Description Fundamentals of empathy Emotional contagion, in which individuals display fear or distress behaviors in response to observations of the same in another, is considered a basal form of empathy and is known to occur in fishes. Akinrinade et al. have shown that the neuropeptide oxytocin is responsible for these behaviors in zebrafish, as it is in mammals (see the Perspective by DeAngelis and Hofmann). They also found that the same regions of the brain are involved in zebrafish and in mammals.

In an effort to assist experimental research and improve animal welfare, we propose a mathematical model for the social behavior of groups of zebrafish swimming in a shallow water tank in response to the administration of psychoactive compounds to select individuals. We specialize the mathematical model to caffeine, a popular anxiogenic compound. Each fish is assigned to a Markov chain that describes transitions between freezing and swimming. When swimming, zebrafish locomotion is modeled as a pair of coupled stochastic differential equations, describing the time evolution of the turn-rate and speed in response to caffeine administration. Comparison with experimental results demonstrates the accuracy of the model and its potential use in the design of in-silico experiments.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 61, 'citationCount': 1, 'journal': {'volume': '7'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Tuqan2021MathematicalMO,\n author = {Mohammad Tuqan and M.

While emotional contagion has been traditionally considered to be a prerogative of mammals and birds, recent findings are demonstrating otherwise. Here, we investigate emotional contagion in groups of zebrafish, a freshwater model species which is gaining momentum in preclinical studies. Zebrafish have high genetic homology to humans, and they exhibit a complex behavioral repertoire amenable to study social behavior. To investigate whether individual emotional states can be transmitted to group members, we pharmacologically modulated anxiety-related behaviors of a single fish through Citalopram administration and we assessed whether the altered emotional state spread to a group of four untreated conspecifics. By capitalizing upon our in-house developed tracking algorithm, we successfully preserved the identity of all the subjects and thoroughly described their individual and social behavioral phenotypes. In accordance with our predictions, we observed that Citalopram administration consistently reduced behavioral anxiety of the treated individual, in the form of reduced geotaxis, and that such a behavioral pattern readily generalized to the untreated subjects. A transfer entropy analysis of causal interactions within the group revealed that emotional contagion was directional, whereby the treated individual influenced untreated subjects, but not vice-versa. This study offers additional evidence that emotional contagion is biologically preserved in simpler living organisms amenable to preclinical investigations.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 63, 'citationCount': 6, 'journal': {'volume': '15', 'name': 'Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Lombana2021CollectiveEC,\n author = {Daniel Alberto Burbano Lombana and S.

In recent years evidence on emotional contagion in different animal species has accumulated. However, despite its adaptative advantages and its presumed simplicity, the study and direct demonstration of this phenomenon present more complexities than previously thought. For these reasons, a review of the literature on emotional contagion in nonhuman species is timely to integrate current findings. In this paper thus, we carry out a comprehensive review of the most relevant studies on emotional contagion in animals and discuss the main problems and challenges of the field. We conclude that more research is needed to broaden our understanding of the mechanisms and functions of emotional contagion and the extent to which this process is present in a wide variety of species. Furthermore, the comparative study of emotional contagion would benefit from the use of systematized paradigms including both behavioral and physiological measures and the simultaneous recording of the responses of the interacting individuals to reliably assess an emotional state‐matching between them and reliable controls.

In particular, social learning allows animals to learn about dangers without incurring in the costs of trial‐and‐error learning. In zebrafish, both chemical and visual social cues elicit an innate alarm response, which consists of erratic movement followed by freezing behavior. Injured zebrafish release an alarm substance from their skin that elicits the alarm response. Similarly, the sight of conspecifics displaying the alarm response can also elicit the expression of this response in observers. In this study, we investigated if these social cues of danger can also be used by zebrafish as unconditioned stimulus (US) in learning. We found that only the chemical cue was effective in the social fear conditioning. We suggest that this differential efficacy of social cues results from the fact that the alarm cue is a more reliable indicator of threat, than the sight of an alarmed conspecific. Therefore, although multiple social cues may elicit innate responses not all have been evolutionarily co‐opted to act as US in associative learning. Furthermore, the use of the expression of the immediate early genes as markers of neuronal activity showed that chemical social fear conditioning is paralleled by a differential activation of the olfactory bulbs and by a different pattern of functional connectivity across brain regions involved in olfactory processing.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 89, 'citationCount': 8, 'journal': {'volume': '19', 'name': 'Genes'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Pinho2020InnateCB,\n author = {Júlia Pinho and M.

For social organisms travelling in groups, like the fish in a school or the birds in a flock, sharing information can further improve their situational awareness and reaction times. Data on the benefits and costs of social coordination, however, have largely allowed our understanding of why collective behaviours have evolved to outpace our mechanistic knowledge of how they arise. Recent studies have begun to correct this imbalance through fine-scale analyses of group movement data. One approach that has received renewed attention is the use of information theoretic (IT) tools like mutual information, transfer entropy and causation entropy, which can help identify causal interactions in the type of complex, dynamical patterns often on display when organisms act collectively. Yet, there is a communications gap between studies focused on the ecological constraints and solutions of collective action with those demonstrating the promise of IT tools in this arena. We attempt to bridge this divide through a series of ecologically motivated examples designed to illustrate the benefits and challenges of using IT tools to extract deeper insights into the interaction patterns governing group-level dynamics. We summarize some of the approaches taken thus far to circumvent existing challenges in this area and we conclude with an optimistic, yet cautionary perspective.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 118, 'citationCount': 28, 'journal': {'volume': '17', 'name': 'Journal of the Royal Society Interface'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Pilkiewicz2020DecodingCC,\n author = {K.

We tested whether the sight of a distressed conspecific elicited fear in zebrafish, and whether this was modulated by familiarity. Groups of six zebrafish were housed together in the same tanks for 7 days to create familiar conditions. The behaviour of individual fish was then recorded in paired tanks within sight of either a familiar or an unfamiliar individual, before and after distilled water or an alarm substance was added to the demonstrator, but not to the observer. As expected, addition of distilled water did not elicit any behavioural change in either the demonstrator or the observer. However, addition of an alarm cue triggered anti-predatory behaviours in the demonstrator which caused the expression of anti-predatory behaviours in the observer, suggesting the existence of fear contagion. Furthermore, the extent of fear contagion was affected by familiarity, and observers were more active, swam closer to the bottom and further away from the demonstrator when they watched a distressed familiar neighbour than when they watched an unfamiliar fish. Our results have implications for fish welfare because they show that fish can become stressed by simply watching others become stressed.

It may be a cost-effective tool with which we can improve our understanding of the biological and genetic mechanisms of human brain function and dysfunction. Some, myself and collaborators included, have argued that such translational relevance may be best achieved if one considers the ecology and species-specific characteristics of the study organism. In this review, I focus on our own studies investigating zebrafish fear responses, which may be utilized in analyzing the mechanisms of fear and anxiety, and which may be used for screening anxiolytic drugs. I review how zebrafish respond to their natural and synthetic alarm substance as well as to other fear-inducing stimuli, including sympatric and allopatric predatory fish, sympatric or allopatric harmless fish, moving (animated) images of predatory fish and moving images of abstract shapes. I discuss the behavioral responses these stimuli elicit, summarize the methods of the quantification of the behaviors, and speculate about their possible adaptive nature. Although we utilize complex visual stimuli and do not yet know what key features zebrafish may be sensitive to, our results, together with those published by others, imply that this simple vertebrate may have a bright future in behavioral brain research.', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 56, 'citationCount': 49, 'journal': {'volume': '11', 'name': 'Evolutionary Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Gerlai2013AntipredatoryBO,\n author = {R.

Physiological similarity to mammals, ease of genetic manipulations, sensitivity to pharmacological and genetic factors, robust behavior, low cost, and potential for high-throughput screening contribute to the growing utility of zebrafish models in this field. Understanding zebrafish behavioral phenotypes provides important insights into neural pathways, physiological biomarkers, and genetic underpinnings of normal and pathological brain function. Novel zebrafish paradigms continue to appear with an encouraging pace, thus necessitating a consistent terminology and improved understanding of the behavioral repertoire. What can zebrafish 'do', and how does their altered brain function translate into behavioral actions? To help address these questions, we have developed a detailed catalog of zebrafish behaviors (Zebrafish Behavior Catalog, ZBC) that covers both larval and adult models. Representing a beginning of creating a more comprehensive ethogram of zebrafish behavior, this effort will improve interpretation of published findings, foster cross-species behavioral modeling, and encourage new groups to apply zebrafish neurobehavioral paradigms in their research. In addition, this glossary creates a framework for developing a zebrafish neurobehavioral ontology, ultimately to become part of a unified animal neurobehavioral ontology, which collectively will contribute to better integration of biological data within and across species."", 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 187, 'citationCount': 778, 'journal': {'volume': '10 1', 'pages': '\n          70-86\n        ', 'name': 'Zebrafish'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Kalueff2013TowardsAC,\n author = {A.

Several characteristics have been described for this species, including scototaxis, which is the natural preference for dark environments in detriment of bright ones. However, there is no evidence regarding the influence of “natural stimuli” in zebrafish subjected to novelty-based paradigms. In this report, we evaluated the spatio-temporal exploratory activity of the short-fin zebrafish phenotype in the open tank after a short-period confinement into dark/bright environments. A total of 44 animals were individually confined during a 10-min single session into one of three environments: black-painted, white-painted, and transparent cylinders (dark, bright, and transparent groups). Fish were further subjected to the novel tank test and their exploratory profile was recorded during a 15-min trial. The results demonstrated that zebrafish increased their vertical exploratory activity during the first 6-min, where the bright group spent more time and travelled a higher distance in the top area. Interestingly, all behavioral parameters measured for the dark group were similar to the transparent one. These data were confirmed by automated analysis of track and occupancy plots and also demonstrated that zebrafish display a classical homebase formation in the bottom area of the tank. A detailed spatio-temporal study of zebrafish exploratory behavior and the construction of representative ethograms showed that the experimental groups presented significant differences in the first 3-min vs. last 3-min of test. Although the main factors involved in these behavioral responses still remain ambiguous and require further investigation, the current report describes an alternative methodological approach for assessing the zebrafish behavior after a forced exposure to different environments. Additionally, the analysis of ethologically-relevant patterns across time could be a potential phenotyping tool to evaluate the zebrafish exploratory profile in the open tank task.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 48, 'citationCount': 141, 'journal': {'volume': '6', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Rosemberg2011DifferencesIS,\n author = {D.

However, the number of behavioral test paradigms specifically designed for zebrafish, and in general the amount of information available on the behavior of this species, is relatively small when compared with classical laboratory model organisms such as the mouse, the rat, and the fruit fly. A particularly typical behavioral feature of zebrafish is shoaling, i.e., group formation. Given the importance of social behavior in our own species and the fact that zebrafish possess several characteristics similar to those of other vertebrates, including humans, at many levels of biological organization (e.g., neuroanatomy, neurochemistry, biochemical processes, and amino acid sequence of proteins or nucleotide sequence of genes), the zebrafish is expected to be an excellent tool not only for basic research but perhaps also for translational research. Briefly, we propose that once social behavior of the zebrafish is better characterized and once appropriate behavioral methods have been developed, this species can be utilized for the analysis of the mechanisms of social behavior of other vertebrates including our own. In this review, we discuss general principles of shoaling and highlight what we know and what we do not know about this behavior as it pertains to zebrafish.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 105, 'citationCount': 145, 'journal': {'volume': '22', 'pages': '17 - 25'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Miller2011ShoalingIZ,\n author = {Noam Y.

For return-benefits to play a motivational role, however, they need to be experienced by the organism. Motivational analyses should restrict themselves, therefore, to the altruistic impulse and its knowable consequences. Empathy is an ideal candidate mechanism to underlie so-called directed altruism, i.e., altruism in response to anothers's pain, need, or distress. Evidence is accumulating that this mechanism is phylogenetically ancient, probably as old as mammals and birds. Perception of the emotional state of another automatically activates shared representations causing a matching emotional state in the observer. With increasing cognition, state-matching evolved into more complex forms, including concern for the other and perspective-taking. Empathy-induced altruism derives its strength from the emotional stake it offers the self in the other's welfare. The dynamics of the empathy mechanism agree with predictions from kin selection and reciprocal altruism theory."", 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 159, 'citationCount': 1303, 'journal': {'volume': '59', 'pages': '279-300', 'name': 'Annual Review of Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Waal2008PuttingTA,\n author = {F.

In novel environments, zebrafish swim to tank bottoms and dark backgrounds, behaviors attributed to anxiety associated with threat of predation. To examine possible genetic effects of inbreeding and segregation on this behavior, we compared Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC) AB and WIK lines to zebrafish and GloFish® from a pet store (PETCO) in two qualitatively different novel environments: the dive tank and aquatic light/dark plus maze. Behavior was observed in the dive tank for 5 min, immediately followed by 5 min in the light/dark plus maze. Among strains, WIK spent more time in the dive tank top than AB (76 ± 30 vs. 17 ± 11 sec), and AB froze in the plus maze center for longer than PETCO or GloFish® (162 ± 61 vs. 72 ± 29 or 27 ± 27 sec). Further, behavior of zebrafish exposed for 3 min to 25 mg/L nicotine, desipramine, chlordiazepoxide, yohimbine, 100 mg/L citalopram, 0.05% DMSO, or 0.5% ethanol was compared to controls. Approximately 0.1% of drug is available in brain after such exposures. Desipramine or citalopram-exposed fish spent more time in the dive tank top, and both reuptake inhibitors bound to serotonin transporters in zebrafish brain with high affinity (K(i) = 7 ± 5 and 9 ± 5 nM). In the plus maze, chlordiazepoxide, ethanol and DMSO-exposed fish crossed more lines and spent more time in white arms. Neither 25 mg/L nicotine nor yohimbine altered zebrafish behavior in novel environments, but nicotine was anxiolytic at higher doses. Overall, the light/dark plus maze and dive tank are distinct behavioral measures that are sensitive to treatment with anxiolytic compounds, but zebrafish line selection and solvents can influence baseline behavior in these tests.', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 30, 'citationCount': 239, 'journal': {'volume': '23 1', 'pages': '\n          43-61\n        ', 'name': 'International journal of comparative psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Sackerman2010ZebrafishBI,\n author = {James Sackerman and J.

One such type of information consists of cues to the speaker's personality traits, the most fundamental dimension of variation between humans. Recent work explores the automatic detection of other types of pragmatic variation in text and conversation, such as emotion, deception, speaker charisma, dominance, point of view, subjectivity, opinion and sentiment. Personality affects these other aspects of linguistic production, and thus personality recognition may be useful for these tasks, in addition to many other potential applications. However, to date, there is little work on the automatic recognition of personality traits. This article reports experimental results for recognition of all Big Five personality traits, in both conversation and text, utilising both self and observer ratings of personality. While other work reports classification results, we experiment with classification, regression and ranking models. For each model, we analyse the effect of different feature sets on accuracy. Results show that for some traits, any type of statistical model performs significantly better than the baseline, but ranking models perform best overall. We also present an experiment suggesting that ranking models are more accurate than multi-class classifiers for modelling personality. In addition, recognition models trained on observed personality perform better than models trained using self-reports, and the optimal feature set depends on the personality trait. A qualitative analysis of the learned models confirms previous findings linking language and personality, while revealing many new linguistic markers."", 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 94, 'citationCount': 894, 'journal': {'volume': '30', 'pages': '457-500', 'name': 'J.

This pair of concepts refers to two basic modes of coping with stress. Approach and avoidance are simply metaphors for cognitive and emotional activity that is oriented either toward or away from threat. An approach-avoidance model of coping is presented in the context of contemporary theoretical ap- proaches to coping. The research literature on coping ef- fectiveness, including evidence from our laboratory, is dis- cussed, and speculations are made about the implications for future research. The study of stress and coping has become quite popular in recent years, particularly in regard to traumatic life events. Although the area is broad and the coping process is complex, there is a striking coherence in much of the literature. This coherence is based on two concepts central to an understanding of coping with trauma: approach and avoidance. In its simplest form, this pair of concepts refers to two basic orientations toward stressful infor- mation, or two basic modes of coping with stress. Ap- proach and avoidance are shorthand terms for the cog- nitive and emotional activity that is oriented either toward or away from threat. In this article we will present the case for utilizing the concepts of approach and avoidance to provide a co- herent theoretical structure to our understanding of cop- ing with stress. Several different formulations of the ap- proach-avoidance dimension will be reviewed, followed by a brief review of the coping effectiveness literature. Several studies from our laboratory will be used to illus- trate the relationship between coping and outcome. Fi- nally, a general approach-avoidance model of coping will be presented, with suggestions for further research to cor- roborate or extend the theory. The study of coping with stress has been split into two areas: anticipation of future stressful events and re- covery from trauma. These areas have been kept re- markably distinct in both theory and research on coping. Although there are clearly important differences between the two cases, we have chosen not to emphasize this dis- tinction. For any given stress, anticipation and recovery are not always clearly separable; dealing with a trauma involves coming to terms with the event itself and with the threat of recurrence in the future.

Previously, we have shown that a simple fully connected feedforward DNN performs surprisingly well when trained directly on the raw time signal. The analysis of the weights revealed that the DNN has learned a kind of short-time time-frequency decomposition of the speech signal. In conventional feature extraction pipelines this is done manually by means of a filter bank that is shared between the neighboring analysis windows. Following this idea, we show that the performance gap between DNNs trained on spliced hand-crafted features and DNNs trained on raw time signal can be strongly reduced by introducing 1D-convolutional layers. Thus, the DNN is forced to learn a short-time filter bank shared over a longer time span. This also allows us to interpret the weights of the second convolutional layer in the same way as 2D patches learned on critical band energies by typical convolutional neural networks. The evaluation is performed on an English LVCSR task. Trained on the raw time signal, the convolutional layers allow to reduce the WER on the test set from 25.5% to 23.4%, compared to an MFCC based result of 22.1% using fully connected layers.

Introduction State-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) systemstypically model the relationship between the acoustic speechsignal and the phones in two separate steps, which are op-timized in an independent manner [1]. In a rst step, thespeech signal is transformed into features, usually composed ofa dimensionality reduction phase and an information selectionphase, based on the task-specic knowledge of the phenomena.These two phases have been carefully hand-crafted, leading tostate-of-the-art features such as Mel frequency cepstral coef-cients(MFCCs)orperceptuallinearpredictioncepstralfeatures(PLPs). In a second step, the likelihood of subword units suchas, phonemes is estimated using generative models or discrimi-native models.In recent years, in the hybrid HMM/ANN framework [1],there has been growing interests in using \x93intermediate\x94 rep-resentations instead of conventional features, such as cepstral-based features, as input for neural networks-based systems.ANNs with deep learning architectures, more precisely, deepneural networks (DNNs) [2, 3], which can yield better systemthan a single hidden layer MLP have been proposed to addressvarious aspects of acoustic modeling. More specically, useof context-dependent phonemes [4, 5]; use of spectral featuresas opposed to cepstral features [6, 7]; CNN-based system withMel lter bank energies as input [8, 9, 10]; combination of dif-ferent features [11], to name a few.

83,df81691d0bb8eeb775787d6a79dd48c6d1d007bd,Effect of Changes in the Structure of a Social Network on Emotion Contagion,"Agent-based support systems are used to help people with developing and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Interventions on the social network of an individual could play a role in achieving behaviour change. In this paper, a method for finding effective network interventions to influence specific individuals is proposed. The effect of these interventions was analysed by simulating the diffusion of emotional values about intentions and goals in a social network. Experiments showed that changing connections closer to the target have a larger influence than changing connections further from the target node. A comparison of the effect of the proposed interventions with all possible interventions showed that they are among the most optimal possible interventions. Finally, it was shown that nodes with fewer connections are easier to influence. The proposed interventions could form the basis for a support system that focus on affecting the social interaction between people in an online social network.",2014,21,10,"{'name': '2014 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conferences on Web Intelligence (WI) and Intelligent Agent Technologies (IAT)', 'pages': '270-277', 'volume': '3'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Klein2014EffectOC,\n author = {M.

The nature of habit cuing calls for certain self-control strategies. Because the slow-to-change memory trace of habits is not amenable to change or reinterpretation, successful habit control involves inhibiting the unwanted response when activated in memory. In support, two episode-sampling diary studies demonstrated that bad habits, unlike responses to temptations, were controlled most effectively through spontaneous use of vigilant monitoring (thinking “don’t do it,” watching carefully for slipups). No other strategy was useful in controlling strong habits, despite that stimulus control was effective at inhibiting responses to temptations. A subsequent experiment showed that vigilant monitoring aids habit control, not by changing the strength of the habit memory trace but by heightening inhibitory, cognitive control processes. The implications of these findings for behavior change interventions are discussed.', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 59, 'citationCount': 236, 'journal': {'volume': '36', 'pages': '499 - 511', 'name': 'Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Quinn2010CantCY,\n author = {Jeffrey M.

The process leading to fission is viewed as an unequal flow of sentiments and information across the ties in a social network. This flow is unequal because it is uniquely constrained by the contextual range and sensitivity of each relationship in the network. The subsequent differential sharing of sentiments leads to the formation of subgroups with more internal stability than the group as a whole, and results in fission. The Ford-Fulkerson labeling algorithm allows an accurate prediction of membership in the subgroups and of the locus of the fission to be made from measurements of the potential for information flow across each edge in the network. Methods for measurement of potential information flow are discussed, and it is shown that all appropriate techniques will generate the same predictions.', 'year': 1977, 'referenceCount': 24, 'citationCount': 3966, 'journal': {'volume': '33', 'pages': '452 - 473', 'name': 'Journal of Anthropological Research'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Avrachenkov1977AnIF,\n author = {Konstantin Avrachenkov and Aleksei Yu.

The first approach to capture the global properties of such systems is to model them as graphs whose nodes represent the dynamical units, and whose links stand for the interactions between them. On the one hand, scientists have to cope with structural issues, such as characterizing the topology of a complex wiring architecture, revealing the unifying principles that are at the basis of real networks, and developing models to mimic the growth of a network and reproduce its structural properties. On the other hand, many relevant questions arise when studying complex networks’ dynamics, such as learning how a large ensemble of dynamical systems that interact through a complex wiring topology can behave collectively. We review the major concepts and results recently achieved in the study of the structure and dynamics of complex networks, and summarize the relevant applications of these ideas in many different disciplines, ranging from nonlinear science to biology, from statistical mechanics to medicine and engineering. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, the impact of our autonomous laughter-aware agent on the humor experience of the user and interaction between user and agent is evaluated by subjective and objective means. Preliminary results show that the laughter-aware agent increases the humor experience (i.e., felt amusement of the user and the funniness rating of the film clip), and creates the notion of a shared social experience, indicating that the agent is useful to elicit positive humor-related affect and emotional contagion.",2013,24,67,{'pages': '619-626'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Niewiadomski2013LaughawareVA,\n author = {Radoslaw Niewiadomski and Jennifer Hofmann and J.

The chapter provides an overview of what we know about laughter in terms of respiration, vocalization, facial action, and body movement and attempts to illustrate the mechanisms of laughter and to define its elements. The importance of discriminating between spontaneous and contrived laughter is pointed out and it is argued that unrestrained spontaneous laughter involves inarticulate vocalization. It is argued that we need research integrating the different systems in laughter including experience. Laughter is a conspicuous but frequently overlooked human phenomenon. In ontogenetic development it emerges, later than smiling, around the fourth month; however, cases of gelastic epilepsy (from Greek; gelos = laughter) among neonates demonstrate that all structures are there and functional on date of birth. Further evidence for its innateness comes from twin studies as well as from the fact that laughter is easily observable among deaf-blind children (even among deaf-blind thalidomide children, who could not ""learn"" laughter by touching people\'s faces). Man is not the only animal that laughs. Like smiling, laughter has its equivalent in the repertoire of some nonhuman primates. Beginning with Darwin (1872), many writers have been struck by the notable acoustic, orofacial, and contextual similarities between chimpanzee and human laughter. Especially among juvenile chimpanzees a ""play-face"" with associated vocalization was noted to accompany actions such as play, tickling, or play-biting (Preuschoft, 1995; van Hooff, 1972). 1. Laughter as an Inarticulate Utterance Laughter is estimated to be about 7 million years old (Niemitz, 1990). There is disagreement on how human speech developed phylogenetically. It could have originated from non-verbal vocal utterances, a prelingual gestural system, or sounds initially used to supplement the facial channel. However, it is safe to assume that laughter –like other utterances such as moan, sigh, cry, groan, etc.– was there before man developed speech and served as an expressive-communicative social signal. Considering the stage in the evolution of voice when laughter emerged allows us to make several deductions about the nature of the sound, its generation and the cerebral organization of laughter. If laughter was part of the human vocal repertoire before the speech centers were developed, it is likely that the sound was generated almost exclusively by laryngeal modulations, modified to some degree by supralaryngeal activity but not by articulation. This is because articulation requires voluntary control over the vocal system. Thus the production of speech sounds needs the coordination of respiration, phonation, resonance, and articulation, an analysis of laughter will involve mainly the consideration of the first three. But is it consistent with current knowledge to hypothesize that a laugh-pulse –a vocalization segment initiated by an aspirated ""h"" type sound followed by the utterance of one of several vowel sounds that is then abruptly terminated– is an inarticulate sound? Indeed, the /h/, an voiceless fricative glottal sound, is the only consonant produced at the level of the larynx; but as laughter is not ""speech"" we should not expect phonemes of a language to be uttered. Likewise, the assumption of resting articulators would suggest that the laughter ""vowel"" (but also the sound for other prelingual utterances, such as moaning or utterances of astonishment) is the central vowel schwa, or /e/ (as in about). For the production of this ""neutral vowel"" one needs to open the mouth and lower the jaw, but keep all other articulators passive. We know from everyday experience that there is a tremendous variety in the quality of the laughing sounds, so obviously deviations from the schwa occur. This does not contradict the hypothesis of an inarticulate vocalization per se but puts forward the task of defining the deviations from the resting articulation position that are due to altered emotional states and separate them from those supralaryngeal conditions modulating the sound that are due to voluntary actions. A second factor that we need to take into account is that there are different ways to generate laughing sounds and it is possible to intentionally modulate the emotion-driven spontaneous laughter. As the cerebral organization of vocal behavior progressed phylogenetically after these early facio-vocal signals became hardwired, higher centers obtained control over the laughter ""timer"". Thus, in addition to laughing spontaneously (emotional laughter), we can laugh voluntarily or on command (contrived or faked laughter), and we can even speak or sing the laughing sounds, which typically are phonetically represented as ""ha ha ha."" These forms of utterances differ in degree of volitional control and –inversely– emotionality, and imply different neural pathways and systems involved (for reviews of neuronal control of vocalization see, for example, Jürgens, 1998; Ploog, 1986; for reviews or models of laughter: Arroyo et al., 1993; Fried et al., 1998). The distinction made between spontaneous and voluntary laughter is consistent with clinical observations; certain patients with degenerative brain disorders may be unable to move their abdomen voluntarily, but demonstrate vigorous expiratory movement of the abdomen when laughing spontaneously (Bright et al., 1986). Finally, it should be noted that there are also voluntary attempts to regulate spontaneous laughter; for sake of brevity the combination of voluntary and spontaneous in regulated laughter is only mentioned here. In spontaneous laughter we are following an impulse, an urge to laugh without restraining ourselves. There is no attempt to suppress the response or exert any control over its expression; the laughing person has been described as abandoning himself or herself to the body response (Plessner, 1941). The involuntary aspect can also be seen in the fact that during laughter our self-awareness and self-attention is diminished. Trying to direct attention during a laughter episode stops or reduces laughter. During laughter the state of consciousness is altered; as Hall and Allin (1897; p. 8-9) put it: ""[t]he objective world has vanished and is forgotten, the proprieties and even the presence of others are lost, and the soul is all eye and ear to the one laughable object. Care, trouble, and even physical pain are forgotten, and the mind, as it were, falls back through unnumbered millennia and catches a glimpse of that primeval paradise where joy was intense and supreme."" While descriptions of emotional experience are rather sparse and reports of subjects mainly refer to the awareness of the impulse to laugh, spontaneous laughter is clearly enjoyable. In voluntary laughter we may want to produce a sound pattern like that of natural laughter. A typical everyday situation demanding faked laughter is when we want to signal somebody that we enjoyed a humorous message and join the laughter of others but actually do not feel any enjoyment. While voluntary laughter may pass over into involuntary laughter, we can not voluntarily produce emotional laughter. Interestingly, research has shown that contrived and spontaneous laughter within a person are strikingly similar with respect to the respirational pattern (suggesting a ""laughter signature""); however, it is doubtful whether this is also the case for supralaryngeal systems. The many ways in which they differ still need to be described; this will be especially important when studying individual differences as laughter gets socialized during ontogenetic development. Research has made use of the fact that we can voluntarily alter key features, and thus studies of laughter at different vowels, pitch, and voice quality exist (Citardi et al., 1996; Habermann, 1955). Laughing on command is embarrassing to some, and thus the results obtained for contrived laughter are of limited value for describing spontaneous laughter as it may merge voluntary movements with unintended affective states. Speaking or singing ""ha ha"" allows modulating the sound in many ways (e.g., stretching the length of vowels, emphasizing particular syllables), just as with other spoken words. As with voluntary laughter we intend to produce a particular sound pattern and we have even more control over the outcome; the major difference being that phonation is not based on forced breathing but on well dosed air supply resulting in less tracheal resonance, breathiness, and aspiration. Spoken laugh sounds may be devoid of emotional intonation; thus there will be less variability in melody, and the utterance will be more clearly articulated and often match the phonemes of a language. Emotional laughter and speech are rather independent; in fact, laughter and speech may co-occur, thereby lengthening the duration of laugh-pulses (Nwokah et al., in press). It remains to be verified that damage of the higher speech centers has little impact on the expression of tickle-induced emotional laughter. 2. Description of Laughter Laughter is not a term used consistently, nor is it precisely defined in research articles and even encyclopedias. In everyday life a smiling face is often referred to as ""laughter"" although the vocal element is entirely missing. Research studies usually focus on one or two systems of laughter rather than the integration of all the components involved. For example, a study of the acoustics of laughter typically restricts the investigation to the phonatory system and may arrive at the conclusion that the duration of laughter is, say, below two seconds. Sound production is contingent on air flow and the deviation from resting breathing exceeds the rhythmic forced exhalations underlying laughter by far; therefore duration estimates of eight seconds are not uncommon in respiration studies (', 'year': 2001, 'referenceCount': 50, 'citationCount': 271, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'pages': '426-443', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Ruch2001TheEP,\n author = {W.

85,5cceb70a11e9a09ecc03a8488d0bb7e3b8dc09a4,Eye-tracking Analysis for Product Recommendation Virtual Agent with Markov Chain Model,"PRVAs, product recommendation virtual agents, are agents that are designed for virtual clerks in online shopping. Prendinger et al. investigated the effect of virtual clerks by eye tracking analysis (Prendinger, Ma, & Ishizuka, 2007). In their experiment, participants were introduced real estate properties by text, speech, and an animated agent. They showed that the agent’s use of deictic gestures had the effect of attracting a participant’s gaze. Terada et al. studied what appearance was the most suitable for PRVAs (Terada, Jing, & Yamada, 2015). They showed that one of the most effective appearances were dog, robot, and young woman. In this paper, we investigated the effect of PRVA’s emotion transition to user’s gaze by eye tracking analysis. A Markov chain model is widely used for constructing a model of eye tracking transition. Liechty et al. showed local and global covert visual attention by adapting a Bayesian hidden Markov model (Liechty, Pieters, & Wedel, 2003). He et al. suggested investigating hidden user behaviors that occur when a user is using a search site by using a partially observable Markov model with duration (POMD) (He & Wang, 2011). This model is derived from the hidden Markov model (HMM). The difference was that POMD contained a partially observable event. He et al. suggested that only seeing without clicking links was the hidden user behavior. In this paper, our goal was to improve the PRVA design methodology by analyzing user eye-tracking data. We focused on transition-based analysis. In prior research on human-agent interaction, eye-tracking data were mainly analyzed on the basis of fixation durations.

This, in turn, has motivated the development of robotic agents that are humanlike in appearance and/or behavior. Yet, some agents -- often those with highly humanlike appearances -- have been found to elicit the opposite, wherein they are evaluated more negatively than their less humanlike counterparts. These trends are captured by Masahiro Mori's uncanny valley hypothesis, which describes a (uncanny) valley in emotional responding - a switch from affinity to dislike - elicited by agents that are ``too humanlike'. However, while the valley phenomenon has been repeatedly observed via subjective measures, it remains unknown as to whether such evaluations reflect a potential impact to a person's behavior (i.e., aversion). We attempt to address this gap in the literature via a novel experimental paradigm employing both traditional subjective ratings, as well as measures of peoples' behavioral and phsyiological responding. The results show that not only do people rate highly humanlike robots as uncanny, but moreover, they exhibit greater avoidance of such encounters than encounters with less humanlike and human agents. Thus, the findings not only support Mori's hypothesis, but further, they indicate the valley should be taken as a serious consideration for peoples' interactions with humanlike agents."", 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 46, 'citationCount': 58, 'journal': {'name': 'Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Strait2015TooMH,\n author = {M.

POMD utilizes not only the positional but also the temporal information of the clicks in the log. In this work, we treat the user engagements with a search engine as a Markov process, and model the unobservable engagements as hidden states. POMD differs from the traditional hidden Markov model (HMM) in that not all the hidden state transitions emit observable events, and that the duration of staying in each state is explicitly factored into the core statistical model. To address the training and decoding issues emerged as the results of the variations, we propose an iterative two-stage training algorithm and a greedy segmental decoding algorithm respectively. We validate the proposed algorithm with two sets of experiments. First, we show that the search behavioral patterns inferred by POMD match well with those reported in the eye tracking experiments. Secondly, through a series of A/B comparison experiments, we demonstrate that POMD can distinguish the ranking qualities of different search engine configurations much better than the patterns inferred by the model proposed in the previous work. Both of the experimental results suggest that POMD can provide a statistical and quantitative way to understand the sophisticated search behaviors by simply mining the search logs.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 22, 'citationCount': 22, 'journal': {'pages': '415-424'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{He2011InferringSB,\n author = {Yin He and Kuansan Wang},\n pages = {415-424},\n title = {Inferring search behaviors using partially observable markov model with duration (POMD)},\n year = {2011}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2118917602', 'name': 'Yin He'}, {'authorId': '1748169', 'name': 'Kuansan Wang'}]}, {'paperId': '57624d99699f71f213b3a8d2f1905a56ac60f1c7', 'title': 'Eye movements as indices for the utility of life-like interface agents: A pilot study', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 48, 'citationCount': 29, 'journal': {'volume': '19', 'pages': '281-292', 'name': 'Interact.

Little research has studied how social media technologies impact sleep quality among college students. This study aims to determine the relationship between social media use and sleep quality among freshman undergraduates during their first quarter in college. Specifically, we explored whether variations in Twitter use across the time of day and day of the week would be associated with self-reported sleep quality. We conducted a study of freshman Twitter-using students (N\u2009=\u2009197) over their first quarter of college, between October and December of 2015. We collected students’ tweets, labeled the content of the tweets according to different emotional states, and gave theme weekly surveys on sleep quality. Tweeting more frequently on weekday late nights was associated with lower sleep quality (β\u2009=\u2009−0.937, SE\u2009=\u20090.352); tweeting more frequently on weekday evenings was associated with better quality sleep (β\u2009=\u20090.189, SE\u2009=\u20090.097). Tweets during the weekday that were labeled related to the emotion of fear were associated with lower sleep quality (β\u2009=\u2009−0.302, SE\u2009=\u20090.131). Results suggest that social media use is associated with sleep quality among students.

In this paper we report on the experience of a vocational course on object-oriented design, which - among other topics - provides professional criteria to students who are required to plan a large assortment of computer interfaces from panels to object lists, from animated images to social web pages. In the first stage, lessons on HCI illustrate the psychological portraits of computer users. Second, the lessons deduce practical guidelines from those profiles. Finally the students learn the technical contents regarding HCI design. The concise psychological and social criteria which guide the students to prepare the visual interfaces constitute the innovative contribution of the present work at the didactic level.

Intelligent virtual agents are often blind to users’ laughter and unable to produce convincing laughter themselves.

First, to probe human laughter perception by analyzing patterns of categorisations of natural laughter animated on a minimal avatar. Results reveal that a low dimensional space can describe perception of laughter “types”. Second, to investigate observers’ perception of laughter (hilarious, social, awkward, fake, and non-laughter) based on animated avatars generated from natural and acted motion-capture data. Significant differences in torso and limb movements are found between animations perceived as laughter and those perceived as non-laughter. Hilarious laughter also differs from social laughter. Different body movement features were indicative of laughter in sitting and standing avatar postures. Third, to investigate automatic recognition of laughter to the same level of certainty as observers’ perceptions. Results show recognition rates of the Random Forest model approach human rating levels.

Affective arousal modulates all nonverbal communicative cues (facial expressions, body movements, and vocal and physiological reactions). In a face-to-face interaction, humans detect and interpret those interactive signals of their communicator with little or no effort.

Some confuse the concept of ""emotion"" with the more general concept of ""affect"", which covers other things besides emotions, including moods, attitudes, desires, preferences, intentions, dislikes, etc. Moreover researchers have different goals: some are concerned with understanding natural phenomena, while others are more concerned with producing useful artifacts, e.g. synthetic entertainment agents, sympathetic machine interfaces, and the like. We address this confusion by showing how ""architecture-based"" concepts can extend and refine our pre-theoretical concepts in ways that make them more useful both for expressing scientific questions and theories, and for specifying engineering objectives. An implication is that different information-processing architectures support different classes of emotions, different classes of consciousness, different varieties of perception, and so on. We start with high level concepts applicable to a wide variety of types of natural and artificial systems, including very simple organisms, namely concepts such as ""need"", ""function"", ""information-user"", ""affect"", ""information-processing architecture"". For more complex architectures, we offer the CogAff schema as a generic framework which distinguishes types of components that may be in a architecture, operating concurrently with different functional roles. We also sketch H-Cogaff, a richly-featured special case of CogAff, conjectured as a type of architecture that can explain or replicate human mental phenomena. We show how the concepts that are definable in terms of such architectures can clarify and enrich research on human emotions. If successful for the purposes of science and philosophy the architecture is also likely to be useful for engineering purposes, though many engineering goals can be achieved using shallow concepts and shallow theories, e.g., producing ""believable"" agents for computer entertainments.

After each video, the participants were scanned while performing a 3-back working memory task having either words or faces as stimuli. Task-related neural activity in bilateral PFC showed a predicted pattern: an Emotion × Stimulus crossover interaction, with no main effects, with activity predicting task performance. This highly specific result indicates that emotion and higher cognition can be truly integrated, i.e., at some point of processing, functional specialization is lost, and emotion and cognition conjointly and equally contribute to the control of thought and behavior.

To stimulate discussion of these issues, we propose a componential model in which emotions are seen to develop from simpler, reflex-like forms (“wired-in” sensory-motor processes) to complex cognitive-emotional patterns that result from the participation of at least two distinct levels of memory and information processing, a schematic and a conceptual level. These systems are typically activated by a continuous stimulus check process which evaluates five environment-organism attributes: novelty; pleasantness; goal conductiveness; coping potential; and consistency with social norms and self-relevant values.

Yet in spite of the many emotion models developed to date, there is a lack of consistency, and clarity, regarding what exactly it means to ‘model emotions’. The purpose of this paper is to attempt to deconstruct the vague term ‘emotion modeling’ by (1) suggesting that we view emotion models in terms of two fundamental categories of processes: emotion generation and emotion effects; and (2) identifying some of the fundamental computational tasks necessary to implement these processes. These ‘model building blocks’ can then provide a basis for the development of more systematic guidelines for the theoretical and data requirements, and the representational and reasoning alternatives, in emotion modeling. Identification of a set of generic computational tasks is also a good starting point for a systematic comparison of alternative approaches.', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 50, 'citationCount': 43, 'journal': {'pages': '52-59'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Hudlicka2008WhatAW,\n author = {E.

This paper describes a computational model of the appraisal process, implemented within the broader context of a cognitive agent architecture. A particular focus here is on modeling the interacting influences of states and traits on perception and cognition, including their effects on the appraisal process itself. These effects are modeled by manipulating a series of architecture parameters, such as the speed and processing capacity of the individual modules. The paper presents results of an evaluation experiment modeling the behavior of three types of agents: ‘normal’, ‘anxious’, and ‘aggressive’. The appraisal model generated different affective appraisals of the same set of external circumstances for the different agent types, resulting in distinct emotions, and eventually leading to observable differences in behavior.

Unfortunately, the traditional evacuation-drill approach for emergency situations focuses on the physiological interaction between individuals/crowds, whereas the approach ignores psychological interaction. In this paper, we present an emotion contagion model that associates components, such as physiological demand, security requirement and personality traits, with individual agents comprising a crowd, and produces emergent behaviours in the crowd as a whole. The emotion contagion model realises the interaction of physiological and psychological factors. Personality traits are associated with emotions by using the OCEAN, OCC and PAD models. To reflect the complexity of emotion contagion of crowd, we consider three processes: contagion, update, and decay. We also consider the effect of emotions on the movement. Testing results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and realistic for simulating the movement of heterogeneous crowd in emergency situations.",2018,36,5,"{'name': 'Int. J. Simul.

Based on the approximate calculation, a discrete combination optimisation model is formulated and a modified max-min ant system (MMAS) is taken as the core algorithm. With the integration speed tracking strategy, this method achieves the recommended speed profile with optimised energy consumption and a perfect running punctuality along the actual tracked trajectory. The computation time of the algorithm is shorter and the switching time of operation during the cruising phase is reduced by integrating the drivers' experience, which also reduces the energy consumption of train running between stations.

This paper describes how crowd density information can be used to guide a large number of characters through a crowded environment. Crowd density information helps characters avoid congested routes that could lead to traffic jams. It also encourages characters to use a wide variety of routes to reach their destination. Our technique measures the desirability of a route by combining distance information with crowd density information. We start by building a navigation mesh for the walkable regions in a polygonal two‐dimensional (2‐D) or multilayered three‐dimensional (3‐D) environment. The skeleton of this navigation mesh is the medial axis. Each walkable region in the navigation mesh maintains an up‐to‐date density value. This density value is equal to the area occupied by all the characters inside a given region divided by the total area of this region. These density values are mapped onto the medial axis to form a weighted graph. An A* search on this graph yields a backbone path for each character, and forces are used to guide the characters through the weighted environment. The characters periodically replan their routes as the density values are updated. Our experiments show that we can compute congestion‐avoiding paths for tens of thousands of characters in real‐time.

By means of molecular-dynamic-like microsimulations based on a generalized force model of interactive pedestrian dynamics, the spatio-temporal patterns in pedestrian crowds are successfully reproduced and interpreted as self-organized phenomena. In contrast to previous socio-psychological approaches, this allows a physical understanding of the observations. Despite the significantly different phenomena occuring in normal and panic situations, the main effects can be described by a unified model containing only well interpretable and plausible terms. The transition between the “rational” normal behavior and the apparently “irrational” panic behavior is controlled by a single parameter, the “nervousness”, which influences fluctuation strengths, desired speeds, and the tendency of herding. Thereby, it causes paradoxial effects like “freezing by heating”, “faster is slower”, and the ignorance of available exits.

The integrated wholeness of the organism must be one of the foundation stones of motivation theory. 2. The hunger drive (or any other physiological drive) was rejected as a centering point or model for a definitive theory of motivation. Any drive that is somatically based and localizable was shown to be atypical rather than typical in human motivation. 3. Such a theory should stress and center itself upon ultimate or basic goals rather than partial or superficial ones, upon ends rather than means to these ends. Such a stress would imply a more central place for unconscious than for conscious motivations. 4. There are usually available various cultural paths to the same goal. Therefore conscious, specific, local-cultural desires are not as fundamental in motivation theory as the more basic, unconscious goals. 5. Any motivated behavior, either preparatory or consummatory, must be understood to be a channel through which many basic needs may be simultaneously expressed or satisfied. Typically an act has more than one motivation. 6. Practically all organismic states are to be understood as motivated and as motivating. 7. Human needs arrange themselves in hierarchies of prepotency. That is to say, the appearance of one need usually rests on the prior satisfaction of another, more pre-potent need. Man is a perpetually wanting animal.

However, as human behaviour can change under the effect of emotions, it is essential to create models of artificial agents and simulations that mimic such behaviour in order to make prediction of the overall system performance. In emotional agents, the role of emotional contagion is important. Emotional contagion is a result of interaction between agents which could affect each others emotions. It is the case that in emergency situations, emotions (especially calmness, fear and panic) may propagate in various ways, depending on the agents personality type as well as other factors. In this paper, we review various methods of emotional contagion. In order to develop emotional agent simulation, we start from a formal state-based modelling method and devise a number of variations of known emotional contagion methods.

Prof. Dr. Uğur Güdükbay July, 2010 Crowd simulation has a wide range of application areas such as biological and social modeling, military simulations, computer games and movies. Simulating the behavior of animated virtual crowds has been a challenging task for the computer graphics community. As well as the physical and the geometrical aspects, the semantics underlying the motion of real crowds inspire the design and implementation of virtual crowds. Psychology helps us understand the motivations of the individuals constituting a crowd. There has been extensive research on incorporating psychological models into the simulation of autonomous agents. However, in our study, instead of the psychological state of an individual agent as such, we are interested in the overall behavior of the crowd that consists of virtual humans with various psychological states. For this purpose, we incorporate the three basic constituents of affect: personality, emotion and mood. Each of these elements contribute variably to the emergence of different aspects of behavior. We thus examine, by changing the parameters, how groups of people with different characteristics interact with each other, and accordingly, how the global crowd behavior is influenced. In the social psychology literature, crowds are classified as mobs and audiences. Audiences are passive crowds whereas mobs are active crowds with emotional, irrational and seemingly homogeneous behavior. In this thesis, we examine how audiences turn into mobs and simulate the common properties of mobs to create collective misbehavior. So far, crowd simulation research has focused on panicking crowds among all types of mobs. We extend the state of the art to simulate different types of mobs based on the taxonomy. We demonstrate various scenarios that realize the behavior of distinct mob types. Our model is built on top of an existing crowd simulation system, HiDAC iv', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 119, 'citationCount': 49, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Durupinar2010FromAT,\n author = {Funda Durupinar},\n title = {From audiences to mobs: Crowd simulation with psychological factors (Kitlelerden güruhlara: Psikolojik faktörlerle kalabalık simülasyonu)},\n year = {2010}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2643744', 'name': 'Funda Durupinar'}]}, {'paperId': 'c90e110b533affd1c51f1bd3f4dfb89ae90c06fe', 'title': 'NEO inventories for the NEO Personality Inventory-3 (NEO-PI-3), NEO Five-Factor Inventory-3 (NEO-FFI-3), NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO PI-R) : professional manual', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 2392, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{McCrae2010NEOIF,\n author = {R.

One such challenge is the creation of autonomous socially intelligent characters with whom players can practice different social skills. Although there are several architectures in the field of virtual agents that are designed specifically to enable more human-like interactions, they are still not widely adopted by game studios that develop serious games, in particular for learning. In this paper, we present a virtual agent toolkit that was specifically developed with the intent of making agent-based solutions more accessible and reliable to game developers. To this end, a collaborative effort was established with a game studio that has used the toolkit to develop two different serious games. Among other advantages, the toolkit facilitated the inclusion of a dynamic model of emotions that affects not just how the character looks and acts but also how the player’s performance is determined.",2018,22,17,"{'name': '2018 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)', 'pages': '1-7'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mascarenhas2018AVA,\n author = {S.

For humans to be able to have a positive experience of interaction with such robots, they need to trust them to some degree. In this paper, we present the development and evaluation of a social robot that was created to play a card game with humans, playing the role of a partner and opponent. This type of activity is especially important, since our target group is elderly people - a population that often suffers from social isolation. Moreover, the card game scenario can lead to the development of interesting trust dynamics during the interaction, in which the human that partners with the robot needs to trust it in order to succeed and win the game. The design of the robot's behavior and game dynamics was inspired in previous user-centered design studies in which elderly people played the same game. Our evaluation results show that the levels of trust differ according to the previous knowledge that players have of their partners. Thus, humans seem to significantly increase their trust level towards a robot they already know, whilst maintaining the same level of trust in a human that they also previously knew.

To determine whether high performing player strategies could be collectively codified, we augmented the Foldit gameplay mechanics with tools for players to encode their folding strategies as “recipes” and to share their recipes with other players, who are able to further modify and redistribute them. Here we describe the rapid social evolution of player-developed folding algorithms that took place in the year following the introduction of these tools. Players developed over 5,400 different recipes, both by creating new algorithms and by modifying and recombining successful recipes developed by other players. The most successful recipes rapidly spread through the Foldit player population, and two of the recipes became particularly dominant. Examination of the algorithms encoded in these two recipes revealed a striking similarity to an unpublished algorithm developed by scientists over the same period. Benchmark calculations show that the new algorithm independently discovered by scientists and by Foldit players outperforms previously published methods. Thus, online scientific game frameworks have the potential not only to solve hard scientific problems, but also to discover and formalize effective new strategies and algorithms.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 14, 'citationCount': 467, 'journal': {'volume': '108', 'pages': '18949 - 18953', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Khatib2011AlgorithmDB,\n author = {Firas Khatib and Seth Cooper and M.

The success of an e-learning tool relies primarily on the level of acceptance of the tool by the e-learners and their state of emotion while using the tool. Therefore, addressing e-learner's emotional competences is important to understand the implicit emotion of the young minds. In this context, virtual agents are expected to play the role of instructors in a virtual learning environment. This paper aims to study the affective design of the Virtual Agent in terms of attractiveness and realism that adopts Kansei Engineering, an emerging technology used to explore and validate the emotion structure defined as a complex state of feelings that can result in the changes of human behaviour and thoughts of e-learners. Adding on, the paper also highlights and validates the six universal emotions such as anger, happiness, surprise, disgust, sadness and fear.

A nimals and humans all manifest social qualities and skills. Dogs recognize dominance and submission , stand corrected by their superiors, demonstrate consistent personalities, and so forth. On the other hand, only humans communicate through language and carry on conversations with one another. The skills involved in human conversation have developed in such a way as to exploit all the special characteristics of the human body. We make complex repre-sentational gestures with our prehensile hands, gaze away and toward one another out of the corners of our centrally set eyes, and use the pitch and melody of our flexible voices to emphasize and clarify what we are saying. Perhaps because conversation is so defining of humanness and human interaction, the metaphor of face-to-face conversation has been applied to human-computer interface design for quite some time. One of the early arguments for the utility of this metaphor pointed to the application of the features of face-to-face conversation in human-computer interaction, including mixed initiative, nonverbal communication , sense of presence, and the rules involved in transferring control [9]. However, although these features have gained widespread recognition, human-computer conversation has only recently become more than a metaphor. That is, only recently have human-computer interface designers taken the metaphor seriously enough to attempt to design a computer that could hold up its end of the conversation with a human user. Here, I describe some of the features of human-human conversation being implemented in this new genre of embodied conversational agent, exploring a notable embodied conversational agent—named Rea—based on these features.

In this paper, we address the emotions that a virtual character should express to try to convince someone else during a negotiation. A model of an emotional persuasive virtual character and its implementation in the virtual world Second Life are presented. Such character is endowed with strategies of emotion expression that enable it to identify dynamically the emotion that it should express, depending on its interlocutor’s emotional reaction, to try to influence his opinion during a negotiation. The emotional persuasive virtual character has been evaluated in indirect interaction (i.e. when the user watches a conversation between two virtual characters).

Are there activities that computers can engage in that actively draw people into relationships with them? What are the potential benefits to the people who participate in these human-computer relationships? To address these questions this work introduces a theory of Relational Agents, which are computational artifacts designed to build and maintain long-term, social-emotional relationships with their users. These can be purely software humanoid animated agents--as developed in this work--but they can also be non-humanoid or embodied in various physical forms, from robots, to pets, to jewelry, clothing, hand-helds, and other interactive devices. Central to the notion of relationship is that it is a persistent construct, spanning multiple interactions; thus, Relational Agents are explicitly designed to remember past history and manage future expectations in their interactions with users. Finally, relationships are fundamentally social and emotional, and detailed knowledge of human social psychology--with a particular emphasis on the role of affect--must be incorporated into these agents if they are to effectively leverage the mechanisms of human social cognition in order to build relationships in the most natural manner possible. People build relationships primarily through the use of language, and primarily within the context of face-to-face conversation. Embodied Conversational Agents--anthropomorphic computer characters that emulate the experience of face-to-face conversation--thus provide the substrate for this work, and so the relational activities provided by the theory will primarily be specific types of verbal and nonverbal conversational behaviors used by people to negotiate and maintain relationships. This work also provides an analysis of the types of applications in which having a human-computer relationship is advantageous to the human participant. In addition to applications in which the relationship is an end in itself (e.g., in entertainment systems), human-computer relationships are important in tasks in which the human is attempting to undergo some change in behavior or cognitive or emotional state. One such application is explored here: a system for assisting the user through a month-long health behavior change program in the area of exercise adoption. This application involves the research, design and implementation of relational agents as well as empirical evaluation of their ability to build relationships and effect change over a series of interactions with users.

While its application in Virtual Reality (VR) has been very successful for phobic disorders, the effects of exposure to virtual social stimuli in Social Anxiety Disorder are heterogeneous. This difference has been linked to demands on realism and presence, particularly social presence, as a pre-requisite in evoking emotional experiences in virtual social interactions. So far, however, the influence of social presence on emotional experience in social interactions with virtual agents remains unknown. Objective: We investigated the relationship between realism and social presence and the moderating effect of social presence on the relationship between agent behavior and experienced emotions in virtual social interaction. Methods: Healthy participants (N = 51) faced virtual agents showing supportive and dismissive behaviors in two virtual environments (short interactions and oral presentations). At first, participants performed five blocks of short one-on-one interactions with virtual agents (two male and two female agents per block). Secondly, participants gave five presentations in front of an audience of 16 agents. In each scenario, agent behavior was a within subjects factor, resulting in one block of neutral, two blocks of negative, and two blocks of positive agent behavior. Ratings of agent behavior (valence and realism), experience (valence and arousal), and presence (physical and social) were collected after every block. Moderator effects were investigated using mixed linear models with random intercepts. Correlations were analyzed via repeated measures correlations. Results: Ratings of valence of agent behaviors showed reliable relationships with experienced valence and less reliable relationships with experienced arousal. These relationships were moderated by social presence in the presentation scenario. Results for the interaction scenario were weaker but potentially promising for experimental studies. Variations in social presence and realism over time were correlated but social presence proved a more reliable moderator. Conclusion: Our findings emphasize the role of social presence for emotional experience in response to specific agent behaviors in virtual social interactions. While these findings should be replicated with experimental designs and in clinical samples, variability in social presence might account for heterogeneity in efficacy of virtual exposure to treat social anxiety disorder.",2021,39,3,{'volume': '2'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Pfaller2021SocialPA,\n author = {Michael Pfaller and Leon O.

Past research provided inconclusive answers: several experiments confirmed this possibility, but several others disagreed. On the other hand, previous studies have shown the important role of VR characteristics, such as realism or co-presence, in evoking other psychological phenomena. However, no study has investigated the interplay between the presence of computer-generated agents and perceived social realism in evoking social facilitation in virtual reality. To this end, the present randomized control study was conducted. The sample consisted of professional firefighters (N = 48), divided into an experimental group with virtual bystanders and a control group without them. Subjects were instructed to perform a rescue procedure in a virtual reality headset. The performance of participants was logged and they completed questionnaires regarding sense of presence in the virtual environment, perceived realism of the environment and perceived co-presence of virtual agents. The obtained results confirmed the role of social realism as a moderator of the occurrence of social facilitation in the presence of computer-generated agents. At the same time, the main effect of facilitation was not confirmed. These results support predictions that the subjective feeling of being in a realistic company of others may be more important in evoking social facilitation than objective facts. Furthermore, the results contribute to the debate regarding the mechanism of social facilitation, suggesting that simple augmentation of the environment with social distractors is not always enough, thus questioning the attentional explanation of the effect. Taken together, our results extend previous findings on social facilitation and open up new possibilities for designing effective virtual environments.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 54, 'citationCount': 14, 'journal': {'volume': '11', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Strojny2020ModeratorsOS,\n author = {P.

Close interpersonal distance (IPD) increases emotional responses during interaction and has been related to avoidance behavior in social anxiety. However, a systematic investigation of the effects of IPD on subjective experience combined with measures of physiological arousal and behavioral responses during real-time social interaction has been missing. Virtual Reality allows for a controlled manipulation of IPD while maintaining naturalistic social encounters. The present study investigates IPD in social interaction using a novel paradigm in Virtual Reality. Thirty-six participants approached virtual agents and engaged in short interactions. IPD was varied between 3.5 and 1 m by manipulating the distance at which agents reacted to the participant's approach. Closer distances were rated as more arousing, less pleasant, and less natural than longer distances and this effect was significantly modulated by social anxiety scores. Skin conductance responses were also increased at short distances compared to longer distances. Finally, an interaction of IPD and social anxiety was observed for avoidance behavior, measured as participants' backward motion during interaction, with stronger avoidance related to close distances and high values of social anxiety. These results highlight the influence of IPD on experience, physiological response, and behavior during social interaction. The interaction of social anxiety and IPD suggests including the manipulation of IPD in behavioral tests in Virtual Reality as a promising tool for the treatment of social anxiety disorder."", 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 46, 'citationCount': 25, 'journal': {'volume': '11', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychiatry'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Kroczek2020InterpersonalDD,\n author = {Leon O.

Also, socially anxious subjects reported to experience more copresence and mutual attention as well as a higher sense of being in the VE than their healthy peers.

The second meta-analysis tested whether the standard treatment for social anxiety, which includes in vivo or imaginal exposure, leads to greater effects than virtual reality exposure therapy. The second meta-analysis, consisting of seven studies and 340 total participants, showed essentially no difference in effect sizes between virtual reality exposure and in vivo or imaginal exposure.

Social exposure conducted in virtual reality (VR), embedded in individual cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT), could be an answer. Aims To show that conducting VR exposure in CBT for SAD is effective and is more practical for therapists than conducting exposure in vivo. Method Participants were randomly assigned to either VR exposure (n = 17), in vivo exposure (n = 22) or waiting list (n = 20). Participants in the active arms received individual CBT for 14 weekly sessions and outcome was assessed with questionnaires and a behaviour avoidance test. (Trial registration number ISRCTN99747069.) Results Improvements were found on the primary (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale) and all five secondary outcome measures in both CBT groups compared with the waiting list. Conducting exposure in VR was more effective at post-treatment than in vivo on the primary outcome measure and on one secondary measure. Improvements were maintained at the 6-month follow-up. VR was significantly more practical for therapists than in vivo exposure.

This technology, with its unique ability to simulate complex, real situations and contexts, offers researchers unprecedented opportunities to investigate human behavior in well controlled designs in the laboratory. One important application of VR is the investigation of pathological processes in mental disorders, especially anxiety disorders. Research on the processes underlying threat perception, fear, and exposure therapy has shed light on more general aspects of the relation between perception and emotion. Being by its nature virtual, i.e., simulation of reality, VR strongly relies on the adequate selection of specific perceptual cues to activate emotions. Emotional experiences in turn are related to presence, another important concept in VR, which describes the user’s sense of being in a VR environment. This paper summarizes current research into perception of fear cues, emotion, and presence, aiming at the identification of the most relevant aspects of emotional experience in VR and their mutual relations. A special focus lies on a series of recent experiments designed to test the relative contribution of perception and conceptual information on fear in VR. This strand of research capitalizes on the dissociation between perception (bottom–up input) and conceptual information (top-down input) that is possible in VR. Further, we review the factors that have so far been recognized to influence presence, with emotions (e.g., fear) being the most relevant in the context of clinical psychology. Recent research has highlighted the mutual influence of presence and fear in VR, but has also traced the limits of our current understanding of this relationship. In this paper, the crucial role of perception on eliciting emotional reactions is highlighted, and the role of arousal as a basic dimension of emotional experience is discussed. An interoceptive attribution model of presence is suggested as a first step toward an integrative framework for emotion research in VR.

Existing studies on the relation between sense of presence and level of anxiety, however, have yielded mixed results on the correlation between the two. In this meta-analysis, we reviewed publications on VRET for anxiety that included self-reported presence and anxiety. The comprehensive search of the literature identified 33 publications with a total of 1196 participants. The correlation between self-reported sense of presence and anxiety was extracted and meta-analyzed. Potential moderators such as technology characteristics, sample characteristics including age, gender and clinical status, disorder characteristics and study design characteristics such as measurements were also examined. The random effects analysis showed a medium effect size for the correlation between sense of presence and anxiety (r\u200a=\u200a.28; 95% CI: 0.18–0.38). Moderation analyses revealed that the effect size of the correlation differed across different anxiety disorders, with a large effect size for fear of animals (r\u200a=\u200a.50; 95% CI: 0.30–0.66) and a no to small effect size for social anxiety disorder (r\u200a=\u200a.001; 95% CI: −0.19–0.19). Further, the correlation between anxiety and presence was stronger in studies with participants who met criteria for an anxiety disorder than in studies with a non-clinical population. Trackers with six degrees of freedom and displays with a larger field of view resulted in higher effect sizes, compared to trackers with three degrees of freedom and displays with a smaller field of view. In addition, no difference in effect size was found for the type of presence measurement and the type of anxiety measurement.

Thus, the current study analyzed presence, self-reported anxiety, and a physiological parameter (heart rate [HR]) in a sample of 30 high anxious and 35 low anxious participants. Both groups delivered a 5 minute speech in a virtual lecture hall. Results indicate no mediating influences of presence on group differences in self-reported state anxiety during the speech, but point toward negative correlations between state anxiety and the iGroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ) scales ""sense of being there"" and ""realism."" Furthermore, HR was found to be unrelated to self-reported presence. Only the IPQ scale ""spatial presence"" showed a marginally significant influence on group differences in state anxiety. The present results support the assumption that presence and anxiety are logically distinct, meaning that presence does not directly influence the intensity of an emotion felt in a VE. Rather, it constitutes a precondition for an emotion to be at all elicited by a VE. Also, HR has proven to be no adequate substitute measure for presence, since it only assesses anxiety not presence. It may, however, mediate the interplay between trait anxiety and state anxiety. Possible implications of the current findings are discussed alongside the problem of using presence questionnaires that seem to be prone to subjective bias (i.e., participants confusing presence and emotion).', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 23, 'citationCount': 50, 'journal': {'volume': '17 5', 'pages': '\n          310-6\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Felnhofer2014AfraidTB,\n author = {A.

The idea is put forward, based on the experience of a large number of experimental studies, that there are two orthogonal components that contribute to this realistic response. The first is ‘being there’, often called ‘presence’, the qualia of having a sensation of being in a real place. We call this place illusion (PI). Second, plausibility illusion (Psi) refers to the illusion that the scenario being depicted is actually occurring. In the case of both PI and Psi the participant knows for sure that they are not ‘there’ and that the events are not occurring. PI is constrained by the sensorimotor contingencies afforded by the virtual reality system. Psi is determined by the extent to which the system can produce events that directly relate to the participant, the overall credibility of the scenario being depicted in comparison with expectations. We argue that when both PI and Psi occur, participants will respond realistically to the virtual reality.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 49, 'citationCount': 1520, 'journal': {'volume': '364', 'pages': '3549 - 3557', 'name': 'Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Slater2009PlaceIA,\n author = {M.

A period of distraction (reading a text on relaxation) separated the ANX and NOANX immersions. Experimenters recorded presence and anxiety in the middle of and after each VR immersion. These brief measures of presence supported our hypothesis and were significantly higher in the anxious immersion than in the baseline or the nonanxious immersion. This finding was not corroborated by the presence questionnaire, where scores varied significantly in the opposite direction. The results from the brief one-item measures of presence support the significant contribution of emotions felt during the immersion on the subjective feeling of presence. The mixed results with the presence questionnaire are discussed, along with psychological factors potentially involved in presence.', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 69, 'citationCount': 159, 'journal': {'volume': '17', 'pages': '376-391', 'name': 'PRESENCE: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Bouchard2008AnxietyIT,\n author = {S.

Although research into presence is still at an early stage of development, there is a consensus that presence has multiple determinants. To identify and test which parameters affect presence, a reliable, robust and valid means of measuring presence is required. In this paper, we describe the categories of factors thought to have an impact on presence. Furthermore, we present an overview of various approaches taken to measuring presence, which can be divided into two general categories: subjective measures and objective corroborative measures. Since presence is a subjective experience, the most direct way of assessment is through users' subjective report. This approach has serious limitations however, and should be used judiciously. Objective measures, such as postural, physiological or social responses to media, can be used to corroborate subjective measures, thereby overcoming some of their limitations. At present, the most promising direction for presence measurement is to develop and use an aggregate measure of presence that is comprised of both subjective and objective components, tailored to the specific medium under study."", 'year': 2000, 'referenceCount': 58, 'citationCount': 617, 'journal': {'volume': '3959'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Ijsselsteijn2000PresenceCD,\n author = {W.

These are believed to be associated with vulnerability to psychopathology. This paper explores the construct and measurement of submissive behaviours and their association with psychopathology.\n\n\nDESIGN\nTwo self-report scales were designed to measure the frequencies of (a) typical submissive behaviours (SBS) and (b) passive/withdrawal and affiliative strategies focused on conflict de-escalation (CDS). The association of these scales with psychopathology was explored in a series of questionnaire studies.\n\n\nMETHODS\nStudy 1 assessed the SBS using a student sample (N = 332) and a mixed clinical group (N = 136). Of these, 177 students and 66 patients also completed the SCL-90-R. In Studies 2 and 3, the CDS and its association with depressive symptoms were assessed using a student sample (N = 154) and a depressed patient group (N = 60).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe SBS and CDS appeared reliable. There was a positive relationship between the SBS and the SCL-90-R, including interpersonal sensitivity and unexpressed hostility. The passive/withdrawal subscale of the CDS was associated with depressive symptoms. Evidence was obtained for sex differences with the affiliative subscale.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSome forms of submissive behaviour, especially those associated with passive/withdrawal and inhibition, are associated with a wide range of psychological problems.', 'year': 1997, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 278, 'journal': {'volume': '36 ( Pt 4)', 'pages': '\n          467-88\n        ', 'name': 'The British journal of clinical psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Allan1997SubmissiveBA,\n author = {S.

The fundamental task in sentiment analysis is to classify the polarity of a given content as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Although extensive research has been conducted in this area of computational linguistics, most of the research work has been carried out in the context of English language. However, Bengali sentiment expression has varying degree of sentiment labels, which can be plausibly distinct from English language. Therefore, sentiment assessment of Bengali language is undeniably important to be developed and executed properly. In sentiment analysis, the prediction potential of an automatic modeling is completely dependent on the quality of dataset annotation. Bengali sentiment annotation is a challenging task due to diversified structures (syntax) of the language and its different degrees of innate sentiments (i.e., weakly and strongly positive/negative sentiments).

For PNs, we define emotion carriers as the speech or text segments that best explain the emotional state of the narrator. Such segments may span from single to multiple words, containing for example verb or noun phrases. Advanced automatic understanding of PNs requires not only the prediction of the narrator’s emotional state but also to identify which events (e.g. the loss of a relative or the visit of grandpa) or people (e.g. the old group of high school mates) carry the emotion manifested during the personal recollection. This work proposes and evaluates an annotation model for identifying emotion carriers in spoken personal narratives. Compared to other text genres such as news and microblogs, spoken PNs are particularly challenging because a narrative is usually unstructured, involving multiple sub-events and characters as well as thoughts and associated emotions perceived by the narrator. In this work, we experiment with annotating emotion carriers in speech transcriptions from the Ulm State-of-Mind in Speech (USoMS) corpus, a dataset of PNs in German.

However, the context of dialogue can prove helpful in detection of the emotion. In this task, given a textual dialogue i.e. an utterance along with two previous turns of context, the goal was to infer the underlying emotion of the utterance by choosing from four emotion classes - Happy, Sad, Angry and Others. To facilitate the participation in this task, textual dialogues from user interaction with a conversational agent were taken and annotated for emotion classes after several data processing steps. A training data set of 30160 dialogues, and two evaluation data sets, Test1 and Test2, containing 2755 and 5509 dialogues respectively were released to the participants. A total of 311 teams made submissions to this task. The final leader-board was evaluated on Test2 data set, and the highest ranked submission achieved 79.59 micro-averaged F1 score.

The solution to the dilemma is to develop metrics that quantify the decisions that annotators are asked to make. This paper discusses MASI, distance metric for comparing sets, and illustrates its use in quantifying the reliability of a specific dataset. Annotations of Summary Content Units (SCUs) generate models referred to as pyramids which can be used to evaluate unseen human summaries or machine summaries. The paper presents reliability results for five pairs of pyramids created for document sets from the 2003 Document Understanding Conference (DUC). The annotators worked independently of each other. Differences between application of MASI to pyramid annotation and its previous application to co-reference annotation are discussed. In addition, it is argued that a paradigmatic reliability study should relate measures of inter-annotator agreement to independent assessments, such as significance tests of the annotated variables with respect to other phenomena. In effect, what counts as sufficiently reliable intera-annotator agreement depends on the use the annotated data will be put to.', 'year': 2006, 'referenceCount': 16, 'citationCount': 166, 'journal': {'pages': '831-836'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Passonneau2006MeasuringAO,\n author = {R.

In this study, we propose a novel task/method to address QA sentiment analysis. In particular, we create a high-quality annotated corpus with specially-designed annotation guidelines for QA-style sentiment classification. On the basis, we propose a three-stage hierarchical matching network to explore deep sentiment information in a QA text pair. First, we segment both the question and answer text into sentences and construct a number of [Q-sentence, A-sentence] units in each QA text pair. Then, by leveraging a QA bidirectional matching layer, the proposed approach can learn the matching vectors of each [Q-sentence, A-sentence] unit. Finally, we characterize the importance of the generated matching vectors via a self-matching attention layer.

The goal of the present research was to show that it is of interest to assess the impact of neutral expressions in this context. In 2 studies using different methodologies, the authors found that participants perceived men who expressed neutral and angry emotions as higher in dominance when compared with men expressing sadness or shame. Study 1 showed that this is also true for men expressing happiness. In contrast, women expressing either anger or happiness were perceived as higher in dominance than were women showing a neutral expression who were rated as less dominant. However, sadness expressions by both men and women clearly decreased the extent to which they were perceived as dominant, and a trend in this direction emerged for shame expressions by men in Study 2. Thus, neutral expressions seem to be perceived as a sign of dominance in men but not in women.

In this paper, we explore a novel vision-based approach of collision avoidance between walkers that fits the requirements of interactive crowd simulation. By simulating humans based on cognitive science results, we detect future collisions as well as the level of danger from visual stimuli. The motor-response is twofold: a reorientation strategy prevents future collision, whereas a deceleration strategy prevents imminent collisions.

However, creating photo-realistic animations under environment illumination is exceedingly compute intensive. The Precomputed Radiance Transfer (PRT) methods achieve real-time rendering under environment illumination; however, these methods only have a limited application in animation because the objects in the scene cannot be moved or rotated. In this paper, we propose a method for rendering photo-realistic animations of dynamic scenes under environment illumination in real time. We notice the fact that when objects are moved or rotated, changes of radiances occur mainly in the regions of shadows cast by other objects. Our method makes a distinction between self-shadow and shadows cast by other objects and computes these two kinds of shadows efficiently.

Since the available space for such facilities is increasingly under pressure, the space efficiency and walking comfort is becoming more and more important. The developed simulation tool provides designers and decision-makers with all kinds of quantitative information about the expected quality of pedestrian (traffic) flows such as travel times, waiting times, queue building, preferred routes, visits to shops and counters, etc. This information is very useful in comparing multiple designs as well as to optimise a specific design. The simulation model also is meant to improve schedules of public transport services at interchange nodes by minimising passenger transfer times. To that end, special attention is paid to the modelling of boarding and alighting processes. New insights about walking have been gained by performing unique large-scale laboratory experiments in which large groups of subjects were assigned various walking tasks, such as high volume crossing flows and walking through bottlenecks until flow breaks down. Specific walking and route choice models are developed using observations of passengers on platforms (such as in Delft) and route choice through the station (such as in Delft and Breda).

Using numerous examples, they explain how different variables influence emotion intensity, and show how emotions can be formalized for computational purposes.\xa0Now with a contributed chapter describing the OCC model's influence, this book will interest a wide audience in cognitive, clinical, and social psychology, as well as in artificial intelligence and affective computing, and other cognitive science disciplines."", 'year': 1988, 'referenceCount': 3, 'citationCount': 6710, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Ortony1988TheCS,\n author = {A.

The I-Sim Research Workshop is a new forum for researchers to exchange ideas and results and to discuss new developments in the simulation of stochastic processes and discrete-event systems. The goal is to bring together leading researchers working in a variety of theoretical, empirical, application, and implementation domains in order to reflect on a common theme. The first I-Sim Research Workshop focused on the following question: How can simulation most effectively support better decisions? The workshop participants took several approaches to responding to this question. One was to examine the frontiers of research, including simulation optimization techniques from continuous and discrete ranking-and-selection perspectives, uncertainty analysis, the robustness of decisions to modeling assumptions, implementation issues, and special considerations that arise in specific applications. Another approach was to examine the demands being placed on existing simulation tools that are used in a variety of applications.

This paper presents our work on designing behavior model for virtual humans in a crowd simulation under normal‐life and emergency situations. Our model adopts an agent‐based approach and employs a layered framework to reflect the natural pattern of human‐like decision making process, which generally involves a person's awareness of the situation and consequent changes on the internal attributes. The social group and crowd‐related behaviors are modeled according to the findings and theories observed from social psychology (e.g., social attachment theory). By integrating our model into an agent execution process, each individual agent can response differently to the perceived environment and make realistic behavioral decisions based on various physiological, emotional, and social group attributes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, a case study has been conducted, which shows that realistic human behaviors can be generated at both individual and group level.

ABM is applicable to complex systems embedded in natural, social, and engineered contexts, across domains that range from engineering to ecology. An Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling offers a comprehensive description of the core concepts, methods, and applications of ABM. Its hands-on approach -- with hundreds of examples and exercises using NetLogo -- enables readers to begin constructing models immediately, regardless of experience or discipline. The book first describes the nature and rationale of agent-based modeling, then presents the methodology for designing and building ABMs, and finally discusses how to utilize ABMs to answer complex questions.

This has led to a truly interdisciplinary, mutually beneficial partnership between emotion research in psychology and in computational science, of which this volume is an exemplar. To understand this partnership and its potential for transforming existing practices in emotion research across disciplines and for disclosing important novel areas of research, we explore in this chapter the history of work in computational models of emotion including the various uses to which they have been put, the theoretical traditions that have shaped their development, and how these uses and traditions are reflected in their underlying architectures. For an outsider to the field, the last 15 years have seen the development of a seemingly bewildering array of competing and complementary computational models. Figure 1.2.1 lists a ‘family tree’ of a few of the significant models and the theoretical traditions from which they stem. Although there has been a proliferation of work, the field is far from mature: the goals that a model is designed to achieve are not always clearly articulated; research is rarely incremental, more often returning to motivating theories rather than extending prior computational approaches; and rarely are models contrasted with each other in terms of their ability to achieve their set goals. Contributing to potential confusion is the reality that computational models are complex systems embodying a number of, sometimes unarticulated, design decisions and assumptions inherited from the psychological and computational traditions from which they emerged, a circumstance made worse by the lack of a commonly accepted lexicon even for designating these distinctions. In this chapter, we lay out the work on computational models of emotion in an attempt to reveal the common uses to which they may be put and the underlying techniques and assumptions from which the models are built. Our aim is to present conceptual distinctions and common terminology that can aid in discussion and comparison of competing models. Our hope is that this will not only facilitate an understanding of the field for outside researchers but work towards a lexicon that can help foster the maturity of the field towards more incremental research. In characterizing different computational models of emotion, we begin by describing interdisciplinary uses to which computational models may be put, including their uses in improving human–computer interaction, in enhancing general models of intelligence, and as methodological tools for furthering our understanding of human behaviour. We next discuss how models have been built, including the underlying theoretical traditions that have shaped their development. These differing theoretical perspectives often conceptualize emotion in quite different ways, emphasizing different scenarios and proposed functions, different component processes, and different linkages between these components. It should then come as no surprise that such', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 113, 'citationCount': 392, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Marsella2010ComputationalMO,\n author = {S.

It also presents an analysis of the responses to a post-experiment Likert scale questionnaire and the emotions estimated from the participants’ facial expressions, which allowed one to obtain a phone embedding matrix and to conclude that there is no common cross-cultural baseline impression regarding different prosody parameters and that similarly sounding phones are not close in the embedding space.

In the past, business negotiations, profiling, seminars, shopping, and agreements were in-person but today everything is almost digitalized. Objectives: The study aims to examine how the Internet of things (IoTs) connects text-object as part of NLP and AI responding to human needs. Also, how precipitated changes in the business environment and modern applications such as NLP and AI embedded with IoTs services have changed business settings. Problem statement: As communication takes lead in the business environment, companies have developed sophisticated applications of NLP that take human desires and fulfill them instantly with the help of text, phone calls, smart records, and chatbots. The ease of communication and interaction has shown a greater influence on customer choice, desires, and needs. Modern service providers now use email, text, phone calls, smart records, and virtual assistants as first contact points for almost all of their dealings, customer inquiries, and most preferred trading channels. Method: The study uses text content as part of NLP and AI to demonstrate how companies capture customers’ insight and how they use IoTs to influence customers’ reactions, responses, and engagement with enterprise management in Industry 4.0. The “Behavior-oriented drive and influential function of IoTs on Customers in Industry 4.0” concept was used in this study to determine the influence of Industry 4.0 on customers. Results: The result indicates the least score of 12 out of 15 grades for all the measurements on a behavior-oriented drive and influential function of IoTs on customers. Conclusion: The study concluded that NLP and AI are the preferred system for enterprise management in the era of Industry 4.0 to understand customers’ demands and achieve customer satisfaction.

Previous methods performed the expressive speech synthesis either with explicit labels or with a fixed-length style embedding extracted from reference audio, both of which can only learn an average style and thus ignores the multi-scale nature of speech prosody. In this paper, we propose MsEmoTTS, a multi-scale emotional speech synthesis framework, to model the emotion from different levels. Specifically, the proposed method is a typical attention-based sequence-to-sequence model and with proposed three modules, including global-level emotion presenting module (GM), utterance-level emotion presenting module (UM), and local-level emotion presenting module (LM), to model the global emotion category, utterance-level emotion variation, and syllable-level emotion strength, respectively. In addition to modeling the emotion from different levels, the proposed method also allows us to synthesize emotional speech in different ways, i.e., transferring the emotion from reference audio, predicting the emotion from input text, and controlling the emotion strength manually. Extensive experiments conducted on a Chinese emotional speech corpus demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the compared reference audio-based and text-based emotional speech synthesis methods on the emotion transfer speech synthesis and text-based emotion prediction speech synthesis respectively. Besides, the experiments also show that the proposed method can control the emotion expressions flexibly.

However, since linguistic information is not directly relevant to how words are pronounced, TTS quality improvement of these systems is mild. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective way of jointly training acoustic phone and word embeddings for end-to-end TTS systems. Experiments on the LJSpeech dataset show that the acoustic word embeddings dramatically decrease both the training and validation loss in phone-level prosody prediction.

In these artificial intelligence devices, trust plays a key role in users’ initial adoption and successful utilization. Factors enhancing trust toward conversational agents include appearances, voice features, and communication styles. Synthesizing such work will be useful in designing evidence-based, trustworthy conversational agents appropriate for various contexts. We conducted a systematic review of the experimental studies that investigated the effect of conversational agents’ and users’ characteristics on trust. From a full-text review of 29 articles, we identified five agent design-themes affecting trust toward conversational agents: social intelligence of the agent, voice characteristics and communication style, look of the agent, non-verbal communication, and performance quality. We also found that participants’ demographic, personality, or use context moderate the effect of these themes. We discuss implications for designing trustworthy conversational agents and responsibilities around on stereotypes and social norm building through agent design.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 75, 'citationCount': 95, 'journal': {'volume': '37', 'pages': '81 - 96', 'name': 'International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Rheu2021SystematicRT,\n author = {M.

Existing annotated databases of facial expressions in the wild are small and mostly cover discrete emotions (aka the categorical model). There are very limited annotated facial databases for affective computing in the continuous dimensional model (e.g., valence and arousal). To meet this need, we collected, annotated, and prepared for public distribution a new database of facial emotions in the wild (called AffectNet). AffectNet contains more than 1,000,000 facial images from the Internet by querying three major search engines using 1,250 emotion related keywords in six different languages. About half of the retrieved images were manually annotated for the presence of seven discrete facial expressions and the intensity of valence and arousal. AffectNet is by far the largest database of facial expression, valence, and arousal in the wild enabling research in automated facial expression recognition in two different emotion models. Two baseline deep neural networks are used to classify images in the categorical model and predict the intensity of valence and arousal.

A mechanism for coordinating this basic mode of interaction is a system of turn-taking that regulates who is to speak and when. Yet relatively little is known about how this system varies across cultures. The anthropological literature reports significant cultural differences in the timing of turn-taking in ordinary conversation. We test these claims and show that in fact there are striking universals in the underlying pattern of response latency in conversation. Using a worldwide sample of 10 languages drawn from traditional indigenous communities to major world languages, we show that all of the languages tested provide clear evidence for a general avoidance of overlapping talk and a minimization of silence between conversational turns. In addition, all of the languages show the same factors explaining within-language variation in speed of response. We do, however, find differences across the languages in the average gap between turns, within a range of 250 ms from the cross-language mean. We believe that a natural sensitivity to these tempo differences leads to a subjective perception of dramatic or even fundamental differences as offered in ethnographic reports of conversational style. Our empirical evidence suggests robust human universals in this domain, where local variations are quantitative only, pointing to a single shared infrastructure for language use with likely ethological foundations.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 49, 'citationCount': 1022, 'journal': {'volume': '106', 'pages': '10587 - 10592', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Stivers2009UniversalsAC,\n author = {Tanya Stivers and N.

This allows the researcher to estimate confidence intervals for statistics that do not have simple sampling distributions (e.g., the median). The purposes of this article are to describe the concept of bootstrapping, to demonstrate how to estimate confidence intervals for the median and the Spearman rank correlation coefficient for non-normally-distributed data from a recent clinical study using two commonly used statistical software packages (SAS and Stata), and to discuss specific limitations of the bootstrap.', 'year': 2005, 'referenceCount': 12, 'citationCount': 345, 'journal': {'volume': '12 4', 'pages': '\n          360-5\n        ', 'name': 'Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Haukoos2005AdvancedSB,\n author = {J.

A window into perception, thought and language', 'abstract': 'We investigated grapheme–colour synaesthesia and found that: (1) The induced colours led to perceptual grouping and pop-out, (2) a grapheme rendered invisible through ‘crowding’ or lateral masking induced synaesthetic colours — a form of blindsight — and (3) peripherally presented graphemes did not induce colours even when they were clearly visible. Taken collectively, these and other experiments prove conclusively that synaesthesia is a genuine perceptual phenomenon, not an effect based on memory associations from childhood or on vague metaphorical speech. We identify different subtypes of number–colour synaesthesia and propose that they are caused by hyperconnectivity between colour and number areas at different stages in processing; lower synaesthetes may have cross-wiring (or cross-activation) within the fusiform gyrus, whereas higher synaesthetes may have cross-activation in the angular gyrus. This hyperconnectivity might be caused by a genetic mutation that causes defective pruning of connections between brain maps. The mutation may further be expressed selectively (due to transcription factors) in the fusiform or angular gyri, and this may explain the existence of different forms of synaesthesia. If expressed very diffusely, there may be extensive cross-wiring between brain regions that represent abstract concepts, which would explain the link between creativity, metaphor and synaesthesia (and the higher incidence of synaesthesia among artists and poets). Also, hyperconnectivity between the sensory cortex and amygdala would explain the heightened aversion synaesthetes experience when seeing numbers printed in the ‘wrong’ colour. Lastly, kindling (induced hyperconnectivity in the temporal lobes of temporal lobe epilepsy [TLE] patients) may explain the purported higher incidence of synaesthesia in these patients . We conclude with a synaesthesia-based theory of the evolution of language. Thus, our experiments on synaesthesia and our theoretical framework attempt to link several seemingly unrelated facts about the human mind. Far from being a mere curiosity, synaesthesia may provide a window into perception, thought and language. www.imprint-academic.com/rama copyright © Journal of Consciousness Studies, 8, No. 12, 2001, pp. 3–34 Correspondence: Center for Brain and Cognition, University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Dr. 0109, La Jolla, CA 92093-0109, e-mail: vramacha@ucsd.edu', 'year': 2001, 'referenceCount': 128, 'citationCount': 1438, 'journal': {'volume': '8', 'pages': '3-34', 'name': 'Journal of Consciousness Studies'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Ramachandran2001SynaesthesiaAW,\n author = {V.

98,e06a4a5955d1a581a92a17ce5e00edf824e19786,Towards Sentiment and Emotion aided Intent Detection,"Intent detection is one of the crucial Natural Language Understanding(NLU) tasks studied extensively. Misclassification of intents impacts the overall performance of the conversational systems as natural language understanding is the first mean of interaction between a user and a virtual agent. The traditional approach of intent detection is limited only to textual features of user utterances and overlooks other semantic features. The sentiment and emotional state of the speaker are two such semantic features that have essential impacts on intent detection, as they implicitly express user intention conveyed through the user’s message. Depending on the context, these features can help the dialogue agent respond to the same intent with varying degrees of sentiment and emotion. Thus, investigating the role of sentiment and emotion on intent detection is a matter of great interest. The current work investigates the impact of utilizing sentiment and emotion information on intent detection tasks and proposes emotion and sentiment aided intent detection models. We also investigate the impact of sentiment and emotion using three different multitasking frameworks and present a joint model that utilizes the co-relation information across these tasks to correctly identify all these NLU aspects (intent, sentiment, and emotion). The obtained experimental results by the proposed models outperform several baselines and state-of-the-art intent detection models on multiple datasets by a significant margin of 1.8% - 3%, demonstrating the significant role of sentiment and emotion features in intent detection1.",2022,24,0,"{'name': '2022 26th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)', 'pages': '2510-2516'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Trivedi2022TowardsSA,\n author = {Ashutosh Kumar Trivedi and A.

This holds true for discussion in any for a, including social media platforms such as Twitter. However, the tweeter’s emotional state has a huge impact on its pragmatic content because communication is fundamentally characterized and mediated by direct emotions. Sentiment as a human behavior often has a strong relation to emotion, and one helps to understand the other better. We hypothesize that the association between emotion and sentiment will provide a clearer understanding of the tweeter’s state of mind, aiding the identification of tweet acts (speech acts in Twitter, TAs). As the first step, we create a new multimodal, emotion-TA, EmoTA dataset collected from the open-source Twitter dataset. To incorporate these multiple aspects, we propose a multitask ensemble adversarial learning framework for multimodal TA classification (TAC). In addition, we also incorporate a joint embedding network, with bidirectional constraints to capture and efficiently integrate the shared semantic relationships across modalities and learn generalized features across multiple tasks. Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework boosts the performance of the primary task, TAC, by benefiting from the two secondary tasks, i.e., sentiment and emotion analyses compared to its unimodal and single-task TAC variants.', 'year': 2022, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 18, 'journal': {'volume': '9', 'pages': '508-517', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Saha2022AMM,\n author = {Tulika Saha and Apoorva Upadhyaya and S.

However, in real-world situations, end-users might not have a known and fixed goal beforehand for the task, i.e., they may upgrade/downgrade/update their goal components in real-time to maximize their utility values. Existing VAs are unable to handle such dynamic goal-oriented situations. Methodology Due to the absence of any related dialogue dataset where such choice deviations are present, we have created a conversational dataset called Deviation adapted Virtual Agent(DevVA), with the manual annotation of its corresponding intents, slots, and sentiment labels. A Dynamic Goal Driven Dialogue Agent (DGDVA) has been developed by incorporating a Dynamic Goal Driven Module (GDM) on top of a deep reinforcement learning based dialogue manager. In the course of a conversation, the user sentiment provides grounded feedback about agent behavior, including goal serving action. User sentiment appears to be an appropriate indicator for goal discrepancy that guides the agent to complete the user’s desired task with gratification. The negative sentiment expressed by the user about an aspect of the provided choice is treated as a discrepancy that is being resolved by the GDM depending upon the observed discrepancy and current dialogue state. The goal update capability and the VA’s interactiveness trait enable end-users to accomplish their desired task satisfactorily. Findings The obtained experimental results illustrate that DGDVA can handle dynamic goals with maximum user satisfaction and a significantly higher success rate. The interaction drives the user to decide its final goal through the latent specification of possible choices and information retrieved and provided by the dialogue agent. Through the experimental results (qualitative and quantitative), we firmly conclude that the proposed sentiment-aware VA adapts users’ dynamic behavior for its goal setting with substantial efficacy in terms of primary objective i.e., task success rate (0.88). Practical implications In real world, it can be argued that many people do not have a predefined and fixed goal for tasks such as online shopping, movie booking & restaurant booking, etc. They tend to explore the available options first which are aligned with their minimum requirements and then decide one amongst them. The DGDVA provides maximum user satisfaction as it enables them to accomplish a dynamic goal that leads to additional utilities along with the essential ones. Originality To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort towards the development of A Dynamic Goal Adapted Task-Oriented Dialogue Agent that can serve user goals dynamically until the user is satisfied.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 73, 'citationCount': 9, 'journal': {'volume': '16', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Tiwari2021ADG,\n author = {Abhisek Tiwari and Tulika Saha and S.

To test this hypothesis, we design different attention-based multi-task architectures that concurrently regress/classify both depression level and emotion intensity using text data.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective novel framework for NLU where the parameters of the IC and the NER models are jointly trained in a consolidated parameter space. Text semantic representations are obtained from popular pre-trained contextual language models, which are fine-tuned for our task, and these parameters are propagated to other deep neural layers in our framework leading to a faithful unified modelling of the IC and NER parameters. The overall framework results in a faithful parameter sharing when the training is underway, leading to a more coherent learning.

On the SNIPS dataset, we obtain a 1.42% improvement in NER in terms of the F1 score, and 1% improvement in intent accuracy score. On ATIS, we achieve 1.54% improvement in intent accuracy score.

99,8a388f43b366c4366d3d402f610b92c5422b3aff,Combining cognition and emotion in virtual agents,"Purpose 
 
 
 
 
The paper aims to explain the limitations of existing cognitive architectures and affective models, and propose a new cognitive-affective architecture that can be integrated in real intelligent agents to make them more realistic and believable. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
The paper evaluates the state of the art, and describes the design and implementation of the cognitive-affective architecture in an agent. A brief evaluation of the agent is provided. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The paper clearly states that it is possible to use cognitive architectures to help, but there is a lack of architectures that address the problem of combining cognition and emotion in agents in a unified, simplified way. A cognitive-affective architecture is useful to make believable intelligent agents in an easier way. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
 
The paper does not explore a lot of possible future work that can be done to extend the emotional expressions of the agent, as well as including direct emotional-sensing capabilities in real time. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
 
The paper argues about the need to include cognitive-affective architectures in modern intelligent agents. The architecture allows to influence and modify the behavior of the agent in real time, to achieve a more realistic and believable interaction with the user. 
 
 
 
 
Social implications 
 
 
 
 
The paper remarks the importance of a cognitive-affective architecture that makes intelligent agents able to help the users in different tasks and environments. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
The paper describes a new cognitive-affective architecture and its utility for modern intelligent agents. This is proven by including it in a previous agent, which boosts its behavior and emotional expression possibilities and thus improves user experience.",2017,47,5,"{'name': 'Kybernetes', 'pages': '933-946', 'volume': '46'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Marco2017CombiningCA,\n author = {J.

We use the computational model of affect ALMA that is able to simulate three different affect types in real-time. The computation of affect is based on a novel approach of an appraisal language. Both the use of elements of the appraisal language and the simulation of different affect types has been evaluated. Affect is used to control facial expressions, facial complexions, affective animations, posture, and idle behavior on the body layer and the selection of dialogue strategies on the mind layer. To enable a fine-grained control of these aspects a Player Markup Language (PML) has been developed. The PML is player-independent and allows a sophisticated control of character actions coordinated by high-level temporal constraints. An Action Encoder module maps the output of ALMA to PML actions using affect display rules. These actions drive the real-time rendering of affect, gesture and speech parameters of virtual characters, which we call Virtual Humans.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 26, 'citationCount': 5, 'journal': {'volume': '6', 'pages': '43-54', 'name': 'Int.

In this article, these four desiderata are motivated and explained, and then combined with the graphical architecture hypothesis to yield a rationale for the development of Sigma. The current state of the cognitive architecture is then introduced in detail, along with the graphical architecture that sits below it and implements it. Progress in extending Sigma beyond these architectures and towards a full cognitive system is then detailed in terms of both a systematic set of higher level cognitive idioms that have been developed and several virtual humans that are built from combinations of these idioms. Sigma as a whole is then analyzed in terms of how well the progress to date satisfies the desiderata.

Section One begins with a look at the makings of AC and a historical review of the science of emotion. Chapters discuss the theoretical underpinnings of AC from an interdisciplinary perspective involving the affective, cognitive, social, media, and brain sciences. Section Two focuses on affect detection or affect recognition, which is one of the most commonly investigated areas in AC. Section Three examines aspects of affect generation including the synthesis of emotion and its expression via facial features, speech, postures and gestures. Cultural issues in affect generation are also discussed. Section Four features chapters on methodological issues in AC research, including data collection techniques, multimodal affect databases, emotion representation formats, crowdsourcing techniques, machine learning approaches, affect elicitation techniques, useful AC tools, and ethical issues in AC.

Laird ({rmarinie,laird}@umich.edu) Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, 2260 Hayward Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA augmented Soar with a new module, our emotion system, described below. Abstract Existing computational models of emotion are primarily concerned with creating more realistic agents, with recent efforts looking into matching human data, including qualitative emotional responses and dynamics. In this paper, our work focuses on the functional benefits of emotion in a cognitive system where emotional feedback helps drive reinforcement learning. Our system is an integration of our emotion theory with Soar, an independently-motivated cognitive architecture. Integrating Appraisal Theories and Cognition Our work is grounded in appraisal theories (Roseman & Smith, 2001, for an overview) and Newell’s (1990) PEACTIDM (pronounced PEE-ACK-TEH-DIM). Appraisal theories hypothesize that an emotional reaction to a stimulus is the result of an evaluation of that stimulus along a number of dimensions, most of which relate it to current goals. The particular appraisals that our system uses is a subset of the appraisals described by Scherer (2001) (see Table 1). The subset our system uses can be split into two main groups: appraisals that help the agent decide which stimulus attend to (Suddenness, Unpredictability, Intrinsic Pleasantness, Relevance) and those appraisals that help the agent decide what do in response to an attended stimulus (causal agent and motive, outcome probability, discrepancy from expectation, conduciveness, control, power). Appraisal theories generally do not give much detail about how appraisals are generated or why. That is, the details of the process are left unspecified. Thus, computational models must fill in those details, but with little or no direction from appraisal theory, the details are often arbitrary. PEACTIDM, on the other hand, describes necessary and sufficient processes for immediate behavior (see Table 2). The PEACTIDM hypothesis is that stimuli are Perceived and Encoded so cognition can work with them. Then Attend focuses cognition on one stimulus to process, which is then Comprehended. Tasking is managing tasks and goals (e.g., in response to a change in the situation), whereas Intend is determining what actions to take. Decode and Motor are translating cognitive choices into physical actions. PEACTIDM, however, does not describe the data upon which these processes operate. The basis of our theory is that appraisals are the information upon which the PEACTIDM theory operates (Marinier & Laird, 2006) (see Table 3). For example, the attend process determines what to process next based on appraisal information generated by the perceive and encode processes (i.e., suddenness, unpredictability, intrinsic pleasantness, and relevance). Thus, appraisals not only determine the information that PEACTIDM processes, PEACTIDM also imposes dependencies between the appraisals (e.g., the appraisals for Comprehend cannot occur until after appraisals for Attend have been generated). Keywords: Emotion, reinforcement learning, intrinsic reward, cognitive architecture, appraisal theories. Introduction Folk psychology often casts emotions in a negative light. For example, in Star Trek, Vulcans are portrayed as superior to humans because they are not distracted by emotions, and thus can make purely logical decisions. As far back as Phineas Gage, however, it has been clear that emotions play a critical role in proper functioning in humans, and over the last several decades psychological research has explored how emotions influence behavior. We are interested in exploring how some of the functional capabilities of emotion can be utilized in computational agents; that is, we want to bring the functionality of emotions to artificial intelligence. This is in contrast to most existing computational models of emotion, which focused primarily on creating believable agents (Gratch & Marsella, 2004; Hudlicka, 2004), modeling human data (Marsella & Gratch 2006; Gratch, Marsella, and Mao, 2006), or entertainment (Loyall, Neal Reilly, Bates, and Weyhrauch, 2004). In this paper, we present work in which reinforcement learning is driven by emotion. Intuitively, feelings serve as a reward signal. The agent learns to behave in a way that makes it feel good while avoiding feeling bad. Coupled with a task that the agent wants to complete, the agent learns that completing the task makes it feel good. This work contributes not only to research on emotion in providing a functional computational grounding for feelings, but it also contributes to research in reinforcement learning by providing a detailed theory of the origin and basis of intrinsically-motivated reward. Background Our system in implemented in the Soar cognitive architecture (Newell, 1990). Soar is a complete agent framework composed of interacting, task-independent memory and processing modules that include short- and long-term memory, decision making, learning, and perception.

Such work understandably starts from concepts of ordinary language (e.g. “emotion”, “feeling”, “mood”, etc.). However, these concepts can be deceptive: the words appear to have clear meanings but are used in very imprecise and systematically ambiguous ways. This is often because of explicit or implicit pre-scientific theories about mental states and process. More sophisticated theories can provide a basis for deeper and more precise concepts, as has happened in physics and chemistry. In the Cognition and Affect project we have been attempting to explore the benefits of developing architecture-based concepts, i.e. starting with specifications of architectures for complete agents and then finding out what sorts of states and processes are supported by those architectures. So, instead of presupposing one theory of the architecture and explicitly or implicitly basing concepts on that, we define a space of architectures generated by the CogAff architecture schema, where each supports different collections of concepts. In that space we focus on one architecture H-Cogaff, a particularly rich instance of the CogAff architecture schema, conjectured as a theory of normal adult human information processing. The architecture-based concepts that it supports provide a framework for defining with greater precision than previously a host of mental concepts, including affective concepts. We then find that these map more or less loosely onto various pre-theoretical concepts, such as “emotion”, etc. We indicate some of the variety of emotion concepts generated by the H-Cogaff architecture A different architecture, supporting a different range of mental concepts might be appropriate for exploring affective states of other animals, for instance insects, reptiles, or other mammals, and young children.', 'year': 2001, 'referenceCount': 41, 'citationCount': 117, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Sloman2001VarietiesOA,\n author = {A.
