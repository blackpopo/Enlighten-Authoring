0,000a2d26225e66bc512087a6bfcb555ab66bdcfc,The Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire: Prevalence and Diagnostic Classification,"The Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire (BAPQ) was administered to a large community‐based sample of biological parents of children with autism (PCAs) and comparison parents (CPs) (n = 1,692). Exploratory factor analysis and internal consistency parameters confirmed a robust three‐factor structure of the BAPQ, corresponding to the proposed aloof, pragmatic language and rigidity subscales. Based upon the distribution of Broad Autism Phenotype (BAP) features in the general population, new normative cutoff values for BAPQ subscales were established that provide increased specificity relative to those previously reported, and thus enhance the utility of the BAPQ for diagnostically classifying the BAP. These cutoffs were also used to estimate prevalence of the BAP and its three components, with rates ranging between 14–23% for PCAs and between 5–9% for CPs. Analysis of patterns of BAP characteristics within family members revealed that BAP features were more likely to co‐occur in PCAs relative to CPs. Collectively, these findings extend the utility of the BAPQ and provide additional evidence that it is an efficient and reliable tool for disaggregating the heterogeneity of autism through the identification of meaningful subgroups of parents.

Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are both widely used in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There has, however, been debate regarding the advantages of one approach over the other. This study sought to determine whether there was any evidence that one treatment was superior to the other. Method. We performed a systematic review of the literature dating from 1989 to 2005 and identified eight publications describing treatment outcomes of EMDR and CBT in active–active comparisons. Seven of these studies were investigated meta-analytically. Results. The superiority of one treatment over the other could not be demonstrated. Trauma-focused CBT and EMDR tend to be equally efficacious. Differences between the two forms of treatment are probably not of clinical significance. While the data indicate that moderator variables influence treatment efficacy, we argue that because of the small number of original studies, little benefit is to be gained from a closer examination of these variables. Further research is needed within the framework of randomized controlled trials. Conclusions. Our results suggest that in the treatment of PTSD, both therapy methods tend to be equally efficacious. We suggest that future research should not restrict its focus to the efficacy, effectiveness and efficiency of these therapy methods but should also attempt to establish which trauma patients are more likely to benefit from one method or the other. What remains unclear is the contribution of the eye movement component in EMDR to treatment outcome.",2006.0,38.0,424.0,"{'volume': '36', 'pages': '1515 - 1522', 'name': 'Psychological Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Seidler2006ComparingTE,\n author = {G.

It was possible to divide it into two parts: septum pellucidum, composed of fiber tracts and glia, and septum verum (true septum) which in addition to fiber tracts and glia, contain neurons arranged in a nuclear pattern. The septum verum in the human corresponds to the septum as described in lower forms. The human septum has been thought to have regressed and be nearly functionless in contrast to lower forms. However, the nucleus septalis triangularis is the only septal nucleus which regressed in development when compared to that in the brains of insectivores and primates. The rest of the septal nuclei progressively increased in size during primate development. Finally, it should be emphasized that the septum verum of the human has attained its highest degree of development in primate phylogeny.",1968.0,16.0,138.0,"{'volume': '133', 'name': 'Journal of Comparative Neurology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Andy1968TheSI,\n author = {O.

10,0089abe41a632b652af8bf62b36c65844fa463d2,Early Social-Emotional Functioning and Public Health: The Relationship Between Kindergarten Social Competence and Future Wellness.,"OBJECTIVES
We examined whether kindergarten teachers' ratings of children's prosocial skills, an indicator of noncognitive ability at school entry, predict key adolescent and adult outcomes. Our goal was to determine unique associations over and above other important child, family, and contextual characteristics.


METHODS
Data came from the Fast Track study of low-socioeconomic status neighborhoods in 3 cities and 1 rural setting. We assessed associations between measured outcomes in kindergarten and outcomes 13 to 19 years later (1991-2000). Models included numerous control variables representing characteristics of the child, family, and context, enabling us to explore the unique contributions among predictors.


RESULTS
We found statistically significant associations between measured social-emotional skills in kindergarten and key young adult outcomes across multiple domains of education, employment, criminal activity, substance use, and mental health.


CONCLUSIONS
A kindergarten measure of social-emotional skills may be useful for assessing whether children are at risk for deficits in noncognitive skills later in life and, thus, help identify those in need of early intervention. These results demonstrate the relevance of noncognitive skills in development for personal and public health outcomes.",2015.0,280.0,727.0,"{'volume': '105 11', 'pages': '\n          2283-90\n        ', 'name': 'American journal of public health'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Jones2015EarlySF,\n author = {Damon Jones and M.

Less well understood is precisely how-that is, through which developmental pathways-these interventions work. This study assesses mechanisms by which the Fast Track project (n = 891), a randomized intervention in the early 1990s for high-risk children in four communities (Durham, NC; Nashville, TN; rural PA; and Seattle, WA), reduced delinquency, arrests, and general and mental health service utilization in adolescence through young adulthood (ages 12-20). A decomposition of treatment effects indicates that about a third of Fast Track's impact on later crime outcomes can be accounted for by improvements in social and self-regulation skills during childhood (ages 6-11), such as prosocial behavior, emotion regulation, and problem solving. These skills proved less valuable for the prevention of general and mental health problems.",2016.0,53.0,48.0,"{'volume': '87 2', 'pages': '\n          429-45\n        ', 'name': 'Child development'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sorensen2016HowDT,\n author = {Lucy C.

Guided by new conceptual and quantitative approaches (Cowen, Elfenbein, Laukka, & Keltner, 2018; Cowen & Keltner, 2017, 2018), we explore the taxonomy of emotion recognized in facial-bodily expression. Participants (N = 1,794; 940 female, ages 18-76 years) judged the emotions captured in 1,500 photographs of facial-bodily expression in terms of emotion categories, appraisals, free response, and ecological validity. We find that facial-bodily expressions can reliably signal at least 28 distinct categories of emotion that occur in everyday life. Emotion categories, more so than appraisals such as valence and arousal, organize emotion recognition. However, categories of emotion recognized in naturalistic facial and bodily behavior are not discrete but bridged by smooth gradients that correspond to continuous variations in meaning. Our results support a novel view that emotions occupy a high-dimensional space of categories bridged by smooth gradients of meaning. They offer an approximation of a taxonomy of facial-bodily expressions, visualized within an online interactive map.

17,01840b6d00de248d13cc30822462df8a47cf969e,Nonverbal overload: A theoretical argument for the causes of Zoom fatigue.,"For decades, scholars have predicted that videoconference technology will disrupt the practice of commuting daily to and from work and will change the way people socialize. In 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic forced a drastic increase in the number of videoconference meetings, and Zoom became the leading software package because it was free, robust, and easy to use. While the software has been an essential tool for productivity, learning, and social interaction, something about being on videoconference all day seems particularly exhausting, and the term “Zoom Fatigue” caught on quickly. In this article, I focus on nonverbal overload as a potential cause for fatigue, and provide four arguments outlining how various aspects of the current Zoom interface likely lead to psychological consequences. The arguments are based on academic theory and research, but also have yet to be directly tested in the context of Zoom, and require future experimentation to confirm. Instead of indicting the medium, my goal is to point out these design flaws to isolate research areas for social scientists and to suggest design improvements for technologists.",2021.0,29.0,466.0,"{'name': 'Technology, Mind, and Behavior'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bailenson2021NonverbalOA,\n author = {J.

20,01dd8ccb1cc789450d3deb0e3f4beed972098223,A Comparative Study on the Temporal Effects of 2D and VR Emotional Arousal,"Previous research comparing traditional two-dimensional (2D) and virtual reality with stereoscopic vision (VR-3D) stimulations revealed that VR-3D resulted in higher levels of immersion. However, the effects of these two visual modes on emotional stimulus processing have not been thoroughly investigated, and the underlying neural processing mechanisms remain unclear. Thus, this paper introduced a cognitive psychological experiment that was conducted to investigate how these two visual modes influence emotional processing. To reduce fatigue, participants (n = 16) were randomly assigned to watch a series of 2D and VR-3D short emotional videos for two days. During their participation, electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded simultaneously. The results showed that even in the absence of sound, visual stimuli in the VR environment significantly increased emotional arousal, especially in the frontal region, parietal region, temporal region, and occipital region. On this basis, visual evoked potential (VEP) analysis was performed. VR stimulation compared to 2D led to a larger P1 component amplitude, while VEP analysis based on the time course of the late event-related potential component revealed that, after 1200 ms, the differences across visual modes became stable and significant. Furthermore, the results also confirmed that VEP in the early stages is more sensitive to emotions and presumably there are corresponding emotion regulation mechanisms in the late stages.",2022.0,40.0,3.0,"{'name': 'Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)', 'volume': '22'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tian2022ACS,\n author = {F.

23,01e411620c11738854db65b2b647a1242bfb9b88,Change in daily life behaviors and depression: Within-person and between-person associations.,"OBJECTIVE
This study examined associations between daily physical, sedentary, social, and leisure behaviors and depressive symptoms (a) at a macrolevel, over the course of an Experience Sampling (ESM) self-monitoring intervention, and (b) at a microlevel, by examining daily within-person associations. Second, we examined the effects of the ESM self-monitoring intervention on these daily life behaviors.


METHODS
Individuals with a diagnosis of depression (N = 102) receiving pharmacological treatment were randomized to 1 of 2 six-week ESM intervention conditions or a control condition. Physical, sedentary, social, and leisure behaviors as well as depressive symptoms were assessed prospectively in every-day life at baseline, postintervention, and during the ESM interventions.


RESULTS
Change in physical activity and talking from baseline to postintervention was associated with change in depressive symptoms from baseline to postintervention. Within-person daily fluctuations in talking, physical activity, doing nothing/resting, and being alone predicted end-of-day depressive symptoms over and above depressive symptoms at the previous day. The ESM interventions contributed to change in talking, doing nothing/resting, and being alone over time in comparison with the control group. The analyses revealed individual differences in the amount of behavioral change over time and in the within-subject associations between daily behaviors and depressive symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings suggest that physical, sedentary, and social behaviors have affective implications for daily mental health of individuals with depression. Self-monitoring using ESM may be a useful add-on tool to achieve behavioral change and to gain personalized insight in behaviors that improve daily depressive symptoms.",2016.0,51.0,59.0,"{'volume': '35 5', 'pages': '\n          433-41\n        ', 'name': 'Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Snippe2016ChangeID,\n author = {E.

Innovativeness of employees is one of the coveted characteristics as previous research has shown that innovativeness contributes beneficially towards an organization’s competiveness and growth. On the other hand, self-efficacy is a construct which has been studied in the context of individual entrepreneurship, technology solutions, and task completion. The link between self-efficacy and innovativeness has not been studied and this research hypothesized a relationship between self efficacy and innovativeness of an individual. The study also investigated the mediating impact of cultural dimensions on this relationship. We found a positive relationship between self efficacy and innovativeness and found positive effects of the “individualism” dimension on this relationship. This has useful implications for assessing the innovation potential of an organization as well as for training employees in order to make the organization more innovation-ready in today’s competitive and flexible business environment.

The ""Handbook of Bereavement Research"" provides a broad view of diverse contemporary approaches to bereavement, examining both normal adaptation and complicated manifestations of grief. In this volume, leading interdisciplinary scholars focus on three important themes in bereavement research: consequences, coping and care. In exploring the consequences of bereavement, authors examine developmental factors that influence grief both for the individual and the family at different phases of the life cycle. In exploring coping, they describe exciting new empirical studies about how people can and do cope with grief, without professional intervention. People do not grieve alone, so chapters on coping present new ways to understand grief at an interpersonal level as well. Until recently, intervention for the bereaved has not been scientifically guided and has become the subject of challenging differences of opinion and approach. Chapters in the care section of the volume critically examine interventions to date and provide guidance for assessment and more empirically guided treatment strategies. The ""Handbook"" provides an up-to-date comprehensive review of scientific knowledge about bereavement in an authoritative yet accessible way that should be useful reading for researchers, practitioners and health care professionals in the 21st century.",2001.0,12.0,841.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Stroebe2001HandbookOB,\n author = {M.

The objective of the game is to increase self-control over emotions, decision making and behaviours. The aim of this study is to describe the results from a consecutive series of nine bulimia nervosa patients who were treated with the VG in addition to cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT).

Phenomenology is concerned with the study of experience from the perspective of the individual, ‘bracketing’ taken-for-granted assumptions and usual ways of perceiving. Epistemologically, phenomenological approaches are based in a paradigm of personal knowledge and subjectivity, and emphasise the importance of personal perspective and interpretation.

Twitch is approximately the thirtieth most-viewed website in the world, with over 150 million spectators, and 2 million individuals around the world regularly broadcasting. Although less well-known than Facebook or Twitter, these figures demonstrate that Twitch has become a central part of the platformized Internet. We explore a seven-part typology of monetization extant on Twitch: subscribing, donating and “cheering,” advertising, sponsorships, competitions and targets, unpredictable rewards for viewers, and the implementation of games into streaming channels themselves. We explore each technique in turn, considering how streamers use the affordances of the platform to earn income, and invent their own methods and techniques to further drive monetization. In doing so, we look to consider the particular kinds of governance and infrastructure manifested on Twitch. By governance, we mean how the rules, norms, and regulations of Twitch influence and shape the cultural content both produced and consumed within its virtual borders; and by infrastructure, we mean how the particular technical affordances of the platform, and many other elements besides, structure how content production on Twitch might be made profitable, and therefore decide what content is made, and how, and when. Examining Twitch will thus advance our understanding of the platformization of amateur content production; methodologically, we draw on over 100 interviews with successful live streamers, and extensive ethnographic data from live events and online Twitch broadcasts.",2019.0,44.0,75.0,"{'volume': '5', 'name': 'Social Media + Society'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Johnson2019AndTT,\n author = {Mark R.

More importantly, studies have shown that people infer their expected behaviors and attitudes from observing their avatar’s appearance, a phenomenon known as the Proteus Effect (Yee & Bailenson, 2007). For example, users given taller avatars negotiated more aggressively than users given shorter avatars. Two studies are reported here that extend our understanding of this effect. The first study extends the work beyond laboratory settings to an actual online community. We found that both the height and attractiveness of an avatar in an online game were significant predictors of the player’s performance. In our second study, we found that the behavioral changes stemming from the virtual environment transferred to subsequent face-to-face interactions. Participants were placed in an immersive virtual environment and were given either shorter or taller avatars. They then interacted with a confederate for about 15 minutes. In addition to causing a behavioral difference within the virtual environment, we found that participants given taller avatars negotiated more aggressively in subsequent face-to-face interactions than participants given shorter avatars.

Chinese livestreamers enjoy a greater degree of opportunity than their Western counterparts, including competing gameplay platforms that vie for premier gameplayers who can dictate their own terms. Decades-old cultural policies fostered underlying conditions that advantage female streamers engaging in gendered performativity to appeal to lonely rich men. Livestreamers ride marketing imperatives directing consumers to cross-integrated e-commerce platforms that fuel China’s emerging consumption culture.

Study 1 showed strong relations between measures of mood, goal appraisals, and MIL. In multivariate analyses, PA was a stronger predictor of MIL than goal appraisals. In Study 2, the most consistent predictor of the experience of meaning in a day was the PA experienced that day. Later, global MIL was predicted by average daily PA, rather than average daily MIL. Study 3 demonstrated no prospective relations between measures of MIL and PA over 2 years. In Study 4, priming positive mood concepts enhanced MIL. In Study 5, manipulated positive mood enhanced ratings of MIL for those who were not given an attributional cue for their moods. In Study 6, PA was associated with a high level of distinction between meaningful and meaningless activities. Results indicate that positive moods may predispose individuals to feel that life is meaningful. In addition, positive moods may increase sensitivity to the meaning-relevance of a situation.",2006.0,88.0,991.0,"{'volume': '90 1', 'pages': '\n          179-96\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{King2006PositiveAA,\n author = {L.

Previous research has suggested that institutionalization increases the co-existing symptoms of dementia, such as aggression, depression, apathy, lack of motivation and loss of interest in oneself and others. Despite the importance of supporting the mental well-being of people with dementia, in many cases, it remains undertreated. In recent years, there has been growing research interest in designing non-pharmacological interventions aiming to improve the Health-Related Quality of Life for people with dementia within long-term care. With computer technology and especially Virtual Reality offering endless opportunities for mental support, we must consider how Virtual Reality for people with dementia can be sensitively designed to provide comfortable, enriching out-world experiences. Working closely with 24 dementia patients and 51 medical and paramedical personnel, we co-designed an intelligent and personalized Virtual Reality system to enhance symptom management of dementia patients residing in long-term care. Through this paper, we thoroughly explain the screening process and analysis we run to identify which environments patients would like to receive as a Virtual Reality intervention to minimize the aforementioned co-existing symptoms of dementia, and the development of an intelligent system using the selected environments, that adapts the content of the Virtual Reality experience based on physiological and eye-tracking data from the patients and their personal preferences.",2022.0,63.0,5.0,"{'name': 'Adjunct Proceedings of the 30th ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Matsangidou2022FreeOW,\n author = {M.

To test whether a head-mounted display helmet enhances the effectiveness of videogame distraction for children experiencing cold pressor pain.


METHOD
Forty-one children, aged 6-14 years, underwent one or two baseline cold pressor trials followed by two distraction trials in which they played the same videogame with and without the helmet in counterbalanced order. Pain threshold (elapsed time until the child reported pain) and pain tolerance (total time the child kept the hand submerged in the cold water) were measured for each cold pressor trial.


RESULTS
Both distraction conditions resulted in improved pain tolerance relative to baseline. Older children appeared to experience additional benefits from using the helmet, whereas younger children benefited equally from both conditions. The findings suggest that virtual reality technology can enhance the effects of distraction for some children. Research is needed to identify the characteristics of children for whom this technology is best suited.",2009.0,53.0,100.0,"{'volume': '34 5', 'pages': '\n          574-84\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of pediatric psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Dahlquist2009EffectsOV,\n author = {L.

With the closure of institutions, programs which typically relied on face-to-face interactions to deliver content were abruptly demanded to switch to online-based education. This upheaval has spawned unique challenges in delivering content for various subjects and disciplines. Particularly in the delivery of technical programs such as information technology and other computing disciplines, the unexpected shift to online classes introduced significant challenges. The inability to interact directly with instructors and peers endangers students? ability to master much of the intricate and abstract concepts in computing courses. Further, students and faculty find themselves socially isolated and neither may be properly prepared for online teaching and learning. Strategies incorporating the use of learning management systems, web conferencing software, and open-source software can, nonetheless, be adopted to mitigate the challenges in the teaching and learning of information technology and other computing courses. This paper discusses some of the challenges that have arisen in the online teaching and learning of these courses.

However, excessive speed may make customers feel rushed.

Regardless of restaurant type, too fast a pace during the meal itself diminishes customer satisfaction, but speed during check settlement is often appreciated. The effects on customer satisfaction of the pace of welcome, seating, and taking drink orders depend partly on the type of restaurant and on the meal type. Guests at fine-dining restaurants do not want these preprocess events to be rushed.

Despite recent neurocomputational advances, it is unknown whether brain signatures of affiliative emotions, such as tenderness/affection, can be decoded and voluntarily modulated. Here, we employed multivariate voxel pattern analysis and real-time fMRI to address this question. We found that participants were able to use visual feedback based on decoded fMRI patterns as a neurofeedback signal to increase brain activation characteristic of tenderness/affection relative to pride, an equally complex control emotion. Such improvement was not observed in a control group performing the same fMRI task without neurofeedback. Furthermore, the neurofeedback-driven enhancement of tenderness/affection-related distributed patterns was associated with local fMRI responses in the septohypothalamic area and frontopolar cortex, regions previously implicated in affiliative emotion. This demonstrates that humans can voluntarily enhance brain signatures of tenderness/affection, unlocking new possibilities for promoting prosocial emotions and countering antisocial behavior.",2014.0,70.0,73.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Moll2014VoluntaryEO,\n author = {J.

Measuring such subjective data as reactions to color, heat, light, and sound would seem to be an almost impossible task; indeed, until now there has been no theory around which the research in this field could be organized. This volume represents a preliminary effort to identify the relevant variables involved and fit them into a systematic framework. Furthermore, it presents extensive sets of measures for investigating the theory and implementing it in a variety of everyday environments.Basically, the framework outlined here proposes that environmental stimuli are linked to behavioral responses by the primary emotional responses of arousal, pleasure, and dominance. By considering the impact of the environment on these basic emotional responses, the effects of diverse stimulus components within or across sense modalities can be readily compared. An additional concept, information rate, is used to compare the effects of different environments, each with stimulation in many sense modalities. In the final chapters the authors present a series of hypotheses which relate the emotional response variables to a diversity of behaviors such as physical approach, performance, affiliation, and verbally or nonverbally expressed preference.",1974.0,0.0,5823.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Mehrabian1974AnAT,\n author = {A.

Researchers from the fields of virtual reality (VR) and game design highlight the potential of VR technologies as a great tool to promote empathy. However, there is little empirical and systematic knowledge on how to use VR technology to help promote empathy in young children. To address this gap, we developed a VR Empathy Game prototype to explore how VR experiences can inculcate empathy development in young children. To evaluate this prototype, we conducted a qualitative study with 15 children from 6 to 9 years old. We used an interpretive case study to provide an in-depth understanding of children’s experiences with the VR Empathy Game. To guide participant selection, we used a purposeful sampling approach and intentionally included K-3 children with different empathy and social skills levels. 
  
This paper describes one case representing a challenge that children with a low level of empathy can experience while playing the VR Empathy Game. This case explains the game experience of a seven-year-old boy, Gabe. The case is entitled: “The VR Empathy Game Experience with a Focus on Exploring the Environment and Looking for Clues.” Gabe confused intrinsic and extrinsic game goals and played the game focusing only on the VR environment. He perceived the game characters as an information source rather than building relationships with them unlike the children with a higher level of empathy. This case represents the group of four boys who participated in our study. In comparison with other participants, Gabe’s case provided very little evidence of noticing the characters' emotions. Our findings suggest that game designers should provide additional scaffolding for children with little levels of empathy, including additional reflective questions and reminders to interact with the characters. We also suggest a follow-up study exploring how different storylines would help children’s game experience.",2022.0,18.0,0.0,{'name': 'European Conference on Games Based Learning'},"{'bibtex': '@Conference{Muravevskaia2022CaseSO,\n author = {Ekaterina Muravevskaia and Christina Gardner-Mccune},\n booktitle = {European Conference on Games Based Learning},\n journal = {European Conference on Games Based Learning},\n title = {Case Study on VR Empathy Game: Challenges with VR Games Development for Emotional Interactions with the VR Characters},\n year = {2022}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '3439826', 'name': 'Ekaterina Muravevskaia'}, {'authorId': '1403600070', 'name': 'Christina Gardner-Mccune'}]"
60,050563579a2ddf033f8d173dc8ad8437ba2e5cd2,Integrating mindfulness with parent training: effects of the Mindfulness-Enhanced Strengthening Families Program.,"There is growing support for the efficacy of mindfulness training with parents as an intervention technique to improve parenting skills and reduce risk for youth problem behaviors. The evidence, however, has been limited to small scale studies, many with methodological shortcomings. This study sought to integrate mindfulness training with parents into the Strengthening Families Program: For Parents and Youth 10-14 (SFP 10-14), an empirically-validated family-based preventive intervention. It used a randomized-controlled comparative effectiveness study design (N = 432 families, 31% racial/ethnic minority) to test the efficacy of the Mindfulness-Enhanced Strengthening Families Program (MSFP), compared to standard SFP 10-14 and a minimal-treatment home study control condition. Results indicated that, in general, MSFP was as effective as SFP 10-14 in improving multiple dimensions of parenting, including interpersonal mindfulness in parenting, parent-youth relationship quality, youth behavior management, and parent well-being, according to both parent and youth reports at both postintervention and 1-year follow-up. This study also found that in some areas MSFP boosted and better sustained the effects of SFP 10-14, especially for fathers. Although the pattern of effects was not as uniform as hypothesized, this study provides intriguing evidence for the unique contribution of mindfulness activities to standard parent training.",2015.0,40.0,199.0,"{'volume': '51 1', 'pages': '\n          26-35\n        ', 'name': 'Developmental psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Coatsworth2015IntegratingMW,\n author = {J.

Purpose
Social network services (SNS) gifting is a new business model, but many SNS providers continue to face challenges as they explore ways to increase their revenues from gifting. The purpose of this paper is to examine the key factors involved in gift giving via SNS platforms.


Design/methodology/approach
This study adopts a mixed methods approach through qualitative and quantitative research. In the first stage (qualitative study), the authors extract factors from interviews with users of SNS gifting services. In the second stage (quantitative study), the authors interpret decisional factors explored in the first stage on the basis of customer value theory, develop a research model and empirically test it.


Findings
The results show that five factors – convenience of SNS gifting, symbolic representation of SNS gifting, relationship support of SNS gifting, pleasure of SNS gifting, and an SNS gifting norm – directly or indirectly affect SNS gifting decisions.


Research limitations/implications
This study contributes to electronic commerce research by extending the customer value theory and adding to the literature on SNS gifting and gift giving in general.


Practical implications
The study informs SNS providers regarding the promotion of SNS gifting services for revenue generation.


Originality/value
This study is among the first to comprehensively examine decision-making in SNS gifting through the lens of customer value theory.

65,0543a8a6e1d57deead06199b5876e6ea21defacb,Simulator Sickness Questionnaire: An enhanced method for quantifying simulator sickness.,"Simulator sickness (SS) in high-fidelity visual simulators is a byproduct of modem simulation technology. Although it involves symptoms similar to those of motion-induced sickness (MS), SS tends to be less severe, to be of lower incidence, and to originate from elements of visual display and visuo-vestibular interaction atypical of conditions that induce MS. Most studies of SS to date index severity with some variant of the Pensacola Motion Sickness Questionnaire (MSQ). The MSQ has several deficiencies as an instrument for measuring SS. Some symptoms included in the scoring of MS are irrelevant for SS, and several are misleading. Also, the configural approach of the MSQ is not readily adaptable to computer administration and scoring.

Much of the literature pertinent to management indicates that service providers with high emotional intelligence (EI) receive higher customer satisfaction scores. Previous studies offer limited evidence regarding the impact of physician's EI on patient-physician relationship.


PURPOSES
Using a multilevel and multisource data approach, the current study aimed to build a model that demonstrated the impact of a physician's EI on the patient's trust and the patient-physician relationship.


METHODOLOGY
The survey sample included 983 outpatients and 39 physicians representing 11 specialties.


FINDINGS
Results of path analyses demonstrated that the ratio of patient's follow-up visits (p < .01) and the nurse-rated EI for physicians (p < .05) had positive effects on the patient's trust. The impact of patient's trust on patient's satisfaction was mediated by the patient-physician relationship at a significant level (p < .01). The patient-physician relationship had a significantly positive effect on patient's satisfaction (p < .001). The model accounted for 37% of the variance of patient's trust, 67% of the PDR, and 58% of patient's satisfaction on physician services.


PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS
This study suggests that nurses had the sensitivity and intellectual skills in assessing the physician's performance and the patient's need. Our findings suggest that patient's trust is the cornerstone of the patient-physician relationship; however, mutual trust and professional respect between nurses and physicians play a critical role in reinforcing the patient-physician relationship to effect improvements in the provision of patient-centered care.",2008.0,48.0,110.0,"{'volume': '33 4', 'pages': '\n          280-8\n        ', 'name': 'Health care management review'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Weng2008DoesTP,\n author = {H.

In times of the COVID-19 pandemic, the crisis of conversion to online teaching has triggered new emotional experiences of teachers that not many studies have taken into account. Method Studying emotion from a post-structuralist lens, this study examines the emotional orientations of Vietnamese higher education language teachers and their emotional responses in online teaching environments. Results The findings show that the pedagogically and technologically distinctive features of online teaching aroused unique challenges and emotions of teachers, both positive and negative. Also, the teachers reported a number of strategies to cope with the new situation. Conclusion The study highlights the critical need for acknowledgement and support of institutions for the transition to online teaching in the “new normal situation”.",2021.0,40.0,13.0,"{'volume': '40', 'pages': '115 - 124', 'name': 'Educational and Developmental Psychologist'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Pham2021LetsAI,\n author = {L.

The purpose of this article is to explore a novel, short-term treatment intervention for internalizing behaviours. This intervention is primarily based upon an externalizing process, transforming of metaphoric imagery, and shifting of underlying maladaptive emotional schemas. This article addresses the clinical population of children and youth, specifically through outlining the protocol, externalizing metaphors therapy. A selective review of significant works regarding the efficacy of short-term therapy was conducted, including the process of change within narrative therapy. It is proposed that two specific processes account for the mental health change experienced by clients who receive this new treatment intervention: (1) externalization of problems and (2) purposeful client-generated metaphor manipulation, impacting upon underlying schemas. From these theoretical constructs, the present article outlines a three-session treatment protocol that manualizes these key clinical processes. A case study is presented to illustrate this intervention for anxiety and depression. Further clinical research is underway to address the testable hypotheses resulting from the current theoretical model. Clinical trials in brief psychotherapy are suggested to empirically evaluate the efficacy of this new treatment intervention for dysphoria.


KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE
This article outlines a short-term treatment intervention for anxiety and depression (dysphoira) through a novel 3-session model, where the clinician-practitioner can obtain competency through a one-day workshop.Its relevance for the clinical researcher and the mental health community is in its versatility in addressing internalizing behavior for four clinical populations: (1) children and adolescents; (2) children and adolescents on the autism spectrum; (3) adults in general; and, (4) adults with a dual-diagnosis. The treatment protocol described within is based upon the externalizing and deconstructive properties of Narrative Therapy, and the transformation of metaphoric imagery of Metaphor Therapy; both of which have little empirical support with narrative practices gaining international attention and widespread usage - through brief therapy, long-term therapy, and walk-in clinics in North America. For the first time, the theoretical constructs of the 3-session model are described and a case example illustrates the interlinking concepts.",2014.0,18.0,9.0,"{'volume': '21 5', 'pages': '\n          381-93\n        ', 'name': 'Clinical psychology & psychotherapy'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{McGuinty2014ACT,\n author = {Everett McGuinty and D.

Nevertheless, laboratory experiments and retrospective assessments have been the 2 most common strands of ER research; thus, leaving open several crucial questions about ER antecedents and consequences in daily life. Beyond traditional methods, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has the potential to capture ER dynamics during the flow of daily experiences, in real-life settings and through repeated measurements. Here, we discuss what we currently know about ER antecedents and consequences. We will compare findings from previous literature to findings from EMA studies, pointing out both similarities and differences, as well as questions that can be answered better with the EMA approach.

This study reports the findings of a controlled feasibility pilot which assessed acceptability and emotional well-being outcomes of an 8-week mindfulness program (Paws b) for children aged 7–9 years. The program was delivered by school teachers within a regular school curriculum. Emotional well-being was measured using self-report questionnaires at baseline, post-training and 3 months follow-up, and informant reports were collected at baseline and follow-up. Seventy one participants aged 7–9 years were recruited from three primary schools in the UK (training group n = 33; control group n = 38). Acceptability of the program was high with 76% of children in the training group reporting ‘liking’ practicing mindfulness at school, with a strong link to wanting to continue practicing mindfulness at school (p < 0.001). Self-report comparisons revealed that relative to controls, the training group showed significant decreases in negative affect at follow-up, with a large effect size (p = 0.010, d = 0.84). Teacher reports (but not parental ratings) of meta-cognition also showed significant improvements at follow-up with a large effect size (p = 0.002, d = 1.08). Additionally, significant negative correlations were found between changes in mindfulness and emotion regulation scores from baseline to post-training (p = 0.038) and baseline to follow-up (p = 0.033). Findings from this study provide initial evidence that the Paws b program in children aged 7–9 years (a) can be feasibly delivered by primary school teachers as part of the regular curriculum, (b) is acceptable to the majority of children, and (c) may significantly decrease negative affect and improve meta-cognition.",2016.0,79.0,81.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vickery2016MindfulnessTI,\n author = {C.

A critical pre-cursor to this type of social learning is the ability to maintain interaction levels that are neither overwhelming nor under-stim ulating. In this paper, we present a mechanism for an autonomous robot to regulate the intensity of its social interactions with a human. Similar to the feedback from infant to caregiver, the robot uses expressive displays to modulate the interaction intensity. This mechanism is integrated within a general framework that combines perception, attention, drives, emotions, behavior selection, and motor acts. We present a specific implementation of this architecture that enables the robot to react appropriately to both social stimuli (faces) and non-social stimuli (moving toys) while maintaining a suitable interaction intensity. We present results from both face-to-face interactions and interactions mediated through a toy.

Researchers studying individual differences in social interactions are typically interested in keeping the behavior and the appearance of the interaction partner constant across participants. With IVET researchers have full control over the interaction partners, can standardize them while still keeping the simulation realistic. Virtual simulations are valid: growing evidence shows that indeed studies conducted with IVET can replicate some well-known findings of social psychology. Moreover, IVET allows researchers to subtly manipulate characteristics of the environment (e.g., visual cues to prime participants) or of the social partner (e.g., his/her race) to investigate their influences on participants’ behavior and cognition. Furthermore, manipulations that would be difficult or impossible in real life (e.g., changing participants’ height) can be easily obtained with IVET. Beside the advantages for theoretical research, we explore the most recent training and clinical applications of IVET, its integration with other technologies (e.g., social sensing) and future challenges for researchers (e.g., making the communication between virtual humans and participants smoother).",2015.0,83.0,102.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bombari2015StudyingSI,\n author = {Dario Bombari and M.

Emerging evidence, however, suggests that right frontal EEG asymmetry might be linked to empathic responding. EEG was used to assess baseline asymmetries in frontal brain activity. Participants viewed images associated with a charity and then rated their sadness, personal distress, perspective-taking, and empathic concern towards the images. We found that baseline measures of right frontal asymmetry were a significant predictor of empathic concern, a relationship that was mediated by feelings of sadness.

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a structured mindfulness group intervention program targeting deficient emotional self-regulation (DESR) in a sample of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).


METHOD
Seventy-two children aged 7 to 12 years with ADHD were randomized into 2 groups (mindfulness and control). The dysregulation profile was measured using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Attention/Anxiety-Depression/Aggression scales.


RESULTS
Children with ADHD who received mindfulness-based group therapy showed lower levels of DESR after treatment, with a reduction in CBCL dysregulation profile (F (1,63) = 4.81; p = 0.032). All ADHD symptoms showed a moderately significant positive correlation with DESR (p < 0.01). Children with combined-type showed higher levels of DESR than children with inattentive-type (p = 0.018); however, no statistically significant changes were observed in the combined-type after mindfulness treatment.


CONCLUSION
This study suggests that mindfulness in the form of structured group therapy might be clinically relevant in treating children with ADHD and thus make an impact on the overall clinical outcome, regardless of the ADHD subtype.",2019.0,37.0,22.0,{'name': 'Journal of Developmental & Behavioral Pediatrics'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Huguet2019DeficientES,\n author = {A.

One new addition to this strategy is virtual gifting, whereby users purchase virtual products to give to other users. The monetary value of such virtual good transactions is economically significant but no prior study has examined this phenomenon in a strictly virtual context. We apply theory from the economics literature to examine gifting behavior in a virtual world in which users' social status is reflected in observable social connections (friendships) and interactions (personal messages). We find strong evidence that gifting is associated with future enhancements of the gift giver's social status, consistent with a social status-seeking motivation, thus confirming a theorized behavior that is difficult to study in the real world. Our study has implications for system proprietors and managers because we show that gift giving increases system use continuance. We identify various antecedents of gift giving, which may assist a manager in identifying users who are most inclined to give gifts and enable the manager to signal the social exchange benefits to users as a way of improving their social connections.",2014.0,119.0,35.0,"{'volume': '31', 'pages': '171 - 210', 'name': 'Journal of Management Information Systems'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Goode2014GiftingAS,\n author = {Sigi Goode and Gregory Shailer and Mark Wilson and Jarosław Jankowski},\n journal = {Journal of Management Information Systems},\n pages = {171 - 210},\n title = {Gifting and Status in Virtual Worlds},\n volume = {31},\n year = {2014}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '38488976', 'name': 'Sigi Goode'}, {'authorId': '2998243', 'name': 'Gregory Shailer'}, {'authorId': '2130836886', 'name': 'Mark Wilson'}, {'authorId': '39922408', 'name': 'Jarosław Jankowski'}]"

The purpose of this systematic review was to describe the evidence for the effectiveness of early intervention to improve and maintain performance in occupations for youths with or at risk for serious mental illness (SMI). METHOD. Titles and abstracts of 670 articles were reviewed, 234 were retrieved for full review, and 30 met inclusion criteria. RESULTS. Moderate to strong evidence supports cognitive remediation (CR) and mixed evidence supports cognitive‐behavioral therapy (CBT) as an adjunct modality to improve general functioning. Moderate to strong evidence supports use of supported employment and supported education (SE/E) to improve social and occupational outcomes in employment and academics. Strong evidence supports family psychoeducation (FPE) to prevent relapse and rehospitalization and improve problem‐solving skills and general functioning. CONCLUSION.

Mindfulness-based interventions have been tried out in a wide range of mental disorders, with the strongest evidence for use in depression and anxiety. Mindfulness operates by changing the person's relationship with unhelpful thoughts and emotions. The need for home practice is both a strength and a weakness. Some find home practice too demanding and a barrier to effective utilisation of mindfulness. Others discover a set of practical tools that, once learnt, can be applied to ongoing life difficulties; in this way mindfulness may have a place in promoting recovery beyond the acute treatment of a disorder. Additionally, mindfulness may be beneficial for clinicians to promote well-being and enhance the therapeutic relationship.",2016.0,37.0,17.0,"{'volume': '40', 'pages': '289 - 292', 'name': 'BJPsych Bulletin'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Groves2016MindfulnessIP,\n author = {P.

Nevertheless, previous research has demonstrated that traumatic experiences can also lead to positive reactions, stimulating resilience and feelings of growth. The aim of this narrative review is to investigate the positive aspects associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the possible health prevention and promotion strategies by analyzing the available scientific evidence. In particular, we focus on the constructs of resilience, coping strategies and posttraumatic growth (PTG). A literature search was performed on the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Psycinfo databases. Forty-six articles were included in the literature synthesis. Psychological resilience is a fundamental variable for reducing and preventing the negative psychological effects of the pandemic and is associated with lower levels of depression, anxiety and burnout. At the individual and organizational level, resilience plays a crucial role in enhancing wellbeing in healthcare and non-healthcare workers. Connected to resilience, adaptive coping strategies are essential for managing the emergency and work-related stress. Several positive factors influencing resilience have been highlighted in the development of PTG. At the same time, high levels of resilience and positive coping strategies can enhance personal growth. Considering the possible long-term coexistence and consequences of COVID-19, organizational interventions should aim to improve workers’ adaptive coping skills, resilience and PTG in order to promote wellbeing.",2021.0,98.0,103.0,"{'volume': '18', 'name': 'International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Finstad2021ResilienceCS,\n author = {Georgia Libera Finstad and Gabriele Giorgi and L.

Specifically, students have been experiencing high-stress levels due to social isolation and virtual learning environments that have caused significant changes to their daily lives. This study explores the emotional perception of music listening to analyze whether listening to self-selected music is an effective coping mechanism.  An online questionnaire consisting of two closed-ended and six open-ended questions was created on Google Forms and sent out to high school students through email and social media platforms to understand the students’ perceptions better. 16 participant responses were thoroughly analyzed and manually coded to create different themes and average values. Findings from the survey revealed that the majority of the students experienced some level of stress due to the pandemic, and the frequency of listening to music increased since social distancing regulations were implemented. Analysis of student responses revealed that their emotions when listening to music were happiness, sadness, motivation, relaxation, and stimulation. Additionally, pop and hip-hop were the most preferred genres of music by students, and listening to music was generally viewed as a positive form of coping. This study explores whether listening to music can be used as a stress therapy in young adults. However, future research needs to be conducted to make broader implications and investigate the reasoning behind the emotional impact of music.",2023.0,0.0,0.0,{'name': 'Journal of Student Research'},"{'bibtex': ""@Article{Lee2023ExploringTE,\n author = {Kebin Lee and Rosemari Nam and Daniele Olivo},\n booktitle = {Journal of student-scientists' research},\n journal = {Journal of Student Research},\n title = {Exploring the Emotional Perception of High School Students When Utilizing Music as a Coping Mechanism during the COVID-19 Pandemic},\n year = {2023}\n}\n""}","[{'authorId': '2211994650', 'name': 'Kebin Lee'}, {'authorId': '2132293157', 'name': 'Rosemari Nam'}, {'authorId': '150079938', 'name': 'Daniele Olivo'}]"

Mindfulness is defined as the awareness that arises out of intentionally attending in an open and discerning way to whatever is arising in the present moment. Two decades of empirical research have generated considerable evidence supporting the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions across a wide range of clinical and nonclinical populations, and these interventions have been incorporated into a variety of health care settings. Still, there are many unanswered questions and potential horizons to be investigated. This special issue endeavors to assist in this exploration. It presents a combination of articles concerning aspects of clinical and scientific integration of mindfulness within psychotherapy and psychoeducational settings. This commentary attempts to highlight the main findings of the featured articles as well as elucidate areas for future inquiry.

111,0a8543686eeb03f28d8cb76933f9685e66a086bf,Appraisal Theory,"The appraisal framework, developed by Martin and White and their colleagues in the 1990s and 2000s (see, for example, Iedema, Feez, & White, 1993; Martin & White, 2005), provides for analyses of those meanings by which texts convey positive or negative assessments, by which the intensity or directness of such attitudinal utterances is strengthened or weakened and by which speakers/writers engage dialogistically with prior speakers or with potential respondents to the current proposition. These meaningmaking resources are grouped together as the “language of evaluation” on the grounds that they are all means by which the speaker’s/writer’s personal, evaluative involvement in the text is revealed as they adopt stances either toward phenomena (the entities, happenings, or states of affairs being construed by the text) or toward metaphenomena (propositions about these entities, happenings, and states of affairs). Early work on the appraisal framework largely focused on evaluative meanings in English, with this literature noting that no assumptions should be made as to whether the evaluative categories proposed for English necessarily operate in other languages. Subsequently, researchers have employed the descriptive principles that underlie the framework in work on other languages and in work that compares and contrasts evaluative meanings across languages (see, for example, Thomson & White, 2008). The view of language adopted by the architects of the appraisal framework is that of the systemic functional linguistic theory of Halliday and his associates (Halliday, 1994). Accordingly they hold that meaning-making can usefully be divided into three broad modes, or what Halliday terms “metafunctions”: (1) “ideational” meaning by which language construes the world of experience, (2) “interpersonal” meaning by which speakers/writers enact social roles, personas, and relationships, and (3) “textual” meaning by which these ideational and interpersonal meanings are organized into coherent texts appropriate for a given communicative setting. The evaluative meanings described by the appraisal framework provide some of the mechanisms by which the “interpersonal” metafunction operates, in that they present speakers/writers as revealing their feelings, tastes, and opinions with greater or lesser degrees of intensity and directness, as construing propositions as more or as less contentious or warrantable, and as thereby aligning or disaligning with value positions in play in the current communicative context. Within the model of the interpersonal metafunction proposed by Martin (1997) these resources of “appraisal” operate alongside two other interpersonal systems: those communicative resources by which speakers/writers perform speech functions such as asserting, questioning, responding, commanding, advising, and offering,",2020.0,7.0,275.0,{'name': 'Encyclopedia of Personality and Individual Differences'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{White2020AppraisalT,\n author = {P.

This research provides a theoretical and empirical examination of the role of mindfulness in psychological well-being. The development and psychometric properties of the dispositional Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) are described. Correlational, quasi-experimental, and laboratory studies then show that the MAAS measures a unique quality of consciousness that is related to a variety of well-being constructs, that differentiates mindfulness practitioners from others, and that is associated with enhanced self-awareness. An experience-sampling study shows that both dispositional and state mindfulness predict self-regulated behavior and positive emotional states. Finally, a clinical intervention study with cancer patients demonstrates that increases in mindfulness over time relate to declines in mood disturbance and stress.",2003.0,185.0,10587.0,"{'volume': '84 4', 'pages': '\n          822-48\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Brown2003TheBO,\n author = {K.

One possible explanation for the mixed results is that impulsivity is a multifaceted construct and some, but not all, facets are related to aggression. The goal of the current meta-analysis was to determine the relation between the different facets of impulsivity (i.e., negative urgency, positive urgency, lack of premeditation, lack of perseverance, and sensation seeking) and aggression. The results from 93 papers with 105 unique samples (N = 36, 215) showed significant and small-to-medium correlations between each facet of impulsivity and aggression across several different forms of aggression, with more impulsivity being associated with more aggression. Moreover, negative urgency (r = .24, 95% [.18, .29]), positive urgency (r = .34, 95% [.19, .44]), and lack of premeditation (r = .23, 95% [.20, .26]) had significantly stronger associations with aggression than the other scales (rs < .18). Two-stage meta-analytic structural equation modeling showed that these effects were not due to overlap among facets of impulsivity. These results help advance the field of aggression research by clarifying the role of impulsivity and may be of interest to researchers and practitioners in several disciplines.",2019.0,156.0,39.0,{'name': 'Aggression and Violent Behavior'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Bresin2019ImpulsivityAA,\n author = {Konrad Bresin},\n journal = {Aggression and Violent Behavior},\n title = {Impulsivity and aggression: A meta-analysis using the UPPS model of impulsivity},\n year = {2019}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '5227414', 'name': 'Konrad Bresin'}]"

For tipping to serve this function, consumers must leave larger tips in response to better service. Numerous studies have found a relationship between evaluations of service and tip size, but these studies have involved between-subjects, correlational designs that mean the observed relationships could be due to extraversion, friendliness, generosity, or other stable dispositional differences between tippers that affect both service ratings and tip sizes. The current study attempts to rule out these alternative explanations by examining the tipping behavior of 51 people across multiple dining occasions. Results indicate that tip sizes are reliably correlated with service ratings after controlling for the identity of the tipper and, therefore, all potential stable dispositional difference confounds. The theoretical and practical implications of this finding are discussed.",2010.0,22.0,56.0,"{'volume': '34', 'pages': '269 - 275', 'name': 'Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lynn2010TippingAS,\n author = {M.

Accordingly, providing retrieval opportunity during vocabulary learning is encouraged in this essay. After reviewing some literature related to retrieval process, repetition is one effective way to promote retrieval process. Since repeated encounters of the words facilitate the students to access the words-related information in their mind, repetition activity will be the effective solution for this context. The spaced repetition as proposed by Baddley (1990) can be appropriate for this context since learners will not be bored about the repetition. This idea is then developed by providing students with Southeast Sulawesi folklore as the reading material in order to obtain target words.

Drawing on conservation of resources theory and self‐regulation theory, we examined the mechanism and process underlying individuals' performance in GVTs in this specific situation. We posit that the local severity of the pandemic has a negative effect on individuals' performance in GVTs and that self‐regulation functions as a coping mechanism in times of pandemic‐related ambient stress, reducing its negative effect on performance. We suggest that three cultural value orientations, that is, uncertainty avoidance, collectivism, and long‐term orientation, explain different levels of self‐regulation, which in turn moderates the relationship between the local severity of the pandemic and individual performance in GVTs. Based on a sample of 2727 individuals from 31 countries participating in an international business consulting project during the early stage of the unfolding pandemic, we show that (a) the local severity of the pandemic had a negative effect on individuals' performance, (b) the negative effect of the pandemic on performance is weaker for individuals with high self‐regulation, and (c) uncertainty avoidance and long‐term orientation are positively associated with self‐regulation, which mediates the moderating relationship between the cultural value orientations and the relationship between the COVID‐19 pandemic and individual performance in GVTs.",2022.0,158.0,6.0,"{'volume': '44', 'pages': '102 - 131', 'name': 'Journal of Organizational Behavior'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Schlaegel2022COVID19AI,\n author = {Christopher Schlaegel and M.

This reflects the power of presence – seen as the feeling of being located in a perceived, external world – in developing and affecting psychological wellbeing. Until today Virtual reality Environments (VEs) have been incorporated into a variety of clinical and everyday settings to improve mental health. Nevertheless many areas in the health field can be still explored by using this innovative technology. One example is represented by stress management area, one of the leading mental health problems of western societies linked to several pathologies. Following this trend our proposal is to investigate with a non clinical sample the efficacy of a relaxing narrative through a virtual experience. In a controlled study we compared three different media: Immersive VR, DVD and Audio speaker, by using the same therapeutic narrative and protocol. A control group without treatment was also included in the study. The sample included 60 university students, randomly divided in four experimental conditions. Non parametric test and correlation were used to analyse self-reports and physiological parameters. Within groups analysis - in both VR and DVD conditions - showed a significant improvement of the emotional state and significative physiological changes. Furthermore, regression analysis showed that a relationship exists between the sense of presence and the outcome achieved by the mediated experience. However, the absence of significant differences from the analysis between groups suggests that the principal determinant of presence might be the content proposed within the mediated experience.

Consistent with these revisions, we postulate two models of emotion dysregulation in PTSD in which fear is not the prevailing emotion but is only one of several components implicated in a dysregulated emotional system that also mediates problems regulating anger, guilt, shame, dissociation, and numbing. We discuss whether there is a relationship between fear and other emotion regulation systems that may help further our understanding of PTSD and its underlying neurocircuitry. Two pathways describing the relationship between fear and other emotion regulation systems in PTSD are proposed. The first pathway describes emotion dysregulation as an outcome of fear conditioning through stress sensitization and kindling. The second pathway views emotion dysregulation as a distal vulnerability factor and hypothesizes a further exacerbation of fear and other emotion regulatory problems, including the development of PTSD after exposure to one or several traumatic event(s) later in life.

The present observational study used hierarchical linear modeling to examine predictors of children's social and self-regulatory outcomes in first-grade classrooms. Specifically, goals were the following: (1) to explore relations between emotionally supportive teacher–child interactions and children's social behaviors (aggression with peers, exclusion by peers, prosocial behaviors) and self-regulatory skills (behavioral self-control); and (2) to examine whether emotionally supportive teacher–student interactions contributed differentially to social and self-regulatory outcomes for first-graders at risk for school difficulty based on sociodemographic characteristics compared to counterparts with fewer sociodemographic risk characteristics. Participants were 178 students and 36 teachers in seven rural schools. Results indicated higher teacher emotional support related to lower child aggression and higher behavioral self-control. Emotional support was equally important for all children regardless of the number of sociodemographic risk factors. Results provide evidence for the contribution of teacher behaviors to students' social behaviors and self-regulatory skills, and suggest the importance of classroom interactions in children's acquisition of social and emotional competence. Discussion focuses on plausible mechanisms and implications for interventions.",2012.0,82.0,180.0,"{'volume': '41', 'pages': '141 - 159', 'name': 'School Psychology Review'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Merritt2012TheCO,\n author = {Eileen G.

They are mainly caused by the failures of the drivers to perceive the changes of the traffic lights or the unexpected conditions happening accidentally on the roads. In this paper, we devised a quantitative analysis for assessing driver's cognitive responses by investigating the neurobiological information underlying electroencephalographic (EEG) brain dynamics in traffic-light experiments in a virtual-reality (VR) dynamic driving environment. The VR technique allows subjects to interact directly with the moving virtual environment instead of monotonic auditory and visual stimuli, thereby provides interactive and realistic tasks without the risk of operating on an actual machine. Independent component analysis (ICA) is used to separate and extract noise-free ERP signals from the multi-channel EEG signals. A temporal filter is used to solve the time-alignment problem of ERP features and principle component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce feature dimensions. The dimension-reduced features are then input to a self-constructing neural fuzzy inference network (SONFIN) to recognize different brain potentials stimulated by red/green/yellow traffic events, the accuracy can be reached 87% in average eight subjects in this visual-stimuli ERP experiment. It demonstrates the feasibility of detecting and analyzing multiple streams of ERP signals that represent operators' cognitive states and responses to task events.",2007.0,19.0,104.0,"{'volume': '54', 'pages': '1349-1352', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lin2007EEGBasedAO,\n author = {Chin-Teng Lin and I.

It is based on findings from the JISC-funded DEsign of Learning spaces in 3D Virtual Environments (DELVE) project at the University of Nottingham and the Open University. Given continued confusion about the term immersion, what it means for a learner to be immersed, and the relationship between immersion, presence and engagement, notions of immersion and engagement in 3D virtual environments are explored in the context of previous published studies ranging from virtual reality to psychology. The resultant improved understanding of the terminology is then used as the basis for coding results from a qualitative, inductive analysis of 20 students that undertook a substantive learning task in the virtual environment Second Life. Emergent themes from the analysis identify key factors that act to both enhance and restrict learner engagement in 3D virtual worlds and a set of principles for practitioners who wish to use 3D virtual environments to enhance learner engagement is presented.",2009.0,25.0,47.0,"{'volume': '8', 'pages': '40 - 55', 'name': 'Innovation in Teaching and Learning in Information and Computer Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mount2009LearnerIE,\n author = {N.

Because social deficits are core symptoms of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), we hypothesized that individuals on this spectrum will exhibit abnormal interpersonal distance preferences. The literature on interpersonal distance in ASD is not conclusive. While some studies show preferences for closer distances among this group, others show preferences for farther distances than controls. A common symptom of ASD that may explain the variance in responses to interpersonal distance in this population is social anxiety (SA), which has been shown to correlate with interpersonal distance preferences. In the current study, we investigated interpersonal distance preferences in a group of individuals with ASD using both behavioral and ERP measures. We found greater variance in interpersonal distance preferences in the ASD group than in the control group. Furthermore, we showed that this variance can be explained by differences in SA level and can be predicted by the N1 amplitude, an early ERP component related to attention and discrimination processes. These results hint at the early sensory and attentional processes that may be affecting higher social behaviors, both in subclinical and in clinical populations.",2015.0,56.0,53.0,"{'volume': '10', 'pages': '354 - 365', 'name': 'Social Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Perry2015InterpersonalDA,\n author = {A.

144,0d9ea3956243696a4fd9bc399fe96f15331c7680,Linear and Generalized Linear Mixed Models and Their Applications,"edge of both engineering process control and statistics. A minimum of a master’s level background is preferred (in the opinion of the reviewer). The calculus and matrix algebra, in addition to the advanced terminology, will eliminate any misunderstandings with respect to prerequisites. In the typical format of a collection of contributions from both academicians and practicing electrical and industrial engineers, the continuity is somewhat lacking. This is regrettably often inevitable, due to the difference of writing styles of the authors. The issue is exacerbated by the differences in chapter formats. Some have (often excellent) cases, while others present mostly theory. Much of the book is (not surprisingly) devoted to benchmarking, a topic of extreme familiarity to quality professionals, but only relatively recently introduced to process engineering applications. Benchmarking techniques are delineated based on data-driven and model-driven techniques, and on single input– single output and multiple input–multiple output systems. The general benchmarking coverage culminates with a chapter-long simulation study of a divided wall column distillation process. Other chapters cover economic auditing of control systems, locating sources of disturbances, technical issues with control-system benchmarking, and new research directions. The strongest of these is the economic auditing (in Chap. 2), almost three-fourths of which is devoted to a case study of an oil-production platform. The mix of managerial and engineering methodology and verbiage is optimal. The weakest chapter covers the location of disturbances. Giving short shrift to statistical techniques, the authors ignore much relevant literature in this vital area. The case study is of little use for elucidation; it is too short, and uses a small subset of available methodology. The interested reader is referred to Blanke, Kinnaert, Lunze, and Staroswiecki (2006) for a thorough coverage of locating disturbances in control systems. The final chapter is definitely tailored for the academician interested in cutting-edge process-control scholarship. The proposed new research directions are no doubt relevant, covering new performance metrics, algorithms, and performance analysis. But this largely amounts to straining at gnats, since there is a wealth of literature available on many applicable statistically-based techniques. The most salient is algorithmic process control, and the general integration of statistical process control with engineering process control. Montgomery (2004) offers a superb introduction and coverage of the major corpus in this subject. Overall, the book accomplishes its ostensible purpose. The mix of theory and application will most likely appeal more to the academic reader than the industrial practitioner. The caveat here is that the academician in question needs a thorough background in control theory. This is not an introductory text for interlopers wishing to break into process control-theoretic research. Despite certain shortcomings, the current piece is a nice addition to the process control library. Any interested academic researchers from this area should strongly consider purchasing it. Conversely, most practitioners will find it too pedantic. This is hardly an indictment of this text, as the entire series seems to target the ivory tower.

However, studies to date have not differentially addressed the brain areas associated with the perception, experience, or expression of emotion during emotional arousal. To explore the neural correlates of emotional experience, we used positron emission tomography (PET) and 15O-water to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) in 12 healthy women during film- and recall-induced emotion and correlated CBF changes attributable to emotion with subjects' scores on the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS), a measure of individual differences in the capacity to experience emotion in a differentiated and complex way. A conjunction analysis revealed that the correla-tions between LEAS and CBF during film- and recall-induced emotion overlapped significantly (z = 3.74, p < 0.001) in Brod-mann's area 24 of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). This finding suggests that individual differences in the ability to accurately detect emotional signals interoceptively or exteroceptively may at least in part be a function of the degree to which the ACC participates in the experiential processing and response to emotion cues. To the extent that this finding is consistent with the functions of the ACC involving attention and response selection, it suggests that this neural correlate of conscious emotional experience is not exclusive to emotion.",1998.0,80.0,696.0,"{'volume': '10', 'pages': '525-535', 'name': 'Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lane1998NeuralCO,\n author = {R.

This paper investigates the potential of physiological signals as reliable channels for emotion recognition. All essential stages of an automatic recognition system are discussed, from the recording of a physiological data set to a feature-based multiclass classification. In order to collect a physiological data set from multiple subjects over many weeks, we used a musical induction method that spontaneously leads subjects to real emotional states, without any deliberate laboratory setting. Four-channel biosensors were used to measure electromyogram, electrocardiogram, skin conductivity, and respiration changes. A wide range of physiological features from various analysis domains, including time/frequency, entropy, geometric analysis, subband spectra, multiscale entropy, etc., is proposed in order to find the best emotion-relevant features and to correlate them with emotional states. The best features extracted are specified in detail and their effectiveness is proven by classification results. Classification of four musical emotions (positive/high arousal, negative/high arousal, negative/low arousal, and positive/low arousal) is performed by using an extended linear discriminant analysis (pLDA). Furthermore, by exploiting a dichotomic property of the 2D emotion model, we develop a novel scheme of emotion-specific multilevel dichotomous classification (EMDC) and compare its performance with direct multiclass classification using the pLDA. An improved recognition accuracy of 95 percent and 70 percent for subject-dependent and subject-independent classification, respectively, is achieved by using the EMDC scheme.",2008.0,55.0,942.0,"{'volume': '30', 'pages': '2067-2083', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kim2008EmotionRB,\n author = {Jonghwa Kim and E.

149,0e4b0a92b6a9171e3ff8d814b9bae4715cac63d5,The brain timewise: how timing shapes and supports brain function,"We discuss the importance of timing in brain function: how temporal dynamics of the world has left its traces in the brain during evolution and how we can monitor the dynamics of the human brain with non-invasive measurements. Accurate timing is important for the interplay of neurons, neuronal circuitries, brain areas and human individuals. In the human brain, multiple temporal integration windows are hierarchically organized, with temporal scales ranging from microseconds to tens and hundreds of milliseconds for perceptual, motor and cognitive functions, and up to minutes, hours and even months for hormonal and mood changes. Accurate timing is impaired in several brain diseases. From the current repertoire of non-invasive brain imaging methods, only magnetoencephalography (MEG) and scalp electroencephalography (EEG) provide millisecond time-resolution; our focus in this paper is on MEG. Since the introduction of high-density whole-scalp MEG/EEG coverage in the 1990s, the instrumentation has not changed drastically; yet, novel data analyses are advancing the field rapidly by shifting the focus from the mere pinpointing of activity hotspots to seeking stimulus- or task-specific information and to characterizing functional networks. During the next decades, we can expect increased spatial resolution and accuracy of the time-resolved brain imaging and better understanding of brain function, especially its temporal constraints, with the development of novel instrumentation and finer-grained, physiologically inspired generative models of local and network activity. Merging both spatial and temporal information with increasing accuracy and carrying out recordings in naturalistic conditions, including social interaction, will bring much new information about human brain function.",2015.0,68.0,65.0,"{'volume': '370', 'name': 'Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hari2015TheBT,\n author = {R.

This study aimed to describe the theoretical background and relevance of teachers’ social–emotional competencies. We conducted a systematic review with a critical, theoretical review approach. The results showed that the concept has an increasingly complex history and followed a structured course from 1920 to present. Five main models have been identified: emotional regulation, prosocial classroom, Collaborative Association of Social Emotional Learning, Bar-On emotional intelligence, and emotional intelligence. There are measurement instruments consistent with four of the identified models; however, the model that does not have its own instrument uses different available scales. Specific recommendations are proposed to develop social and emotional competencies in educational public policies, which include school leadership, assessment, and teacher professional training. In conclusion, it is relevant to have clear guidelines that conceive and conceptualize social–emotional competence univocally. These guidelines would allow the design of instruments with a comprehensive and sufficient theoretical base that reflect the multidimensionality of the concept, provide a precise measure to assess the effectiveness of intervention programs, and enlist teachers who seek the development of the different skills that involve social–emotional competencies.",2021.0,100.0,12.0,{'name': 'Sustainability'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Lozano-Peña2021TeachersSC,\n author = {Gissela Lozano-Peña and Fabiola Sáez-Delgado and Yaranay López-Angulo and Javier Mella-Norambuena},\n journal = {Sustainability},\n title = {Teachers’ Social–Emotional Competence: History, Concept, Models, Instruments, and Recommendations for Educational Quality},\n year = {2021}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2139563886', 'name': 'Gissela Lozano-Peña'}, {'authorId': '2083843286', 'name': 'Fabiola Sáez-Delgado'}, {'authorId': '2091113474', 'name': 'Yaranay López-Angulo'}, {'authorId': '2132121833', 'name': 'Javier Mella-Norambuena'}]"

Differences among countries in such matters are of interest as they provide a unique window to understand human behaviour and culture. The aim of this study is to examine cross‐cultural differences in state anxiety, and any moderating role of resilience and social contact. Participants from three countries were recruited: Ireland (n = 449), Italy (n = 324) and Spain (n = 471). While these countries share many characteristics, it was anticipated that their experiences might differ because of pronounced differences in governmental measures and the local severity and history of the pandemic at the time of data collection. Results indicated that: (a) Resilience was negatively related to state anxiety both bivariately and multivariately; (b) number of hours outside per week did not predict state anxiety but was negatively correlated with fear of contagious diseases in the essential workers from the Irish sample; (c) national measures had a moderating role in the relationship between resilience and state anxiety; and (d) social contact, in terms of numbers of written, audio or visual interactions, was not a statistically significant predictor of state anxiety.

To investigate functional neural plasticity underlying the augmentation of empathy and to test the counteracting potential of compassion, one group of participants was first trained in empathic resonance and subsequently in compassion. In response to videos depicting human suffering, empathy training, but not memory training (control group), increased negative affect and brain activations in anterior insula and anterior midcingulate cortex-brain regions previously associated with empathy for pain. In contrast, subsequent compassion training could reverse the increase in negative effect and, in contrast, augment self-reports of positive affect. In addition, compassion training increased activations in a non-overlapping brain network spanning ventral striatum, pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex. We conclude that training compassion may reflect a new coping strategy to overcome empathic distress and strengthen resilience.",2014.0,45.0,482.0,"{'volume': '9 6', 'pages': '\n          873-9\n        ', 'name': 'Social cognitive and affective neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Klimecki2014DifferentialPO,\n author = {O.

Typically, this bias has been conceptualized as driven by an overactive bottom-up attentional system; however, this potentially overlooks the role of top-down attention in being able to modulate this bottom-up bias. Here, the role of top-down mechanisms in directing attention toward emotional faces was assessed with a modified dot-probe task, in which participants were given a top-down cue (""happy"" or ""angry"") to attend to a happy or angry face on each trial, and the cued face was either presented with a face of the other emotion (angry, happy) or a neutral face. This study found that social anxiety was not associated with differences in shifting attention toward cued angry faces. However, participants with higher levels of social anxiety were selectively impaired in attentional shifting toward a cued happy face when it was paired with an angry face, but not when paired with a neutral face. The results indicate that top-down attention can be used to orient attention to emotional faces, but that higher levels of social anxiety are associated with selective deficits in top-down control of attention in the presence of threat.

This paper addresses this by revisiting existing Interactive Narrative paradigms, granting explicit status to users' disposition towards story characters as part of narrative generation as well as adding support for new forms of interaction. We demonstrate this with a novel Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) design, incorporating empathy for a main character derived from brain signals within filmic conceptions of narrative which drives generation using planning techniques.

They then continuously rated their subjective emotional arousal while viewing a replay of their experience. The association between emotional arousal and parieto-occipital alpha power was tested and confirmed by (1) decomposing the continuous EEG signal while maximizing the comodulation between alpha power and arousal ratings and by (2) decoding periods of high and low arousal with discriminative common spatial patterns and a Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network.

However, parents and clinicians have long noted the importance of emotional problems in individuals with ASD (e.g. tantrums and “meltdowns”). In this study, 21 high‐functioning children and adolescents with ASD and 22 age and gender group‐matched typically developing (TD) controls completed a Reactivity and Regulation Situation Task. This task assesses emotional reactivity and spontaneous use of emotion regulation strategies (problem solving, cognitive reappraisal, avoidance, distraction, venting, suppression, and relaxation) in the context of age‐appropriate ambiguous and potentially threatening negative scenarios. After the concept of cognitive reappraisal was explained, the scenarios were presented again to participants, and they were prompted to use this strategy. Results indicated that individuals with ASD exhibited the same level of reactivity to negative stimuli as TD participants. Furthermore, youth with ASD had a different emotion regulation profile than TD individuals, characterized by a less frequent use of cognitive reappraisal and more frequent use of suppression. When prompted to use cognitive reappraisal, participants with ASD were less able to implement reappraisal, but benefitted from this strategy when they were able to generate a reappraisal. Findings from this study suggest that cognitive reappraisal strategies may be useful to children and adolescents with ASD. Therefore, the development of treatment programs that focus on enhancing the use of adaptive forms of emotion regulation might decrease emotional problems and optimize long‐term outcomes in youth with ASD.

Two studies that examined whether social presence is largely an attribute of the communication medium or users’ perception of the medium are discussed. It can be concluded from the results that even though CMC is considered to be a medium that is low in social context cues, it can be perceived as interactive, active, interesting, and stimulating by conference participants. However, it is the kind of interactions that take place between the participants, and the sense of community that is created during the conference, that will impact participants’ perceptions of CMC as a “social” medium. Therefore, the impetus falls upon the moderators of computer conferences to create a sense of online community in order to promote interaction and collaborative learning.",1995.0,23.0,1182.0,"{'volume': '1', 'pages': '147-166', 'name': 'International journal of educational telecommunications'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gunawardena1995SocialPT,\n author = {C.

In these labs, students work together in small groups imitating professional practice of design and technology workers. More insights are needed in what competences student labs in the STEM domain address and what the implications would be for the design of student labs. A review of empirical studies on student labs and additional literature indicate that five generic competences are addressed in most student labs: Collaboration, communication, problem solving, critical thinking, and creativity. In order to effectively enhanced these competences, student labs should be designed as authentic productive learning environments based on three design principles: 1) Realistic, complex task situations, 2) Multidisciplinarity,  and 3) Social interaction. IoT Rapid Proto Labs are examples of such a student labs, in which cross-border multidisciplinary teams of students, teachers (coaches), and practitioners jointly develop solutions to challenging IoT applications (Internet-connected objects), add value for enterprises, and strengthen the employability, creativity and career prospects of students.",2019.0,36.0,16.0,"{'volume': '3', 'pages': '85-94', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Admiraal2019StudentsAF,\n author = {W.

Yet, the neural mechanisms supporting the training of these emotions are poorly understood. To study affective plasticity in healthy adults, we measured functional neural and subjective responses to witnessing the distress of others in a newly developed task (Socio-affective Video Task). Participants' initial empathic responses to the task were accompanied by negative affect and activations in the anterior insula and anterior medial cingulate cortex--a core neural network underlying empathy for pain. Whereas participants reacted with negative affect before training, compassion training increased positive affective experiences, even in response to witnessing others in distress. On the neural level, we observed that, compared with a memory control group, compassion training elicited activity in a neural network including the medial orbitofrontal cortex, putamen, pallidum, and ventral tegmental area--brain regions previously associated with positive affect and affiliation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the deliberate cultivation of compassion offers a new coping strategy that fosters positive affect even when confronted with the distress of others.",2013.0,56.0,491.0,"{'volume': '23 7', 'pages': '\n          1552-61\n        ', 'name': 'Cerebral cortex'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Klimecki2013FunctionalNP,\n author = {O.

185,124d726971ebb0858df205143d58b364537dae67,QUANTITATIVE METHODS IN PSYCHOLOGY A Power Primer,"One possible reason for the continued neglect of statistical power analysis in research in the behavioral sciences is the inaccessibility of or difficulty with the standard material. A convenient, although not comprehensive, presentation of required sample sizes is provided here. Effect-size indexes and conventional values for these are given for operationally defined small, medium, and large effects. The sample sizes necessary for .80 power to detect effects at these levels are tabled for eight standard statistical tests: (a) the difference between independent means, (b) the significance of a product-moment correlation, (c) the difference between independent rs, (d) the sign test, (e) the difference between independent proportions, (f) chi-square tests for goodness of fit and contingency tables, (g) one-way analysis of variance, and (h) the significance o f a multiple or multiple partial correlation. The preface to the first edition of my power handbook (Cohen, 1969) begins: During my first dozen years o f teaching and consulting o n applied statistics with behavioral scientists, 1 became increasingly impressed with the importance of statistical power analysis, an importance which was increased an order of magnitude by its neglect in our textbooks and curricula. The case for its importance is easily made: What behavioral scientist would view with equanimity the question of the probability that his investigation would lead to statistically significant results, i.e., its power? (p. vii) This neglect was obvious through casual observation and had been confirmed by a power review of the 1960 volume of the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, which found the mean power to detect medium effect sizes to be .48 (Cohen, 1962). Thus, the chance of obtaining a significant result was about that of tossing a head with a fair coin. I attributed this disregard of power to the inaccessibility of a meager and mathematically difficult literature, beginning with its origin in the work of Neyman and Pearson (1928,1933). The power handbook was supposed to solve the problem. It required no more background than an introductory psychological statistics course that included significance testing. The exposition was verbal-intuitive and carried largely by many worked examples drawn from across the spectrum of behavioral science. In the ensuing two decades, the book has been through revised (1977) and second (1988) editions and has inspired dozens of power and effect-size surveys i n many areas of the social and life sciences (Cohen, 1988, pp. xi-xii).

Method. Non-systematic literature review. Results. VR, despite its more common usage by younger persons, is a potentially promising source of techniques useful in the identification and rehabilitation of cognitive disorders of the elderly. Systems employing VR can include desktop and head-mounted visual displays among other devices. Thus far, published studies have described VR-based applications in the identification and treatment of deficits in navigational skills in ambulation and driving. In addition, VR has been utilised to enhance the ability to perform activities of daily living in patients with dementia, stroke, and Parkinson's Disease. Such investigations have thus far been small, and unblinded. Conclusions. VR-based applications can potentially offer more versatile, comprehensive, and safer assessments of function. However, they also might be more expensive, complex and more difficult to use by elderly patients.

Many studies have investigated responses to facial emotions to provide a better understanding of the processes and the neural networks involved. Moreover, several studies have revealed abnormalities of emotional face processing and their neural correlates in affective disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate whether early visual event-related potentials (ERPs) are affected by the emotional skills of healthy adults. Unfamiliar faces expressing the six basic emotions were presented to 28 young adults while recording visual ERPs. No specific task was required during the recording. Participants also completed the Social Skills Inventory (SSI) which measures social and emotional skills. The results confirmed that early visual ERPs (P1, N170) are affected by the emotions expressed by a face and also demonstrated that N170 and P2 are correlated to the emotional skills of healthy subjects. While N170 is sensitive to the subject's emotional sensitivity and expressivity, P2 is modulated by the ability of the subjects to control their emotions. We therefore suggest that N170 and P2 could be used as individual markers to assess strengths and weaknesses in emotional areas and could provide information for further investigations of affective disorders.",2014.0,130.0,30.0,"{'volume': '9 8', 'pages': '\n          1089-98\n        ', 'name': 'Social cognitive and affective neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Meaux2014EarlyVE,\n author = {E.

Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with caregivers (n = 20) to explore their support services received, access barriers, utility of services, needed supports, coping strategies and factors promoting life satisfaction. The team recorded, transcribed verbatim and inductively analysed all interviews. Results: Through thematic data analysis, three central themes were revealed: (a) barriers impeding quality-of-life, (b) support needed to improve quality-of-life and (c) factors enabling quality-of-life. All perspectives from the participants involved are synthesized to provide a rich depiction of caregivers’ support needs and coping strategies. Conclusions: Two specific findings of interest include a negative association between severity of brain injury and caregiver’s desire to direct treatment, as well as a distinct service gap in assistance for caregivers who are caring for someone with violent/offending behaviours. This study recommends short- and long-term changes, given Australia’s upcoming National Disability Insurance Scheme, to increase caregiver quality-of-life, which will ultimately affect the rehabilitation outcomes of persons with ABI.",2015.0,65.0,39.0,"{'volume': '29', 'pages': '1082 - 1093', 'name': 'Brain Injury'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kitter2015CaregiversSN,\n author = {Bryony Kitter and R.

The clinical evaluation of ASD requires its consideration as a continuum of deficits, and there is a need to identify biologically significant parameters (biomarkers) that have the power to automatically characterize each individual at different stages of neurological development. The emerging field of computational psychiatry (CP) attempts to meet the needs of precision diagnosis by developing powerful computational and mathematical techniques. A growing scientific activity proposes the use of implicit measures based on biosignals for the classification of ASD. Virtual reality (VR) technologies have demonstrated potential for ASD interventions, but most of the work has used virtual reality for the learning / objective of interventions. Very few studies have used biological signals for recording and detailed analysis of behavioral responses that can be used to monitor or produce changes over time. In this paper the concept of behavioral biomarkers based on VR or VRBB is introduced. VRBB will allow the classification of ASD using a paradigm of computational psychiatry based on implicit brain processes measured through psychophysiological signals and the behavior of subjects exposed to complex replicas of social conditions using virtual reality interfaces.",2020.0,0.0,3.0,"{'volume': '80 Suppl 2', 'pages': '\n          31-36\n        ', 'name': 'Medicina'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Alcañiz2020AutismSD,\n author = {M.

Mindfulness-based interventions have been shown to be effective in the treatment of a range of health and psychological disorders in adults and young people without intellectual disabilities (ID). Clinical studies are emerging reporting on the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions as a stand-alone treatment for common clinical disorders in adults with ID.


METHOD
This paper aims to evaluate the efficacy of an innovative structured mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) group programme adapted for adults with ID with a diagnosis of either recurrent depression, anxiety or both clinical conditions and a history of deliberate self-harm behaviour. Two groups ran consecutively consisting of a total of fifteen participants and seven carers. All participants were recorded as having either a borderline, mild, or moderate ID. The group programme ran over a period of 9 weeks with a follow-up session at 6 weeks post group intervention. Outcome measures included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and two sub-scales from the Self-Compassion Scale administered at baseline, post therapy and at 6-week follow-up.


RESULTS
The evaluation showed that participants reported an improvement in their experience of depression, anxiety, self-compassion and compassion for others. The most significant impact was in the reduced levels of anxiety reported. Improvements across all outcomes were maintained at 6-week follow-up.


CONCLUSION
The results of the evaluation suggest that people with intellectual disabilities benefit from a structured MBCT group intervention and the results are maintained at 6-week follow-up.",2015.0,46.0,81.0,"{'volume': '59 2', 'pages': '\n          93-104\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Idusohan-Moizer2015MindfulnessbasedCT,\n author = {H.

Using the GT, 11% of healthy control participants and 61% of ISDs opted for choices with high immediate gains in spite of higher future losses. For the ISDs and controls with equal GT impairments, the ISDs performed significantly lower than controls on the DNMS task. The nonimpaired ISDs on the GT also performed significantly worse than matched controls on the DNMS task. The DNMS task deficit in ISDs was across all delay times, suggesting the deficit may lie in the ""executive"" process of working memory, which supports earlier findings (E. M. Martin et al., 2003). The authors suggest that the prefrontal cortex hosts multiple distinct mechanisms of decision making and inhibitory control and that ISDs may be affected in any one or combination of them.",2004.0,69.0,441.0,"{'volume': '18 1', 'pages': '\n          152-62\n        ', 'name': 'Neuropsychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bechara2004ImpairedDM,\n author = {A.

Relaxation techniques, which are facilitated by external (bio)feedback of electrodermal activity, can be used by trained subjects to actively control bodily and emotional arousal. Biofeedback relaxation provides an experimental model to explore neural mechanisms contributing to emotional representations and intentional autonomic control. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore neural mechanisms contributing to integration of volitional intent, self-representation, and autonomic states of arousal, embodied within performance of a biofeedback relaxation exercise. Data were obtained from 17 subjects to assess brain activity during relaxation in which a visual index of electrodermal arousal was modulated by accuracy (addition of random ""noise"") or sensitivity (by scalar adjustments of feedback). A central matrix of cortical, subcortical and brainstem autonomic centres was activated during biofeedback relaxation, as well as regions that mediate visual and somatesthetic representations and executive control. Anterior cingulate, amygdala, and insula activity was modulated by task manipulations that increased demand on processing interoceptive representations, while variation in anterior insula activity reflected an interaction between accuracy and sensitivity of feedback. These findings identify neural substrates that support integration of perceptual processing, interoception, and intentional modulation of bodily states of arousal.",2002.0,34.0,218.0,"{'volume': '16', 'pages': '909-919', 'name': 'NeuroImage'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Critchley2002VolitionalCO,\n author = {H.

Once evoked by the story, these emotions can in turn influence a person's experience of the narrative. Lastly, emotions experienced during reading may have consequences after closing the covers of a book.

Income may be evaluated relative to others (social comparison) or to oneself in the past (habituation). We review the evidence on relative income from the subjective well-being literature. We also discuss the relation (or not) between happiness and utility, and discuss some nonhappiness research (behavioral, experimental, neurological) related to income comparisons.

An emerging literature highlights the importance of interpersonal ER, which utilizes social cues to facilitate the regulation of emotional states. In cultures that place high value on social interconnectedness as integral to their collectivistic self-construal, including East Asian cultures, interpersonal ER strategies may be particularly effective in reducing negative affect but this has not been previously tested. In this study, two groups comprising East Asian (n = 48) and Western European (n = 38) participants were randomly assigned to receive a priming narration depicting the use of either interpersonal (e.g., social modeling, perspective taking) or intrapersonal (e.g., cognitive reappraisal) ER strategies during a stressful experience. They were then instructed to utilize similar ER strategies in an emotion reactivity task during which they viewed high arousing negative pictorial stimuli while their heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (high frequency power – HF-HRV) and subjective affective states were measured. First we found that the East Asian group reported higher use of interpersonal ER strategies of social modeling and perspective taking in daily life. During the experimental interpersonal prime exposure, the East Asian group showed elevated HF-HRV (relative to baseline) compared to the Western European group, indicating more adaptive ER, but this pattern was not sustained during the reactivity or recovery phases. Instead, the East Asian group demonstrated increased HF-HRV and decreased HR across both prime conditions. The East Asian group also showed greater decreases in positive affect across the course of the experiment. Furthermore, individual differences in social modeling and individualistic self-construal moderated the effect of the ER prime in the East Asian group at trend levels, and main effects for perspective taking and reappraisal were observed in the Western European group. The findings support the notion that engaging in interpersonal ER strategies may be more beneficial for East Asian groups when immediately exposed to a stressful situation, as these strategies are congruent with cultural context and preferences, but our priming methodology may have limited the longer-term benefits.",2019.0,76.0,22.0,"{'volume': '10', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Liddell2019CulturalDI,\n author = {B.

The core of the system is a real-time 3D virtual simulation of a classroom, populated by twenty-four semi-autonomous virtual students. The system has been designed as a companion tool for classroom management seminars in a syllabus for primary and secondary school teachers. Whereby, it will allow lecturers to link theory with practice, using the medium of VR. The system is therefore designed for two users: a trainee teacher and an instructor supervising the training session. The teacher is immersed in a real-time 3D simulation of a classroom by means of a head-mounted display and headphone. The instructor operates a graphical desktop console which renders a view of the class and the teacher, whose avatar movements are captured by a marker-less tracking system. This console includes a 2D graphics menu with convenient behaviour and feedback control mechanisms to provide human-guided training sessions. The system is built using low-cost consumer hardware and software. Its architecture and technical design are described in detail. A first evaluation confirms its conformance to critical usability requirements (i.e., safety and comfort, believability, simplicity, acceptability, extensibility, affordability and mobility).

The test features eight versions of an experimental website, with varying combinations of online information (e.g. price information, product information, and interactivity). , – Providing more information, whether about the product or price, leads to increased trust among consumers, which has the capacity to reduce consumer price consciousness and thereby enhance price premiums. E-tailers can earn price premiums by enhancing the interactivity on their websites. , – Previous studies are ambivalent about the impacts of providing information online.

232,16a713b7928dbcc4f861788d88ab257e15395be9,The Impact of Context on the Perception of Emotions,"Introduction Most human interactions are imbued with emotional exchange. In fact, it is hard to imagine a meaningful interaction in which emotion communication plays no role and even banal everyday transactions such as paying at a supermarket often involve an exchange of smiles or sometimes the expression of displeasure by one or both interaction partners. Importantly, these expressions serve as social signals that provide information about the expresser as well as about the situation (Hess, Kappas and Banse 1995) and that help to coordinate and facilitate interpersonal interaction and communication (Niedenthal and Brauer 2012; Parkinson, Fischer and Manstead 2005). This chapter explores the influence of context on the social signal value of such emotion expressions. What do they in fact tell us about the person or the situation and what influence has the context they occur in on the meaning of the exchange? When considering the impact of context, on the one hand, and the social signals inherent in emotion expressions, on the other, the first question to ask would be what emotions actually signal. The scientific study of emotion expressions is usually traced to Darwin's seminal work On the Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animal ([1872] 1965). Darwin understood emotion expressions as the visible part of an underlying emotional state, which are evolved and (at least at some point in the past) adaptive. The notion that the expressions communicate the organisms’ state and thereby allow a prediction of the organisms’ likely behaviour was a central point in this argument. Yet, Darwin's view has been disputed and rejected by those who considered facial expressions as exclusively or predominantly social or cultural signals, which are not linked to underlying states. Research by Ekman and colleagues (Ekman 1973; Ekman and Friesen 1971; Ekman, Friesen and Ellsworth 1972; Ekman, Sorenson and Friesen 1969) as well as Izard (Izard 1971a, 1971b) initially vindicated Darwin's idea that at least some basic emotional expressions are universal and directly associated with an underlying emotional state (see Hwang and Matsumoto, this volume, for a defence of this view, and Jack and Russell, both this volume, for criticisms). To this day, this view has been repeatedly challenged by those who consider emotion expressions to be purely social signals or social constructions unconnected to an underlying state (Barrett 2013; Fridlund 1994).",2016.0,68.0,19.0,"{'volume': '', 'pages': '199-218', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Hess2016TheIO,\n author = {U.

An individual who is online manages his/her emotions in a specific manner. Thus, it is highly relevant to analyze and evaluate online socio-emotional competencies. Until now, however, no instruments had been defined or developed for that purpose. This study’s objective was thus to design and validate a questionnaire for the evaluation of socio-emotional competencies in virtual contexts, and to analyze eventual differences according to gender and academic year. Using the model developed by Bisquerra and Pérez (2007) as a theoretical framework, the competencies posited therein were transferred to an online environment. The questionnaire was filled out by 888 adolescents ages 12 to 17 (48% males, M = 13.83 years old, DT = 1.27), all residents of Aragón, Spain. On the basis of their responses, structure analysis, validation, and reliability were carried out. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) yielded a five-dimensional structure with good fit and internal consistency. The five resulting dimensions evaluate (1) emotional e-conscience, (2) emotional e-autonomy, (3) emotional e-regulation, (4) e-self-control of impulsiveness, and (5) social e-competency. Differences among genders were observed in the categories of emotional e-conscience and social e-competency. Furthermore, the results of this study show that online emotional expression does not imply emotional competency.

The total sample comprised 86 students aged 9–11 years. A quasi-experimental design with pre-test and post-test measures with a control group was used. The results show that the program’s implementation is effective both for the improvement of the classroom climate and the acquisition of training in the field of emotional intelligence, as well as for the development of cooperative competences.

236,173e7fd342b6b48ac21ec7f7dada18e481889616,Challenges and Opportunities of Immersive Technologies for Mindfulness Meditation: A Systematic Review,"Mindfulness is considered an important factor of an individual's subjective well-being. Consequently, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has investigated approaches that strengthen mindfulness, i.e., by inventing multimedia technologies to support mindfulness meditation. These approaches often use smartphones, tablets, or consumer-grade desktop systems to allow everyday usage in users' private lives or in the scope of organized therapies. Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality (VR, AR, MR; in short: XR) significantly extend the design space for such approaches. XR covers a wide range of potential sensory stimulation, perceptive and cognitive manipulations, content presentation, interaction, and agency. These facilities are linked to typical XR-specific perceptions that are conceptually closely related to mindfulness research, such as (virtual) presence and (virtual) embodiment. However, a successful exploitation of XR that strengthens mindfulness requires a systematic analysis of the potential interrelation and influencing mechanisms between XR technology, its properties, factors, and phenomena and existing models and theories of the construct of mindfulness. This article reports such a systematic analysis of XR-related research from HCI and life sciences to determine the extent to which existing research frameworks on HCI and mindfulness can be applied to XR technologies, the potential of XR technologies to support mindfulness, and open research gaps. Fifty papers of ACM Digital Library and National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine (PubMed) with and without empirical efficacy evaluation were included in our analysis. The results reveal that at the current time, empirical research on XR-based mindfulness support mainly focuses on therapy and therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, most of the currently investigated XR-supported mindfulness interactions are limited to vocally guided meditations within nature-inspired virtual environments. While an analysis of empirical research on those systems did not reveal differences in mindfulness compared to non-mediated mindfulness practices, various design proposals illustrate that XR has the potential to provide interactive and body-based innovations for mindfulness practice. We propose a structured approach for future work to specify and further explore the potential of XR as mindfulness-support. The resulting framework provides design guidelines for XR-based mindfulness support based on the elements and psychological mechanisms of XR interactions.",2021.0,112.0,29.0,{'volume': '2'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Döllinger2021ChallengesAO,\n author = {Nina Döllinger and C.

The inclusion of a brief form of the Emotional Quotient Inventory-Youth Version (EQi:YV-Brief) in the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY) presents a unique opportunity to study the developmental dynamics of TEI during the transition from childhood to adolescence. However, before drawing any inferences about construct continuity and change, researchers must establish that the EQi:YV-Brief functions equivalently over time. This study tested configural, metric, scalar, and residual measurement invariance of the EQi:YV-Brief over a 6-year period from late childhood (age 10-11) to adolescence (age 16-17). Longitudinal mean and covariance structures models were fitted to the data from 773 NLSCY participants (51% girls) who completed the EQi:YV-Brief at 4 biennial cycles. Three of the 4 EQi:YV-Brief subscales were found to be fully invariant at ages 12-13 through 17-18 and partially invariant at age 10-11. Controlling for partial noninvariance, we also investigated patterns of rank-order stability and mean-level change in TEI. These exploratory analyses showed that individual differences in TEI became increasingly more stable with age and that changes in mean TEI levels followed a complex nonlinear pattern over time. The results supported the longitudinal utility of 3 of the 4 EQi:YV-Brief subscales used in the NLSCY, supporting their further use in research on the developmental dynamics of TEI.",2013.0,115.0,74.0,"{'volume': '25 4', 'pages': '\n          1255-72\n        ', 'name': 'Psychological assessment'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Keefer2013LongitudinalAO,\n author = {Kateryna V.

Power in all frequency bands was extracted by fast Fourier transformation. There was a significant Group X Hemisphere interaction in the mid-frontal region, for the alpha band power only. Depressed subjects had less left-sided activation (i.e., more alpha activity) than did normal control subjects.

Evidence from India during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Distress in online classrooms and problematic internet use are two issues that have caused student burnout and affect perceived learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the high pressure placed on students throughout COVID-19, it is critical to understand the influence of problematic internet use (PIU), psychological stress, academic burnout, and resilience on perceived learning (PL). A cross-sectional analytical study was chosen to collect data from 350 learners pursuing undergraduate and postgraduate business/management degrees in Karnataka, India. The data were analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Science) and Smart PLS 3. The present study reports a non-significant negative total effect of stress on PL, while there was a significant positive direct effect but a significant indirect negative effect of multiple mediators, namely PIU, burnout, and resilience. In the relationship between stress and PL, burnout has full competitive mediation, and the suppressive effect of burnout and resilience wipes out the beneficial benefit of stress on PL, resulting in reduced PL. As a societal problem, a change in educational policy and prevention strategies for students and organizations (reducing the number of courses, number of exams, and handling parental expectations) would be effective. Emotional intelligence to improve resilience, which assists students in sailing through a current challenging situation and using IT for reducing negative and unexpected emotional outbursts should be encouraged.",2022.0,91.0,28.0,{'name': 'Sustainability'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Basri2022DoAS,\n author = {Savitha Basri and Iqbal Thonse Hawaldar and R.

Design: This study adopted a constructivist grounded theory approach, with data consisting of in-depth interviews conducted with spouses over a 12-month period. Data were analysed through an iterative process of open and focused coding, identification of emergent categories and exploration of relationships between categories. Participants: Participants were four spouses of individuals with severe TBI (with moderate–severe disability). Spouses had shared committed relationships (marriage or domestic partnerships) for at least 4 years at initial interview. Three spouses were in relationships that had commenced following injury. Main outcome and results: Two main themes emerged from the data. The first identified the saliency of the relational space in which decision-making took place. The second revealed the complex nature of decision-making within the spousal relationship. Conclusions: Spouses experience decision-making as a complex multi-stage process underpinned by a number of relational factors. Increased understanding of this process can guide health professionals in their provision of support for couples in exploring decision-making participation after injury.",2015.0,64.0,34.0,"{'volume': '29', 'pages': '745 - 757', 'name': 'Brain Injury'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Knox2015TheBT,\n author = {Lucy Knox and J.

However, the analysis and interpretation of multiple physiological measures is time consuming and requires specific skills, which are not available to most clinicians. To address this issue, we designed and developed a Decision Support System (DSS) for automatic classification of stress levels during exposure to VR environments. The DSS integrates different biosensor data (ECG, breathing rate, EEG) and behavioral data (body gestures correlated with stress), following a training process in which self-rated and clinical-rated stress levels are used as ground truth. Detected stress events for each VR session are reported to the therapist as an aggregated value (ranging from 0 to 1) and graphically displayed on a diagram accessible by the therapist through a web-based interface.",2014.0,18.0,16.0,"{'volume': '196', 'pages': '\n          114-20\n        ', 'name': 'Studies in health technology and informatics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gaggioli2014ADS,\n author = {A.

Affective computing research has mostly used non-immersive two-dimensional (2D) images or videos to elicit emotional states. However, immersive virtual reality, which allows researchers to simulate environments in controlled laboratory conditions with high levels of sense of presence and interactivity, is becoming more popular in emotion research. Moreover, its synergy with implicit measurements and machine-learning techniques has the potential to impact transversely in many research areas, opening new opportunities for the scientific community. This paper presents a systematic review of the emotion recognition research undertaken with physiological and behavioural measures using head-mounted displays as elicitation devices.

272,1abcc5349eeec3608f87caa32fcdb9baa24a3265,Conversational agents in healthcare: a systematic review,"Abstract Objective Our objective was to review the characteristics, current applications, and evaluation measures of conversational agents with unconstrained natural language input capabilities used for health-related purposes. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and ACM Digital using a predefined search strategy. Studies were included if they focused on consumers or healthcare professionals; involved a conversational agent using any unconstrained natural language input; and reported evaluation measures resulting from user interaction with the system. Studies were screened by independent reviewers and Cohen’s kappa measured inter-coder agreement. Results The database search retrieved 1513 citations; 17 articles (14 different conversational agents) met the inclusion criteria. Dialogue management strategies were mostly finite-state and frame-based (6 and 7 conversational agents, respectively); agent-based strategies were present in one type of system. Two studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 1 was cross-sectional, and the remaining were quasi-experimental. Half of the conversational agents supported consumers with health tasks such as self-care. The only RCT evaluating the efficacy of a conversational agent found a significant effect in reducing depression symptoms (effect size d = 0.44, p = .04). Patient safety was rarely evaluated in the included studies. Conclusions The use of conversational agents with unconstrained natural language input capabilities for health-related purposes is an emerging field of research, where the few published studies were mainly quasi-experimental, and rarely evaluated efficacy or safety. Future studies would benefit from more robust experimental designs and standardized reporting.

The hunger drive (or any other physiological drive) was rejected as a centering point or model for a definitive theory of motivation. Any drive that is somatically based and localizable was shown to be atypical rather than typical in human motivation. 3. Such a theory should stress and center itself upon ultimate or basic goals rather than partial or superficial ones, upon ends rather than means to these ends. Such a stress would imply a more central place for unconscious than for conscious motivations. 4. There are usually available various cultural paths to the same goal. Therefore conscious, specific, local-cultural desires are not as fundamental in motivation theory as the more basic, unconscious goals. 5. Any motivated behavior, either preparatory or consummatory, must be understood to be a channel through which many basic needs may be simultaneously expressed or satisfied. Typically an act has more than one motivation. 6. Practically all organismic states are to be understood as motivated and as motivating. 7. Human needs arrange themselves in hierarchies of prepotency. That is to say, the appearance of one need usually rests on the prior satisfaction of another, more pre-potent need. Man is a perpetually wanting animal. Also no need or drive can be treated as if it were isolated or discrete; every drive is related to the state of satisfaction or dissatisfaction of other drives. 8. Lists of drives will get us nowhere for various theoretical and practical reasons.

Human internal processing mechanisms for evoking an emotion by a relevant stimulus have not been clarified. Therefore, there are few reliable techniques for evoking an intended emotion in order to reproduce this process.
 However, in the field of cognitive science, the ability to alter a bodily response has been shown to unconsciously generate emotions. We therefore hypothesized emotional experience could be manipulated by having people recognize pseudo-generated facial expressions as changes to their own facial expressions. Our results suggest that this system was able to manipulate an emotional state via visual feedback from artificial facial expressions.

Rejecting the oft-favored features of bodily feelings, emotion-related behaviors, and facial expressions as too intensity-dependent and insufficiently diagnostic, they provide a detailed analysis of emotion differentiation in terms of the cognitive underpinnings of emotion types. Using numerous examples, they explain how different variables influence emotion intensity, and show how emotions can be formalized for computational purposes. Now with a contributed chapter describing the OCC model's influence, this book will interest a wide audience in cognitive, clinical, and social psychology, as well as in artificial intelligence and affective computing, and other cognitive science disciplines.",1988.0,3.0,6591.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Ortony1988TheCS,\n author = {A.

The results also reveal that structural capital and cognitive capital have positive influence on relational capital, while structural capital influences cognitive capital significantly. The results, on the other hand, show that awareness and affective social presence are the antecedents of structural capital, whereas cognitive social presence and affective social presence influence cognitive capital significantly.

To examine predictors of perceived susceptibility to breast cancer and assess differences across three dependent measures.


DESIGN
Annual surveys were completed by US women veterans (N = 3,758) participating in a repeat mammography intervention trial. Multivariable non-linear mixed model analyses examined individual- and group-level changes in perceived susceptibility to breast cancer.


DEPENDENT MEASURES
Three single-item measures of perceived susceptibility to breast cancer (percent risk, ordinal risk, and comparative risk likelihood). Predictors included demographic, health status, health behavior, affect, knowledge, and subjective norm variables.


RESULTS
Breast symptoms and greater cancer worry increased perceived susceptibility for all three measures. Other predictors varied by dependent measure. Random change, indicating individual variability, was observed for percent risk only.


CONCLUSION
Despite small model effect sizes, breast symptoms and cancer worry were consistent predictors and may be good targets for messages designed to influence women's perceived susceptibility to breast cancer. Researchers may benefit from using measures of perceived susceptibility with larger response scales, but additional measurement research is needed. Combining indicators of perceived susceptibility may be undesirable when different predictors are associated with different measures.",2008.0,48.0,42.0,"{'volume': '27 1', 'pages': '\n          68-77\n        ', 'name': 'Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{McQueen2008PredictorsOP,\n author = {A.

 For a woman to experience an orgasm she needs adequate physical, psychological, social and emotional stimulation to be highly aroused and have the ability to let go and be vulnerable. Mindfulness positively impacts attentional control, cognitive control, emotion regulation, and how one processes the perception of one’s self. Research indicates the positive influence of mindfulness training on immune function and overall brain function1, positively influencing outcomes including improved levels of performance on attentional tasks2, increased empathy3, and reduced physical symptoms and stress4, as well as positive changes in anxiety and depression.5 Group-based mindfulness cognitive behavioral therapy in women with sexual interest and arousal disorder have shown an improvement in sexual desire, distress, and function measures.6-8
 
 
 
 We expect that we will be able to recruit, enroll and retain females living with anorgasmia into a virtual, group-based mindfulness intervention.
 
 
 
 Subjects were recruited using social media and flyers for self-referral and physician-referral methods. The study enrolled 10 females with self-reported lifelong anorgasmia with an average age of 39 years (±10.4), 90% white, 10% black. All subjects reported being non-Hispanic or Latina, identified as straight, and in monogamous relationships. Menopause status varied among subjects. We conducted an 8-week virtual, group mindfulness series incorporating mindfulness education, writing exercises, opportunities for meditation practice, with time for discussion and sharing. Subjects received daily reminders to listen to prescribed mindfulness meditations at home. Meditation usage was tracked using REDCap including which recording was listened to, session duration, and session frequency.
 
 
 
 Of 26 women screened, 10 enrolled in the study. Two had scheduling conflicts, 2 never attended a session, and 6 attended at least four sessions. Of these, the average attendance was 75% during each session and each subject attending an average of 6 sessions. Subjects were asked to rate (0-10, where “0” is Not at all Appropriate and “10” is Very Appropriate) the degree to which group and virtual formats were appropriate (8.33 ±1.89, 8.17±2.62), and the weekly meeting schedule (7.33 ±2.56). At-home recording platform was deemed easy to use (8.83 ±1.67), however, subjects felt the recordings were moderately beneficial and convenient (6.33 ±1.11 and 5.17 ±1.86). Mindfulness meditations were listened to 173 times, with a subject mean of 28.8 (±20.7) times. When session duration was adjusted for excessive time, the mean mindfulness duration was 15.5 (±9.2) minutes. With a sample of only 8 subjects, we cautioned against reporting any pre-to-post analyses for the Female Sexual Function Index, the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale-10, PROMIS-Sexual Function, PROMIS-Depression SF or PROMIS-Anxiety SF. Completion rates at both the pre- and post- time points was 75%.
 
 
 
 The virtual group-based mindfulness intervention was generally perceived to be appropriate and easy to use for females presenting with anorgasmia and enabled participation from all over the US. With this success, future research with a larger sample size and a comparison group are warranted.

However, studies assessing physiological reactions to social rejection are rare and results of these studies were found to be ambiguous. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine and specify physiological effects of social rejection. Methods: Participants (n = 50) were assigned to either a social exclusion or inclusion condition of a virtual ball-tossing game (Cyberball). Immediate and delayed physiological [skin conductance level (SCL) and heart rate] reactions were recorded. In addition, subjects reported levels of affect, emotional states, and fundamental needs. Results: Subjects who were socially rejected showed increased heart rates. However, social rejection had no effect on subjects' SCLs. Both conditions showed heightened arousal on this measurement. Furthermore, psychological consequences of social rejection indicated the validity of the paradigm. Conclusions: Our results reveal that social rejection evokes an immediate physiological reaction. Accelerated heart rates indicate that behavior activation rather than inhibition is associated with socially threatening events. In addition, results revealed gender-specific response patterns suggesting that sample characteristics such as differences in gender may account for ambiguous findings of physiological reactions to social rejection.",2014.0,84.0,48.0,"{'volume': '5', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Iffland2014RapidHB,\n author = {Benjamin Iffland and L.

A cultural perspective suggests, however, that these consequences may be moderated by cultural values. We tested this hypothesis in a two-part study, and found that, for Americans holding Western-European values, habitual suppression was associated with self-protective goals and negative emotion. In addition, experimentally elicited suppression resulted in reduced interpersonal responsiveness during face-to-face interaction, along with negative partner-perceptions and hostile behavior. These deleterious effects were reduced when individuals with more Asian values suppressed, and these reductions were mediated by cultural differences in the responsiveness of the suppressors.

293,1c2d4de67b73c562490b8b04aa8fe6ea3a0600d1,Virtual Reality as Pedagogical Tool to Enhance Experiential Learning: A Systematic Literature Review,"Since half of the century, technology has dominated the modern era. The rapid advancement of technology has reached generating artificial intelligence and artificial realities. So, virtual reality is an emerging technology and is applicable in education as well. Virtual reality is a computer-generated simulation, where people can interact within an artificial environment. Moreover, in an educational setting, such an environment provides students with a chance to get experiential learning. This paper has a systematic literature review on emerging technologies, such as virtual reality as a pedagogical tool for enhancing students’ experiential learning. This review aims to explore and understand the effect of virtual reality on students’ experiential learning by reviewing twenty-six selected articles. The selected studies have followed various methodologies and are from different contexts. This review study aims to present a systematic literature review for understanding and exploring the effect of virtual reality as a pedagogical tool for enhancing students’ experiential learning. Nine themes were identified, which are (a) virtual reality as pedagogical tool, (b) virtual reality as emerging educational technology tool, (c) virtual reality as digital transformation, (d) virtual reality as teaching-learning model, (e) virtual reality as architectural pedagogy, (f) virtual reality for communication skills, (g) virtual reality for reading and writing skills, (h) virtual reality for social learning, and (i) virtual reality for experiential learning. Thus, it is found that virtual reality is used as a pedagogical tool for various subject areas for encouraging involvement. It is helpful in medical, engineering, language, and social learning, as it provides a chance to get first-hand experience of the environment. Also, it helps learners to engage in a presented virtual environment and experience the sense of presence in it and enhances students’ experiential learning. Therefore, this review found virtual reality as an essential pedagogical tool for strengthening students’ experiential learning.",2021.0,106.0,20.0,{'name': 'Education Research International'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Asad2021VirtualRA,\n author = {M.

295,1c749321b318d9eabf07ceddd25e14bd3f1e7f08,Applying planning to interactive storytelling: Narrative control using state constraints,"We have seen ten years of the application of AI planning to the problem of narrative generation in Interactive Storytelling (IS). In that time planning has emerged as the dominant technology and has featured in a number of prototype systems. Nevertheless key issues remain, such as how best to control the shape of the narrative that is generated (e.g., by using narrative control knowledge, i.e., knowledge about narrative features that enhance user experience) and also how best to provide support for real-time interactive performance in order to scale up to more realistic sized systems. Recent progress in planning technology has opened up new avenues for IS and we have developed a novel approach to narrative generation that builds on this. Our approach is to specify narrative control knowledge for a given story world using state trajectory constraints and then to treat these state constraints as landmarks and to use them to decompose narrative generation in order to address scalability issues and the goal of real-time performance in larger story domains. This approach to narrative generation is fully implemented in an interactive narrative based on the “Merchant of Venice.” The contribution of the work lies both in our novel use of state constraints to specify narrative control knowledge for interactive storytelling and also our development of an approach to narrative generation that exploits such constraints. In the article we show how the use of state constraints can provide a unified perspective on important problems faced in IS.",2010.0,39.0,167.0,"{'volume': '1', 'pages': '10:1-10:21', 'name': 'ACM Trans.

296,1cd5d7638efe1192779c19e7e3cc6451255be41d,Brain activity during transient sadness and happiness in healthy women.,"OBJECTIVE
The specific brain regions involved in the normal emotional states of transient sadness or happiness are poorly understood. The authors therefore sought to determine if H2(15)O positron emission tomography (PET) might demonstrate changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) associated with transient sadness or happiness in healthy adult women.


METHOD
Eleven healthy and never mentally ill adult women were scanned, by using PET and H2(15)O, during happy, sad, and neutral states induced by recalling affect-appropriate life events and looking at happy, sad, or neutral human faces.


RESULTS
Compared to the neutral condition, transient sadness significantly activated bilateral limbic and paralimbic structures (cingulate, medial prefrontal, and mesial temporal cortex), as well as brainstem, thalamus, and caudate/putamen. In contrast, transient happiness had no areas of significantly increased activity but was associated with significant and widespread reductions in cortical rCBF, especially in the right prefrontal and bilateral temporal-parietal regions.


CONCLUSIONS
Transient sadness and happiness in healthy volunteer women are accompanied by significant changes in regional brain activity in the limbic system, as well as other brain regions. Transient sadness and happiness affect different brain regions in divergent directions and are not merely opposite activity in identical brain regions. These findings have implications for understanding the neural substrates of both normal and pathological emotion.",1995.0,1.0,764.0,"{'volume': '152 3', 'pages': '\n          341-51\n        ', 'name': 'The American journal of psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{George1995BrainAD,\n author = {M.

Among these, an emerging approach is the use of virtual reality (VR) within exposure-based protocols for anxiety disorders, and in particular posttraumatic stress disorder. However, no systematically tested VR protocols are available for the management of psychological stress. Objective Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy of a new technological paradigm, Interreality, for the management and prevention of psychological stress. The main feature of Interreality is a twofold link between the virtual and the real world achieved through experiential virtual scenarios (fully controlled by the therapist, used to learn coping skills and improve self-efficacy) with real-time monitoring and support (identifying critical situations and assessing clinical change) using advanced technologies (virtual worlds, wearable biosensors, and smartphones). Methods The study was designed as a block randomized controlled trial involving 121 participants recruited from two different worker populations—teachers and nurses—that are highly exposed to psychological stress. Participants were a sample of teachers recruited in Milan (Block 1: n=61) and a sample of nurses recruited in Messina, Italy (Block 2: n=60). Participants within each block were randomly assigned to the (1) Experimental Group (EG): n=40; B1=20, B2=20, which received a 5-week treatment based on the Interreality paradigm; (2) Control Group (CG): n=42; B1=22, B2=20, which received a 5-week traditional stress management training based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); and (3) the Wait-List group (WL): n=39, B1=19, B2=20, which was reassessed and compared with the two other groups 5 weeks after the initial evaluation. Results Although both treatments were able to significantly reduce perceived stress better than WL, only EG participants reported a significant reduction (EG=12% vs CG=0.5%) in chronic “trait” anxiety. A similar pattern was found for coping skills: both treatments were able to significantly increase most coping skills, but only EG participants reported a significant increase (EG=14% vs CG=0.3%) in the Emotional Support skill. Conclusions Our findings provide initial evidence that the Interreality protocol yields better outcomes than the traditionally accepted gold standard for psychological stress treatment: CBT. Consequently, these findings constitute a sound foundation and rationale for the importance of continuing future research in technology-enhanced protocols for psychological stress management.

Social distancing policies, mandatory lockdowns, isolation periods, and anxiety of getting sick, along with the suspension of productive activity, loss of income, and fear of the future, jointly influence the mental health of citizens and workers. Workplace aspects can play a crucial role on moderating or worsening mental health of people facing this pandemic scenario. The purpose of this literature review is to deepen the psychological aspects linked to workplace factors, following the epidemic rise of COVID-19, in order to address upcoming psychological critical issues in the workplaces. We performed a literature search using Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus, selecting papers focusing on workers’ psychological problems that can be related to the workplace during the pandemic. Thirty-five articles were included. Mental issues related to the health emergency, such as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and sleep disorders are more likely to affect healthcare workers, especially those on the frontline, migrant workers, and workers in contact with the public. Job insecurity, long periods of isolation, and uncertainty of the future worsen the psychological condition, especially in younger people and in those with a higher educational background. Multiple organizational and work-related interventions can mitigate this scenario, such as the improvement of workplace infrastructures, the adoption of correct and shared anti-contagion measures, including regular personal protective equipment (PPE) supply, and the implementation of resilience training programs. This review sets the basis for a better understanding of the psychological conditions of workers during the pandemic, integrating individual and social perspectives, and providing insight into possible individual, social, and occupational approaches to this “psychological pandemic”.",2020.0,86.0,443.0,"{'volume': '17', 'name': 'International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Giorgi2020COVID19RelatedMH,\n author = {Gabriele Giorgi and L.

309,1f361925106f8039b50780a49a81b5f7ef93dd23,22 Virtual Reality and Prosocial Behavior,"People have long been intrigued by the notion of a virtual space that could offer an escape from reality to new sensory experiences. As early as 1965, Sutherland envisioned that the ‘ultimate display’ would enable users to actively interact with the virtual space as if it were real, giving them “a chance to gain familiarity with concepts not realizable in the physical world” (Sutherland, 1965, p. 506). William Gibson appears to have shared this vision when coining the term ‘cyberspace’ in his 1984 novel Neuromancer, defining it as “a consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts · · · ” (p. 51). While the image may have seemed farfetched at the time, the mounting popularity of home video game consoles, massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs), and massive open online courses (MOOCs) all demonstrate that virtual reality (VR) is an increasingly integral component of our everyday lives. Despite some romanticized versions of VR, much of the previous literature focused on its dangers. Early studies voiced concerns about how individuals would no longer be able to receive true emotional and social support online (e.g., Kraut et al., 1998) and more recent research focused on Internet addiction (e.g., Lam et al., 2009) as well as the antisocial effects of playing violent games (e.g., Bartholow, Bushman, & Sestir, 2006). Overall, the results suggest that spending extensive amounts of time in VR can result in apathetic or even violent attitudes and behavior toward others. Indeed, early conversations between Jaron Lanier, one of the pioneers of the technology, and William Gibson, who consulted Lanier while writing his manifesto, focused on this tension. Lanier envisioned prosocial uses for the technology he championed, but Gibson felt compelled to write about the less wholesome applications, saying, “Jaron, I tried. But it’s coming out dark” (Lanier, 2013, p. 329). In terms of academic research, there is a group of scholars who focus on a more positive outlook; the unique affordances of virtual environments actually promote prosocial behavior when leveraged. Recent developments show that even brief virtual interventions can increase environmental awareness, reduce racial bias, and enhance general altruistic behavior. These interventions have been found to be especially powerful when the user feels fully immersed in the virtual world. With these findings in mind, the present chapter will outline the characteristics and strengths of virtual environments. It will then describe the malleable nature of prosocial behavior and explain how the",2018.0,58.0,4.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Shriram201822VR,\n author = {K. Shriram and Soo Youn Oh and J.

It is further postulated that eye-contact is linked to affiliative motivation, and that approach and avoidance forces produce an equilibrium level of physical proximity, eyecontact and other aspects of intimacy. If one of these is disturbed, compensatory changes may occur along the other dimensions. Experiments are reported which suggest that people move towards an equilibrium distance, and adopt a particular level of eye-contact. As predicted, there was less eyecontact and glances were shorter, the closer two subjects were placed together (where one member of each pair was a confederate who gazed continuously at the other). The effect was greatest for opposite-sex pairs.

A previous case study has demonstrated that the integrity of both amygdalae is essential to regulate interpersonal distances. Despite unilateral lesion to the amygdala, as to other sectors of the medial temporal cortex, are known to also affect social behavior, their role in the regulation of interpersonal distances has never been investigated. Here, we sought to fill this gap by testing three patients with unilateral temporal lesions following surgical resections, including one patient with a lesion mainly centered on the amygdala and two with lesions to adjacent medial temporal cortex, on two versions of the stop distance paradigm (i.e. in a virtual reality environment and in a real setting). Our results showed that all three patients set shorter interpersonal distances compared to neurotypical controls. In addition, compared to controls, none of the patients adjusted such physical distances depending on facial emotional expressions, despite they preserved ability to categorize them. Finally, patients' heart rate responses differed from controls when viewing approaching faces. Our findings bring compelling evidence that unilateral lesions within the medial temporal cortex, not necessarily restricted to the amygdala, are sufficient to alter interpersonal distance, thus shedding new light on the neural circuitry regulating distance in social interactions.",2022.0,0.0,0.0,"{'name': 'Cerebral Cortex Communications', 'volume': '3'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Dureux2022PersonalSR,\n author = {A.

To assess disordered online social networking use via modified diagnostic criteria for substance dependence, and to examine its association with difficulties with emotion regulation and substance use.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional survey study targeting undergraduate students. Associations between disordered online social networking use, internet addiction, deficits in emotion regulation and alcohol use problems were examined using univariate and multivariate analyses of covariance.


SETTING
A large University in the Northeastern United States.


PARTICIPANTS
Undergraduate students (n = 253, 62.8% female, 60.9% white, age mean = 19.68, standard deviation = 2.85), largely representative of the target population. The response rate was 100%.


MEASUREMENTS
Disordered online social networking use, determined via modified measures of alcohol abuse and dependence, including DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence, the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale and the Cut-down, Annoyed, Guilt, Eye-opener (CAGE) screen, along with the Young Internet Addiction Test, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II, White Bear Suppression Inventory and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale.


FINDINGS
Disordered online social networking use was present in 9.7% [n = 23; 95% confidence interval (5.9, 13.4)] of the sample surveyed, and significantly and positively associated with scores on the Young Internet Addiction Test (P < 0.001), greater difficulties with emotion regulation (P = 0.003) and problem drinking (P = 0.03).


CONCLUSIONS
The use of online social networking sites is potentially addictive. Modified measures of substance abuse and dependence are suitable in assessing disordered online social networking use. Disordered online social networking use seems to arise as part of a cluster of symptoms of poor emotion regulation skills and heightened susceptibility to both substance and non-substance addiction.",2014.0,60.0,302.0,"{'volume': '109 12', 'pages': '\n          2079-88\n        ', 'name': 'Addiction'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hormes2014CravingFB,\n author = {J.

315,1f73b289b36d11e667a6dee34ec87018634622e9,International Journal of Medical Informatics,"Background: Self-care management is becoming an important part of care for chronic patients. However, various kinds of self-management educational materials which government or healthcare institutions provide for patients may not achieve the expected outcome. One of the critical reasons affecting patients’ use intention could be patients’ perceived information overload regarding the self-management educational materials. Purpose: This study proposed an extended model of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), which incorporated perceived information overload, to explore if information overload will prevent chronic patients from reading educational materials for self-care management. The independent variables are attitude, subject norm, perceived behavior control and perceived information overload while the dependent variable is behavior intention to use the self-management educational materials. Perceived information overload is also referred to as an antecedent variable which may has impacts on attitude and perceived behavior control. Methods: The cross-sectional study interviewed newly diagnosed chronic patients with coronary artery disease, who are the potential users of the self-management educational materials, in a medical center in Taiwan. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics of the basic information distribution of the respondents, and structural equation modeling to study the reliability and validity for testing hypotheses. Results: A total of 110 respondents were enrolled in this study and successful interview data were collected from 106 respondents. The result indicates that the patients’ perceived information overload of self-management educational materials was validated to have impacts on attitude and perceived behavioral control constructs of the TPB as well as contributing a direct impact on patients’ intentions to use self-management educational materials. Besides, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control constructs were validated to have signiﬁcant impacts on behavioral intentions, whereas the attitude construct was not. Finally, the relationships between information overload and attitude, information overload and intention, subjective norm and intention, as well as perceived behavioral control and intention varied signiﬁcantly between highly-and less-educated respondents. Differing self-management educational materials for respondents of various educational levels could be formulated to substantially boost the use of self-management educational materials. Conclusions: This study demonstrated a comprehensive framework, which extended perceived information overload into the TPB model, to predict patients’ behavioral intention of using self-management educational materials. We expect the results of this study will provide useful insights for studying self-management educational materials usage and information overload from the perspectives of academia, governments, and healthcare providers. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",2016.0,40.0,33.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Liua2016InternationalJO,\n author = {hung-Feng Liua and Kuang-Ming Kuob},\n title = {International Journal of Medical Informatics},\n year = {2016}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2264041633', 'name': 'hung-Feng Liua'}, {'authorId': '2264050102', 'name': 'Kuang-Ming Kuob'}]"

However, most users will only buy cheap virtual gifts in live streaming, therefore exploring how to promote users to buy expensive virtual gifts is a valuable topic in live commerce research. Based on social presence theory and information overload theory, this study used the PLS-SEM method to investigate the factors influencing live streaming users to shift from buying cheap virtual gifts to buying expensive virtual gifts, and analyzed the moderating role of information overload in these relationships. The results show that immediate interaction anxiety, verbal intimacy, and virtual physical intimacy positively influence users’ shift to purchasing expensive virtual gifts, and that perceived network size and perceived financial risk are negative factors in users’ shift to purchasing expensive virtual gifts. Information overload has a moderating role in the relationship between immediate interaction anxiety and switch intention, and it also plays a moderating role in the relationship between perceived network size and perceived financial risk on users’ switch intention.",2022.0,82.0,1.0,"{'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology', 'volume': '13'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cao2022InfluencingFO,\n author = {Junwei Cao and Guihua Zhang and Dong Liu and Meng Shang},\n booktitle = {Frontiers in Psychology},\n journal = {Frontiers in Psychology},\n title = {Influencing factors of users’ shift to buying expensive virtual gifts in live streaming: Empirical evidence from China},\n volume = {13},\n year = {2022}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2152323793', 'name': 'Junwei Cao'}, {'authorId': '2116300615', 'name': 'Guihua Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2152510073', 'name': 'Dong Liu'}, {'authorId': '2128246547', 'name': 'Meng Shang'}]"

Despite evidence of deficits in executive functions in individuals with ASD, little is known about executive dysfunctions as candidate cognitive endophenotypes for ASD. In this study, we investigated executive functions in youths with ASD, their unaffected siblings and typically developing controls (TDC). Methods We recruited 240 youths with a clinical diagnosis of ASD (aged 6–18 years), 147 unaffected siblings of ASD youths, and 240 TDC youths. TDC youths were recruited based on the age and sex distribution of the ASD youths. Participants were assessed using the verbal Digit Span test and four executive function tasks from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, including Intra-dimensional/Extra-dimensional Shift (I/ED), Spatial Span (SSP), Spatial Working Memory (SWM), and Stocking of Cambridge (SoC). Results ASD youths, relative to TDC, performed significantly worse in executive function tasks assessing verbal working memory (forward and backward digit span), set-shifting (I/ED), visuospatial working memory (SSP, SWM), and planning/problem solving (SoC). Furthermore, unaffected siblings, relative to TDC, performed worse in forward and backward digit recalls and made more errors in SWM. These results were independent of the effects of age, sex, IQ, and symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Conclusions Our findings support impaired executive functions in youths with ASD. However, unaffected siblings were mostly unimpaired except in the areas of verbal and spatial working memory, which may be potential cognitive endophenotypes for ASD.",2020.0,80.0,17.0,"{'volume': '51', 'pages': '2571 - 2580', 'name': 'Psychological Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Seng2020ExecutiveFI,\n author = {Guan-Jye Seng and W.

Patients have intact cognitive abilities but are impaired in making everyday decisions. Here we review anatomical, neuropsychological, and neurophysiological evidence to determine the neuronal mechanisms that might underlie these impairments. We suggest that OFC plays a key role in processing reward: It integrates multiple sources of information regarding the reward outcome to derive a value signal. In effect, OFC calculates how rewarding a reward is. This value signal can then be held in working memory where it can be used by lateral prefrontal cortex to plan and organize behavior toward obtaining the outcome, and by medial prefrontal cortex to evaluate the overall action in terms of its success and the effort that was required. Thus, acting together, these prefrontal areas can ensure that our behavior is most efficiently directed towards satisfying our needs.",2007.0,115.0,787.0,"{'volume': '30', 'pages': '\n          31-56\n        ', 'name': 'Annual review of neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wallis2007OrbitofrontalCA,\n author = {J.

Until now to monitor these phases clinicians and researchers have used several referential process computerized linguistic measures, which however need the sessions verbatim transcription. In order to have a less time-consuming method we developed and tested a therapist self-report questionnaire measuring the referential process phases. Method We asked eight psychotherapists in a first study and nine psychotherapists in a second study to complete the Referential Process Post-session Scale – Therapist version (RPPS-T) just after the end of their sessions. In a third study we transcribed 29 sessions conducted by three psychotherapists to calculate the correlations between the RPPS-T scores and the computerized linguistic measures of the referential process calculated on the session transcripts. Results In the first study we collected 105 evaluations regarding 29 patients and an exploratory factor analysis revealed a four-factor pattern consistent with the hypothesized constructs. The analysis reduced the initial pool of 42 items to 12. In the second study 130 sessions with 25 different patients have been evaluated on the shortened version of the RPPS-T and a confirmatory factor analysis found that the four-factor model satisfactorily fitted the new data as well. In the third study we found that the factors of RPPS-T regarding the symbolizing phase correlated with the corresponding computerized linguistic measures calculated on the session transcripts.

Negative affect is an important psychological factor in the promotion and maintenance of cigarette smoking, though the underlying factors that account for this relationship remain to be determined. One possible mechanism may be smokers' emotion regulation strategies. Preliminary research among adolescents and young adults suggests that greater utilization of expressive suppression versus cognitive reappraisal is associated with higher rates of smoking initiation. There is limited research, however, on the role of emotion regulation strategies in smoking maintenance in adult smokers.


METHODS
Data from participants in a laboratory study (N = 121) were used to examine whether utilization of cognitive reappraisal and/or expressive suppression were related to smoking characteristics and subjective (i.e., mood, urge to smoke ratings) and behavioral reactions (i.e., Emotional Stroop Task performance, smoking behavior) to a mood induction procedure. Data were evaluated for the full sample and subsample who endorsed current depressive symptoms (n = 46).


RESULTS
Frequent reappraisal was associated with weaker expectancies that smoking alleviates unpleasant feelings, greater positive mood, and fewer depressive symptoms. In contrast, frequent suppression was related to longer smoking history and greater attentional bias to smoking cues on an Emotional Stroop Task. Among the depressed subsample, reappraisal moderated the effect of mood condition on smoking duration, number of cigarette puffs, and carbon monoxide boost.


CONCLUSIONS
These results provide preliminary support that emotion regulation strategies may be associated with motivational correlates of smoking as well as actual smoking behavior among depressed smokers.",2010.0,44.0,73.0,"{'volume': '12 11', 'pages': '\n          1156-61\n        ', 'name': 'Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fucito2010CognitiveRA,\n author = {L.

Consequently, tourism authorities focus much attention on the factors that could give them a competitive advantage especially in attracting repeat visitations to certain tourist destinations. The current study explores the path, environment → place attachment → revisit intention using the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) model. The study obtained 455 responses from visitors to Batam Island in Indonesia using the convenience sampling method. This led to the formulation of hypotheses using the structural equation modeling (SEM). Novel findings are revealed. Atmosphere environment has a high positive correlation with place dependence while low positive correlation with place identity, place dependence, and place social bonding. Furthermore, the cultural environment is unimportant and insignificant in predicting place attachment. Interestingly, place attachment dimensions positively support revisit intentions. Place social binding is the most crucial feature of place attachment in revisit intentions. Thus, the findings obtained from documenting the importance of social interactions in tourism destinations are invaluable to tourism authorities, tourist practitioners, and tourism management in locating and extending tourist centers by reflecting on the physical and service environmental facilities that trigger social bonding-revisit effects. The findings shape new thinking to increase tourists’ repeat visits. 摘要 在一些国家, 旅游业被认为是一个重要的经济驱动力。因此, 旅游当局非常重视能够使他们具有竞争优势的因素, 特别是在吸引某些旅游目的地的重游方面。本研究采用刺激-组织-反应(S-O-R)模型, 探索环境→依恋位置→重游意愿的影响路径。该研究采用便利抽样的方法, 从印尼巴丹岛的游客中获得了455份问卷, 并且使用结构方程模型(SEM)检验了假设。研究表明, 大气环境与地方依赖呈高度正相关, 而与地方认同、地方依赖、地方社会联系呈低度正相关。此外, 文化环境在预测地点依恋方面并不显著。有趣的是, 地方依恋维度正向支持重游意愿。地点社会联系是地点依恋影响重游意愿的最重要的特征。因此, 通过记录旅游目的地社会互动的重要性所得到的研究结果, 对于旅游当局、旅游从业者和旅游管理人员反思触发社会纽带-再访效应的物质和服务环境设施, 选址和扩增旅游中心是非常宝贵的。这些发现为增加游客的重游提供了新的思路。",2020.0,156.0,53.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '51 - 82', 'name': 'Tourism Geographies'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Isa2020TheEO,\n author = {S.

339,224c2687e9841631200d11fcf9a6b71c94ad9fee,Anxiety and the Neurobiology of Temporally Uncertain Threat Anticipation,"When extreme, anxiety—a state of distress and arousal prototypically evoked by uncertain danger—can be debilitating. Uncertain anticipation is a shared feature of situations that elicit signs and symptoms of anxiety across psychiatric disorders, species, and assays. Despite the profound significance of anxiety for human health and wellbeing, the neurobiology of uncertain-threat anticipation remains unsettled. Leveraging a paradigm adapted from animal research and optimized for fMRI signal decomposition, we examined the neural circuits engaged during the anticipation of temporally uncertain and certain threat in 99 men and women. Results revealed that the neural systems recruited by uncertain and certain threat anticipation are anatomically colocalized in frontocortical regions, extended amygdala, and periaqueductal gray. Comparison of the threat conditions demonstrated that this circuitry can be fractionated, with frontocortical regions showing relatively stronger engagement during the anticipation of uncertain threat, and the extended amygdala showing the reverse pattern. Although there is widespread agreement that the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and dorsal amygdala—the two major subdivisions of the extended amygdala—play a critical role in orchestrating adaptive responses to potential danger, their precise contributions to human anxiety have remained contentious. Follow-up analyses demonstrated that these regions show statistically indistinguishable responses to temporally uncertain and certain threat anticipation. These observations provide a framework for conceptualizing anxiety and fear, for understanding the functional neuroanatomy of threat anticipation in humans, and for accelerating the development of more effective intervention strategies for pathological anxiety. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Anxiety—an emotion prototypically associated with the anticipation of uncertain harm—has profound significance for public health, yet the underlying neurobiology remains unclear. Leveraging a novel neuroimaging paradigm in a relatively large sample, we identify a core circuit responsive to both uncertain and certain threat anticipation, and show that this circuitry can be fractionated into subdivisions with a bias for one kind of threat or the other. The extended amygdala occupies center stage in neuropsychiatric models of anxiety, but its functional architecture has remained contentious. Here we demonstrate that its major subdivisions show statistically indistinguishable responses to temporally uncertain and certain threat. Collectively, these observations indicate the need to revise how we think about the neurobiology of anxiety and fear.",2020.0,173.0,50.0,"{'volume': '40', 'pages': '7949 - 7964', 'name': 'The Journal of Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hur2020AnxietyAT,\n author = {Juyoen Hur and Jason F.

A cross-cultural comparison between European Americans and Hong Kong Chinese.,"The habitual use of expressive suppression as an emotion regulation strategy has been consistently linked to adverse outcomes in a number of domains, including psychological functioning. The present study aimed to uncover whether the suppression-health relationship is dependent on cultural context, given differing cultural norms surrounding the value of suppressing emotional displays. We hypothesized that the negative associations between suppression and psychological functioning seen in European Americans would not be seen among members of East Asian cultures, in which emotional restraint is relatively encouraged over emotional expression. To test this hypothesis, we asked 71 European American students and 100 Chinese students from Hong Kong to report on their use of expressive suppression, life satisfaction, and depressed mood. A moderation analysis revealed that expressive suppression was associated with adverse psychological functioning for European Americans, but not for Chinese participants.

Importantly, sustained attention undergoes significant development over the early childhood period. Yet, how sustained attention fluctuates over time on task has not been clearly outlined, particularly in young children. In this study, we provide a first test of whether the pupillary response can be used as an indicator of moment-to-moment sustained attention over time on task in young children. Children aged 5 to 7 years (N = 41) completed a psychomotor vigilance task, where they were asked to press a button as fast as possible at the onset of a target stimulus. We measured reaction times over the course of the task, pupil size prior to target onset (baseline pupil size), and pupil size in response to target onset (task-evoked pupil size). The results showed a stereotypical vigilance decrement in children’s response times: as time on task increased, reaction times increased. Critically, children’s task-evoked pupil size decreased over time on task, while no such change was present in baseline pupil size. These results suggest that young children’s waning sustained attention may be linked to a decrease in alertness while overall arousal is maintained. We discuss the importance of leveraging pupillometry to understand the mechanisms of sustained attention over individuals and development.",2022.0,96.0,1.0,"{'volume': '10', 'name': 'Journal of Intelligence'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Benitez2022PupillometryAA,\n author = {Viridiana L.

Most evidence-based psychological therapies target symptoms of heightened negative affect (e.g., negative inferential style) instead of deficits in positive affect (e.g., attenuated reward response) and typically show little benefit for anhedonia. Viewing positive scenes through virtual reality (VR) has been shown to increase positive affect and holds great promise for addressing anhedonic symptoms. In this pilot study, six participants with clinically significant depression completed 13 sessions of exposure to positive scenes in a controlled VR environment. Significant decreases were found in self-reported anhedonia, depression, anxiety, and impairments in functioning from baseline to 1-month follow-up.

348,22d2b91039160a6b9c2abbd54cc4c6f493ab4459,Physical Versus Virtual Reality–Based Calm Rooms for Psychiatric Inpatients: Quasi-Randomized Trial,"Background Interest in sensory rooms or so-called “calm rooms” in psychiatric inpatient care has increased significantly. In a hospital setting, their purpose is to introduce a relaxing environment to increase well-being as well as to decrease anxiety and aggressive behaviors. Calm rooms can also be used as a tool to provide self-help through a convenient environment for the patients and, at the same time, strengthen the therapeutic relationship between the patient and the professional. Recent developments in virtual reality (VR) have made virtual calm rooms possible, but these have not yet been evaluated in psychiatric inpatient care. Objective This study aimed to compare the effects of VR and physical calm rooms on self-reported well-being and physiological markers of arousal. Methods The study was conducted in 2 inpatient psychiatric wards specializing in bipolar disorder from March 2019 to February 2021. Patients who were already admitted were asked if they were interested in using a calm room and willing to provide ratings. This study relied on the quasi-randomized allocation of patients to the wards, which either had a physical or VR calm room. Self-assessment scales (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale-Self Assessment [MADRS-S], Beck Anxiety Scale, and Clinical Global Impression) were used to determine the participants' baseline level of depressive and anxiety symptoms before their use of the physical or VR calm room. The study determined the state of well-being measured using an 11-point visual analog scale (VAS) as well as arousal measured by blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and heart rate before and after the use of the calm rooms. The primary end point was self-reported well-being using the VAS. Results A total of 60 participants were included—40 used the VR calm room and 20 used the physical calm room. The mean age of participants was 39 years and the majority were women (35/60, 58%). Analysis of VAS measurement showed improved well-being at the group level from before to after the intervention (P<.05), with no statistically significant difference in effects between the 2 different interventions. Effects were not moderated by baseline depression levels (dichotomized as MADRS-S >20 or ≤20) despite an overall difference in reported well-being between subgroups. Conclusions Although the power in this study was low, the findings of this first study indicate comparable effects with respect to well-being and arousal of a VR calm room and a physical calm room. This suggests that a VR calm room can be a viable alternative when the use of a physical calm room is not an option for logistic or other reasons.

349,22ecf2f35a375fa94676d209b65496711d5cd6e6,What Other Countries Can Learn From Italy During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"In the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Italy has been hit very hard,1 with 110 574 documented cases and 13 155 documented deaths related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection as of April 1, 2020. The number of cases and deaths cannot be explained simply because of the epidemic starting in Italy earlier compared with other countries besides China. It is important to understand why death rates were so high in Italy to learn how to best prepare and how to plan for optimal actions in other countries. Some contributing factors may be immutable (eg, age structure of the population), but even these need to be laid out carefully in preparedness assessments. Some other contributing factors are potentially modifiable. Some factors pertain to demographics and background disease in the population. Italy has the most elderly population in Europe and the second most elderly population in the world after Japan. COVID-19 has a strong age dependence for the severity of the infection and the risk of death. The median age of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 who are dying in Italy has been 80 years, and the average age of patients requiring critical care support has been 67 years. Moreover, COVID-19 morbidity and mortality is strongly dependent on the presence of concomitant serious diseases, and Italy has a high proportion of patients with history of smoking and high rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and ischemic heart disease.2 The corollary is that preparedness for needs of intensive care unit (ICU) beds and estimates of expected deaths should consider the age structure and chronic diseases of the population served by each health care system. Taking this adjustment into account, burden of disease may be expected to be much less in most areas in the United States, with variability across states and hospital catchment areas. For example, the proportion of the population older than 65 years is 9.5% in Alaska as compared with 19.1% in Florida and 23.1% in Italy. A second set of factors in Italy is the increased burden of cases that presented themselves to the health care system. The proportion of people infected must have been very high in specific areas that were highly affected. In the town of Vò, all 3300 residents were tested the day the first case was detected in the third week of February, and 3% were found to be infected.3 Following aggressive testing, the epidemic was extinguished. However, elsewhere in Italy, it is likely that the prevalence of infection was several times higher in the absence of effective public health intervention. For example, it is likely that the health care system was overwhelmed in Bergamo owing to massive viral transmission during the Champions League match on February 19, 2020 (Atalanta vs Valencia), where a third of the population of Bergamo attended and continued celebrations overnight. Italian life is famous for its socialization and frequent congregations and clustering. It is possible also that in early stages, there was not much adoption of standard hygienic measures, and instructions to stay at home proved difficult to accept, with many complaints registered with the police.4 Accordingly, a higher level of preparedness should be considered for areas where mass gatherings have occurred or where there is extensive social intermingling. A third set of factors pertains to the standard capacity of the health care system and decisions made during hospital management of the presenting cases. Italy has a highly competent state-run health care system, but it has only a modest number of ICU beds and very few subintensive care beds. Overall, 5090 ICU beds (8.4 per 100 000 population) are available in Italy, and 2601 beds in coronary care units (4.3 per 100 000 population),5 as opposed to much higher numbers (36 ICU beds per 100 000 population) in the United States. Given the little experience in dealing with the new virus, it is unavoidable that some strategic mistakes were made about which patients should be hospitalized. In the winter, hospitals tend to run close to full capacity, with 87% average occupancy in Italy during the flu season. Apparently, many patients with relatively modest symptoms were admitted; by the time more patients with severe cases started to arrive, there were limited reserves. Hospital overcrowding may also explain the high infection rate of medical personnel. As of March 30, 2020, 8920 medical personnel had been found to be infected in Italy,6 leading to further loss of capacity for hospitals to respond. Moreover, early infection of medical personnel led to the spread of the infection to other patients within hospitals. In Lombardy, SARS-CoV-2 became largely a nosocomial infection. Nine percent of infections in Italy occurred among health care personnel.6 Characteristically, the first patient with COVID-19 visited the emergency department twice, thus exposing all of the personnel and patients in that area before the infection was recognized. Italy is a decentralized country; thus, preparedness and containment may have been hampered. There was a delay from the first case detection (February 21, 2020) to the first containment decree from the government that closed the relevant villages 3 days later. The lessons relevant to other countries are the need to (1) avoid bringing patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection to the hospital, except when they clearly require hospital care; (2) maintain strict hygienic procedures in the hospital environment; and (3) act swiftly in VIEWPOINT",2020.0,9.0,286.0,{'name': 'JAMA internal medicine'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Boccia2020WhatOC,\n author = {S.

To answer this question, a meta-review was conducted to assess the meta-analyses and systematic and narrative reviews published in this field in the last twenty-two months. Twenty-five different articles demonstrated the clinical potential of this technology in both the diagnosis and the treatment of mental health disorders: VR compares favorably to existing treatments in anxiety disorders, eating and weight disorders, and pain management, with long-term effects that generalize to the real world. But why is VR so effective? Here, the following answer is suggested: VR shares with the brain the same basic mechanism: embodied simulations. According to neuroscience, to regulate and control the body in the world effectively, the brain creates an embodied simulation of the body in the world used to represent and predict actions, concepts, and emotions. VR works in a similar way: the VR experience tries to predict the sensory consequences of an individual's movements, providing to him/her the same scene he/she will see in the real world. To achieve this, the VR system, like the brain, maintains a model (simulation) of the body and the space around it. If the presence in the body is the outcome of different embodied simulations, concepts are embodied simulations, and VR is an embodied technology, this suggests a new clinical approach discussed in this article: the possibility of altering the experience of the body and facilitating cognitive modeling/change by designing targeted virtual environments able to simulate both the external and the internal world/body.",2019.0,169.0,249.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '82 - 96', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology, Behavior and Social Networking'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Riva2019NeuroscienceOV,\n author = {G.

Previous research has suggested that emotional regulation (ER) and emotional dysregulation (ED) may be factors which are correlated with symptom severity and maintenance of TR-PTSD. This embedded mixed-methods pilot study (n=9) sought to explore the impact of 3MDR on ER and ED of MMs and Veterans. Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale (DERS-18) data was collected at baseline, prior to each session, and at 1 week, 1 month and 3 months post-intervention and analyzed using a Wilcoxon signed-ranks test. Qualitative data collected from sessions, debriefs, and follow-up interviews were transcribed and descriptively analyzed. Results demonstrated statistically significant decreases in DERS-18 scores from pre-intervention to post-intervention at each timepoint. Qualitatively, participants perceived improvements in ER within specified DERS-18 domains. We describe how 3MDR’s unique and novel approach may address ED through cognitive-motor stimulation, narration, divergent thinking, reappraisal of aversive stimuli, dual-task processing, and reconsolidation of traumatic memories.

The current study assesses rates of mental health outcomes in the Italian general population three to 4 weeks into lockdown measures and explores the impact of COVID-19 related potential risk factors. Methods A web-based survey spread throughout the internet between March 27th and April 6th 2020. Eighteen thousand one hundred forty-seven individuals completed the questionnaire, 79.6% women. Selected outcomes were post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), depression, anxiety, insomnia, perceived stress, and adjustment disorder symptoms (ADS). Seemingly unrelated logistic regression analysis was performed to identify COVID-19 related risk factors. Results Endorsement rates for PTSS were 6,604 (37%), 3,084 (17.3%) for depression, 3,700 (20.8%) for anxiety, 1,301 (7.3%) for insomnia, 3,895 (21.8%) for high perceived stress and 4,092 (22.9%) for adjustment disorder. Being woman and younger age were associated with all of the selected outcomes. Quarantine was associated with PTSS, anxiety and ADS. Any recent COVID-related stressful life event was associated with all the selected outcomes. Discontinued working activity due to the COVID-19 was associated with all the selected outcomes, except for ADS; working more than usual was associated with PTSS, Perceived stress and ADS. Having a loved one deceased by COVID-19 was associated with PTSS, depression, perceived stress, and insomnia.

Its position as an integrated program within the SAS statistical package makes it an ideal choice for empirical researchers and applied statisticians seeking to do data reduction, management, and analysis within a single statistical package. Because the program was developed from the perspective of a “mixed” statistical model with both random and fixed effects, its syntax and programming logic may appear unfamiliar to users in education and the social and behavioral sciences who tend to express these models as multilevel or hierarchical models. The purpose of this paper is to help users familiar with fitting multilevel models using other statistical packages (e.g., HLM, MLwiN, MIXREG) add SAS PROC MIXED to their array of analytic options. The paper is written as a step-by-step tutorial that shows how to fit the two most common multilevel models: (a) school effects models, designed for data on individuals nested within naturally occurring hierarchies (e.g., students within classes); and (b) individual growth models, designed for exploring longitudinal data (on individuals) over time. The conclusion discusses how these ideas can be extended straighforwardly to the case of three level models. An appendix presents general strategies for working with multilevel data in SAS and for creating data sets at several levels.",1998.0,27.0,2940.0,"{'volume': '23', 'pages': '323 - 355', 'name': 'Journal of Educational Statistics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Singer1998UsingSP,\n author = {J.

These challenges hinder academic progress and frequently persist despite educational, behavioral, and medical interventions. An assistive smartglasses technology may aid these individuals, especially if the technology is efficacious in ecologically-valid school settings. This study explored the feasibility and efficacy of Empowered Brain, a computerized smartglasses intervention designed as a socio-emotional behavioral aid for students with ASD. Methods: This two-part six-week study involved four school children with ASD from a public elementary school. The study incorporated an initial three-week feasibility stage followed by a three-week controlled longitudinal efficacy stage. Both stages involved the use of a twice-daily socio-emotional intervention with the smartglasses. Educators completed pre-intervention and post-intervention Aberrant Behavioral Checklist (ABC) ratings at the start of the feasibility stage, and weekly during the efficacy stage. Primary outcome measures were improvements in the ABC subscales of irritability, hyperactivity, and social withdrawal. Results: Students in both feasibility and efficacy stages demonstrated improvements (decreases) in irritability, hyperactivity, and social withdrawal compared to a baseline period and control periods, respectively. Participants in the controlled efficacy stage demonstrated decreased ABC subscale scores of 90% for irritability, 41.6% for hyperactivity, and 45.6% for social withdrawal. An intervention exposure-response improvement in irritability and hyperactivity was found during the efficacy stage. Educators rated the technology as superior or vastly superior compared to other assistive technologies. Conclusion: A substantial number of school children with ASD demonstrate chronic and impairing cognitive and behavioral challenges. This study provides evidence that Empowered Brain, a smartglasses-based socio-emotional aid for autism, is both feasible and efficacious in improving symptoms of social withdrawal, irritability, and hyperactivity in students with autism. The improvement is demonstrated as part of a longitudinal school-based intervention. Further studies involving larger samples and incorporation of randomized controlled trial methodology are underway to further elucidate the impact of this technology.",2018.0,82.0,44.0,"{'volume': '8', 'name': 'Behavioral Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vahabzadeh2018ImprovedSA,\n author = {Arshya Vahabzadeh and Neha U.

Emotion recognition uses low-cost wearable electroencephalography (EEG) headsets to collect brainwave signals and interpret these signals to provide information on the mental state of a person, with the implementation of a virtual reality environment in different applications; the gap between human and computer interaction, as well as the understanding process, would shorten, providing an immediate response to an individual’s mental health. This study aims to use a virtual reality (VR) headset to induce four classes of emotions (happy, scared, calm, and bored), to collect brainwave samples using a low-cost wearable EEG headset, and to run popular classifiers to compare the most feasible ones that can be used for this particular setup. Firstly, we attempt to build an immersive VR database that is accessible to the public and that can potentially assist with emotion recognition studies using virtual reality stimuli. Secondly, we use a low-cost wearable EEG headset that is both compact and small, and can be attached to the scalp without any hindrance, allowing freedom of movement for participants to view their surroundings inside the immersive VR stimulus. Finally, we evaluate the emotion recognition system by using popular machine learning algorithms and compare them for both intra-subject and inter-subject classification. The results obtained here show that the prediction model for the four-class emotion classification performed well, including the more challenging inter-subject classification, with the support vector machine (SVM Class Weight kernel) obtaining 85.01% classification accuracy. This shows that using less electrode channels but with proper parameter tuning and selection features affects the performance of the classifications.",2022.0,54.0,21.0,"{'volume': '6', 'pages': '16', 'name': 'Big Data Cogn.

369,24867aee6927e8798cf33eec7ac0aff9846f7bef,Development and Verification of an Alcohol Craving-Induction Tool Using Virtual Reality: Craving Characteristics in Social Pressure Situation,"Alcoholism is a disease that affects parts of the brain that control emotion, decisions, and behavior. Therapy for people with alcoholism must address coping skills for facing high-risk situations. Therefore, it is important to develop tools to mimic such conditions. Cue exposure therapy (CET) provides high-risk situations during treatment, which raises the individual's ability to recognize that alcohol craving is being induced. Using CET, it is hard to simulate situations that induce alcohol craving. By contrast, virtual reality (VR) approaches can present realistic situations that cannot be experienced directly in CET. Therefore, we hypothesized that is possible to model social pressure situations using VR. We developed a VR system for inducing alcohol craving under social pressure situations and measured both the induced alcohol craving and head gaze of participants. A 2 x 2 experimental model (alcohol-related locality vs. social pressure) was designed. In situations without an avatar (no social pressure), more alcohol craving was induced if alcohol was present than if it was not. And more alcohol craving was induced in situations with an avatar (social pressure) than in situations without an avatar (no social pressure). The difference of angle between the direction of head gazing and the direction of alcohol or avatar was smaller in situations with an avatar alone (social pressure) than in situations with alcohol alone. In situations with both alcohol and an avatar, the angle between the direction of head gaze and the direction of the avatar was smaller than between the direction of head gaze and the direction of the alcohol. Considering the results, this VR system induces alcohol craving using an avatar that can express various social pressure situations.",2008.0,16.0,48.0,"{'volume': '11 3', 'pages': '\n          302-9\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology & behavior : the impact of the Internet, multimedia and virtual reality on behavior and society'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cho2008DevelopmentAV,\n author = {Sangwoo Cho and J.

These two components complement each other. When investigating teachers’ promotion of SRL, not only teacher behavior, but also teachers’ beliefs as well as their knowledge about SRL are relevant aspects to consider. Therefore, this study seeks to examine teachers’ knowledge and beliefs on promoting SRL, as well as their predictive value on teachers’ promotion of SRL in the classroom. Forty-seven primary school teachers completed questionnaires on knowledge and beliefs towards both components of the promotion of SRL: strategy instruction and a constructivist learning environment. In addition, teachers had to answer open-ended questions on their understanding of SRL, as well as their implementation of SRL in their classroom. The results show that teachers are more positive towards constructivist than towards SRL (teacher beliefs), and most teachers mentioned characteristics of constructivist learning environments, while only few teachers addressed strategy instruction when being asked about their understanding of SRL (teacher knowledge). Moreover, teacher beliefs are the only predictor for teacher behavior. The results indicate how teacher education could support teachers to learn how to promote SRL effectively.",2012.0,47.0,122.0,"{'volume': '2012', 'pages': '741713', 'name': 'Education Research International'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ewijk2012WhatTT,\n author = {C.

In the current study, we compared a brief nature-based mindfulness VR experience to a resting control condition on anxious participants. Self-reported anxiety symptoms and resting-state EEG were recorded across intervals containing quiet rest or the VR intervention. EEG activity was analyzed as a function of global power shifts in Alpha and Beta activity, and with sLORETA current source density estimates of cingulate cortex regions of interest. Results demonstrated that both a quiet rest control condition and the VR meditation significantly reduced subjective reports of anxiety and increased Alpha power. However, the VR intervention uniquely resulted in shifting proportional power from higher Beta frequencies into lower Beta frequencies, and significantly reduced broadband Beta activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. These effects are consistent with a physiological reduction of anxiety. This pilot study provides preliminary evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of VR for anxiety management and stress reduction programs.",2018.0,84.0,104.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tarrant2018VirtualRF,\n author = {J.

One such trait is positive urgency: the tendency to act rashly when experiencing extremely positive affect. This trait may be relevant for college student risky behavior, because it appears that a great deal of college student risky behavior is undertaken during periods of intensely positive mood states. To test this possibility, the authors conducted a longitudinal study designed to predict increases in risky sexual behavior and illegal drug use over the course of the first year of college (n=407). In a well-fitting structural model, positive urgency predicted increases in illegal drug use and risky sexual behavior, even after controlling for time 1 (T1) involvement in both risky behaviors, biological sex, and T1 scores on four other personality dispositions to rash action.

385,25897bc629171073a21cef5ac3871e16a428877e,Multisubject fMRI Studies and Conjunction Analyses,"In this paper we present an approach to making inferences about generic activations in groups of subjects using fMRI. In particular we suggest that activations common to all subjects reflect aspects of functional anatomy that may be ""typical"" of the population from which that group was sampled. These commonalities can be identified by a conjunction analysis of the activation effects in which the contrasts, testing for an activation, are specified separately for each subject. A conjunction is the joint refutation of multiple null hypotheses, in this instance, of no activation in any subject. The motivation behind this use of conjunctions is that fixed-effect analyses are generally more ""sensitive"" than equivalent random-effect analyses. This is because fixed-effect analyses can harness the large degrees of freedom and small scan-to-scan variability (relative to the variability in responses from subject to subject) when assessing the significance of an estimated response. The price one pays for the apparent sensitivity of fixed-effect analyses is that the ensuing inferences pertain to, and only to, the subjects studied. However, a conjunction analysis, using a fixed-effect model, allows one to infer: (i) that every subject studied activated and (ii) that at least a certain proportion of the population would have shown this effect. The second inference depends upon a meta-analytic formulation in terms of a confidence region for this proportion. This approach retains the sensitivity of fixed-effect analyses when the inference that only a substantial proportion of the population activates is sufficient.",1999.0,15.0,1102.0,"{'volume': '10', 'pages': '385-396', 'name': 'NeuroImage'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Friston1999MultisubjectFS,\n author = {Karl J.

In response, many proponents of culturalist paradigms have adopted the vernacular of ‘thick data’ to defend their vulnerable position in the marketing research field. However, thick data proselytising fails to challenge several outmoded ontological assumptions that are manifest in the big data myth and it situates socio-cultural modes of marketing thought in a counterproductive technocratic discourse. In building this argument, I first discuss the relevant historical continuities and discontinuities that have shaped the big data myth and the thick data opportunism. Next, I argue that culturally oriented marketing researchers should promote a different ontological frame— the analytics of marketplace assemblages—to address how big data, or more accurately its socio-technical infrastructure, produces new kinds of emergent and hybrid market structures, modes of social aggregation, consumption practices, and prosumptive capacities.",2019.0,181.0,31.0,"{'volume': '35', 'pages': '207 - 230', 'name': 'Journal of Marketing Management'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Thompson2019TheD,\n author = {Craig J Thompson},\n journal = {Journal of Marketing Management},\n pages = {207 - 230},\n title = {The ‘big data’ myth and the pitfalls of ‘thick data’ opportunism: on the need for a different ontology of markets and consumption},\n volume = {35},\n year = {2019}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '32115604', 'name': 'Craig J Thompson'}]"

Length of membership is proposed as a moderator between participation and the three community consequences.

Building on existing research concerning this everyday process, the authors describe the development of a theoretical classification scheme that distinguishes between the types of strategy used to achieve interpersonal affect regulation. To test the theoretical classification, the authors generated a corpus of 378 distinct strategies using self-report questionnaires and diaries completed by student and working samples. Twenty participants then performed a card-sort of the strategies. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to determine how well the theoretical classification represented spontaneous understandings of controlled interpersonal affect regulation. The final classification primarily distinguished between strategies used to improve versus those used to worsen others' affect, and between strategies that engaged the target in a situation or affective state versus relationship-oriented strategies.

The feasibility of virtual reality within an inpatient psychiatric care setting was therefore explored. Research design and methods: Eight people with dementia and 16 caregivers were recruited in January and February 2018 from a UK hospital specialising in progressive neurological conditions. A mixed methods design measured affect and behaviour using the Observed Emotion Rating Scale, Overt Aggression Scale-Modified for Neurorehabilitation and St Andrew’s Sexual Behaviour Assessment. Thematic analysis was conducted following semi-structured interviews. Caregivers who worked at the hospital supported people with dementia throughout the process and were interviewed for their views on Head Mounted Display-Virtual Reality (HMD-VR) use with people with dementia. Results HMD-VR was tried and accepted by people with dementia. Participants viewed HMD-VR positively as a ‘change in environment’ and would use it again. People with dementia experienced more pleasure during and after HMD-VR compared to before exposure, as well as increased alertness after. Three core themes emerged: ‘Virtual Reality Experiences’, ‘Impact of Virtual Reality’ and ‘Experiences within the Virtual Environment’. Caregivers discussed preconceptions about virtual reality use and how these changed. Discussion and implications: This is the first study to explore the feasibility of HMD-VR with people with mild to moderately severe dementia in hospital and found that overall HMD-VR is viable.

However, there is a scarcity of academic research on the psychological effects and mechanisms of video conferencing, and scholars need tools to understand this drastically scaled usage. The current paper presents the development and validation of the Zoom Exhaustion & Fatigue Scale (ZEF Scale). In one qualitative study, we developed a set of interview prompts based on previous work on media use. Those interviews resulted in the creation of 49 survey items that spanned several dimensions. We administered those items in a survey of 395 respondents and used factor analyses to reduce the number of items from 49 to 15, revealing five dimensions of fatigue: general, social, emotional, visual, and motivational fatigue. Finally, in a scale validation study based on 2724 respondents, we showed the reliability of the overall scale and the five factors and demonstrated scale validity in two ways. First, frequency, duration, and burstiness of Zoom meetings were associated with a higher level of fatigue. Second, fatigue was associated with negative attitudes towards the Zoom meetings.

We address these challenges by comparing spontaneous facial expressions of anger, sadness, laughter, and smiling with concurrent, “on‐line” appraisal themes from narrative data, and by examining whether coherence between facial and appraisal components were associated with increased experience of emotion. Consistent with claims that emotion systems are loosely coupled, facial expressions of anger and sadness co‐occurred to a moderate degree with the expected appraisal themes, and when this happened, the experience of emotion was stronger. The results for the positive emotions were more complex, but lend credence to the hypothesis that laughter and smiling are distinct. Smiling co‐occurred with appraisals of pride, but never occurred with appraisals of anger. In contrast, laughter occurred more often with appraisals of anger, a finding consistent with recent evidence linking laughter to the dissociation or undoing of negative emotion.",2004.0,54.0,117.0,"{'volume': '18', 'pages': '431 - 444', 'name': 'Cognition and Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bonanno2004BriefRT,\n author = {G.

Distance learning system can be regarded as one of ubiquitous computing applications since the learners can study anywhere even in mobile environments. However, the instructor cannot know if the learners comprehend the lecture or not since each learner is physically isolated. Therefore, a framework which detects the learners’ concentration condition is required. If a distance learning system obtains the information that many learners are not concentrated on the class due to the incomprehensible lecture style, the instructor can perceive it through the system and change the presentation strategy. This is a context-aware technology which is widely used for ubiquitous computing services. In this paper, an efficient distance learning system, which accurately detects learners’ concentration condition during a class, is proposed. The proposed system uses multiple biological information which are learners’ eye movement metrics, i.e. fixation counts, fixation rate, fixation duration and average saccade length obtained by an eye tracking system. The learners’ concentration condition is classified by using machine learning techniques. The proposed system has performed the detection accuracy of 90.7% when Multilayer Perceptron is used as a classifier. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed eye metrics has been confirmed. Furthermore, it has been clarified that the fixation duration is the most important eye metric among the four metrics based on the investigation of evaluation experiment.",2017.0,28.0,14.0,"{'volume': '5', 'pages': '1-15', 'name': 'Journal of Computational Chemistry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Daniel2017DetectionOL,\n author = {Kim Daniel and E.

Abstract Recreational abuse of ketamine has been associated with the emergence of a new bladder pain syndrome, ketamine‐induced cystitis, characterised by chronic inflammation and urothelial ulceration. This study investigated the direct effects of ketamine on normal human urothelium maintained in organ culture or as finite cell lines in vitro. Exposure of urothelium to ketamine resulted in apoptosis, with cytochrome c release from mitochondria and significant subsequent caspase 9 and 3/7 activation. The anaesthetic mode‐of‐action for ketamine is mediated primarily through N‐methyl D‐ aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonism; however, NHU cells were unresponsive to NMDAR agonists or antagonists and no expression of NMDAR transcript was detected. Exposure to non‐cytotoxic concentrations of ketamine (≤1 mM) induced rapid release of ATP, which activated purinergic P2Y receptors and stimulated the inositol trisphosphate receptor to provoke transient release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. Ketamine concentrations >1 mM were cytotoxic and provoked a larger‐ amplitude increase in cytosolic [Ca 2+ ] that was unresolved. The sustained elevation in cytosolic [Ca 2+ ] was associated with pathological mitochondrial oxygen consumption and ATP deficiency. Damage to the urinary barrier initiates bladder pain and in ketamine‐induced cystitis, loss of urothelium from large areas of the bladder wall is a reported feature. This study offers first evidence for a mechanism of direct toxicity of ketamine to urothelial cells by activating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.",2007.0,25.0,677.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Ford2007ContactIF,\n author = {Chandra L.

We extend this research by exploring whether this effect of VRPT is driven by increased empathy and whether the effect extends to ostensibly real-stakes behavioral games. In a pre-registered laboratory experiment (N = 180), participants interacted with an ostensible partner (a student from the same university as them) on a series of real-stakes economic games after (a) taking the perspective of the partner in a virtual reality, “day-in-the-life” simulation, (b) taking the perspective of a different person in a “day-in-the-life” simulation, or (c) doing a neutral activity in a virtual environment. The VRPT experience successfully increased participants’ subsequent propensity to take the perspective of their partner (a facet of empathy), but only if the partner was the same person whose perspective participants assumed in the virtual reality simulation. Further, this effect of VRPT on perspective-taking was moderated by participants’ reported feeling of immersion in the virtual environment.

417,293398f01e62c4e1b57050c3d26bc41602ffc8fa,A virtual reality meditative intervention modulates pain and the pain neuromatrix in patients with opioid use disorder.,"OBJECTIVE
Standard-of-care for opioid use disorder (OUD) includes medication and counseling. However, there is an unmet need for complementary approaches to treat OUD patients coping with pain; furthermore, few studies have probed neurobiological features of pain or its management during OUD treatment. This preliminary study examines neurobiological and behavioral effects of a virtual reality-based meditative intervention in patients undergoing methadone maintenance treatment (MMT).


DESIGN
Prospective, non-blinded, single-arm, 12-week intervention with standardized assessments.


SETTING
Academic research laboratory affiliated with an on-site MMT clinic.


METHODS
Fifteen (11 female) MMT patients completed a virtual reality, therapist-guided meditative intervention that included breathing and relaxation exercises; sessions were scheduled twice weekly. Assessments included functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of pain neuromatrix activation and connectivity (pre- and post-intervention), saliva cortisol and C-reactive protein (CRP) at baseline and weeks 4, 8 and 12; and self-reported pain and affective symptoms before and after each intervention session.


RESULTS
After each intervention session (relative to pre-session), ratings of pain, opioid craving, anxiety and depression (but not anger) decreased. Saliva cortisol (but not CRP) levels decreased from pre- to post-session. From pre- to post-intervention fMRI assessments, pain task-related left postcentral gyrus (PCG) activation decreased. At baseline, PCG showed positive connectivity with other regions of the pain neuromatrix, but this pattern changed post-intervention.


CONCLUSIONS
These preliminary findings demonstrate feasibility, therapeutic promise, and brain basis of a meditative intervention for OUD patients undergoing MMT.",2021.0,69.0,7.0,{'name': 'Pain medicine'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Faraj2021AVR,\n author = {M.

Hedonic picture content varied from highly arousing scenes of erotica and violence to scenes depicting nature, babies, loss, contamination, food, and more. Despite equivalent overall picture brightness and contrast, pupil diameter still varied as a function of the local brightness of central vision at fixation. Statistical (Experiment 1) and methodological (Experiment 2, 3) solutions produced complementary data indicating that scenes of erotica and violence reliably attenuate the amplitude of the initial light reflex and prompt enhanced late diameter pupil changes, compared to other scene contents.

The use of physiological signals is growing in the design of interactive systems due to their relevance in the improvement of the coupling between user states and application behavior. Reading is pervasive in visual user interfaces. In previous work, we integrated EEG signals in prototypical applications, designed to analyze reading tasks. This work searches for signals that are most relevant for reading detection procedures. More specifically, this study determines which features, input signals, and frequency bands are more significant for discrimination between reading and non-reading classes. This optimization is critical for an efficient and real time implementation of EEG processing software components, a basic requirement for the future applications. We use probabilistic similarity metrics, independent of the classification algorithm. All analyses are performed after determining the power spectrum density of delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma rhythms. The results about the relevance of the input signals are validated with functional neurosciences knowledge. The experiences have been performed in a conventional HCI lab, with non clinical EEG equipment and setup. This is an explicit and voluntary condition.

It also popularized physics that promoted innovation. The deep popularization of physical science is an important content of science education. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the logical relationship and practical path between science education, college physics curriculum and science popularization, that is, the generalization of physics curriculum to science education and popular science from the perspective of emotional regulation. Subjects and Methods Apply Bruner's cognitive structure learning theory in psychology to college physics teaching, and transform the basic structure of physics into the cognitive structure of physical theories and phenomena in students' minds. In order to coordinate the development of physics courses and the popularization of science, the basic physics courses and majors of the University have been adjusted to help students understand the principles of physics and apply them to engineering. A total of 415 junior middle school students in three grades of an experimental middle school were investigated by cluster stratified sampling. The emotional regulation ability scale compiled by Lu Jiamei and Ji Jiajun (2010), the Chinese version of emotional behavior scale (PBI) revised by Yang Hongjun (2009) and the Chinese version of aggressive behavior (BWAQ) (2008) were used as research tools, and spss17 0 to analyze the data results by descriptive analysis, analysis of variance and linear regression. Results We found that while widely spreading science and technology, cultivating citizens' awareness of science and technology is a necessary condition for further popularizing science. We have identified four aspects of in-depth popularization of science. We have also created a four part physics course and created a teaching method that combines online and offline teaching, large and small classes, as well as theoretical and practical learning. Using various forms of science education, we have constructed three ways to provide ideological education in the curriculum. In the practice of many science education, we have not only proved that the most important part of physics education is scientific and technological literacy, but also formed the soul of basic physics curriculum: “explore laws after encountering phenomena, respond to principles creatively, and pursue loyalty and accuracy”. Based on the teaching philosophy and objectives of Xi University of technology, and taking two innovative points, three characteristic physics courses and popularization as the main line, this paper explores 30 elements of ideological education related to “physics, weapon industry and calligraphy”. These reforms were highly praised by the heads of 15 engineering majors related to the ordnance industry, and helped 13 engineering majors obtain China's higher engineering education certification. Conclusion After 10 years of educational practice, we have developed the physics curriculum to the stage of in-depth popularization of science. In the full combination of physics curriculum and engineering teaching, it embodies the three-stage learning process of acquisition, transformation and evaluation in Bruner's psychological theory. The scientific and technological literacy of Chinese teenagers has improved. In short, we should fully consider the important influence of emotion, actively pay attention to the changes of psychological emotion and behavior in their learning, and strive to become the manager, coordinator and collaborator of curriculum construction. We should actively organize rich activities flexibly according to the psychological characteristics of this part of the group, strive to build a relaxed and harmonious living atmosphere, create a friendly and mutual aid relationship, encourage and guide this part of the group, adjust the psychology to the best state, and promote the healthy growth in a good learning life.

While considerable efforts have focused on explicating when, why and for whom this fundamental psychological ability can go awry, considerably less is known about factors that may enhance theory of mind. Accordingly, the current study explored the possibility that mindfulness-based meditation may improve people’s mindreading skills. Following a 5-minute mindfulness induction, participants with no prior meditation experience completed tests that assessed mindreading and empathic understanding. The results revealed that brief mindfulness meditation enhanced both mental state attribution and empathic concern, compared to participants in the control group.

We explored the associations between sensory processing and classroom emotional, behavioral, and educational outcomes of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).


METHOD
Twenty-eight children with ASD (with average-range IQ) were compared with 51 age- and gender-matched typically developing peers on sensory processing and educational outcomes.


RESULTS
For children with ASD, the Short Sensory Profile scores Underresponsive/Seeks Sensation and Auditory Filtering explained 47% of the variance in academic performance, yet estimated intelligence was not a significant predictor of academic performance. Significant negative correlations were found between (1) auditory filtering and inattention to cognitive tasks, (2) tactile hypersensitivity and hyperactivity and inattention, and (3) movement sensitivity and oppositional behavior.


CONCLUSION

443,2beaaa066b716606a00952073d109f4bd679ce0a,The Potential of Immersive Virtual Reality for Cognitive Training in Elderly,"The number of elderly is growing rapidly, including those that struggle with cognitive decline and, consequently, activities of daily living. Developing interventions that slow down cognitive decline would greatly benefit the autonomy of these elderly, as well as their caretakers. Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive and interactive human-computer interface with real-time simulation that is suggested to be a promising tool to improve cognitive functioning. This literature review discusses the features of immersive VR, including its opportunities and limitations, that are of special relevance for improving cognition in elderly. First, the high flexibility of VR allows for personalized and safe training of potentially harmful situations and isolated aspects of tasks. Second, VR’s dynamic and real-time feedback on performance provides a labor-extensive tool for caretakers in elderly care. Third, the acquisition of high resolution data enables the exposure of subtle changes over time, relevant for detecting the nature and extent of cognitive changes in elderly, including those with dementia. Fourth, immersive VR has been related to cybersickness. Finally, VR is immersive and enables the perception and expression of emotions, motor behaviors, and multiple senses. Aged subjects are found to have sparing of emotional learning and show increased reliance on multisensory integration for learning. Moreover, they experience high levels of flow, motivation, and presence in VR setups. Despite the clear potential of immersive VR, the studies available are small scale and have not been replicated. The digital illiteracy of elderly and healthcare personnel form an additional barrier for implementation. Hence, while replication of outcomes and standardization of VR interventions is required before it can be used in standard care, VR may provide a particularly effective tool for training cognition in elderly.",2020.0,130.0,39.0,"{'volume': '66', 'pages': '614 - 623', 'name': 'Gerontology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bauer2020ThePO,\n author = {A.

The main question was whether the quality of experience was more influenced by whether a person was at work or at leisure or more influenced by whether a person was in flow (i.e., in a condition of high challenges and skills). Results showed that all the variables measuring the quality of experience, except for relaxation and motivation, are more affected by flow than by whether the respondent is working or in leisure. Moreover, the great majority of flow experiences are reported when working, not when in leisure. Regardless of the quality of experience, however, respondents are more motivated in leisure than in work.

Spoken narratives in English were elicited from sixty Chinese-speaking participants at four ages – five, eight, ten, and young adults – using the wordless picture book Frog, where are you? (Mayer, 1969). Narrative analysis focused on the referring expressions that the L2 speakers used to introduce and maintain reference to story characters in the narratives and on the referential appropriateness of those expressions. We then compared the results of this study with other, similar studies on children learning English as a first language (L1) and found both universal and L2-specific patterns in the development of referring expressions in discourse. On the one hand, regardless of whether English is acquired as an L1 or L2, appropriate use of referring expressions in discourse is developed gradually and is influenced by both discourse function (introduction vs. maintenance) and character type (main vs. secondary).

Since the emotions that arise in the viewer of an image are highly subjective, they are rarely indexed. However there are situations when it would be helpful if images could be retrieved based on their emotional content. We investigate and develop methods to extract and combine low-level features that represent the emotional content of an image, and use these for image emotion classification. Specifically, we exploit theoretical and empirical concepts from psychology and art theory to extract image features that are specific to the domain of artworks with emotional expression. For testing and training, we use three data sets: the International Affective Picture System (IAPS); a set of artistic photography from a photo sharing site (to investigate whether the conscious use of colors and textures displayed by the artists improves the classification); and a set of peer rated abstract paintings to investigate the influence of the features and ratings on pictures without contextual content.

In order to tackle this problem, we propose a novel deep belief network (DBN) based method for examining critical channels and frequency bands in this paper. First, we design an emotion experiment and collect EEG data while subjects are watching emotional film clips. Then we train DBN for recognizing three emotions (positive, neutral, and negative) with extracted differential entropy features as input and compare DBN with other shallow models such as KNN, LR, and SVM. The experiment results show that DBN achieves the best average accuracy of 86.08%. We further explore critical channels and frequency bands by examining the weight distribution learned by DBN, which is different from the existing work.

To capture the experiences of occupational therapists implementing P4C and to elicit their perspectives about how this model differs from the direct service approach. Methods. Semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted with seven therapists who had delivered P4C in 10 Ontario schools. Thematic analysis was utilized with themes verified through member checking. Findings. Five themes (a year of growth, becoming a community, the key ingredients of P4C, a balancing act, and providing services that make an impact) reflected therapists' personal and professional growth, aspects of the model they believed were key, challenges they encountered, and the impact they felt they had made.

Most studies have sought to clarify the role of self-injury as a coping strategy, and while this research is central to the understanding of those who self-injure, factors that influence coping behaviors may affect treatment and prevention efforts. This study examined the mediational effect of coping self-efficacy (CSE) on the relationship between emotion dysregulation and frequency of NSSI. The sample included 187 self-injuring university students between the ages of 18–26, and was predominately female (76.5%) and Caucasian (67.4%). Participants completed the Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale, the Coping Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Non-Suicidal Self-Injury Assessment Tool. Results indicated that CSE did not act as a mediator between difficulty with ER and frequency of NSSI. However, greater difficulty with ER predicted increased frequency in NSSI. These results highlight the importance of ER skills in the prevention and cessation of NSSI. It is imperative that mental health practitioners working with young adults focus on actual skill building rather than increasing CSE, as increased ER skills are likely to both increase CSE and reduce NSSI.",2018.0,65.0,18.0,"{'volume': '5', 'name': 'Cogent Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Midkiff2018TheRO,\n author = {Melanie Midkiff and C.

Combining mindfulness with immersive virtual reality (VR) has been proven to be especially effective for a wide range of mood disorders for which traditional mindfulness has proven valuable. However, the vast majority of immersive VR-enhanced mindfulness applications have focused on clinical settings, with little evidence on healthy subjects. This narrative review evaluates the real effectiveness of state-of-the-art mindfulness interventions mediated by VR systems in influencing mood and physiological status in non-clinical populations. Only studies with an RCT study design were considered. We conclude that most studies were characterized by one single meditation experience, which seemed sufficient to induce a significant reduction in negative mood states (anxiety, anger, depression, tension) combined with increased mindfulness skills. However, physiological correlates of mindfulness practices have scarcely been investigated. The application of VR-enhanced mindfulness-based interventions in non-clinical populations is in its infancy since most studies have several limitations, such as the poor employment of the RCT study design, the lack of physiological measurements (i.e., heart rate variability), as well as the high heterogeneity in demographical data, technological devices, and VR procedures.

In attendance were a range of researchers, educators, and advocates with diverse interests related to meeting the developmental, psychological, educational, and general health needs of children. These issues were discussed, and the term social and emotional learning (SEL) was introduced. SEL described a framework for providing opportunities for young people to acquire the skills necessary for attaining and maintaining personal well-being and positive relationships across the lifespan. Out of this 1994 meeting, the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) was formed with the goal of “establishing high-quality, evidence-based SEL as an essential part of preschool through high school education” (Elias et al., 1997; Greenberg et al., 2003; Kress & Elias, 2006). Since its conception, CASEL has defined SEL more specifically and has served as a guide to school-based SEL programming (CASEL, 2003). According to CASEL, SEL describes the acquisition of skills including selfand social awareness and regulation, responsible decision making and problem solving, and relationship management. The first of CASEL’s 39 Guidelines for Educators delineates four primary domains of SEL: “(1) life skills and social competencies, (2) health promotion and problem-prevention skills, (3) coping skills and social support for transitions and crises, and (4) positive, contributory service” (Elias et al., 1997; Kress & Elias, 2006). These skills are critical at all levels of development but vary in their application over the life course. Underlying SEL programming is a theoretical foundation based on the ideas that essential learning takes place in the context of relationships and that similar risk factors are responsible for various maladaptive outcomes",2010.0,64.0,102.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Elbertson2010SchoolBasedSA,\n author = {Nicole A.

Using event-related fMRI, we tested the hypothesis that voluntary modulation of negative emotion is associated with changes in neural activity within the amygdala. Negative and neutral pictures were presented with instructions to either maintain the emotional response or passively view the picture without regulating the emotion. Each picture presentation was followed by a delay, after which subjects indicated how they currently felt via a response keypad. Consistent with previous reports, greater signal change was observed in the amygdala during the presentation of negative compared to neutral pictures. No significant effect of instruction was found during the picture presentation component of the trial. However, a prolonged increase in signal change was observed in the amygdala when subjects maintained the negative emotional response during the delay following negative picture offset. This increase in amygdalar signal due to the active maintenance of negative emotion was significantly correlated with subjects' self-reported dispositional levels of negative affect. These results suggest that consciously evoked cognitive mechanisms that alter the emotional response of the subject operate, at least in part, by altering the degree of neural activity within the amygdala.",2002.0,55.0,310.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '913-921', 'name': 'Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Schaefer2002ModulationOA,\n author = {S.

It has been used for assessments and training in social cognition with the use of virtual agents instead of face-to-face interactions – but its potential for the study of social emotion regulation has, perhaps surprisingly, largely remained untapped. The present study evaluates a novel immersive VR scenario designed to study the efficacy of social support by a virtual agent using a modified version of Cyberball, an established paradigm to induce the feeling of ostracism. Participants embodied a new pupil in a virtual school environment and played Cyberball, after which they either did or did not receive emotional support. Self-reports and psychophysiological markers demonstrated that the negative impact of social exclusion in Cyberball was successfully replicated, while participants also reported a significant improvement in emotional state after being supported by the virtual agent. These results indicate the potential of the developed scenario for research on social emotion regulation in immersive VR. Future studies could aim to test the efficacy of social support for people with difficulties in self-regulation, for example individuals with high social anxiety, with a view to developing training programs in VR.",2023.0,0.0,1.0,"{'name': 'Int.

471,2eda7ede68dac52e32065c72fbdd6ae67da36e10,FUNDAMENTALS OF EEG MEASUREMENT,"Electroencephalographic measurements are commonly used in medical and research areas. This review article presents an introduction into EEG measurement. Its purpose is to help with orientation in EEG field and with building basic knowledge for performing EEG recordings. The article is divided into two parts. In the first part, background of the subject, a brief historical overview, and some EEG related research areas are given. The second part explains EEG recording. Modern medicine applies variety of imaging techniques of the human body. The group of electrobiological measurements comprises items as electrocardiography (ECG, heart), electromyography (EMG, muscular contractions), electroencephalography (EEG, brain), magnetoencephalography (MEG, brain), electrogastrography (EGG, stomach), electrooptigraphy (EOG, eye dipole field). Imaging techniques based on different physical principles include computer tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Electroencephalography is a medical imaging technique that reads scalp electrical activity generated by brain structures. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is defined as electrical activity of an alternating type recorded from the scalp surface after being picked up by metal electrodes and conductive media (1). The EEG measured directly from the cortical surface is called electrocortiogram while when using depth probes it is called electrogram. In this article, we will refer only to EEG measured from the head surface. Thus electroencephalographic reading is a completely non-invasive procedure that can be applied repeatedly to patients, normal adults, and children with virtually no risk or limitation. When brain cells (neurons) are activated, local current flows are produced. EEG measures mostly the currents that flow during synaptic excitations of the dendrites of many pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex. Differences of electrical potentials are caused by summed postsynaptic graded potentials from pyramidal cells that create electrical dipoles between soma (body of neuron) and apical dendrites (neural branches). Brain electrical current consists mostly of Na+, K+, Ca++, and Cl- ions that are pumped through channels in neuron membranes in the direction governed by membrane potential (2). The detailed microscopic picture is more sophisticated, including different types of synapses involving variety of neurotransmitters. Only large populations of active neurons can generate electrical activity recordable on the head surface. Between electrode and neuronal layers current penetrates through skin, skull and several other layers. Weak electrical signals detected by the scalp electrodes are massively amplified, and then displayed on paper or stored to computer memory (3). Due to capability to reflect both the normal and abnormal electrical activity of the brain, EEG has been found to be a very powerful tool in the field of neurology and clinical neurophysiology. The human brain electric activity starts around the 17-23 week of prenatal development. It is assumed that at birth the full number of neural cells is already developed, roughly 10 11 neurons (4). This makes an average density of 10 4 neurons per cubic mm. Neurons are mutually connected into neural nets through synapses. Adults have about 500 trillion (5.10 14 ) synapses. The number of synapses per one neuron with age increases, however the number of neurons with age decreases, thus the total number of synapses decreases with age too. From the anatomical point of view, the brain can be divided into three sections: cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem. The cerebrum consists of left and right hemisphere with highly convoluted surface layer called cerebral cortex. The cortex is a",2002.0,17.0,1533.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Teplan2002FUNDAMENTALSOE,\n author = {M.

This technology has the potential to provide mental stimulation, a connection to autobiographical memory through reminiscence, and enhanced quality of life (QoL) to people living with dementia (PLWD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this mini-review, we examine the available evidence from studies reporting on the potential benefits of virtual and augmented reality to provide enjoyable, leisurely activities that may promote QoL and psychological well-being and facilitate social interaction. In total, 10 studies of varying study designs and durations (5 min to 6 months) using virtual (n = 9) and augmented reality (n = 1) were examined in PLWD (n = 6) and MCI (n= 3), in addition to 1 study that included participants with both conditions. Overall, the virtual experiences were enjoyed by the participants, improved their mood and apathy, and were preferred when compared with nonvirtual experiences. However, small sample sizes and variations in study design limit the generalizability of the results. Nevertheless, the use of virtual and augmented reality technology for PLWD and MCI is a novel and emerging method which may provide cognitive stimulation and improve well-being. Future research should explore the potential application of this technology to promote social interaction in both the community and aged care settings. We suggest future studies in PLWD and MCI assess the effects of more sustained use of virtual and augmented reality technology on psychological outcomes including QoL, apathy, and depressive symptoms, with the incorporation of physiological biomarker outcomes.",2019.0,45.0,105.0,"{'volume': '65', 'pages': '430 - 440', 'name': 'Gerontology'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{D'Cunha2019AMO,\n author = {N.

We open the article by discussing three classic views for the independence of affect. These are (i) the affective independence hypothesis, that emotion is processed independently from cognition, (ii) the affective primacy hypothesis, that evaluative processing precedes semantic processing, and (iii) the affective automaticity hypothesis, that affectively potent stimuli commandeer attention and evaluation is automatic. We argue that affect is not independent from cognition, that affect is not primary to cognition, nor is affect automatically elicited. The second half of the paper discusses several instances of how affect influences cognition. We review experiments showing affective involvement in perception, semantic activation, and attitude activation. We conclude that one function of affect is to regulate cognitive processing.",2007.0,143.0,318.0,"{'volume': '21', 'pages': '1212 - 1237', 'name': 'Cognition and Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Storbeck2007OnTI,\n author = {Justin Storbeck and G.

We present an approach to generate static and dynamic wrinkles on human skin. For the static model, we consider micro and macro structures of the skin surface geometry. For the wrinkle dynamics, an approach using a biomechanical skin model is employed. The tile texture patterns in the micro structure of skin surface are created using planar Delaunay triangulation. Functions of barycentric coordinates are applied to simulate the curved ridges. The visible (macro) flexure lines which may form wrinkles are predefined edges on the micro structure. These lines act as constraints for the hierarchical triangulation process. Furthermore, the dynamics of expressive wrinkles-controlling their depth and fold-is modeled according to the principal strain of the deformed skin surface. Bump texture mapping is used for skin rendering.",1996.0,17.0,61.0,"{'pages': '90-97', 'name': ""Proceedings Computer Animation '96""}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Wu1996SimulationOS,\n author = {Yin Wu and P.

Neurofeedback usually provides the audio and or video feedback. Positive or negative feedback is produced for desirable or undesirable brain activities, respectively. In this review, we provided clinical and technical information about the following issues: (1) Various neurofeedback treatment protocols i.e. alpha, beta, alpha/theta, delta, gamma, and theta; (2) Different EEG electrode placements i.e. standard recording channels in the frontal, temporal, central, and occipital lobes; (3) Electrode montages (unipolar, bipolar); (4) Types of neurofeedback i.e. frequency, power, slow cortical potential, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and so on; (5) Clinical applications of neurofeedback i.e. treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, epilepsy, insomnia, drug addiction, schizophrenia, learning disabilities, dyslexia and dyscalculia, autistic spectrum disorders and so on as well as other applications such as pain management, and the improvement of musical and athletic performance; and (6) Neurofeedback softwares. To date, many studies have been conducted on the neurofeedback therapy and its effectiveness on the treatment of many diseases. Neurofeedback, like other treatments, has its own pros and cons. Although it is a non-invasive procedure, its validity has been questioned in terms of conclusive scientific evidence. For example, it is expensive, time-consuming and its benefits are not long-lasting. Also, it might take months to show the desired improvements.

The research questions are: 1. How do school-based occupational therapists (OTs) describe the role of sensory-based intervention (SBI) in an educational setting? 2. Which current practice trends influence sensory-based occupational therapy practice? Methods: Descriptive statistics were generated to summarize current school-based practice trends. Qualitative analysis resulted in the identification of categories related to school-based practice. Participants (N = 94) reported the positive impact of sensory-based interventions in the schools, the challenge of the school context, the value of both teacher and team collaboration, the limitations and challenges to parent collaboration, and the sensory resources within the school context. Results: Results indicate that school-based practitioners should focus on educational and social participation of the students.

492,30a467e734a2ec4210aa473f7064c04c41414bd1,Using Virtual Collaboration and Education to Increase Teachers’ Ability to Promote Self-regulation,"ABSTRACT The aim of this evidence-based occupational therapy (OT) project was to answer the question, “Does education and scheduled collaboration on the use of sensory tools in the school environment increase general education teachers’ understanding of OT’s role in self-regulation?” Evidence supports the use of asynchronous learning modules for professional development. Research indicates that the addition of an interactive element enhances learning. Collaboration is supported by evidence for enhanced effectiveness of sensory tools in schools. The project was implemented over the course of 7 weeks. Teachers participated in 5 weeks of intervention with a weekly 30-min asynchronous web-based learning module and a 30-min individual or group collaboration session. Results showed increased positive perceptions with 5 of 10 Likert scale questions showing a statistically significant increase. In addition, data showed a statistically significant positive change in teachers’ knowledge related to OT’s role in schools, self-regulation, and social-emotional skills. Data from open-ended questions revealed an increase in teachers’ understanding of different causes of student behaviors and increased knowledge of self-regulation tools. The results suggest teachers’ understanding of OT’s role in self-regulation increases through the use of asynchronous virtual learning and scheduled collaboration sessions with an occupational therapist. Further research is recommended to increase the generalizability of results and to identify the most effective use of collaboration to enhance teachers’ understanding of self-regulation.",2021.0,32.0,0.0,"{'name': 'Journal of Occupational Therapy, Schools, & Early Intervention', 'pages': '403 - 417', 'volume': '15'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Donald2021UsingVC,\n author = {J.

The purpose of the present study is to examine the influence of SNSs on life satisfaction among university students by first exploring what are the key gratifications which motivates them to engage in SNSs and then focusing on the psychological outcomes including social overload and social benefit from using SNSs that affects life satisfaction among the university students.,Theory of social influence and uses and gratifications theory were used in this study to examine the motivations for using SNSs, and the impact of psychological outcomes associated with SNSs usage, i.e. social benefit and social overload on life satisfaction among university students of Pakistan. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling is used to analyze the data.,The outcomes indicate that the need for maintaining interpersonal interconnectivity, entertainment value and social enhancement value derives the students' participation in social networking sites through which they encounter social benefit and social overload. The presence of social benefit enhances life satisfaction while social overload results in decreasing life satisfaction of students. Using social networking sites influences life satisfaction in the presence of social overload and social benefit while there is no direct influence of social networking sites on life satisfaction was evidenced.,The present study investigated the needs that drive the use of social media through the lens of UGT & Social influence approach. The other potential determinants of social media usage intention should be analyzed by employing variables of the other models.In this study social media was examined as a general platform used by the university students of Pakistan. In future researches the driving needs should be examined in the context of specific social networking sites.,The presented findings embraces the implications for the authorities of higher education institutions and policy makers as it provides the useful insights about student 2019s motivations and participation behavior in SNSs which would help in developing strategies for desirable results.,Educational institutions can utilize the research findings by incorporating social media tools in the academic system, student's interaction with their mentors will lead towards enhanced involvement of students and intellectual skills along with upgraded academic performance which will positively influence life satisfaction of the students.,The scarcity of findings was observed in the local environment specifically in the context of SNSs usage and well-being of the higher education students.

Animal and human studies on neural pathways underlying social buffering typically examined physiological reactions or regional brain activations. However, direct links between emotional and social stimuli, distinct neural processes and behavioural outcomes are still missing. Using data of 27 female participants, the current study delineated a large-scale process model of social buffering’s neural underpinnings, connecting changes in neural activity to emotional behaviour by means of voxel-wise multilevel mediation analysis. Our results confirmed that three processes underlie human social buffering: (i) social support-related reduction of activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, anterior and mid-cingulate; (ii) downregulation of aversive emotion-induced brain activity in the superficial cortex-like amygdala and mediodorsal thalamus; and (iii) downregulation of reported aversive feelings. Results of the current study provide evidence for a distinct neural process model of aversive emotion regulation in humans by social buffering.",2020.0,57.0,8.0,"{'volume': '15', 'pages': '561 - 570', 'name': 'Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bratec2020YourPS,\n author = {Satja Mulej Bratec and Teresa Bertram and G.

Methods A single-case research design with an ideographic approach was selected given the novelty of this intervention. A blended single case experimental design was used combining the Multiple-baseline design across individuals with a reversal design to examine the effects of VR nature scenes on agitation. Visual analysis was used to determine changes in mean, level, and latency of the behaviors. Results For both participants, a significant decrease in their respective agitation behaviors was observed during intervention phases. Conclusions This study provides preliminary evidence of the utility of VR as a brief and effective intervention to decrease agitation in individuals with dementia. Clinical Implications These initial, promising results may help caregivers improve the quality of life for dementia patients. Further, the brevity of the intervention makes this a practical tool for care providers working in clinical settings.

These tools are gradually implemented during six consecutive 45 minutes English (virtual) model lessons. The first three lessons primarily support learners’ emotional development. The following three lessons are concentrated on the development of positive feelings and their impact on social relationships, social-emotional development of young learners. Based on the qualitative character of the study, we suggest to use a narrative approach and to use the methods of observation, individual interview and a test as a research tool for data collection. Lessons oriented towards social-emotional development of young learners may possibly contribute to the art of noticing which definitely helps the learners to improve the quality of their social contacts, to verbalize and justify their positive and negative emotions, to increase their vocabulary, to foster their self-regulation at school and outside of it and it teaches them to be emotionally resilient.

507,31be330e4c2ddf821593a3de6c4b247d734d4cce,The Effect of Immersion on Emotional Responses to Film Viewing in a Virtual Environment,"In this study, we explore how immersion affects people's sense of emotions in a virtual environment. The primary goals of this study are to analyze the possible use of virtual reality (VR) as an affective medium and research the relationship between immersion and emotion. To investigate these objectives, we compared two viewing conditions (HMD vs. No-HMD) and applied two types of emotional content (horror and empathy) to examine whether the level of immersion could influence emotional responses. The results showed that viewers who watched the horror movie using HMD felt more scared than those in the No-HMD condition. However, there were no significant emotional differences between the HMD and No-HMD conditions in the movie groups exposed to empathy. Regarding these results, we may assume that the effect of an immersive viewing experience on emotional responses in VR is deeply related to the degree of arousal and strong perceptual cues. The horror movie used in this study included intense visual and audio stimuli found in the typical horror film format. In contrast, viewers experienced less stimulating perceptual input when they are watching the empathetic movie. In conclusion, VR undoubtedly elicits a more immersive experience and greater emotional responses to the horror film. This study has confirmed the efficacy of VR as an emotional amplifier and successfully demonstrated the important association between immersion and emotion in VR.",2018.0,7.0,23.0,"{'pages': '601-602', 'name': '2018 IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (VR)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kim2018TheEO,\n author = {Aelee Kim and Minha Chang and Yeseul Choi and Sohyeon Jeon and Kyoungmin Lee},\n journal = {2018 IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (VR)},\n pages = {601-602},\n title = {The Effect of Immersion on Emotional Responses to Film Viewing in a Virtual Environment},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '3279749', 'name': 'Aelee Kim'}, {'authorId': '51246922', 'name': 'Minha Chang'}, {'authorId': '2111166025', 'name': 'Yeseul Choi'}, {'authorId': '51236000', 'name': 'Sohyeon Jeon'}, {'authorId': '2115699233', 'name': 'Kyoungmin Lee'}]"

But if the information conveyed nonverbally exhibits clues that are not consistent with the verbal part of an agent’s action, how will the user react to such a discrepancy? Masking ones real emotions with a smile is a naturally occuring example of such a discrepancy. But such masks are often deﬁcient and thus subtle clues of lying and deceiving manifest themselves in facial expressions. The questions is how users will react to these clues if they are conveyed by an agent. Will they render an application unattractive or on the contrary more human-like? In this paper, we examine such facial clues to deception and present the results of two empirical studies: i.) lies in monologues by a talking head presenting movies, ii.) lies in an interactive game of dice.",2004.0,31.0,85.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Rehm2004CatchMI,\n author = {M.

The research was collected and reviewed in terms of the different types of Virtual Reality systems (equipment and levels of immersion) and feasibility of the technology within different stages of demen- tia as well as the methodological limitations. A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the healthcare databases advanced search (Medline, PsychINFO, and EMBASE) and snowballing methods. The participants had a dementia diagnosis and the feasibility of Virtual Reality in terms of its acceptability and practicality was discussed. Only five articles met the eligibility criteria. Four included semi-immersive Virtual Reality with participants in the early stages of dementia. One included fully- immersive Virtual Reality where dementia stage ranged from ‘mild’ to ‘severe’. Based on available demographic information, study participants resided in residential care homes, alone in the community or with their spouse. The existing literature sug- gests that both semi and fully-immersive Virtual Reality technology use can be feasible amongst individuals living within the ear- lier stages of dementia outside of a hospital environment, with it being viewed as a welcomed distraction that increased alert- ness and pleasure.

Reproductive control refers to the ability of a man or woman to control his or her own reproduction. Unintended pregnancy is a commonly used proxy measure for reproductive control.


METHODS
Using heterosexually active women participating in the National Survey of Family Growth Cycle 6 (n = 4521), we evaluated unintended pregnancy as a proxy measure for reproductive control. We identified four categories of women by self-reported pregnancy intention: (1) women reporting one unintended pregnancy, (2) women reporting two or more unintended pregnancies, (3) women reporting intentionally having no pregnancies and (4) women who reported that all pregnancies were intended (reference category). Polytomous logistic regression, weighted for the complex sampling design, provided estimates of odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).


RESULTS
Fifty-one percent of women who reported having one unintended pregnancy went on to experience at least one additional unintended pregnancy. Being black, Hispanic, born to a mother who was <18 years at first birth, having multiple partners and age of first sexual debut (consensual or non-consensual) were significant predictors of multiple unintended pregnancies. Relative to sexual debut after 18 years of age, women reporting a sexual debut at less than 15 years were at increased risk of multiple unintended pregnancies (adjusted OR (reported as consensual): 6.96; 95% CI: 4.26 to 11.39; adjusted OR (reported as non-consensual: 27.10; 95% CI: 11.03-66.57)).


CONCLUSIONS
Efforts to delay sexual debut and to protect girls from non-consensual sex are sorely needed to prevent a lifelong trajectory of lack of reproductive control.",2011.0,31.0,35.0,"{'volume': '8 1', 'pages': '\n          95-101\n        ', 'name': 'Sexual health'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Magnusson2011AdolescentAS,\n author = {Brianna M.

518,32fc1d4acc6566f0930b4f51c783ab4fbb74eaf9,The neural basis of human social values: evidence from functional MRI.,"Social values are composed of social concepts (e.g., ""generosity"") and context-dependent moral sentiments (e.g., ""pride""). The neural basis of this intricate cognitive architecture has not been investigated thus far. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging while subjects imagined their own actions toward another person (self-agency) which either conformed or were counter to a social value and were associated with pride or guilt, respectively. Imagined actions of another person toward the subjects (other-agency) in accordance with or counter to a value were associated with gratitude or indignation/anger. As hypothesized, superior anterior temporal lobe (aTL) activity increased with conceptual detail in all conditions. During self-agency, activity in the anterior ventromedial prefrontal cortex correlated with pride and guilt, whereas activity in the subgenual cingulate solely correlated with guilt. In contrast, indignation/anger activated lateral orbitofrontal-insular cortices. Pride and gratitude additionally evoked mesolimbic and basal forebrain activations. Our results demonstrate that social values emerge from coactivation of stable abstract social conceptual representations in the superior aTL and context-dependent moral sentiments encoded in fronto-mesolimbic regions. This neural architecture may provide the basis of our ability to communicate about the meaning of social values across cultural contexts without limiting our flexibility to adapt their emotional interpretation.",2009.0,59.0,291.0,"{'volume': '19 2', 'pages': '\n          276-83\n        ', 'name': 'Cerebral cortex'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zahn2009TheNB,\n author = {R.

In the first study, the behavior of dispositionally high and low publicly self-conscious women was examined in an interpersonal situation involving rejection by a group. It was hypothesized that persons high in self-consciou sness, being more aware of how they are perceived by others, would be more sensitive and react more negatively to the rejection than those low in self-consciou sness. The predictions were confirmed. In Experiment 2, female subjects were presented with favorable or unfavorable feedback in the context of an interview, and self-attention was experimentally manipulated by exposing half the subjects to their images in a mirror. Self-awareness increased the negative response to the negative evaluation and tended to increase the positivity of the positive evaluation. The implications of selfawareness theory for the social self and social interaction are discussed. Everyday observations as well as theoretical approaches to social behavior suggest that in the presence of others, one is apt to become self-conscious, that is, aware of the self as a social object that can be observed and evaluated by others.

524,338eb07b27a2fc5ce9ce386845acb835c996d2ca,Research on Learning Concentration Recognition with Multi-Modal Features in Virtual Reality Environments,"Learning concentration, as a crucial factor influencing learning outcomes, provides the basis for learners’ self-regulation and teachers’ instructional adjustments and intervention decisions. However, the current research on learning concentration recognition lacks the integration of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral features, and the integration of interaction and vision data for recognition requires further exploration. The way data are collected in a head-mounted display differs from that in a traditional classroom or online learning. Therefore, it is vital to explore a recognition method for learning concentration based on multi-modal features in VR environments. This study proposes a multi-modal feature integration-based learning concentration recognition method in VR environments. It combines interaction and vision data, including measurements of interactive tests, text, clickstream, pupil facial expressions, and eye gaze data, to measure learners’ concentration in VR environments in terms of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral representation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method, which integrates interaction and vision data to comprehensively represent the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions of learning concentration, outperforms single-dimensional and single-type recognition results in terms of accuracy. Additionally, it was found that learners with higher concentration levels achieve better learning outcomes, and learners’ perceived sense of immersion is an important factor influencing their concentration.",2023.0,46.0,1.0,{'name': 'Sustainability'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Hu2023ResearchOL,\n author = {Renhe Hu and Zihan Hui and Yifan Li and Jueqi Guan},\n booktitle = {Sustainability},\n journal = {Sustainability},\n title = {Research on Learning Concentration Recognition with Multi-Modal Features in Virtual Reality Environments},\n year = {2023}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2225680673', 'name': 'Renhe Hu'}, {'authorId': '2225677390', 'name': 'Zihan Hui'}, {'authorId': '2110489870', 'name': 'Yifan Li'}, {'authorId': '2090331915', 'name': 'Jueqi Guan'}]"

In this paper we explore approaches for automatic recognition of engagement from students' facial expressions. We studied whether human observers can reliably judge engagement from the face; analyzed the signals observers use to make these judgments; and automated the process using machine learning. We found that human observers reliably agree when discriminating low versus high degrees of engagement (Cohen's κ = 0.96). When fine discrimination is required (four distinct levels) the reliability decreases, but is still quite high ( κ = 0.56). Furthermore, we found that engagement labels of 10-second video clips can be reliably predicted from the average labels of their constituent frames (Pearson r=0.85), suggesting that static expressions contain the bulk of the information used by observers. We used machine learning to develop automatic engagement detectors and found that for binary classification (e.g., high engagement versus low engagement), automated engagement detectors perform with comparable accuracy to humans. Finally, we show that both human and automatic engagement judgments correlate with task performance. In our experiment, student post-test performance was predicted with comparable accuracy from engagement labels ( r=0.47) as from pre-test scores ( r=0.44).",2014.0,73.0,421.0,"{'volume': '5', 'pages': '86-98', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Whitehill2014TheFO,\n author = {J.

It is widely used in the fields of anxiety relief, fear therapy, and depression regulation. However, objectively evaluating the emotional intervention effect of virtual reality technology is a difficult problem. The main purpose of this paper is to explore the use of EEG signals to identify individual emotional states in virtual reality scenarios and to improve the computational efficiency and recognition accuracy of emotional valence. To induce the target emotional state of the participants, we established a relatively standard emotion-induced virtual reality video library. The EEG data of the participants were collected synchronously as they watched the virtual reality video. The results show that the emotion recognition performance of multiple features (energy spectrum, differential entropy, differential asymmetry, and rational asymmetry) is better than that of a single feature. The radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) performed better than the deep belief network (DBN). RBFNN achieves the highest average classification accuracy of 91.1%. By combining the feature selection (F-test) method with the RBFNN, an ideal classification performance can be maintained with computational efficiency improvements. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the features extracted from the theta band outperform features extracted from other bands in emotional valence decoding.

534,34cd382a6541d0ca6fb28f6209d84d6fd7957ec8,Altered resting-state amygdala functional connectivity in men with posttraumatic stress disorder.,"BACKGROUND
Converging neuroimaging research suggests altered emotion neurocircuitry in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Emotion activation studies in these individuals have shown hyperactivation in emotion-related regions, including the amygdala and insula, and hypoactivation in emotion-regulation regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, few studies have examined patterns of connectivity at rest in individuals with PTSD, a potentially powerful method for illuminating brain network structure.


METHODS
Using the amygdala as a seed region, we measured resting-state brain connectivity using 3 T functional magnetic resonance imaging in returning male veterans with PTSD and combat controls without PTSD.


RESULTS
Fifteen veterans with PTSD and 14 combat controls enrolled in our study. Compared with controls, veterans with PTSD showed greater positive connectivity between the amygdala and insula, reduced positive connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus, and reduced anticorrelation between the amygdala and dorsal ACC and rostral ACC.


LIMITATIONS
Only male veterans with combat exposure were tested, thus our findings cannot be generalized to women or to individuals with non-combat related PTSD.


CONCLUSION
These results demonstrate that studies of functional connectivity during resting state can discern aberrant patterns of coupling within emotion circuits and suggest a possible brain basis for emotion-processing and emotion-regulation deficits in individuals with PTSD.",2012.0,75.0,317.0,"{'volume': '37 4', 'pages': '\n          241-9\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of psychiatry & neuroscience : JPN'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sripada2012AlteredRA,\n author = {Rebecca K.

Using a multiple baseline across treatment teams design, the authors assessed levels of functioning of three treatment teams using a 50-item rating scale and then introduced mindfulness-based mentoring successively across the treatment teams. Following intervention, four follow-up assessments at 3-month intervals were undertaken to assess the durability of the enhanced treatment team functioning levels in the absence of mentoring. Results showed that with the introduction of mindfulness-based mentoring, treatment team performance was enhanced, patients'attendance at therapeutic groups and individual therapy sessions was maximized, and patient and staff satisfaction with treatment team functioning was substantially increased, with patient satisfaction showing greater gains than staff satisfaction. Mindfulness-based mentoring may be an efficient and effective intervention for enhancing and maintaining the performance of treatment teams in adult psychiatric hospitals.",2006.0,25.0,59.0,"{'volume': '30', 'pages': '423 - 441', 'name': 'Behavior Modification'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Singh2006EnhancingTT,\n author = {Nirbhay N.

539,3560cd6a62787a10effa9b4b0369291a59af19d0,From Sharing to Exchange: An Extended Framework of Dual Modes of Collaborative Nonownership Consumption,The sharing economy captures several different market practices such as “car sharing” or “house sharing.” Anecdotal and empirical evidence has found conflicting motivations for participating in the sharing economy due to a misuse of the concept and an absence of a framework. This article proposes a framework to classify sharing economy practices based on their relative weights of sharing and exchange characteristics. The argument is that each practice is dualistic in nature: having characteristics of both sharing and exchange. The essay suggests a way to situate practices within the framework by offering a method to quantitatively calculate the sharing score of a given practice. An augmented model of willingness to participate in the sharing economy is tested across five practices that support the framework’s validity and usefulness. The results resolve some of the mixed findings in the literature and the positive role that materialism plays in the likelihood to participate.,2016.0,34.0,130.0,"{'volume': '1', 'pages': '277 - 294', 'name': 'Journal of the Association for Consumer Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Habibi2016FromST,\n author = {Mohammad Reza Habibi and Andrea Kim and M.

The authors evaluated the effectiveness of brief cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for the prevention of suicide attempts in military personnel.


METHOD
In a randomized controlled trial, active-duty Army soldiers at Fort Carson, Colo., who either attempted suicide or experienced suicidal ideation with intent, were randomly assigned to treatment as usual (N=76) or treatment as usual plus brief CBT (N=76). Assessment of incidence of suicide attempts during the follow-up period was conducted with the Suicide Attempt Self-Injury Interview. Inclusion criteria were the presence of suicidal ideation with intent to die during the past week and/or a suicide attempt within the past month. Soldiers were excluded if they had a medical or psychiatric condition that would prevent informed consent or participation in outpatient treatment, such as active psychosis or mania. To determine treatment efficacy with regard to incidence and time to suicide attempt, survival curve analyses were conducted. Differences in psychiatric symptoms were evaluated using longitudinal random-effects models.


RESULTS
From baseline to the 24-month follow-up assessment, eight participants in brief CBT (13.8%) and 18 participants in treatment as usual (40.2%) made at least one suicide attempt (hazard ratio=0.38, 95% CI=0.16-0.87, number needed to treat=3.88), suggesting that soldiers in brief CBT were approximately 60% less likely to make a suicide attempt during follow-up than soldiers in treatment as usual. There were no between-group differences in severity of psychiatric symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
Brief CBT was effective in preventing follow-up suicide attempts among active-duty military service members with current suicidal ideation and/or a recent suicide attempt.",2015.0,25.0,256.0,"{'volume': '172 5', 'pages': '\n          441-9\n        ', 'name': 'The American journal of psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{David2015BriefCT,\n author = {M.

In both studies, participant gender, virtual human gender, virtual human gaze behavior, and whether virtual humans were allegedly controlled by humans (i.e., avatars) or computers (i.e., agents) were varied. Results indicated that participants maintained greater distance from virtual humans when approaching their fronts compared to their backs. In addition, participants gave more personal space to virtual agents who engaged them in mutual gaze.

The research question guiding the review was: Which curricular and pedagogical arrangements promote engineering students’ employability? The particular focus of the study was on how authors prioritised engineering knowledge and professional skills. The review drew on a theoretical framework that differentiated between engineering knowledge and professional skills to explain how employability could be included in engineering programmes. Data was obtained from research studies over the period 2007–2017. We found an interdependent relationship between engineering knowledge and professional skills that enabled engineering graduates to attain employability. The com of engineering problems require students to master engineering knowledge, while the ability to work with others across contexts requires professional skills.

The concept itself requires a wider view of normativity than the narrow positivist one of law as command. It is certainly protean, ranging over many fundamental questions about the changing nature of the public sphere of politics and the state, and its interactions with the ‘private’ sphere of economic activity and social relations, as well as the mediation of these interactions, especially through law. This survey aims to outline and evaluate some of the main contours of the field as it has developed in this recent period, focusing on the regulation of economic activity. Regulation is seen as having emerged with the withdrawal by governments from direct provision of many economic and social services, to be replaced by corporatist bureaucracies and quasi-public agencies managing the complex public–private interactions of financialized capitalism. The arguments for ‘smart’ regulation have, in an era fixated on neo-liberalism, generally legitimized delegation of responsibility to big business. Its advocates, having been drawn into policy fields, have perhaps too often lost their critical edge, and allowed it to become instrumentalized, reflecting the technicist character of its practice.",2017.0,0.0,548.0,"{'volume': '26', 'pages': '676 - 699', 'name': 'Social & Legal Studies'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Picciotto2017Regulation,\n author = {S.

554,3728f90e115551e777cb0be8a8eb873a5555df0a,Development of Social Mediation and Emotional Regulation in Virtual Learning Environment Research.,"Abstract 
This paper puts forward a series of theoretical underpinnings and design considerations for embodying emotional and aesthetic aspects of virtual (reality) learning environments (VLEs) in support of ubiquitous teaching, studying and learning. The authors assert that a VLE should be considered an interactive and sensation-producing affordances and instruments, as well as a mediator of communication and learning. Furthermore, a VLE should be valued as a tool for emotional and socio-structural mediation, as well as for the psycho-social regulation and control over the communication situation that the environment makes possible by allowing users to regulate psycho-social distances. 
Researchers in studying and learning have too often neglected emotional and aesthetic factors, especially in the context of network-based learning environments. These factors are examined here in terms of seven levels of observation forming a continuum from the individual subconscious/conscious interpersonal level to the social, cultural, cross- and transcultural levels. The continuum is mapped onto learning architectures, offering a greater understanding of their value as starting points and design considerations for VLEs in regulating learning. The most critical issue is to take into account the users — the human individual(s) — and the social nature(s) of using the technologies involved.

Typically experienced in virtual worlds, mediated presence is generated by different technological, cognitive, and emotional factors. The aim of this study was to test how to optimise the virtual experience by manipulating some of these factors. Specifically, we tested if an immersive technology and/or a meaningful narrative context influence the users' sense of presence, providing a more compelling experience than a non-immersive and non-contextualized virtual space. Eighty-four students, randomly divided into four groups, were asked to find a blood container inside a virtual hospital in an immersive or non-immersive condition and with or without an emotionally related narrative. Two presence questionnaires and heart-rate variations were used to measure the effects of the four conditions on the users' sense of presence. Results showed a significant effect of narrative, F(8, 73) = 30.346, p < 0.001, and level of immersion, F (8, 73) = 10.913, p < 0.001, and a significant interaction between narrative and immersion, F(8, 73) = 2.062, p = 0.05, both on the presence questionnaires and on the heart-rate variations. Moreover, considering the factors immersion (I) and narrative (N) together, we found that the I-N condition generated the highest level of presence. We argue that both immersion and narrative are important in creating an effective virtual reality experience because they contribute differently to increasing the sense of presence. Immersion increases the place illusion, while the narrative contributes to generating an emotional response and strengthening the subjects' sense of inner presence.",2011.0,39.0,232.0,"{'volume': '14 3', 'pages': '\n          99-105\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gorini2011TheRO,\n author = {A.

561,37db06525b227be3f76bd650b1187538480e803c,Transtheoretical Model of Change,"The Transtheoretical Model (TTM) outlines the process of altering behavior by integrating leading principles and theories on behavior change. The TTM is comprised of a number of core constructs that include the Stages of Change, Processes of Change, Decisional Balance, Self-Efficacy, and Temptation. The previously identified Stages of Change (or readiness to change) construct is an important dimension of the TTM, as it reflects the model’s critical assumption—behavior change occurs through a series of six stages: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance, and termination. The Processes of Change construct outlines the ten activities that individuals use to progress from stage to stage. Interventions that employ the TTM for behavior change should aim to accurately identify and match an individual’s specific processes of change to their stage of change to maximize efficacy. The Decisional Balance construct refers to an individual’s weighing of the pros and cons of their behavior change. Lastly, the Self-Efficacy construct outlines an individual’s confidence in their ability to not relapse when in high-risk situations that tempt them to engage in a specific behavior. Although the majority of the applications of TTM have focused on smoking cessation, the model has also been applied to other problem behaviors such as alcohol and substance abuse, eating disorders, and domestic violence. In addition to providing a comprehensive overview of the model, this article discusses the various applications of the TTM. This annotated bibliography contains a comprehensive summary of literature on TTM outlining its empirical evidence, effectiveness in various settings, limitations, and future research directions with an emphasis on resources that are relevant to social work practice.",2018.0,2.0,24.0,{'name': 'Social Work'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Craig2018TranstheoreticalMO,\n author = {Shelley L.

562,37fc9bfc2b2059bc25ca2e5f638b7aa7186d29da,Studies in Personal space,"Surprisingly little is known about the way people use space. Social scientists in the field of human ecology have been concerned primarily with the distribution of such things as social classes, economic institutions, and mental illness. An almost unexplored area is microecology or the way that people in pairs or small groups arrange themselves. In the studies of Hediger (5), Howard (6), and Von Uexkull (15), ""space"" has had two different meanings. The more familiar of these refers to space in the geographic sense, i.e., space as area. It is most commonly discussed with reference to the animal's territory or home. However, some writers have applied the concept of territory to human behavior. W. F. Whyte (16) and Thrasher (14) have studied the territories of adolescent gangs. W. H. Whyte (17) also has studied the groupings of people within a housing development. Probably the most intensive investigation thus far has been that of Barker and Wright (2) in the Midwest. Yet this still remains relatively unexplored territory for social scientists. The second way in which the term ""space"" is used can be called ""personal space of the organism."" Although it has its roots in the work of zoologists and ethologists, it is an entirely different concept from that of territory. Personal distance is the distance that the organism customarily places between itself and other organisms. This distance may vary from species to species and individual to individual. Hediger speaks of this as ""flight distance"" and has measured this for hundreds of animals. This concept would seem to have relevance for the study of human behavior, although it has never been studied empirically so far as we know. It seems obvious that people feel uncomfortable when they talk to others who either stand too close or too far away. The concept itself has been used several times in the literature. David Katz (8) used the term ""personal space"" and compared it to the shell of a snail. Von Uexkull used the graphic analogy of people ""surrounded by soap-bubble worlds."" Stern (13) developed the concept of personal world. He noted that the physical world was without a center, but the",1959.0,8.0,422.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '247-260', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Sommer1959StudiesIP,\n author = {R.

However, a practical clinical definition is as follows-gratitude is the appreciation of what is valuable and meaningful to oneself; it is a general state of thankfulness and/or appreciation. The majority of empirical studies indicate that there is an association between gratitude and a sense of overall well being. However, there are several studies that indicate potential nuances in the relationship between gratitude and well being as well as studies with negative findings. In terms of assessing gratitude, numerous assessment measures are available. From a clinical perspective, there are suggested therapeutic exercises and techniques to enhance gratitude, and they appear relatively simple and easy to integrate into psychotherapy practice.

567,38356f194b8c2337bf0d2e2fd325cc3e49ba6a95,A Holistic Framework to Improve the Uptake and Impact of eHealth Technologies,"Background Many eHealth technologies are not successful in realizing sustainable innovations in health care practices. One of the reasons for this is that the current development of eHealth technology often disregards the interdependencies between technology, human characteristics, and the socioeconomic environment, resulting in technology that has a low impact in health care practices. To overcome the hurdles with eHealth design and implementation, a new, holistic approach to the development of eHealth technologies is needed, one that takes into account the complexity of health care and the rituals and habits of patients and other stakeholders. Objective The aim of this viewpoint paper is to improve the uptake and impact of eHealth technologies by advocating a holistic approach toward their development and eventual integration in the health sector. Methods To identify the potential and limitations of current eHealth frameworks (1999–2009), we carried out a literature search in the following electronic databases: PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Knowledge, PiCarta, and Google Scholar. Of the 60 papers that were identified, 44 were selected for full review. We excluded those papers that did not describe hands-on guidelines or quality criteria for the design, implementation, and evaluation of eHealth technologies (28 papers). From the results retrieved, we identified 16 eHealth frameworks that matched the inclusion criteria. The outcomes were used to posit strategies and principles for a holistic approach toward the development of eHealth technologies; these principles underpin our holistic eHealth framework. Results A total of 16 frameworks qualified for a final analysis, based on their theoretical backgrounds and visions on eHealth, and the strategies and conditions for the research and development of eHealth technologies. Despite their potential, the relationship between the visions on eHealth, proposed strategies, and research methods is obscure, perhaps due to a rather conceptual approach that focuses on the rationale behind the frameworks rather than on practical guidelines. In addition, the Web 2.0 technologies that call for a more stakeholder-driven approach are beyond the scope of current frameworks. To overcome these limitations, we composed a holistic framework based on a participatory development approach, persuasive design techniques, and business modeling. Conclusions To demonstrate the impact of eHealth technologies more effectively, a fresh way of thinking is required about how technology can be used to innovate health care. It also requires new concepts and instruments to develop and implement technologies in practice. The proposed framework serves as an evidence-based roadmap.",2011.0,120.0,904.0,"{'volume': '13', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gemert-Pijnen2011AHF,\n author = {J.

It then deploys a walkthrough technique to systematically and forensically step through the various stages of app registration and entry, everyday use and discontinuation of use. The walkthrough method establishes a foundational corpus of data upon which can be built a more detailed analysis of an app’s intended purpose, embedded cultural meanings and implied ideal users and uses.

In light of these interesting but mixed findings, our research applies the motivation theory to investigate the effects of extrinsic and intrinsic motivators on system-use behavior in utilitarian, hedonic, and dual-purposed contexts. We then construct associated hypotheses and empirically test them by analyzing data collected from the literature. The results generally confirm our prediction that, in the context of utilitarian systems, extrinsic motivators are more important than intrinsic motivators, whereas, in the context of hedonic systems, intrinsic motivators play a more critical role than extrinsic motivators. The results thus substantiate our contention that, when information systems vary from utilitarian to hedonic, the most important determinants shift from extrinsic to intrinsic motivators. This paper contributes not only to a new application of the motivation theory to IT adoption, but also to an integrated and in-depth analysis of motivators, which may reorient IS scholars toward potentially more fruitful avenues for studying user behavior.",2013.0,68.0,252.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '1', 'name': 'J.

Struggling to deal with those challenges can have a significant impact on the psychological well-being of the partner, and on the quality and stability of the relationship. Compared with the general population, partners generally report higher levels of anxiety, stress and depression [1,2]; and lower levels of positive well-being, quality of life and life satisfaction [1,2]. Although there may be improvements [2], these difficulties can persist for many years after the TBI [3]. In terms of the impact on the relationship, methodological inadequacies in the research mean that there is, as yet, no clear answer to the question of whether TBI increases the rate of marital breakdown compared with the general population [4]. However, on measures of overall marital quality and satisfaction, partners tend to give their current relationship a poorer rating in comparison to the general population and to the preinjury relationship [4,5]. The primary aim of this overview is to summarize research about the partner’s negative experiences of TBI that may explain this damaging impact that the injury can have on their psychological well-being and the relationship. Understanding the experiences that contribute to the impact will highlight issues that need to be addressed in supporting couples after a TBI. The overview describes experiences both in the initial stages and in the longer term. It addresses the partner’s experience of more severe TBI (i.e., one that requires hospitalization and has long-lasting effects) rather than mild TBI. It should be noted that, although all the research papers cited in the review included at least some participants who were the partners of someone with a more severe TBI, a substantial number used mixed samples that contained participants who had other forms of brain injury (e.g., stroke), other familial relationships with the person with the injury (e.g., parents) or experience of mild TBI. Some partners have more positive experiences of TBI and this research, which is more limited in extent, will also be summarized. Understanding positive experiences may shed light on why some partners cope better than others.",2016.0,20.0,8.0,"{'volume': '1', 'name': 'Concussion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Riley2016ThePE,\n author = {G.

The architecture supports seven commercial physiological sensing technologies and can be deployed in immersive and non-immersive VR systems. To demonstrate the concept, we developed the “The Emotional Labyrinth,” a non-linear scenario in which navigation in a procedurally generated three-dimensional maze is entirely decided by the user, and whose features are dynamically adapted according to a set of emotional states. During navigation, affective states are dynamically represented through pictures, music, and animated visual metaphors chosen to represent and induce affective states. The underlying hypothesis is that exposing users to multimodal representations of their affective states can create a feedback loop that supports emotional self-awareness and fosters more effective emotional regulation strategies. We carried out a first study to, first, assess the effectiveness of the selected metaphors in inducing target emotions, and second, identify relevant psycho-physiological markers of the emotional experience generated by the labyrinth. Results show that the Emotional Labyrinth is overall a pleasant experience in which the proposed procedural content generation can induce distinctive psycho-physiological patterns, generally coherent with the meaning of the metaphors used in the labyrinth design. Furthermore, collected psycho-physiological responses such as electrocardiography, respiration, electrodermal activity, and electromyography are used to generate computational models of users’ reported experience. These models enable the future implementation of the closed loop mechanism to adapt the Labyrinth procedurally to the users’ affective state.",2019.0,71.0,43.0,"{'name': 'IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics', 'pages': '1877-1887', 'volume': '23'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Badia2019TowardEA,\n author = {S.

All these factors may have caused significant stress and led to anxiety and depression in students. The purpose of this study was to study the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 associated mental health morbidity in students in the United States (US). Methods: A online cross-sectional survey was conducted using two instruments – the Perceived Stress Scale-4 (PSS-4) and the Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety-4 (PHQ-4). The survey was administered in the months of March to June during the COVID-19 pandemic to both high school and undergraduate college students. Results: In total, 369 students agreed to participate: 51.8% were male, 44.1% were college students. An elevated perceived stress level (PSS4 > 8) and a positive mood disorder (PHQ-4 > 4) was present in 49.6% and 56.6% of respondents, respectively. The mean (SD) PSS scores in males and females were 6.7 (2.7) and 8.2 (2.9) respectively among all the respondents, while the mean (SD) PHQ scores in males and females were 3.7 (3.2) and 5.3 (3.2) respectively. Prevalence of anxiety and depression in the respondents was 35.0% and 36.3% respectively. Females students reported higher PSS and PHQ scores compared to male students. There is a significant correlation between PSS and PHQ (r=0.66) Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an extremely high level of stress and mental health morbidity in both high school and college students, and this is more pronounced in females.

Operating at the intersection of the entertainment and interactivity, communication and content industries, social media entertainment creators have harnessed these platforms to generate new kinds of content separate from the century-long model of intellectual property control in the traditional entertainment industry. Social media entertainment has expanded rapidly and the traditional entertainment industry has been forced to cede significant power and influence to content creators, their fans, and subscribers. Digital platforms have created a natural market for embedded advertising, changing the worlds of marketing and communication in their wake.

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to develop a theoretical model to investigate the determinants of continuance intention toward social networking sites (SNSs) by integrating the perspectives of the uses and gratifications theory, perceived interactivity and network externalities.


Design/methodology/approach
Data collected from 255 Facebook users in Taiwan were used to test the proposed model. The partial least squares method was used to test the measurement model and the structural model.


Findings
The findings reveal that emotional gratifications and social gratifications are the key predictors of users’ continuance intention toward SNSs. Further, the results indicate that perceived network size, perceived complementarity, machine interactivity and person interactivity influence information gratifications significantly, while perceived complementarity, machine interactivity and person interactivity exert positive effects on emotional gratifications. Finally, the results show that machine interactivity and person interactivity impact social gratifications positively, whereas perceived network size and perceived complementarity affect machine interactivity and person interactivity significantly.


Originality/value
This study is one of the earliest research inquiries to examine the effects of various types of gratifications on continuance intention. It is also one of the earliest studies to identify the antecedents of gratifications from social factors and technological attributes simultaneously.

The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is an instrument that factors a number of aspects of real-life decision-making. Although most SDIs are impaired on the IGT, there is a subgroup of them who perform normally on this task. One possible explanation for this differential performance is that impairment in decision-making is largely detected on the IGT when the use of drugs escalates in the face of rising adverse consequences. The aim of this study is to test this hypothesis, by examining if several real-life indices associated with escalation of addiction severity (as measured by the Addiction Severity Index -ASI-) are predictive of risky decisions, as revealed by impaired performance on different versions of the IGT. We administered the ASI and different versions of the IGT (the main IGT version, a variant IGT version, and two parallel versions of each) to a large sample of SDI. We used regression models to examine the predictive effects of the seven real-life domains assessed by the ASI on decision-making performance as measured by the IGT. We included in regression models both ASI-derived objective and subjective measures of each problem domain. Results showed (i) that several aspects of real-life functioning associated with addiction severity were moderate predictors of IGT decision-making performance; (ii) that the combined assessment of decision-making using different versions of the IGT yielded better predictive measures than assessment using isolated versions of the IGT; and (iii) that objective measures of real-life functioning were better predictors of decision-making performance on the IGT than subjective measures based on SDI's insight about their problems. These results support the notion that decision-making deficits as measured by the IGT are associated with a rise in real-life adverse consequences of addiction.",2006.0,39.0,53.0,"{'volume': '46', 'pages': '55-78', 'name': 'Psychologica Belgica'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Verdéjo-Garcia2006DecisionMakingAT,\n author = {A.

The Internet makes participant relatively easy to switch for one VC to another VC that provides similar content or services. However, many VCs have failed due to the reluctance of members to continue their participation in these VCs. In volatile cyberspaces, VCs without specific domain knowledge may face challenges such as large populations, unstable memberships, and imperfect information and memory, which also affect knowledge flows within members. The most important aspect of VCs from the members’ perspective is the increase satisfaction, and engage behavioral intention to use VCs, but satisfaction does not always predict continuous usage. This study proposes a conceptual model based on commitment-trust theory (CTT) and investigates the continuance intention in VC. It seeks to theorize the antecedents and consequence of relationship commitment in the VCs and identify how CTT can be adapted in a knowledge sharing environment. The members of Programmer Club, a representative professional community in Taiwan, were chosen to participate in the survey, and 488 usable responses were collected in three months.

With a surge of studies in affective neuroscience in recent decades, scientists are poised to answer this question. In this target article, we present a meta-analytic summary of the neuroimaging literature on human emotion. We compare the locationist approach (i.e., the hypothesis that discrete emotion categories consistently and specifically correspond to distinct brain regions) with the psychological constructionist approach (i.e., the hypothesis that discrete emotion categories are constructed of more general brain networks not specific to those categories) to better understand the brain basis of emotion. We review both locationist and psychological constructionist hypotheses of brain–emotion correspondence and report meta-analytic findings bearing on these hypotheses. Overall, we found little evidence that discrete emotion categories can be consistently and specifically localized to distinct brain regions. Instead, we found evidence that is consistent with a psychological constructionist approach to the mind: A set of interacting brain regions commonly involved in basic psychological operations of both an emotional and non-emotional nature are active during emotion experience and perception across a range of discrete emotion categories.",2012.0,1004.0,1663.0,"{'volume': '35', 'pages': '121 - 143', 'name': 'Behavioral and Brain Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lindquist2012TheBB,\n author = {Kristen A.

We propose that the degree of immersion can be objectively assessed as the characteristics of a technology, and has dimensions such as the extent to which a display system can deliver an inclusive, extensive, surrounding, and vivid illusion of virtual environment to a participant. Other dimensions of immersion are concerned with the extent of body matching, and the extent to which there is a self-contained plot in which the participant can act and in which there is an autonomous response. Presence is a state of consciousness that may be concomitant with immersion, and is related to a sense of being in a place. Presence governs aspects of autonomie responses and higher-level behaviors of a participant in a VE.

While pharmacologic interventions have shown promise for enhancing empathic accuracy, little is known about the effects of behavioral interventions on empathic accuracy and related brain activity. This study employed a randomized, controlled and longitudinal design to investigate the effect of a secularized analytical compassion meditation program, cognitive-based compassion training (CBCT), on empathic accuracy. Twenty-one healthy participants received functional MRI scans while completing an empathic accuracy task, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), both prior to and after completion of either CBCT or a health discussion control group. Upon completion of the study interventions, participants randomized to CBCT and were significantly more likely than control subjects to have increased scores on the RMET and increased neural activity in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Moreover, changes in dmPFC and IFG activity from baseline to the post-intervention assessment were associated with changes in empathic accuracy. These findings suggest that CBCT may hold promise as a behavioral intervention for enhancing empathic accuracy and the neurobiology supporting it.",2013.0,59.0,206.0,"{'volume': '8 1', 'pages': '\n          48-55\n        ', 'name': 'Social cognitive and affective neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mascaro2013CompassionME,\n author = {Jennifer S.

619,3d467fffb1e0e951eb5c888611bf88e4d4b89a56,A meta-analysis of the effect of substance use interventions on emotion outcomes.,"OBJECTIVE
Emotional distress has been posited as a key underlying mechanism in the development and maintenance of substance use disorder (SUD), and patients seeking SUD treatment are often experiencing high levels of negative emotion and/or low levels of positive emotion. But the extent to which SUD interventions impact emotional outcomes among general SUD populations is yet unquantified. The current meta-analysis aims to fill this gap.


METHOD
A total of 11,754 records were screened for randomized, controlled trials examining the effect of behavioral SUD interventions on emotion outcomes. Our search yielded a total of 138 effect sizes calculated based on data from 5,146 individuals enrolled in 30 independent clinical trials. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to calculate pooled effect sizes, and metaregression analyses examined study-level moderators (e.g., intervention type).


RESULTS
Findings indicated a small but significant effect of SUD interventions on emotion outcomes, d = 0.157, 95% CI [0.052, 0.262] (k = 30). The effect size for negative emotion was nominally bigger, d = 0.162, 95% CI [0.056, 0.269] (k = 30), whereas the effect for positive emotion did not reach statistical significance, d = 0.062, 95% CI [-0.089, 0.213] (k = 7). Studies featuring SUD interventions designed to specifically target emotions (i.e., affect-regulation, mindfulness-based treatments) produced larger reductions in negative emotion compared with studies featuring interventions that did not contain specific emotion modules (e.g., contingency management).


CONCLUSIONS
Findings suggest that SUD interventions-especially mindfulness-based and affect-regulation treatments-indeed significantly reduce negative emotion, although relatively small effect sizes indicate potential room for improvement. Conclusions regarding positive emotion should be considered preliminary because of the limited numbers of samples assessing these outcomes.

However, the effects on emotional arousal by using these two visual modes have not been comprehensively investigated, and the underlying neural mechanisms are not yet clear. This paper presents a cognitive psychological experiment that was conducted to analyze how these two visual modes impact emotional arousal. Forty volunteers were recruited and were randomly assigned to two groups. They were asked to watch a series of positive, neutral and negative short VR videos in 2D and 3D. Multichannel electroencephalograms (EEG) and skin conductance responses (SCR) were recorded simultaneously during their participation. The results indicated that emotional stimulation was more intense in the 3D environment due to the improved perception of the environment; greater emotional arousal was generated; and higher beta (21–30 Hz) EEG power was identified in 3D than in 2D.

On Twitch.tv – the leading platform for gameplay streaming – influencers livestream themselves playing games while viewers watch and interact with them. Previous research suggests that social interaction may be critical for a successful stream but has not studied gameplay streams as Interaction Rituals, a model describing how interaction lead to social motivation. Analysis of four gameplay streams shows how the streamer, through inclusion strategies and active viewer participation, promote viewer engagement in a way that resembles the mechanisms of offline Interaction Rituals. The model, therefore, appears to be useful for understanding how successful gameplay streams draw a returning audience through producing positive social emotions and parasocial attachment to the group.",2021.0,28.0,17.0,"{'volume': '25', 'pages': '1969 - 1986', 'name': 'Information, Communication & Society'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Jodén2021BuildingVE,\n author = {Henrik Jodén and Jacob Strandell},\n journal = {Information, Communication & Society},\n pages = {1969 - 1986},\n title = {Building viewer engagement through interaction rituals on Twitch.tv},\n volume = {25},\n year = {2021}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2114279966', 'name': 'Henrik Jodén'}, {'authorId': '49138642', 'name': 'Jacob Strandell'}]"

However, there is mixed evidence on the implementation of emotion regulation strategies across the life span. To clarify the discrepancies in the literature, we examined the modulating influence of contextual factors in understanding emotion regulation strategy use in older and young adults. Forty-eight older adults and forty-nine young adults completed a retrospective survey inquiring about the use of emotion regulation strategies in emotion-eliciting situations experienced over the preceding 2 weeks. We used factor analysis to establish clusters of emotion regulation strategies, resulting in cognitive strategies, acceptance, and maladaptive strategies. Overall, we found context-dependent age-related differences in emotion regulation strategy use. Specifically, older adults reported greater use of acceptance than young adults in situations of moderate intensity and in situations that evoke anxiety and sadness. In addition, older adults reported using maladaptive strategies to a lesser extent in high- and moderate-intensity situations and in situations that elicit anxiety and sadness when compared with young adults. There were no age-related differences in the use of cognitive strategies across contexts. Older adults, compared to young adults, reported less use of maladaptive strategies and greater use of acceptance than young adults, which suggests that the enhanced emotional functioning observed later in life may be due to a shift in strategy implementation.

Objective To present nationally representative data on the prevalence and comorbidity of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM–IV) alcohol and drug use disorders and independent mood and anxiety disorders (including only those that are not substance induced and that are not due to a general medical condition). Design Face-to-face survey. Setting The United States. Participants Household and group quarters residents. Main Outcome Measures Prevalence and associations of substance use disorders and independent mood and anxiety disorders. Results The prevalences of 12-month DSM–IV independent mood and anxiety disorders in the U.S. population were 9.21 percent (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 8.78 percent–9.64 percent) and 11.08 percent (95 percent CI, 10.43 percent–11.73 percent), respectively. The rate of substance use disorders was 9.35 percent (95 percent CI, 8.86 percent–9.84 percent). Only a few individuals with mood or anxiety disorders were classified as having only substance-induced disorders. Associations between most substance use disorders and independent mood and anxiety disorders were positive and significant (p < .05). Conclusions Substance use disorders and mood and anxiety disorders that develop independently of intoxication and withdrawal are among the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in the United States. Associations between most substance use disorders and independent mood and anxiety disorders were overwhelmingly positive and significant, suggesting that treatment for a comorbid mood or anxiety disorder should not be withheld from individuals with substance use disorders.",2004.0,69.0,1839.0,"{'volume': '29', 'pages': '107 - 120', 'name': 'Alcohol Research & Health'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Grant2004PrevalenceAC,\n author = {B.

In Experiment 1, while seated and then when walking on a treadmill, adults completed Guilford's alternate uses (GAU) test of creative divergent thinking and the compound remote associates (CRA) test of convergent thinking. Walking increased 81% of participants' creativity on the GAU, but only increased 23% of participants' scores for the CRA. In Experiment 2, participants completed the GAU when seated and then walking, when walking and then seated, or when seated twice. Again, walking led to higher GAU scores. Moreover, when seated after walking, participants exhibited a residual creative boost. Experiment 3 generalized the prior effects to outdoor walking. Experiment 4 tested the effect of walking on creative analogy generation. Participants sat inside, walked on a treadmill inside, walked outside, or were rolled outside in a wheelchair. Walking outside produced the most novel and highest quality analogies. The effects of outdoor stimulation and walking were separable.

The present study extends the Sport Interest Inventory (SII) in order to enhance current understanding of consumer motives in relation to sport in general and women’s competitive sport in particular. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the 54-item Sport Interest Inventory, measuring 14 individual difference factors related to spectator interest in soccer. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that five motivational characteristics?a) sport interest, (b) team interest, (c) vicarious achievement, (d) role modeling, and (e) entertainment value—explained 54% of variance in level of spectator support for women’s professional soccer. These results suggest that augmenting traditional spectator measures offers a better understanding of motivational characteristics in different sport situations and of the impact these motivations have on behavior.

640,3f35fea5a7bdeb427a83e392181b5e11df78ddc3,Featured Article: Adolescent Condom Use and Connectivity in the Social–Planful Brain,"Objective
To reduce rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unwanted pregnancy among adolescents, it is critical to investigate brain connectivity that may underlie adolescents' sexual health decision-making in the context of intercourse. This study explored relationships between adolescent condom use frequency and the brain's resting-state functional connectivity, to identify differential patterns of social-affective processing among sexually active youth.


Methods
In this study, N = 143 sexually active adolescents (68.5% male, Mage = 16.2 years, SD = 1.06) completed magnetic resonance imaging and reported past 3-month frequency of condom use. Resting-state connectivity, seeded on a social region of the brain, the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), was assessed to determine its correspondence with protected sex (condom use).


Results
Condom use was associated with positive connectivity between the left TPJ and bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). This relationship was observed in adolescent males only; no connectivity differences were observed with adolescent females.


Conclusions
This study reflects functional synchrony between nodes of the ""social brain,"" including the TPJ, and a region of planfulness and control, the IFG. The relationship between these regions suggests that adolescents who have more coordinated systems of communication between these critical components of the brain are more likely to be successful in planning and engaging in safer sexual decision-making; for young males, this differentiated more frequent from less frequent condom use. In turn, interventions designed to reduce STIs/human immunodeficiency virus may benefit from targeting social-planfulness dimensions to help youth implement safer sex behaviors.",2018.0,41.0,9.0,"{'volume': '43', 'pages': '821–830', 'name': 'Journal of Pediatric Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Caouette2018FeaturedAA,\n author = {Justin D.

Exposure therapy is so far considered to be the most effective treatment, and research suggests that it is mainly based on a habituation process. Based on learning theories, it appears that a passive systemic exposure to traumatic stimuli should not be the best option for the treatment of PTSD. We hypothesis that an active learning of safer and healthier coping strategies combined with systematic exposure should be more effective in reducing the psychological distress associated with PTSD. In this paper, we describe the theoretical foundations of this approach that focuses on the action and activity of the patient in his or her exposure environment. In this approach, we take advantage of Virtual Reality technologies and learning mechanics of serious games to allow the patient to learn new safe associations while promoting the empowerment. We named this action-centered exposure therapy (ACET). This approach exploits behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism learning theories. With the different benefits of virtual reality technologies, this approach would easily integrate with in-virtuo exposure therapy and would allow us to exploit as much as possible the enormous potential of these technologies. As a first step toward validation, we present a case study that supports the ACET approach.",2018.0,64.0,14.0,"{'volume': '8', 'name': 'Behavioral Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kengne2018ActionCenteredET,\n author = {Sorelle Audrey Kamkuimo Kengne and Mathilde Fossaert and B.

Virtual reality (VR) may potentially be effectively utilized in anger management, and this study aimed to verify the applicability of the VR-based anger control training program. The data obtained by having 60 young male participants divided into 2 groups, the high aggression group and the low aggression group, based on their Aggression Questionnaire scores to execute this program were analyzed. The program consisted of ""Anger Exposure Training"" for provoking anger and facilitating anger control and ""Mindfulness Training"" for providing the meditation experience for controlling anger. The anger scores and comfort scores obtained from these tasks, respectively, were analyzed for differences between the groups and between the experimental conditions. The anger regulation and comfort enhancement rates were analyzed for correlations with psychological variables. In Anger Exposure Training, the anger scores in angry expression were reduced in managed expression of anger in both groups. In Mindfulness Training, meditation increased comfort score as well in both groups, and the comfort enhancement rates were negatively correlated with the levels of self-differentiation and open communication with mother only in the high aggression group. These results indicate that the VR environments can provide an effective means of trainings for managing anger. Therefore, further research on the effectiveness of the VR-based anger control training program is worthy conducting in individuals who express excessive aggression.",2022.0,34.0,3.0,"{'name': 'Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Jo2022TheAO,\n author = {Hye-Jeong Jo and Y.

As important as the data made available by these new technologies have been, equally important have been the guides provided by existing theories and the converging evidence provided by other methodologies. The field of psychological science is no exception. Neuroimaging is an important new tool in the toolbox of psychological science, but it is most productive when its use is guided by psychological theories and complemented by converging methodologies including (but not limited to) lesion, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral studies. Based on this approach, the articles in this special issue specify neural mechanisms involved in perception, attention, categorization, memory, recognition, attitudes, social cognition, language, motor coordination, emotional regulation, executive function, decision making, and depression. Understanding the contributions of individual and functionally connected brain regions to these processes benefits psychological theory by suggesting functional representations and processes, constraining these processes, producing means of falsifying hypotheses, and generating new hypotheses.

To address this uncertainty, this paper attempts to systematically examine the impact of CMV on the inferences drawn from survey research in the IS area. First, we describe the available approaches for assessing CMV and conduct an empirical study to compare them. From an actual survey involving 227 respondents, we find that although CMV is present in the research areas examined, such biases are not substantial. The results also suggest that few differences exist between the relatively new marker-variable technique and other well-established conventional tools in terms of their ability to detect CMV. Accordingly, the marker-variable technique was employed to infer the effect of CMV on correlations from previously published studies. Our findings, based on the reanalysis of 216 correlations, suggest that the inflated correlation caused by CMV may be expected to be on the order of 0.10 or less, and most of the originally significant correlations remain significant even after controlling for CMV. Finally, by extending the marker-variable technique, we examined the effect of CMV on structural relationships in past literature. Our reanalysis reveals that contrary to the concerns of some skeptics, CMV-adjusted structural relationships not only remain largely significant but also are not statistically differentiable from uncorrected estimates. In summary, this comprehensive and systematic analysis offers initial evidence that (1) the marker-variable technique can serve as a convenient, yet effective, tool for accounting for CMV, and (2) common method biases in the IS domain are not as serious as those found in other disciplines.",2006.0,64.0,2690.0,"{'volume': '52', 'pages': '1865-1883', 'name': 'Manag.

This paper presents an empirical study of how video production decisions affect student engagement in online educational videos. To our knowledge, ours is the largest-scale study of video engagement to date, using data from 6.9 million video watching sessions across four courses on the edX MOOC platform. We measure engagement by how long students are watching each video, and whether they attempt to answer post-video assessment problems. Our main findings are that shorter videos are much more engaging, that informal talking-head videos are more engaging, that Khan-style tablet drawings are more engaging, that even high-quality pre-recorded classroom lectures might not make for engaging online videos, and that students engage differently with lecture and tutorial videos.

The power of the framework comes from the components themselves, as well as from considering these components in concert and making connections between them.

The fears can arise, for example, from paranoia, hallucinations, social anxiety or negative-self beliefs. The fears lead patients to withdraw from activities, and this isolation leads to a cycle of worsening physical and mental health. Breaking this cycle requires highly active treatment directly in the troubling situations so that patients learn that they can safely and confidently enter them. However patients with psychosis seldom receive such life-changing interventions. To solve this problem we have developed an automated psychological treatment delivered in virtual reality (VR). It allows patients to experience computer simulations of the situations that they find anxiety-provoking. A virtual coach guides patients, using cognitive techniques, in how to overcome their fears. Patients are willing to enter VR simulations of anxiety-provoking situations because they know the simulations are not real, but the learning made transfers to the real world. Methods and analysis 432 patients with psychosis and anxious avoidance of social situations will be recruited from National Health Service (NHS) secondary care services. In the gameChange trial, they will be randomised (1:1) to the six-session VR cognitive treatment added to treatment as usual or treatment as usual alone. Assessments will be conducted at 0, 6 (post-treatment) and 26 weeks by a researcher blind to allocation. The primary outcome is avoidance and distress in real-life situations, using a behavioural assessment task, at 6 weeks. The secondary outcomes are psychiatric symptoms, activity levels and quality of life. All main analyses will be intention-to-treat. Moderation and mediation will be tested. An economic evaluation will be conducted. Ethics and dissemination The trial has received ethical approval from the NHS South Central - Oxford B Research Ethics Committee (19/SC/0075). A key output will be a high-quality automated VR treatment for patients to overcome anxious avoidance of social situations.

However, most previous research has been limited to the use of static images of prototypical expressive patterns. This article explores the role of facial dynamics in the perception of emotions, reviewing relevant empirical evidence demonstrating that dynamic information improves coherence in the identification of affect (particularly for degraded and subtle stimuli), leads to higher emotion judgments (i.e., intensity and arousal), and helps to differentiate between genuine and fake expressions. The findings underline that using static expressions not only poses problems of ecological validity, but also limits our understanding of what facial activity does.

661,4210ac5e407ac796c137c003bcb52bd4378154e8,The influence of facial expression at perceptual threshold on electrodermal activity and social comfort distance.,"Interpersonal distance, an essential component of social interaction, is modulated by the emotion conveyed by others and associated physiological response. However, in modern societies with overcrowded and hyperstimulating environments, we can only surreptitiously glimpse the faces of others in order to quickly make behavioral adjustments. How this impacts social interactions is not yet well understood. In the present study, we investigated this issue by testing whether facial expressions that are difficult to identify modify the physiological response (Electrodermal Activity, EDA) and subsequent judgment of interpersonal comfort distance. We recorded participants' EDA while they provided comfort judgments to interpersonal distances with a Point-Light Walker (PLW). The PLW, with an emotionally neutral gait, moved toward and crossed participants at various distances after the latter were exposed to a negative (anger), positive (happiness) or neutral facial expression presented at the perceptual threshold. Bayesian analyses of the data revealed an increase versus decrease of interpersonal comfort distance with the PLW depending on the negative versus positive emotional valence of the facial expression. They also showed an increase in EDA when the approaching PLW violated interpersonal comfort distance after participants were exposed to an angry facial expression. These effects correlated with the subjective assessment of the arousal of facial expressions. Thus, previous exposure to barely visible facial expressions can alter the representation of social comfort space and the physiological response associated with a violation of interpersonal comfort distances, depending on the valence and arousal of the emotional social stimuli.",2020.0,55.0,12.0,"{'pages': '\n          e13600\n        ', 'name': 'Psychophysiology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cartaud2020TheIO,\n author = {A.

With virtual reality (VR), computer-generated interactive environments, individuals can repeatedly experience their problematic situations and be taught, via evidence-based psychological treatments, how to overcome difficulties. VR is moving out of specialist laboratories. Our central aim was to describe the potential of VR in mental health, including a consideration of the first 20 years of applications. A systematic review of empirical studies was conducted. In all, 285 studies were identified, with 86 concerning assessment, 45 theory development, and 154 treatment. The main disorders researched were anxiety (n = 192), schizophrenia (n = 44), substance-related disorders (n = 22) and eating disorders (n = 18). There are pioneering early studies, but the methodological quality of studies was generally low. The gaps in meaningful applications to mental health are extensive. The most established finding is that VR exposure-based treatments can reduce anxiety disorders, but there are numerous research and treatment avenues of promise. VR was found to be a much-misused term, often applied to non-interactive and non-immersive technologies. We conclude that VR has the potential to transform the assessment, understanding and treatment of mental health problems. The treatment possibilities will only be realized if – with the user experience at the heart of design – the best immersive VR technology is combined with targeted translational interventions. The capability of VR to simulate reality could greatly increase access to psychological therapies, while treatment outcomes could be enhanced by the technology's ability to create new realities. VR may merit the level of attention given to neuroimaging.",2017.0,67.0,617.0,"{'volume': '47', 'pages': '2393 - 2400', 'name': 'Psychological Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Freeman2017VirtualRI,\n author = {Daniel Freeman and S.

A number of recognition methods have been applied in recent years to recognize human emotion. The motivation for this study is therefore to discover a combination of emotion features and recognition method that will produce the best result in building an efficient emotion recognizer in an affective system. We introduced a shifted tanh normalization scheme to realize the inverse Fisher transformation applied to the DEAP physiological dataset and consequently performed series of experiments using the Radial Basis Function Artificial Neural Networks (RBFANN). In our experiments, we have compared the performances of digital image based feature extraction techniques such as the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG), Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and the Histogram of Images (HIM). These feature extraction techniques were utilized to extract discriminatory features from the multimodal DEAP dataset of physiological signals. Experimental results obtained indicate that the best recognition accuracy was achieved with the EEG modality data using the HIM features extraction technique and classification done along the dominance emotion dimension. The result is very remarkable when compared with existing results in the literature including deep learning studies that have utilized the DEAP corpus and also applicable to diverse fields of engineering studies.",2021.0,87.0,1.0,{'name': 'The International Journal of Integrated Engineering'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Abayomi2021RecognitionOH,\n author = {A.

In ""Emotions Revealed,"" Ekman distills decades of research into a practical, mind-opening, and life-changing guide to reading the emotions of those around us. He answers such questions as: How does our body signal to others whether we are slightly sad or anguished, peeved or enraged? Can we learn to distinguish between a polite smile and the genuine thing? Can we ever truly control our emotions? Packed with unique exercises and photographs, and a new chapter on emotions and lying that encompasses security and terrorism as well as gut decisions, ""Emotions Revealed"" is an indispensable resource for navigating our emotional world.""",2003.0,18.0,1401.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Ekman2003EmotionsRR,\n author = {P.

It also brought the importance of daily emotional management for survival to the forefront of every human being. Our study aims to explore whether emotional processes perform different functions during waking thoughts and night dreams during the first lockdown in Italy. Utilizing Multiple Code Theory (MCT), our goal is to verify whether waking thoughts facilitate a functional disconnection in order to manage the trauma caused by COVID-19. Two online forms were distributed to random participants in the general population, presenting a total of 49 reports of night dreams (23 males; mean age 33.45 ds. 10.12; word mean 238.54 ds. 146.8) and 48 reports of waking thoughts (25 males; mean age 34.54 ds. 12.8; word mean M. 91 words ds. 23). The Referential Process linguistic measures and Affect Salience Index were utilized. It was found that Affect Salience is present in both dreams and in waking thoughts; however, Referential Activity was higher in dreams and Reflection and Affect words were higher in waking thoughts. Two different processes of emotional elaboration emerged. The results highlight the use of greater symbolization processes during dreams and a higher emotional distance in waking thoughts. These results confirm that during the nocturnal processes, there is greater contact with the processing of trauma, while during the diurnal processes, defensive strategies were activated to cope with and manage life via a moment of the defensive disruption of daily activities.",2021.0,107.0,7.0,"{'volume': '12', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mariani2021NarrativesOD,\n author = {R.

First, this paper describes the psycho-educational potential of the horror-themed biofeedback game Nevermind. In Nevermind, players' heart rate is continuously read into the game which in turn adapts to the player's momentary levels of negative affective arousal. Greater negative arousal causes the game and its horror-themed settings to become more disturbing. As a result, Nevermind challenges players to improve their emotion regulation skills by encouraging them to healthily down-regulate their negative affective states in the face of stressful situations. Second, Nevermind implements valuable design practices, practices which we share here. Finally, we describe a recent study conducted on 47 players.

However, there are barriers that constrain group attendance, such as mobility, time, and distance. Using videoconferencing may overcome known barriers and improve the accessibility of group-based interventions. Objective The aim of this study was to review the literature to determine the feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, and implementation of health professional–led group videoconferencing to provide education or social support or both, into the home setting. Methods Electronic databases were searched using predefined search terms for primary interventions for patient education and/or social support. The quality of studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. We developed an analysis framework using hierarchical terms feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, and implementation, which were informed by subheadings. Results Of the 1634 records identified, 17 were included in this review. Home-based groups by videoconferencing are feasible even for those with limited digital literacy. Overall acceptability was high with access from the home highly valued and little concern of privacy issues. Some participants reported preferring face-to-face groups. Good information technology (IT) support and training is required for facilitators and participants. Communication can be adapted for the Web environment and would be enhanced by clear communication strategies and protocols. A range of improved outcomes were reported but because of the heterogeneity of studies, comparison of these across studies was not possible. There was a trend for improvement in mental health outcomes. Benefits highlighted in the qualitative data included engaging with others with similar problems; improved accessibility to groups; and development of health knowledge, insights, and skills. Videoconference groups were able to replicate group processes such as bonding and cohesiveness. Similar outcomes were reported for those comparing face-to-face groups and videoconference groups. Conclusions Groups delivered by videoconference are feasible and potentially can improve the accessibility of group interventions. This may be particularly useful for those who live in rural areas, have limited mobility, are socially isolated, or fear meeting new people. Outcomes are similar to in-person groups, but future research on facilitation process in videoconferencing-mediated groups and large-scale studies are required to develop the evidence base.",2018.0,72.0,195.0,"{'volume': '20', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Banbury2018TelehealthID,\n author = {Annie Banbury and S.

The findings suggest that the 3D virtual world environment produces both positive and negative effects on brand equity when compared to the 2D environment. The positive effect of the 3D virtual world environment on brand equity occurs through telepresence, a specific aspect of flow, as well as enjoyment. The negative effect on brand equity can be explained using distraction-conflict theory in which attentional conflicts faced by users of a highly interactive and rich medium resulted in distractions from attending to the brand. Brand equity, in turn, has a positive effect on behavioral intention. The results suggest that although the 3D virtual world environment has the potential to increase brand equity by offering an immersive and enjoyable virtual product experience, the rich environment can also be a distraction. Therefore, developers of virtual world branding sites need to take into account limitations in the information processing capacity and attention span of users when designing their sites in order to avoid cognitive overload, which can lead to users being distracted from branding information.

The authors also examined the relationships between homophily and parasocial interaction with the teen moms featured in 16 and Pregnant and attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral intentions, finding that homophily predicted lower risk perceptions, greater acceptance of myths about teen pregnancy, and more favorable attitudes about teen pregnancy. Parasocial interaction demonstrated the same pattern of results, with the addition of also predicting fewer behavioral intentions to avoid teen pregnancy.

The results show that the user motivation follows the hierarchical structure of the layer-by-layer influence from the situational level to the personality level, that is, knowledge-seeking motivation and entertainment-seeking motivation at a situational level will positively affect social- interaction motivation at the contextual level, thereby enhancing user self-efficacy at personality level. Users have abundant integrated emotions toward the virtual knowledge community, namely, satisfaction, attachment, and identity, and such multi-integrated emotional model is more conducive for promoting community commitment of users.

677,4377ee92d2709190eee61be049ddcf5e10effb2a,A preliminary controlled trial of a trans-diagnostic programme for cognitive behaviour therapy with adults with intellectual disability.,"BACKGROUND
Several studies have found a heightened prevalence of mental health disorders in people with intellectual disabilities (ID). There have been a number of successful case series and two promising controlled treatment trials of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for emotional disorders (excluding anger) for people with ID. Several authors have promoted the development of trans-diagnostic approaches to cognitive treatment. The present study extends this work with the development and evaluation of a trans-diagnostic treatment manual for CBT in people with ID.


METHOD
A controlled treatment trial was conducted with 12 participants in treatment and waiting list control data. Each treatment participant was matched to a control on age, IQ, presenting problem, and Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) global severity index (GSI) score. The treatment group was also evaluated on the Glasgow anxiety and depression scales and was followed up for 3 to 6 months after treatment.


RESULTS
There were no significant differences between groups at baseline. Following treatment, the CBT group was significantly improved when compared with the control group on the GSI scale of the BSI. The ancovas for all other measures were not significant but there were significant improvements for the treatment group on all scaled except BSI depression from pre to post-CBT. Gains were maintained to follow up, and changes were associated with large effect sizes.


CONCLUSIONS
It was possible to treat a range of symptoms and psychiatric diagnoses with a general trans-diagnostic CBT manual. The effects of therapy were promising, suggesting that the participants could respond to treatment in a meaningful and helpful manner and supporting the case for further evaluation of the trans-diagnostic approach in ID.",2015.0,23.0,42.0,"{'volume': '59 4', 'pages': '\n          360-9\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lindsay2015APC,\n author = {W.

It is also relevant, as some authors claim, that physical exercise may be considered as an adjunctive therapy to improve cognition and memory after strokes. Thus, the integration of physical and cognitive therapies could offer potential benefits. In addition, in general these therapies are usually considered boring, so it is important to include some features that improve the motivation of patients. As a result, computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation systems and serious games for health are more and more present. In order to achieve a continuous, efficient and sustainable rehabilitation of patients, they will have to be carried out as part of the rehabilitation in their own home. However, current home systems lack the therapist’s presence, and this leads to two major challenges for such systems. First, they need sensors and actuators that compensate for the absence of the therapist’s eyes and hands. Second, the system needs to capture and apply the therapist’s expertise. With this aim, and based on our previous proposals, we propose an ambient intelligence environment for cognitive rehabilitation at home, combining physical and cognitive activities, by implementing a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) that gathers, as far as possible, the knowledge of a rehabilitation expert. Moreover, smart sensors and actuators will attempt to make up for the absence of the therapist. Furthermore, the proposed system will feature a remote monitoring tool, so that the therapist can supervise the patients’ exercises.

To evaluate the relation between alexithymia and Referential Activity (RA), a linguistic measure of the process by which non-verbal emotional experience is connected to language.


METHODS
The 20-Item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and the Toronto Structured Interview for Alexithymia (TSIA) were administered to 20 postgraduate students and 15 outpatients with hypertension. The Weighted Referential Activity Dictionary (WRAD) and other linguistic measures (Reflection, Disfluency, and Somatic Sense) were applied to texts derived from the TSIA using the Discourse Attributes Analysis Program (DAAP).


RESULTS
Multiple linear regressions performed in the whole sample showed a relation between TSIA scores and Somatic Sense. Comparing the two groups, hypertensive subjects yielded higher scores on the TSIA than the young adult sample; no differences in DAAP measures emerged. A significant negative correlation was found between the TAS-20 Difficulty Describing Feelings score and the DAAP measure of references to body activations (Somatic Sense) both in the young adult sample and in hypertensives. In the young adult sample, negative relations emerged between different TSIA factors, WRAD score, and Somatic Sense; a positive relation with fragmented speech (Disfluency) and use of rationalization (Reflection) was also found. In hypertensive subjects, using the TSIA, a negative correlation between alexithymia and Somatic Sense and a positive correlation between alexithymia and the Mean High WRAD (a measure of intensity of engagement during the speech) were found.


CONCLUSION
The TSIA seems to be a more adequate instrument than the TAS-20 to explore relations between alexithymia and RA. Results appear to suggest a complex, nonlinear relation between alexithymia and RA, presumably influenced by subject-specific characteristics.


PRACTITIONER POINTS
A relation between alexithymia and RA has been proposed on theoretical grounds, but there has been minimal empirical investigation. This was the first study to employ both a self-report measure and a structured interview for measuring alexithymia in relation to RA. The results of this study suggest a complex, nonlinear relation between alexithymia and RA; this finding is essentially obtained with the structured interview measure of alexithymia. This relation is presumably influenced by subject-specific characteristics.",2018.0,41.0,26.0,"{'volume': '91', 'pages': '232–247', 'name': 'Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Trani2018AlexithymiaAT,\n author = {M.

685,43f182001ee6d749902932fe3d25371379da234c,Redefining Outcome Measurement: A Model for Brief Psychotherapy.,"CONTEXT
The zeitgeist for short-term psychotherapy efficacy has fundamentally shifted away from evidence-based practices to include evidence-informed practices, resulting in an equally important paradigm shift in outcome measurement designed to reflect change in this short-term modality.


OBJECTIVE
The present article delineates a short-term psychotherapy structure which defines four fundamental stages that all brief therapies may have in common, and are represented through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Solution-Focused Brief Therapy, Narrative Therapy, and Emotion-Focused Therapy.


METHOD
These four theoretical approaches were analyzed via a selected literature review through comparing and contrasting specific and common tasks as they relate to the process of psychotherapy and change. Once commonalities were identified within session, they were categorized or grouped into themes or general stages of change within the parameters of a four to six session model of short-term therapy. Commonalities in therapeutic stages of change may more accurately and uniformly measure outcome in short-term work, unlike the symptom-specific psychometric instruments of longer-term psychotherapy.


RESULTS
A systematic framework for evaluating the client and clinician adherence to 20 specific tasks for these four short-term therapies is presented through the newly proposed, Brief Task Acquisition Scale (BTAS). It is further proposed that the client-clinicians' adherence to these tasks will track and ultimately increase treatment integrity.


CONCLUSION
Thus, when the client-clinician relationship tracks and evaluates the three pillars of (1) stage/process change, (2) task acquisition, and (3) treatment integrity, the culmination of these efforts presents a new way of more sensitively measuring outcome in short-term psychotherapy. Data collection is suggested as a first step to empirically evaluate the testable hypotheses suggested within this current model. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message The clinician practitioner will note that the proposed Brief Services model removes the subjectivity of client satisfaction as a reliable outcome measure, and relies upon client and therapist adherence to specific tasks and stages of change within and across short-term psychotherapy. The clinical significance of the BTAS for the practitioner is three fold. The psychometric instrument (1) tracks stage or process change, (2) guides task acquisition, and (3) incorporates greater treatment integrity unlike other outcome measures. The BTAS present a new way of conceptualizing change in short-term psychotherapy regardless of modality or presenting issue, making it a more flexible and usable instrument for the clinician. The BTAS may measure outcome more sensitively and accurately, thus offering the client, therapist and client-therapist more information regarding change at each stage and at the end of short-term psychotherapy.",2016.0,27.0,9.0,"{'volume': '23 3', 'pages': '\n          260-71\n        ', 'name': 'Clinical psychology & psychotherapy'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{McGuinty2016RedefiningOM,\n author = {Everett McGuinty and John Nelson and A.

687,443136202ddf2b5a8fc95ba8eacfa2dc1274c22d,Emotion regulation in autism spectrum disorder: evidence from parent interviews and children's daily diaries.,"BACKGROUND
Although emotion dysregulation is not a defining feature of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), there is a growing consensus that emotional problems play a prominent role in this disorder.


METHODS
The present study examined a wide range of emotion regulation (ER) strategies in 32 individuals with ASD compared to 31 group-matched typically developing (TD) participants in three emotional domains (anger, anxiety, and amusement). Parents of individuals with ASD and TD individuals were interviewed about their child's emotional experience and the use and efficacy of 10 ER strategies. In addition, participants filled out daily diaries on experience and regulation in the same emotional domains.


RESULTS
Compared to TD individuals, parents reported that individuals with ASD experienced more anger and anxiety and less amusement, made less frequent use of a variety of adaptive ER strategies (e.g. problem solving, cognitive reappraisal), and made more frequent use of maladaptive strategies (e.g. repetitive behavior). Moreover, individuals with ASD were less effective at utilizing adaptive ER strategies. Self-reports showed differences in experience of amusement and in ER strategies for anger and anxiety, but not in experience of anger and anxiety.


CONCLUSIONS
This study provides evidence that individuals with ASD less frequently use adaptive - but more frequently use maladaptive - ER strategies. Implications for ASD treatments that focus on increasing the use of adaptive strategies are discussed.",2015.0,45.0,83.0,"{'volume': '56 8', 'pages': '\n          903-13\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Samson2015EmotionRI,\n author = {Andrea C.

The schools workpackage carried out a systematic review of reviews of work on mental health in schools from which it identified evidence-based interventions and programmes and extracted the general principles from evidence-based work. A systematic search of the literature uncovered 52 systematic reviews and meta-analyses of mental health in schools. The interventions identified by the reviews had a wide range of beneficial effects on children, families and communities and on a range of mental health, social, emotional and educational outcomes. The effect sizes associated with most interventions were generally small to moderate in statistical terms, but large in terms of real-world impacts. The effects associated with interventions were variable and their effectiveness could not always be relied on. The characteristics of more effective interventions included: teaching skills, focusing on positive mental health; balancing universal and targeted approaches; starting early with the youngest children and continuing with older ones; operating for a lengthy period of time and embedding work within a multi-modal/whole-school approach which included such features as changes to the curriculum including teaching skills and linking with academic learning, improving school ethos, teacher education, liaison with parents, parenting education, community involvement and coordinated work with outside agencies. Interventions were only effective if they were completely and accurately implemented: this applied particularly to whole-school interventions which could be ineffective if not implemented with clarity, intensity and fidelity.

Nevertheless, the important place it will have in the field of psychiatric literature is already obvious. Whereas many psychoanalysts have tended to harden in their views with the passage of years?as do people in all walks of life?Bowlby has taken the opposite course. On the basis of his trained sensitivity to human behaviour, he has reached out to such new sciences as animal ethology and cybernetics, which were unknown in Freud's day. The result is provocative, enlightening and profoundly stimulating, though not everyone will be able to accept fully the mixture that emerges. The concept of instinctive behaviour in man still remains profoundly difficult, though the author's version is a more acceptable one than most which have been offered before. As far as the mother-child tie is concerned, this makes infinitely more sense in the light of human evolution?as interpreted by Bowlby?than on the basis of conventional psychoanalytical theory. Those who do not have the chore of reading this book in full will be able to get an impression of its most important parts from Bowlby's contribution to the 1968 Congress proceedings, which are to appear shortly.

Happiness, sadness, and disgust are three emotions that differ in their valence (positive or negative) and associated action tendencies (approach or withdrawal). This study was designed to investigate the neuroanatomical correlates of these discrete emotions.


METHOD
Twelve healthy female subjects were studied. Positron emission tomography and [15O]H2O were used to measure regional brain activity. There were 12 conditions per subject: happiness, sadness, and disgust and three control conditions, each induced by film and recall. Emotion and control tasks were alternated throughout. Condition order was pseudo-randomized and counterbalanced across subjects. Analyses focused on brain activity patterns for each emotion when combining film and recall data.


RESULTS
Happiness, sadness, and disgust were each associated with increases in activity in the thalamus and medial prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's area 9). These three emotions were also associated with activation of anterior and posterior temporal structures, primarily when induced by film. Recalled sadness was associated with increased activation in the anterior insula. Happiness was distinguished from sadness by greater activity in the vicinity of ventral mesial frontal cortex.


CONCLUSIONS
While this study should be considered preliminary, it identifies regions of the brain that participate in happiness, sadness, and disgust, regions that distinguish between positive and negative emotions, and regions that depend on both the elicitor and valence of emotion or their interaction.",1997.0,32.0,745.0,"{'volume': '154 7', 'pages': '\n          926-33\n        ', 'name': 'The American journal of psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lane1997NeuroanatomicalCO,\n author = {R.

We conducted a systematic review to determine whether virtual reality (VR) simulation training can supplement and/or replace conventional patient-based endoscopy training for health professional trainees with limited or no prior endoscopic experience. Methods We searched medical, educational, and computer literature databases in July 2017 for trials that compared VR simulation training with no training, conventional training, another form of simulation training, or an alternative method of VR training. We screened, abstracted data, and performed quantitative analysis and quality assessment through Cochrane methodology. Results We included 18 trials with 3817 endoscopic procedures. VR training provided no advantage over no training or conventional training based on the primary outcome of composite score of competency. VR training was advantageous over no training based on independent procedure completion (relative risk [RR] = 1.62, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.15 – 2.26, moderate-quality evidence), overall rating of performance (mean difference [MD] 0.45, 95 %CI 0.15 – 0.75, very low-quality evidence), and mucosal visualization (MD 0.60, 95 %CI 0.20 – 1.00, very low-quality evidence). Compared with conventional training, VR training resulted in fewer independent procedure completions (RR = 0.45, 95 %CI 0.27 – 0.74, low-quality evidence). We found no differences between VR training and no training or conventional training for other outcomes. Based on qualitative analysis, we found no significant differences between VR training and other forms of simulation training. VR curricula based in educational theory provided benefit with respect to composite score of competency, compared with unstructured curricula. Conclusions VR simulation training is advantageous over no training and can supplement conventional endoscopy training. There is insufficient evidence that simulation training provides benefit over conventional training.",2019.0,47.0,65.0,"{'volume': '51', 'pages': '653 - 664', 'name': 'Endoscopy'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Khan2019VirtualRS,\n author = {R.

However, the mechanisms through which puberty confers risk for internalizing psychopathology for girls, but not boys, remain unclear. We examined two pubertal indicators (pubertal status and timing) as predictors of the development of emotion regulation styles (rumination and emotional clarity) and depressive and anxiety symptoms and disorders in a three-wave study of 314 adolescents. Path analyses indicated that early pubertal timing, but not pubertal status, predicted increased rumination, but not decreased emotional clarity, in adolescent girls, but not boys. Additionally, rumination mediated the association between early pubertal timing and increased depressive, but not anxiety, symptoms and disorder onset among adolescent girls. These findings suggest that the sex difference in depression may result partly from early maturing girls’ greater tendency to develop ruminative styles than boys.",2016.0,129.0,62.0,"{'volume': '4', 'pages': '867 - 881', 'name': 'Clinical Psychological Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Alloy2016PubertalDE,\n author = {L.

The present study examined whether the valence of perceived emotions would differentially influence EEG power spectra and heart rate (HR). Pleasant and unpleasant emotions were induced by consonant and dissonant music. Unpleasant (compared to pleasant) music evoked a significant decrease of HR, replicating the pattern of HR responses previously described for the processing of emotional pictures, sounds, and films. In the EEG, pleasant (contrasted to unpleasant) music was associated with an increase of frontal midline (Fm) theta power. This effect is taken to reflect emotional processing in close interaction with attentional functions.

Results support an association between exposure to Hurricane Katrina and reactive aggression via posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and poorly regulated emotion. The proposed model fits well for both boys and girls; however, results suggest that minority youth in this sample were more likely to experience emotional dysregulation in relation to posttraumatic stress than Caucasian youth. Further, results indicate that hurricane exposure, PTSD symptoms, and poorly regulated emotion are associated with reactive aggression even after controlling for proactive aggression. These findings have implications for postdisaster mental health services. Researchers examining mental health problems in youth after a significant disaster have traditionally focused on the presence of internalizing problems such as anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, with very little empirical attention paid to the incidence of post-disaster externalizing problems such as aggression. Specific types of aggressive responses, particularly those that involve poorly regulated emotion (i.e., reactive aggression), have been shown to be associated with a history of trauma and thus may be especially common following a traumatic event such as a hurricane.",2008.0,66.0,154.0,"{'volume': '37', 'pages': '519 - 529', 'name': 'Journal of Clinical Child & Adolescent Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Marsee2008ReactiveAA,\n author = {Monica A.

We used functional neuroimaging to test two hypotheses: (i) that the amygdala and some of its functionally connected structures mediate specific neural responses to fearful expressions; (ii) that the early visual processing of emotional faces can be influenced by amygdalar activity. Normal subjects were scanned using PET while they performed a gender discrimination task involving static grey-scale images of faces expressing varying degrees of fear or happiness. In support of the first hypothesis, enhanced activity in the left amygdala, left pulvinar, left anterior insula and bilateral anterior cingulate gyri was observed during the processing of fearful faces. Evidence consistent with the second hypothesis was obtained by a demonstration that amygdalar responses predict expression-specific neural activity in extrastriate cortex.",1998.0,83.0,1286.0,"{'volume': '121 ( Pt 1)', 'pages': '\n          47-57\n        ', 'name': 'Brain : a journal of neurology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Morris1998ANR,\n author = {J.

Virtual reality (VR) distraction offers promise for needle-related pain and distress given its highly immersive and interactive virtual environment. This study assessed the usability (ease of use and understanding, acceptability) of a custom VR intervention for children with cancer undergoing implantable venous access device (IVAD) needle insertion. Method: Three iterative cycles of mixed-method usability testing with semistructured interviews were undertaken to refine the VR. Results: Participants included 17 children and adolescents (8-18 years old) with cancer who used the VR intervention prior to or during IVAD access. Most participants reported the VR as easy to use (82%) and understand (94%), and would like to use it during subsequent needle procedures (94%). Based on usability testing, refinements were made to VR hardware, software, and clinical implementation. Refinements focused on increasing responsiveness, interaction, and immersion of the VR program, reducing head movement for VR interaction, and enabling participant alerts to steps of the procedure by clinical staff. No adverse events of nausea or dizziness were reported. Conclusions: The VR intervention was deemed acceptable and safe. Next steps include assessing feasibility and effectiveness of the VR intervention for pain and distress.",2018.0,45.0,54.0,"{'volume': '35', 'pages': '406 - 416', 'name': 'Journal of Pediatric Oncology Nursing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Birnie2018UsabilityTO,\n author = {K.

Administrators’ feedback suggested good acceptability and feasibility, and the measure was relatively quick to administer, easy to use and acceptable to service users.

Participants viewed animated virtual characters varying in terms of gender, gaze interaction, and facial expression. We recorded facial EMG, fixation duration, pupil size, and subjective experience. Subject's rapid facial reactions (RFRs) differentiated more clearly between the character's happy and angry expression in the condition of mutual eye-to-eye contact. This finding provides evidence for the idea that RFRs are not simply motor responses, but part of an emotional reaction. Eye movement data showed that fixations were longer in response to both angry and neutral faces than to happy faces, thereby suggesting that attention is preferentially allocated to cues indicating potential threat during social interaction.",2009.0,66.0,104.0,"{'volume': '46 5', 'pages': '\n          922-31\n        ', 'name': 'Psychophysiology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Schrammel2009VirtualFO,\n author = {Franz Schrammel and S.

739,49b89f3caf72ad48a67f447a65da2c93a072ffe0,Does culture influence what and how we think? Effects of priming individualism and collectivism.,"Do differences in individualism and collectivism influence values, self-concept content, relational assumptions, and cognitive style? On the one hand, the cross-national literature provides an impressively consistent picture of the predicted systematic differences; on the other hand, the nature of the evidence is inconclusive. Cross-national evidence is insufficient to argue for a causal process, and comparative data cannot specify if effects are due to both individualism and collectivism, only individualism, only collectivism, or other factors (including other aspects of culture). To address these issues, the authors conducted a meta-analysis of the individualism and collectivism priming literature, with follow-up moderator analyses. Effect sizes were moderate for relationality and cognition, small for self-concept and values, robust across priming methods and dependent variables, and consistent in direction and size with cross-national effects. Results lend support to a situated model of culture in which cross-national differences are not static but dynamically consistent due to the chronic and moment-to-moment salience of individualism and collectivism.

740,4a191bb8c04538cae794379502ce552a0b7adf15,Resilience in the face of stress: emotion regulation as a protective factor,"Introduction Everyone experiences stress at one time or another – from major events such as the death of a loved one, to more minor stressors such as financial difficulties. Not surprisingly, exposure to stress is generally associated with a wide range of negative outcomes, including decreased well-being, increased incidence of disease, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder (Dohrenwend & Dohrenwend, 1974; Kendler et al., 1999; Monat et al., 2007). However, not all individuals who are exposed to even high levels of stress develop such negative outcomes. In fact, recent evidence suggests that a considerable number of individuals exhibit resilience, which is commonly defined as maintained or improved mental health in the face of stress, after short disruptions (if any) to normal functioning (Freitas & Downey, 1998; Rutter, 1999; Luthar et al., 2000; Bonanno, 2005). Note that this definition, which we adapt here, conceptualizes resilience as a potential outcome after exposure to stress rather than a psychological trait that leads to positive outcomes (c.f. Norris et al., 2008). It, therefore, appears that, in the face of comparable stressors, some individuals exhibit significantly impaired functioning while others show impressive resilience. Understanding the factors that govern the great individual variance in outcomes after stress is important for understanding mental health and for developing interventions and prevention programs that foster resilience. What factors, then, might predict resilience? One key to this question might lie in the fact that stressful events are inherently highly emotional (Sarason et al., 1978; Lazarus, 1999). For this reason, people’s ability to regulate emotions may be a critically important factor in determining resilience (Figure 2.1). The present chapter will review relevant literatures and suggest that there is indeed evidence to support this thesis. More specifically, we will propose that a specific type of emotion regulation, cognitive emotion regulation, holds particular promise for contributing to resilience.",2011.0,94.0,264.0,"{'volume': '', 'pages': '30-44', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Troy2011ResilienceIT,\n author = {Allison S.

Philippine-born individuals, in contrast, identified the following important aspects of their identity: valuing family relationships; being hospitable, polite, and respectful; having faith in God; speaking Tagalog; and having Filipino physical characteristics.

Despite the growing use of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy® (DBT®) by clinical psychologists, to date, there are no published studies using standard DBT® or DBT® skills learning for severe burn patients. The current study explored the feasibility and clinical potential of using Immersive Virtual Reality (VR) enhanced DBT® mindfulness skills training to reduce negative emotions and increase positive emotions of a patient with severe burn injuries. The participant was a hospitalized (in house) 21-year-old Spanish speaking Latino male patient being treated for a large (>35% TBSA) severe flame burn injury. Methods: The patient looked into a pair of Oculus Rift DK2 virtual reality goggles to perceive the computer-generated virtual reality illusion of floating down a river, with rocks, boulders, trees, mountains, and clouds, while listening to DBT® mindfulness training audios during 4 VR sessions over a 1 month period. Study measures were administered before and after each VR session. Results: As predicted, the patient reported increased positive emotions and decreased negative emotions. The patient also accepted the VR mindfulness treatment technique. He reported the sessions helped him become more comfortable with his emotions and he wanted to keep using mindfulness after returning home. Conclusions: Dialectical Behavioral Therapy is an empirically validated treatment approach that has proved effective with non-burn patient populations for treating many of the psychological problems experienced by severe burn patients. The current case study explored for the first time, the use of immersive virtual reality enhanced DBT® mindfulness skills training with a burn patient. The patient reported reductions in negative emotions and increases in positive emotions, after VR DBT® mindfulness skills training. Immersive Virtual Reality is becoming widely available to mainstream consumers, and thus has the potential to make this treatment available to a much wider number of patient populations, including severe burn patients.

Our second goal was to investigate whether these relations varied by reactive or proactive aggression. Children (272 second-grade boys and girls) participated in a procedure in which they lost a game and prize to a confederate who cheated. Skin conductance reactivity, heart rate reactivity, selfreports of anger, angry facial expressions, and angry nonverbal behaviors were measured for each turn of the game. We used multi-level regressions to calculate the relations among the 10 pairs of the five anger variables over the course of the game. Six of the 10 pairs of anger variables were positively related. These findings suggest that measuring children’s anger using any one approach may not capture the full complexity of children’s overall experience and expression of anger. Furthermore, three of the 10 relations were stronger at higher levels of reactive aggression, although none varied by proactive aggression. These findings suggest that reactive aggression is related to greater cohesiveness in the experience and expression of anger than is proactive aggression.",2004.0,58.0,90.0,"{'volume': '13', 'pages': '14-39', 'name': 'Social Development'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Hubbard2004TheRA,\n author = {Julie A.

However, understanding their impact requires taking into account that inhibition is not a unitary construct, but consists of distinct functions underlain by specific mechanisms. In this study, 88 participants performed two emotional versions of classic laboratory tasks designed to assess (1) the ability to inhibit a prepotent response (a stop-signal task using faces with different emotional expressions) and (2) the capacity to resist the effect of proactive interference (PI; a recent negative task that included emotional words). Overall results showed that emotional stimuli interfered with inhibition capacities in both tasks. Although tending in the same direction, these results suggest that different underlying mechanisms (e.g., top-down vs. bottom-up processes) or consecutive differences in emotional processing (e.g., different interactions with stimulus/task properties, processing stages or motivational aspects) are at play in these two inhibition-related functions.",2015.0,24.0,58.0,"{'volume': '29', 'pages': '559 - 567', 'name': 'Cognition and Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rebetez2015DoES,\n author = {Marie My Lien Rebetez and L.

753,4bf6bb477d2db488ad3ad65104e7b13815d98176,Prefrontal Control of the Amygdala during Real-Time fMRI Neurofeedback Training of Emotion Regulation,"We observed in a previous study (PLoS ONE 6:e24522) that the self-regulation of amygdala activity via real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) with positive emotion induction was associated, in healthy participants, with an enhancement in the functional connectivity between the left amygdala (LA) and six regions of the prefrontal cortex. These regions included the left rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and right medial frontopolar cortex (MFPC). Together with the LA, these six prefrontal regions thus formed the functional neuroanatomical network engaged during the rtfMRI-nf procedure. Here we perform a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) analysis of the effective connectivity for this network. The SVAR analysis demonstrates that the left rACC plays an important role during the rtfMRI-nf training, modulating the LA and the other network regions. According to the analysis, the rtfMRI-nf training leads to a significant enhancement in the time-lagged effect of the left rACC on the LA, potentially consistent with the ipsilateral distribution of the monosynaptic projections between these regions. The training is also accompanied by significant increases in the instantaneous (contemporaneous) effects of the left rACC on four other regions – the bilateral DMPFC, the right MFPC, and the left SFG. The instantaneous effects of the LA on the bilateral DMPFC are also significantly enhanced. Our results are consistent with a broad literature supporting the role of the rACC in emotion processing and regulation. Our exploratory analysis provides, for the first time, insights into the causal relationships within the network of regions engaged during the rtfMRI-nf procedure targeting the amygdala. It suggests that the rACC may constitute a promising target for rtfMRI-nf training along with the amygdala in patients with affective disorders, particularly posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",2013.0,61.0,128.0,"{'volume': '8', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zotev2013PrefrontalCO,\n author = {V.

Despite widespread public belief in such phenomena and over 75 years of experimentation, there is no compelling evidence that psi exists. In the present study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used in an effort to document the existence of psi. If psi exists, it occurs in the brain, and hence, assessing the brain directly should be more sensitive than using indirect behavioral methods (as have been used previously). To increase sensitivity, this experiment was designed to produce positive results if telepathy, clairvoyance (i.e., direct sensing of remote events), or precognition (i.e., knowing future events) exist. Moreover, the study included biologically or emotionally related participants (e.g., twins) and emotional stimuli in an effort to maximize experimental conditions that are purportedly conducive to psi. In spite of these characteristics of the study, psi stimuli and non-psi stimuli evoked indistinguishable neuronal responsesalthough differences in stimulus arousal values of the same stimuli had the expected effects on patterns of brain activation.

Methods: The study was undertaken using a cross-sectional assessment of 112 elderly subjects (mean age 67.96 ± 5.77 years, and mean education level of 12.8 ± 5.7 years) with a semi-structured interview and a neuropsychological battery. Results: MCI patients did not differ from controls on total MMSE scores (p = 0.212).

Amnestic MCI patients performed worse only on the “three-word recall” task (p = 0.013); non-amnestic MCI patients performed worse on the “three-stage command” task (p = 0.001); and multiple-domain MCI patients performed worse on the “drawing a pentagon” task (p = 0.001) and had a trend toward performing poorly on the ‘three word recall’ task (p = 0.06). Conclusion: The analysis of MMSE subtest scores, in addition to MMSE total scores, may increase the sensitivity of the MMSE test in screening for MCI and its subtypes.",2007.0,27.0,98.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '647 - 656', 'name': 'International Psychogeriatrics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Diniz2007MinimentalSE,\n author = {B.

Virtual reality (VR) may address these challenges by providing an immersive environment for practicing mindfulness and by supporting the user to orient attention to the present moment within a tailored virtual setting. However, there is currently a limited understanding of the ways in which VR can support or hinder mindfulness practice. Such an understanding is required to design effective VR apps while ensuring that VR-supported mindfulness is acceptable to end users. Objective This study aimed to explore how VR can support mindfulness practice and to understand user experience issues that may affect the acceptability and efficacy of VR mindfulness for users in the general population. Methods A sample of 37 participants from the general population trialed a VR mindfulness app in a controlled laboratory setting. The VR app presented users with an omnidirectional video of a peaceful forest environment with a guided mindfulness voiceover that was delivered by a male narrator. Scores on the State Mindfulness Scale, Simulator Sickness Questionnaire, and single-item measures of positive and negative emotion and arousal were measured pre- and post-VR for all participants. Qualitative feedback was collected through interviews with a subset of 19 participants. The interviews sought to understand the user experience of mindfulness practice in VR. Results State mindfulness (P<.001; Cohen d=1.80) and positive affect (P=.006; r=.45) significantly increased after using the VR mindfulness app. No notable changes in negative emotion, subjective arousal, or symptoms of simulator sickness were observed across the sample. Participants described the user experience as relaxing, calming, and peaceful. Participants suggested that the use of VR helped them to focus on the present moment by using visual and auditory elements of VR as attentional anchors. The sense of presence in the virtual environment (VE) was identified by participants as being helpful to practicing mindfulness. Interruptions to presence acted as distractors. Some uncomfortable experiences were discussed, primarily in relation to video fidelity and the weight of the VR headset, although these were infrequent and minor. Conclusions This study suggests that an appropriately designed VR app can support mindfulness practice by enhancing state mindfulness and inducing positive affect. VR may help address the challenges of practicing mindfulness by creating a sense of presence in a tailored VE; by allowing users to attend to visual and auditory anchors of their choice; and by reducing the scope of the content in users’ mind-wandering. VR has the unique capability to combine guided mindfulness practice with tailored VEs that lend themselves to support individuals to focus attention on the present moment.",2019.0,70.0,79.0,"{'volume': '22', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Seabrook2019UnderstandingHV,\n author = {E.

There is a lack of effective pharmacological treatments for apathy, and nonpharmacological interventions are a preferred first-line approach to treatment. Virtual reality (VR) using head-mounted displays (HMDs) is being successfully used in exposure- and distraction-based therapies; however, there is limited research on using HMDs for symptoms of neurological disorders. Objective This feasibility study aimed to assess whether VR using HMDs could be used to deliver tailored reminiscence therapy and examine the willingness to participate, response rates to measures, time taken to create tailored content, and technical problems. In addition, this study aimed to explore the immediate effects between verbal fluency and apathy after exposure to VR. Methods A mixed methods study was conducted in a sample of older adults residing in aged care, and 17 participants were recruited. Apathy was measured using the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), and verbal fluency was used as a proxy measure of improvements in apathy and debriefing interviews to assess feedback from participants. Side effects that can occur from using HMDs were also measured. Results We recruited participants from a high socioeconomic status setting with a high education level, and the participation rate was 85% (17/20); most responses to measures were positive. Access to a wide range of freely available content and the absence of technical difficulties made the delivery of a VR reminiscence intervention highly feasible. Participants had improved semantic scores (t14=−3.27; P=.006) but not phonemic fluency scores (t14=0.55; P=.59) immediately after the intervention. Those with higher levels of apathy demonstrated the greatest cognitive improvements after a VR reminiscence experience, which was indicated by a strong positive relationship between the AES and semantic verbal fluency change scores postminus pre-VR (r=0.719; 95% CI 0.327 to 0.900; P=.003). All participants enjoyed the experience despite 35% (6/17) of participants experiencing temporary side effects. Conclusions This study provides initial evidence that it is feasible to use VR with HMDs for therapy to treat symptoms of apathy in older adults in residential aged care. However, there is a need to closely monitor the side effects of HMD use in older adults. Further research is needed using an active control group to compare the use of VR with traditional forms of reminiscence therapy.",2019.0,104.0,34.0,"{'volume': '22', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Saredakis2019UsingVR,\n author = {Dimitrios Saredakis and H.

In the contamination subtype, individuals are scared of germs and bacteria, are excessively concerned with cleaning, fear contamination and the spread of disease, and may have a very strong aversion to bodily secretions. A few studies on virtual reality have been conducted with people suffering from OCD, but they all focus on the subtype characterized by checking rituals. The goal of this study is to confirm the potential of a “contaminated” virtual environment in inducing anxiety in 12 adults suffering from contamination-subtype OCD compared to 20 adults without OCD (N = 32) using a within-between protocol. Subjective (questionnaire) and objective (heart rate) measurements were compiled. Participants were immersed in a control virtual environment (empty and clean room) and a “contaminated” virtual environment (filthy public restroom) designed for the treatment of OCD. Immersions were conducted in a 6-wall CAVE-like system. As hypothesized, the results of repeated-measures ANCOVAs revealed the significant impact of immersion in a filthy public restroom for participants suffering from OCD on both measures. Presence was correlated with anxiety in OCD participants and no difference in presence was observed between groups. Unwanted negative side effects induced by immersions in virtual reality were higher in the OCD group.

In addition, viewers can engage with broadcasters by sending danmaku, a type of comment scrolled across the screen in real time. This paper investigates the role of viewers’ social interaction in paid gifting on live streaming platforms. We argue that viewer-viewer interaction can prompt paid gifting by affecting viewers’ arousal level through stimuli extracted from danmaku. Types of danmaku-related stimuli are presence of others, social competition, and emotional stimuli. Specifically, presence of others is measured by total number of words; social competition by debate level; and emotional stimuli by similarity of danmaku, number of excitement-related words, and number of emoji. Using data from a major live streaming platform in China, empirical results show that except for number of emoji, the other four variables positively affect paid gifting.",2018.0,56.0,105.0,{'name': 'University of California'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Zhou2018TheMO,\n author = {Jilei Zhou and Jing Zhou and Ying Ding and Hansheng Wang},\n journal = {University of California},\n title = {The Magic of Danmaku: A Social Interaction Perspective of Gift Sending on Live Streaming Platforms},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2206970199', 'name': 'Jilei Zhou'}, {'authorId': '2145787194', 'name': 'Jing Zhou'}, {'authorId': '2111239533', 'name': 'Ying Ding'}, {'authorId': '2113290900', 'name': 'Hansheng Wang'}]"

The variety of VR technology used in the trials prevents us from establishing a systematic relationship between the technology type and its effectiveness. As such, more research is needed to study this link, and our piece is an attempt to shed a spotlight on the issue.Design/methodology/approachTo explore recent developments in the field, the authors followed the procedures of scoping review by Savickaite et al. (2022) and included publications from 2021 to 2022.FindingsIn this updated analysis, it was clear that the research themes emerging over the last two years were similar to those identified previously. Social training and intervention work still dominates the research area, in spite of recent calls from the autism community to broaden the scientific understanding of neurodivergent experiences and daily living behaviours. Although, autism is often characterised by difficulties with social interactions, it is just one part of the presentation. Sensory differences, motor difficulties and repetitive behaviours are also important facets of the condition, as well as various wider aspects of health, wellbeing and quality of life. However, many of these topics appear to be understudied in research on VR applications for autism.Originality/valueVR stands out from other representational technologies because of its immersion, presence and interactivity and has grown into its own niche. The question of what constitutes a truly immersive experience has resurfaced. We can no longer deny that VR has established itself in autism research.

Design: Qualitative study with semistructured interviews. Setting: The stroke unit of an inner city teaching hospital. Participants: 22 patients with stroke who were undergoing rehabilitation; 14 with high motivation for rehabilitation and eight with low motivation. Results: All patients thought rehabilitation was important for recovery. High motivation patients were more likely to view rehabilitation as the most important means of recovery and to accord themselves an active role in rehabilitation. These patients were also more likely to understand rehabilitation and in particular to understand the specialist role of the nursing staff. Many patients reported independence at home as a personal goal, though few low motivation patients related this goal to success in rehabilitation. Information from professionals about rehabilitation, favourable comparisons with other stroke patients, and the desire to leave hospital had a positive effect on motivation. Conversely, overprotection from family members and professionals, lack of information or the receipt of “mixed messages” from professionals, and unfavourable comparisons with other patients had a negative effect. Conclusions: There are some differences in beliefs between stroke patients identified as having low or high motivation for rehabilitation. These beliefs seem to be influenced by the environment in which the patient is rehabilitated. Professionals and carers should be made aware of the ways in which their behaviour can positively and negatively affect motivation.",2000.0,21.0,442.0,"{'volume': '321', 'pages': '1051 - 1054', 'name': 'BMJ : British Medical Journal'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Maclean2000QualitativeAO,\n author = {N.

The study was conducted using the meta-analysis method. In the present study, a total of 40 studies that were carried out between 2010 and 2020 and met the inclusion criteria were subjected to meta-analysis. In the present study, the values of the effect size and combined effect size of each study included in the meta-analysis were calculated using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software. The sample of the study consists of 3474 participants. The results of the study revealed that the studies were usually conducted at the university stage with a medium sample size, and published as articles. It was also revealed that most of the studies were carried out in the field of sciences and social sciences. Considering the intervention durations, it was observed that the studies were particularly carried out within a period between 1 and 4 weeks (37.8%). According to the results of the analysis, the average effect size was calculated as 0.523. Considering the results, it can be stated that CSCL has a positive and moderate effect on academic achievement.

Non-verbal elements limit online communication, thus leading to widespread use of emotional resources. It would be preferable if virtual interaction did not reduce the quality of person-to-person contacts, particularly thanks to the adoption of netiquette (respectful treatment of others online). Phubbing, the tendency to check one’s mobile phone during a face-to-face conversation, has become a widespread practice that causes anxiety and can lead to social exclusion. Educating on this behavior could be related with emotional content and with netiquette. This study’s objectives are to analyze the extent to which the use of netiquette and online emotional content are associated with and can predict phubbing, taking gender differences into account. 935 adolescents (ages 12-17, 55,1% female) from 13 schools in the region of Aragon (Spain) responded to our questionnaire. Results are revealing: the level of online emotional content increases the level of phubbing; online emotional expression is the most influential risk factor in both genders; netiquette protects girls to a greater degree.

Continuous-variable analysis strategies drawing from a general linear model framework can be applied to such designs. The growing emphasis on dimensional examinations of psychological constructs, encouraged by the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria framework, encourages continuous-variable analytic strategies. However, the interpretative implications of applying these strategies to various types of populations and sample score distributions, including those used in EGDs, are not always recognized. Appropriateness and utility of EGDs depend in part on whether the goal is to determine whether a relationship exists between 2 variables or to determine its strength. Whereas the literature investigating EGDs has emphasized symmetrical thresholds for defining extreme groups (e.g., bottom 10% vs. top 10%), psychopathologists often employ asymmetric thresholds (e.g., above a diagnostic threshold vs. a broader range of scores in a healthy comparison group). The present article selectively reviews literature on EGDs and extends it with simulations of symmetric and asymmetric selection criteria. Results indicate that including a wide range of scores in EGDs substantially mitigates problems (e.g., inflation of effect size) that arise when using statistical methods classically employed for continuous variables.

The present study examined this hypothesis by testing whether frontal EEG activity during mood inductions versus a resting baseline predicted emotion regulation. EEG was recorded while participants (N = 66, 40 females) received a fearful, sad, or neutral mood induction. Emotion regulation was measured following the mood inductions as self-reported change in negative mood and as attention interference in a task with mood-congruent emotional distracters. Greater frontal EEG activity during the mood inductions versus baseline was associated with more effective emotion regulation: less post-induction sadness and anxiety and reduced mood-congruent attention interference effects. Effects did not differ between the left and right hemispheres. Results support the hypothesis that frontal EEG activity reflects both emotional context and emotion-regulatory capabilities.",,61.0,70.0,,"{'bibtex': ""@Misc{None,\n author = {Tracy A.

In 5 qualitative studies, it was found that students experience a rich diversity of emotions in academic settings. Anxiety was reported most often, but overall, positive emotions were described no less frequently than negative emotions. Based on the studies in this article, taxonomies of different academic emotions and a self-report instrument measuring students' enjoyment, hope, pride, relief, anger, anxiety, shame, hopelessness, and boredom (Academic Emotions Questionnaire [AEQ]) were developed. Using the AEQ, assumptions of a cognitive-motivational model of the achievement effects of emotions, and of a control/value theory of their antecedents (Pekrun, 1992b, 2000), were tested in 7 cross-sectional, 3 longitudinal, and 1 diary study using samples of university and school students. Results showed that academic emotions are significantly related to students' motivation, learning strategies, cognitive resources, self-regulation, and academic achievement, as well as to personality and classroom antecedents.

Mixed MANCOVA revealed that ADHD children performed worse on correct responses had more commissions and omissions errors, and slower reaction time to targets than controls. Next, results showed significant differences between performance in the virtual environment and the computerized one with longer reaction time in virtual reality.

The aim of this study is to analyse the levels of stress, anxiety and depression of teachers in the north of Spain. Methods This study was conducted with 1633 teachers from the Department of Education of the Basque Autonomous Community (BAC) and Navarre, all of whom are professionals working in various educational centres, from nursery education to university studies, with an average age of 42 years (M = 42.02; s.d. = 10.40). The Spanish version of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 was used. Results The results show that a high percentage of teachers have symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression. Women show significantly more symptoms of stress and anxiety than men, those who have children have more depressive symptoms than those who do not, and people with chronic pathology or those who live with others with chronic pathology have more stress, anxiety and depression. Conclusions This study indicates the importance of attending to the mental health of teachers, particularly women, those who have children, and those who have a chronic pathology or a family member with a chronic pathology.",2021.0,76.0,81.0,"{'volume': '8', 'name': 'Global Mental Health'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Santamaría2021TeacherSA,\n author = {M.

Anxiety leads to substantial long-term problems and may underlie disruptive behaviors in the classroom as a result of the individual’s inability to tolerate anxiety-provoking situations. Thus, interventions in special needs schools that help adolescents cope with anxiety and, in turn, diminish disruptive classroom behaviors are needed. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a virtual reality biofeedback game, DEEP, on daily levels of state-anxiety and disruptive classroom behavior in a clinical sample. In addition, the study also aimed to examine the duration of the calm or relaxed state after playing DEEP. Methods A total of 8 adolescents attending a special secondary school for students with behavioral and psychiatric problems participated in a single-case experimental ABAB study. Over a 4-week period, participants completed 6 DEEP sessions. In addition, momentary assessments (ie, 3 times a day) of self-reported state-anxiety and teacher-reported classroom behavior were collected throughout all A and B phases. Results From analyzing the individual profiles, it was found that 6 participants showed reductions in anxiety, and 5 participants showed reductions in disruptive classroom behaviors after the introduction of DEEP. On a group level, results showed a small but significant reduction of anxiety (d=–0.29) and a small, nonsignificant reduction of disruptive classroom behavior (d=−0.16) on days when participants played DEEP. Moreover, it was found that the calm or relaxed state of participants after playing DEEP lasted for about 2 hours on average. Conclusions This study demonstrates the potential of the game, DEEP, as an intervention for anxiety and disruptive classroom behavior in a special school setting. Future research is needed to fully optimize and personalize DEEP as an intervention for the heterogeneous special school population.",2020.0,85.0,37.0,"{'volume': '7', 'name': 'JMIR Mental Health'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bossenbroek2020EfficacyOA,\n author = {Rineke Bossenbroek and A.

To this end, the Spanish adaptation of the CER-Q and the Spanish adaptation of the STAI were applied to a sample of 266 high school students. A multiple linear regression model was proposed, where anxiety level was the dependent variable, and the use frequencies of emotional regulation strategies were the independent variables. Gender was also considered as an independent variable since the data showed differences in anxiety level and in the use of emotional regulation strategies between male and female subjects. The model explained 46.3% of the variance, and the predictive variables were Self-blame, Positive Reinterpretation, Catastrophizing, Rumination and gender.

We develop an EEG dataset acquired from 15 subjects. Each subject performs the experiments twice at the interval of a few days. DBNs are trained with differential entropy features extracted from multichannel EEG data. We examine the weights of the trained DBNs and investigate the critical frequency bands and channels. Four different profiles of 4, 6, 9, and 12 channels are selected. The recognition accuracies of these four profiles are relatively stable with the best accuracy of 86.65%, which is even better than that of the original 62 channels. The critical frequency bands and channels determined by using the weights of trained DBNs are consistent with the existing observations. In addition, our experiment results show that neural signatures associated with different emotions do exist and they share commonality across sessions and individuals. We compare the performance of deep models with shallow models. The average accuracies of DBN, SVM, LR, and KNN are 86.08%, 83.99%, 82.70%, and 72.60%, respectively.",2015.0,61.0,1055.0,"{'volume': '7', 'pages': '162-175', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zheng2015InvestigatingCF,\n author = {Wei-Long Zheng and Bao-Liang Lu},\n journal = {IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development},\n pages = {162-175},\n title = {Investigating Critical Frequency Bands and Channels for EEG-Based Emotion Recognition with Deep Neural Networks},\n volume = {7},\n year = {2015}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '3108302', 'name': 'Wei-Long Zheng'}, {'authorId': '1715839', 'name': 'Bao-Liang Lu'}]"

Correlational and path analyses revealed that teacher involvement was central to children's experiences in the classroom and that teacher provision of both autonomy support and optimal structure predicted children's motivation across the school year. Reciprocal effects of student motivation on teacher behavior were also found. Students who showed higher initial behavioral engagement received subsequently more of all 3 teacher behaviors. These findings suggest that students who are behaviorally disengaged receive teacher responses that should further undermine their motivation. The importance of the student-teacher relationship, especially interpersonal involvement, in optimizing student motivation is highlighted. What are the factors that motivate children to learn? Educators and parents value motivation in school for its own sake as well as for its long-term contribution to children's learning and self-esteem. Highly motivated children are easy to identify: They are enthusiastic, interested, involved, and curious; they try hard and persist; and they actively cope with challenges and setbacks. These are the children who should stay in school longer, learn more, feel better about themselves, and continue their education after high school. Recent research has borne this out (Ames & Ames, 1984, 1985; Pintrich, 1991; Stipek, 1988). Although motivated students are easy to recognize, they are difficult to find. Research shows that across the preschool to high school years, children's intrinsic motivation decreases and they feel increasingly alienated from learning (Harter, 1981). Why is it so difficult to optimize student motivation?

Methods: At a large Southwestern U.S. university, we examined differences in emotion dysregulation, depression, anxiety, and stress among college students who used illicit substances in the past 30 days (n = 92, 34.5%) and those who did not (n = 175, 65.5%). Data were collected in 2016 using two measures: the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz & Roemer, 2004) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS21; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995). Results: Results from the Descriptive Discriminate Analysis (DDA) indicated that significant differences existed between the two groups. Anxiety, difficulty clarifying emotions, difficulty employing goal-directed behaviors, and stress accounted the most for the group differences. Conclusion/Importance: Mental health differences between illicit substance users and nonusers exist. Specifically, illicit substance users reported more anxiety, stress, and difficulties with emotion regulation.",2018.0,19.0,25.0,"{'volume': '53', 'pages': '1915 - 1918', 'name': 'Substance Use & Misuse'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Prosek2018DifferencesIE,\n author = {Elizabeth A.

Effective face-to-face treatments are Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT) and Problem Solving Treatment (PST). However, about two-thirds of persons who die by suicide have not been in contact with mental health care services in the preceding year, and many have never been treated. Furthermore, many patients do not disclose their suicidal thoughts to their care provider. This may be out of shame, due to fear of stigma or due to lack of trust in (mental) health care. Since many suicidal individuals seek information online, the internet provides an opportunity to reach suicidal individuals who would not be contacted otherwise. By providing a self-help intervention online, persons can anonymously learn to gain control over their suicidal thoughts. There is convincing evidence that self-help is effective for a number of mental disorders. In this study the effectiveness for suicidal thoughts is examined.Methods/DesignIn this study, a recently developed self-help intervention will be evaluated in a Randomized Controlled Trial. The intervention is based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and is aimed at subjects who experience mild to moderate suicidal thoughts. This is defined as a score between 1 and 26 on the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSS). Higher and lower scores are excluded. In addition, severely depressed subjects are excluded. In total, 260 subjects will be randomly allocated to the intervention-condition (N = 130) or to the information-control condition (N = 130). Self-report questionnaires will be filled out at baseline, 6 weeks after baseline and 18 weeks after baseline. Primary outcome measure is the reduction in frequency and intensity of suicidal thoughts. Secondary outcome measures are the reduction of hopelessness, anxiety and depression, sleeplessness, worry and quality of life measures.DiscussionThis study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based self-help intervention for suicidal thoughts.

823,532ce26200b801b8ab6f7332f92dfc7213bb00b8,Emotion and the autonomic nervous system: A prospectus for research on autonomic specificity.,"The question of whether there are different patterns of autonomic nervous system responses for different emotions is examined. Relevant conceptual issues concerning both the nature of emotion and the structure of the autonomic nervous system are discussed in the context of the development of research methods appropriate for studying this question. Are different emotional states associated with distinct patterns of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity? This is an old question that is currently enjoying a modest revival in psychology. In the 1950s autonomic specificity was a key item on the agenda of the newly emerging discipline of psychophysiology, which saw as its mission the scientific exploration of the mind-body relationship using the tools of electrophysiological measurement. But the field of psychophysiology had the misfortune of coming of age during a period in which psychology drifted away from its physiological roots, a period in which psychology was dominated by learning, behaviourism, personality theory and later by cognition. Psychophysiology in the period between 1960 and 1980 reflected these broader trends in psychology by focusing on such issues as autonomic markers of perceptual states (e.g. orienting, stimulus processing), the interplay between personality factors and ANS responsivity, operant conditioning of autonomic functions, and finally, electrophysiological markers of cognitive states. Research on autonomic specificity in emotion became increasingly rare. Perhaps as a result of these historical trends in psychology, or perhaps because research on emotion and physiology is so difficult to do well, there 18 SOCIAL PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY AND EMOTION exists only a small body of studies on ANS specificity. Although almost all of these studies report some evidence for the existence of specificity, the prevailing zeitgeist has been that specificity has not been empirically established. At this point in time a review of the existing literature would not be very informative, for it would inevitably dissolve into a critique of methods. Instead, what I hope to accomplish in this chapter is to provide a new framework for thinking about ANS specificity, and to propose guidelines for carrying out research on this issue that will be cognizant of the recent methodological and theoretical advances that have been made both in psychophysiology and in research on emotion. Emotion as organization From the outset, the definition of emotion that underlies this chapter should be made explicit. For me the essential function of emotion is organization. The selection of emotion for preservation across time and species is based on the need for an efficient mechanism than can mobilize and organize disparate response systems to deal with environmental events that pose a threat to survival. In this view the prototypical context for human emotions is those situations in which a multi-system response must be organized quickly, where time is not available for the lengthy processes of deliberation, reformulation, planning and rehearsal; where a fine degree of co-ordination is required among systems as disparate as the muscles of the face and the organs of the viscera; and where adaptive behaviours that normally reside near the bottom of behavioural hierarchies must be instantaneously shifted to the top. Specificity versus undifferentiated arousal In this model of emotion as organization it is assumed that each component system is capable of a number of different responses, and that the emotion will guide the selection of responses from each system. Component systems differ in terms of the number of response possibilities. Thus, in the facial expressive system a selection must be made among a limited set of prototypic emotional expressions (which are but a subset of the enormous number of expressions the face is capable of assuming). A motor behaviour must also be selected from a similarly reduced set of responses consisting of fighting, fleeing, freezing, hiding, etc. All major theories of emotion would accept the proposition that activation of the ANS is one of the changes that occur during emotion. But theories differ as to how many different ANS patterns constitute the set of selection possibilities. At one extreme are those who would argue that there are only two ANS patterns: 'off' and 'on'. The 'on' ANS pattern, according to this view, consists EMOTION AND THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 19 of a high-level, global, diffuse ANS activation, mediated primarily by the sympathetic branch of the ANS. The manifestations of this pattern rapid and forcefulcontractions of the heart, rapid and deep breathing, increased systolic blood pressure, sweating, dry mouth, redirection of blood flow to large skeletal muscles, peripheral vasoconstriction, release of large amounts of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla, and the resultant release of glucose from the liver are well known. Cannon (1927) described this pattern in some detail, arguing that this kind of high-intensity, undifferentiated arousal accompanied all emotions .. Among contemporary theories the notion of undifferentiated arousal is most clearly found in Mandler's theory (Mandler, 1975). However, undifferentiated arousal also played a major role in the extraordinarily influential cognitive/physiological theory of Schachter and Singer (1962). According to this theory, undifferentiated arousal is a necessary precondition for emotionan extremely plastic medium to be moulded by cognitive processes working in concert with the available cues from the social environment. At the other extreme are those who argue that there are a large number of patterns of ANS activation, each associated with a different emotion (or subset of emotions). This is the traditional specificity position. Its classic statement is often attributed to James (1884), although Alexander (1950) provided an even more radical version. The specificity position fuelled a number of experimental studies in the 1950s and 1960s, all attempting to identify some of these autonomic patterns (e.g. Averill, 1969; Ax, 1953; Funkenstein, King and Drolette, 1954; Schachter, 1957; Sternbach, 1962). Despite these studies, all of which reported support for ANS specificity, the undifferentiated arousal theory, especially as formulated by Schachter and Singer (1962) and their followers, has been dominant for a great many years. Is the ANS capable of specific action No matter how appealing the notion of ANS specificity might be in the abstract, there would be little reason to pursue it in the laboratory if the ANS were only capable of producing one pattern of arousal. There is no question that the pattern of high-level sympathetic arousal described earlier is one pattern that the ANS can produce. Cannon's arguments notwithstanding, I believe there now is quite ample evidence that the ANS is capable of a number of different patterns of activation. Whether these patterns are reliably associated with different emotions remains an empirical question, but the potential is surely there. A case in support of this potential for specificity can be based on: (a) the neural structure of the ANS; (b) the stimulation neurochemistry of the ANS; and (c) empirical findings. 20 SOCIAL PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY AND EMOTION",1988.0,28.0,300.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Levenson1988EmotionAT,\n author = {R.

The face is made up of many muscles, which are partly activated concurrently. Virtual faces with human expressiveness are usually designed with a limited amount of facial regulators. Such regulators are derived from the facial muscle parts that are concurrently activated. Common tools for editing such facial expressions use slider-based interfaces where only a single input at a time is possible. Novel input devices, such as gamepads or data gloves, which allow parallel editing, could not only speed up editing, but also simplify the composition of new facial expressions. We created a virtual face with 23 facial controls and connected it with a slider-based GUI, a gamepad, and a data glove.

A divisive-normalization account—in which representation of stimulus intensity is normalized (divided) by concurrent stimulus intensities—predicts that choice preferences among options increase with the range of option values. In the first experiment reported here, I manipulated the range of attractiveness of the faces presented on each trial by varying the attractiveness of an undesirable distractor face that was presented simultaneously with two attractive targets, and participants were asked to choose the most attractive face. I used normalization models to predict the context dependence of preferences regarding facial attractiveness. The more unattractive the distractor, the more one of the targets was preferred over the other target, which suggests that divisive normalization (a potential canonical computation in the brain) influences social evaluations. I obtained the same result when I manipulated faces’ averageness and participants chose the most average face. This finding suggests that divisive normalization is not restricted to value-based decisions (e.g., attractiveness). This new application to social evaluation of normalization, a classic theory, opens possibilities for predicting social decisions in naturalistic contexts such as advertising or dating.",2016.0,43.0,21.0,"{'volume': '27', 'pages': '1379 - 1387', 'name': 'Psychological Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Furl2016FacialAttractivenessCA,\n author = {N.

Major outcomes to date indicate that teacher candidates gain a sense of instructional self-efficacy (confidence in their competence) more rapidly using the simulator, compared to traditional teacher preparation classes and related activities.

833,54694d21e874237eb36ab1bacef91ceba7f8cb01,Why users purchase virtual products in MMORPG? An integrative perspective of social presence and user engagement,"Purpose 
 
 
 
 
Prior studies on virtual product purchase have focused on external technological factor but have paid less attention to internal user factors. Thus, drawing upon the social presence and user engagement theories, the purpose of this paper is to develop a research model considering both technological factors and user factors and empirically examine the validity of the proposed research model. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
A survey from 214 World of Warcraft players was conducted to test the proposed research model, and structural equation modelling approach (specifically, PLS) was used to test the proposed hypotheses. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The data analysis results suggest that both social presence and user engagement positively influence the intention to purchase virtual products. Furthermore, two technological factors, interactivity and sociability, are found to affect social presence, and two social factors, social ties and social identity, are found to affect user engagement. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
This study proposes a dual factor framework (i.e. technological and user factors) to investigate the factors influencing the intention to purchase by integrating the social presence perspective and user engagement perspective. The findings would be beneficial for service provider of massively multiplayer online role-playing games to recognize that triggering user demand is of equal importance with offering better technologies and suggest new ways to promote users’ virtual product purchase intentions.",2017.0,78.0,69.0,"{'volume': '27', 'pages': '408-427', 'name': 'Internet Res.'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Jin2017WhyUP,\n author = {Wei Jin and Yongqiang Sun and Nan Wang and Xi Zhang},\n journal = {Internet Res.},\n pages = {408-427},\n title = {Why users purchase virtual products in MMORPG?

In Study 1, prior expectations and outcome valence were varied orthogonally in a vignette. More counterfactuals were generated after failures and unexpected outcomes. Also, more additive than subtractive counterfatuals were found after failure, particularly unexpected failure, and more subtractive than additive counterfactuals were found after unexpected success. Evidence for the generality of these results was obtained in Study 2, in which counterfactuals were assessed after students' real-life exam performances.

839,54c90914ad2bee1e7251ed53b3f82a47e40227c4,Relativity in the Perception of Emotion in Facial Expressions,"SUMMARY The same facial expression will be seen as expressing different types and degrees of emotion, depending on what other faces are seen. A relatively neutral face seems sad when presented alongside a happier face, happy alongside a sadder face. A relatively unhappy face seems sad when presented alongside an angrier face, angry alongside a sadder face. The specific emotion seen in a face can be predicted by combining the idea that human judgment is relative with a model of the scale implicit in the judgment of emotion. In that model, categories and dimensions descriptive of feelings are interrelated in a systematic fashion: Categorical descriptors such as happy, sad, calm, and angry are at specific locations around the periphery of an emotion judgment space defined by degree of pleasure and degree of arousal. Viewing one facial expression (an anchor) shifts the entire scale of judgment, displacing the emotion seen in a subsequent expression (the target) in the opposite direction. Specifically, (a) magnitude of shift in perception of the target is proportional to the distance of the anchor from the center of the emotion space, (b) the angle of shift differs by 180° from the angle from the center to the anchor, and (c) the quantitative pleasure-arousal shift in the target corresponds to predictable shifts in the applicability of categorical descriptors. The geometric formulation of these ideas, although perhaps exaggerating our ability to quantify the message seen in a facial expression, did suggest specific hypotheses, some of which were tested here in six experiments. Supportive results were found with successive and with simultaneous presentation of anchor and target, with various target expressions including expressions of neutral, surprised, and angry feelings, with both posed and spontaneous target expressions, with target expressions posed by the same actor seen in the anchor and by a different actor, with different groups of observers, and with different",1987.0,41.0,263.0,"{'volume': '116', 'pages': '223-237', 'name': 'Journal of Experimental Psychology: General'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Russell1987RelativityIT,\n author = {J.

It starts with the most prevailing definitions and theories on presence, most of which attribute special roles for the mental process of attention and for mental models of the virtual space. A review of the phenomena thought to be effected by presence shows that there is still a strong need for research on this subject because little conclusive evidence exists regarding the relationship between presence and phenoma such as emotional responses to virtual stimuli.

Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive technology and emerging digital behavioral pain therapy with analgesic efficacy for acute pain. We found no scientific literature on skills-based VR behavioral programs for chronic pain populations. Objective The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a self-administered VR program that included content and skills informed by evidence-based behavioral treatment for chronic pain. The secondary aim is to determine the preliminary efficacy of the VR program in terms of average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, stress, mood, and sleep, and its impact on pain-related cognition and self-efficacy. The tertiary aim was to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and compare the VR treatment with an audio-only treatment. This comparison isolated the immersive effects of the VR program, thereby informing potential mechanisms of effect. Methods We conducted an RCT involving a web-based convenience sample of adults (N=97) aged 18-75 years with self-reported chronic nonmalignant low back pain or fibromyalgia, with an average pain intensity >4 over the past month and chronic pain duration >6 months. Enrolled participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 unblinded treatments: (1) VR: a 21-day, skills-based VR program for chronic pain; and (2) audio: an audio-only version of the 21-day VR program. The analytic data set included participants who completed at least 1 of 8 surveys administered during the intervention period: VR (n=39) and audio (n=35). Results The VR and audio groups launched a total of 1067 and 1048 sessions, respectively. The majority of VR participants (n=19/25, 76%) reported no nausea or motion sickness. High satisfaction ratings were reported for VR (n=24/29, 83%) and audio (n=26/33, 72%). For VR efficacy, symptom improvement over time was found for each pain variable (all P<.001), with results strengthening after 2 weeks. Importantly, significant time×group effects were found in favor of the VR group for average pain intensity (P=.04), pain-related inference with activity (P=.005), sleep (P<.001), mood (P<.001), and stress (P=.003). For pain catastrophizing and pain self-efficacy, we found a significant declining trend for both treatment groups. Conclusions High engagement and satisfaction combined with low levels of adverse effects support the feasibility and acceptability of at-home skills-based VR for chronic pain. A significant reduction in pain outcomes over the course of the 21-day treatment both within the VR group and compared with an audio-only version suggests that VR has the potential to provide enhanced treatment and greater improvement across a range of pain outcomes. These findings provide a foundation for future research on VR behavioral interventions for chronic pain.",2020.0,55.0,58.0,"{'volume': '4', 'name': 'JMIR Formative Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Darnall2020SelfAdministeredSV,\n author = {B.

Eighteen manuscripts (reporting on 19 studies) met the inclusion criteria, with a majority published in the past 2 years. Two reviewers independently coded the articles regarding A) intended clinical outcomes and effectiveness of the interventions, B) study sample (characteristics of the participants), C) intervention administration (by whom, what setting), D) experimental methods (design/instruments), and E) technical properties of the VR-systems (hardware/devices and software/content). Emotional outcomes were by far the most common objectives of the interventions, reported in seventeen (89.5%) of the included articles.

Many actions in the real world require that people act without prior planning, and these actions are executed quite successfully. In this paper, we study the common action of two people passing through an aperture together in both the real world (Experiment 1) and in a distributed, collaborative IVE (Experiment 2). The aperture's width is varied from too narrow to be passable to so wide as to be easily passable by both participants together simultaneously. We do this in the real world for all possible gender-based pairings. In virtual reality, however, there is potential for the gender of the participant and the gender of the self-avatar to be different. We also investigate the joint action for all possible gender-based pairings in the distributed IVE. Results indicated that, in the real world, social dynamics between gendered pairings emerged; male-male pairings refused to concede to one another until absolutely necessary while other pairings did not. Male-female pairings were most likely to provide ample space to one another during passage. These behaviors seemed not to appear in the IVE, and avatar gender across all pairings generated no significant behavioral differences. In addition, participants tended to require wider gaps to allow for passage in the IVE. These findings establish base knowledge of social dynamics and affordance behaviors within multi-user IVEs.",2019.0,36.0,19.0,"{'volume': '25', 'pages': '2123-2133', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Buck2019InterpersonalAA,\n author = {Lauren E.

A nationally representative sample of 9,844 respondents aged 18-26 years was tested for chlamydial infection, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis in wave 3 (2001-2002) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The authors used multiple logistic regression to assess the relation between age at first sexual intercourse and these STIs and to examine variation by current age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Younger ages at first intercourse were associated with higher odds of STI in comparison with older ages, but the effect diminished with increasing current age. For example, the odds of having an STI for an 18-year-old who first had intercourse at age 13 were more than twice those of an 18-year-old who first had intercourse at age 17 (prevalence odds ratio = 2.25, 95% confidence interval: 1.42, 3.59). In contrast, the odds of having an STI among 24-year-olds with first intercourse at age 13 versus those with first intercourse at age 17 were the same (prevalence odds ratio = 1.11, 95% confidence interval: 0.88, 1.39). Thus, earlier initiation of sexual intercourse is strongly associated with STIs for older adolescents but not for young adults over age 23 years.",2005.0,37.0,466.0,"{'volume': '161 8', 'pages': '\n          774-80\n        ', 'name': 'American journal of epidemiology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kaestle2005YoungAA,\n author = {Christine E Kaestle and C.

In this article, we present data from 3 studies to address this research need. In Study 1, we identify 6 facets of Openness to Experience—intellectual efficiency, ingenuity, curiosity, aesthetics, tolerance, and depth—based on a factor analysis of 36 existing Openness-related scales. In Study 2, we present further validity evidence for the 6-facet structure based on a newly developed measure of Openness. Data from this study also suggest the presence of 2 intermediate-level factors (i.e., aspects) of Openness: intellect and culture. In Study 3, we present a short form of the newly developed measure, retaining items that showed the highest internal consistency and measurement invariance across 3 samples: U.S. undergraduates, Chinese MBA students, and Chinese undergraduates.

But how is interaction altered by the absence of a physical input device? What is the impact on game performance, on a player's expectation of their ability to control the game, and on their game experience? In this study, we investigate these issues in the context of a table tennis video game. The results show that the impact of holding a physical controller, or indeed of the fidelity of that controller, does not appear in simple measures of performance. Rather, the difference between controllers is a function of the responsiveness of the game being controlled, as well as other factors to do with expectations, real world game experience and social context.",2012.0,40.0,14.0,{'pages': '701-710'},"{'bibtex': ""@Inproceedings{Freeman2012TheRO,\n author = {Dustin Freeman and Otmar Hilliges and A.

Unless one can afford a troop of improvisational actors (and not even then for characters such as the Flying Carpet), one is only able to watch these rich characters. Believable agents allow people to not just watch, but also interact with such powerful, personality-rich characters. Believable agents are a combination of autonomous agents and believable characters from the traditional character-based arts, such as animation, film or literature. They are accurately described both as autonomous agents with the same powerful properties as characters from the arts, and as computer-based, interactive versions of personality-rich characters.

We review motivational (i.e., self-efficacy), betweensituation (i.e., increasing frequency, quantity, or quality of adaptive strategy use; decreasing frequency of maladaptive strategy use), and within-situation mechanisms (i.e., using more or fewer strategies in a given situation; optimally ordering strategies) as well as temporal targets of emotion regulation interventions (i.e., short-term effectiveness vs. long-term adaptiveness).

Cybervictimization affects areas such as academic performance, social integration and self-esteem, and causes emotions ranging from anger and sadness to more complex problems such as depression. However, not all victims are equally affected, and the differences seem to be due to certain situational and personal characteristics. The objective of this study is to analyze the relationship between perceived emotional intelligence (PEI) and the emotional impact of cybervictimization. We hypothesize that EI, which has previously been found to play a role in traditional bullying and cyberbullying, may also affect the emotional impact of cyberbullying. The participants in our study were 636 university students from two universities in the south of Spain. Three self-report questionnaires were used: the “European Cyberbullying Intervention Project Questionnaire,” the “Cyberbullying Emotional Impact Scale”; and “Trait Meta-Mood Scale-24.” Structural Equation Models were used to test the relationships between the analyzed variables. The results support the idea that PEI, by way of a moderator effect, affects the relationship between cybervictimization and emotional impact. Taken together, cybervictimization and PEI explain much of the variance observed in the emotional impact in general and in the negative dimensions of that impact in particular. Attention and Repair were found to be inversely related to Annoyance and Dejection, and positively related to Invigoration. Clarity has the opposite pattern; a positive relationship with Annoyance and Dejection and an inverse relationship with Invigoration.

Here, we show how the hedonic “liking” and motivation “wanting” signals for a sweet reward are distinctly modulated and tracked in this circuit separately from signals for Pavlovian predictions (learning). Animals first learned to associate a fixed sequence of Pavlovian cues with sucrose reward. Subsequent intraaccumbens microinjections of an opioid-stimulating drug increased the hedonic liking impact of sucrose in behavior and firing signals of ventral pallidum neurons, and likewise, they increased incentive salience signals in firing to the reward-proximal incentive cue (but did not alter firing signals to the learned prediction value of a reward-distal cue). Microinjection of a dopamine-stimulating drug instead enhanced only the motivation component but did not alter hedonic impact or learned prediction signals. Different dedicated neuronal subpopulations in the ventral pallidum tracked signal enhancements for hedonic impact vs. incentive salience, and a faster firing pattern also distinguished incentive signals from slower hedonic signals, even for a third overlapping population. These results reveal separate neural representations of wanting, liking, and prediction components of the same reward within the nucleus accumbens to ventral pallidum segment of mesocorticolimbic circuitry.",2011.0,103.0,407.0,"{'volume': '108', 'pages': 'E255 - E264', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Smith2011DisentanglingPF,\n author = {Kyle S.

However, understanding how social and emotional skills are learned, and how this process can be supported by technology, is an important but underresearched area in HCI so far. To address this gap, we review existing approaches to social and emotions skills learning (SEL) in other fields, with a specific focus on SEL in education, in which a large number of evidence-based programs is widely deployed. In doing so, the primary aim of this article is to provide a foundation and set an agenda for future research on the design of technology that would support, and help teach, social and emotional skills. We identify the key challenges to successful learning shared by SEL programs in education—such as embedding skills learned in class also into everyday situations, promoting reflection, and providing additional opportunities for practice—and outline how these could be addressed by digital technology. Overall, our key argument is that much existing HCI work could be used in support of social and emotional skills learning in education, and possibly other domains, but that the topic has not been explored so far. We also highlight how the focus on supporting SEL would bring novel opportunities and challenges for HCI, as well as provide a basis for a strong HCI research agenda in this space.",2015.0,170.0,69.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '1 - 34', 'name': 'ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (TOCHI)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Slovák2015TeachingAD,\n author = {P.

 A number of recent Managing Sport and Leisure commentaries have explored how COVID-19 is touching sport. Our commentary adds to these discussions by considering COVID-19, lockdown and (disability) sport. This is especially pertinent given the positioning of disabled people as particularly “vulnerable” in relation to current political discourse. Four key points of discussion are focused upon. First, we explore how the media has attended to issues concerning (disability) sport during lockdown. Second, consideration is given to how sporting and physical activity opportunities have been promoted during lockdown. Third, we focus on the notion of inclusion and explore the ways in which this has thrived during lockdown. Fourth, attention is given to community (disability) sport post-lockdown and what this may mean for disability sport. We conclude by arguing that the future legacy of lockdown and COVID-19 will tell us much about how disabled people have really been embraced within sport.",2020.0,29.0,45.0,"{'volume': '27', 'pages': '32 - 39', 'name': 'Managing Sport and Leisure'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fitzgerald2020COVID19LA,\n author = {H.

This study focuses on a core relational concept found in workplaces, organizational identification—the feeling of belongingness—and the impact of partnering with employers and health clinics in health information dissemination. We use social-identity theory and multiple identification to test our predictions from a sample of working adults representing more than 100 different employers. We found that when people strongly identify with their employer, they have increased health behavioral intentions and they intend to talk about the health information with coworkers. The significant models explain more than 50% and 30% of the variance in these two outcomes. The experimental results examining single and multiple organizational sources revealed no differences on any outcomes. These findings offer a contribution to health information dissemination research by articulating how identification with an employer functions to affect behavioral intentions.",2015.0,63.0,8.0,"{'volume': '30', 'pages': '209 - 220', 'name': 'Health Communication'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Stephens2015BoostingHH,\n author = {K.

875,5844822960f7143e9e0b3abd17f3e1a77d67aa62,A systematic review of virtual reality therapies for substance use disorders: Impact on secondary treatment outcomes.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Virtual reality (VR) therapy may be an effective tool in treating urges and cravings in substance use disorder (SUD). Given the high co-occurrence of difficulties with mood, anxiety, and emotional dysregulation with SUD, this review sought to examine the extant literature on the efficacy of VR for SUD in improving these secondary treatment outcomes.


METHODS
A systematic literature review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines in PubMed, PsychInfo, and Embase. Studies were included if they utilized immersive VR, were conducted with individuals with substance use disorder/dependence/misuse, and included measures of mood, anxiety, depression, emotional dysregulation, or retention in treatment.


RESULTS
Seven articles met our inclusion criteria. Five studies were conducted on patients using nicotine and utilized a cue-exposure intervention. VR was effective at reducing substance use and cravings in the majority of studies. Results on the efficacy of VR for improving mood, anxiety, and emotional regulation were mixed. Work examining retention in treatment was limited.


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
VR for SUD has the potential to improve mood and anxiety symptoms as well as retention in treatment for patients with SUD, particularly if the therapy targets these psychological symptoms. Future studies examining components of VR for SUD in individuals with drug use disorders, as well as examinations of targeted interventions for associated mood, emotional dysregulation, and retention in treatment, are necessary.

This is the first systematic review of the impact of VR on mood, anxiety, and emotional dysregulation for individuals with substance use.",2022.0,46.0,1.0,{'name': 'The American journal on addictions'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Taubin2022ASR,\n author = {Daria Taubin and Amy F.

877,584c87ca438ee2f70b7ed9c0c8cee93cd79dbacd,Infant--mother attachment.,"Bowlby's (1969) ethological-evolutionary attachment theory implies that it is an essential part of the ground plan of the human species—as well as that of many other species—for an infant to become attached to a mother figure. This figure need not be the natural mother but can be anyone who plays the role of principal caregiver. This ground plan is fulfilled, except under extraordinary circumstances when the baby experiences too little interaction with any one caregiver to support the formation of an attachment. The literature on maternal deprivation describes some of these circumstances, but it cannot be reviewed here, except to note that research has not yet specified an acceptable minimum amount of interaction required for attachment formation. However, there have been substantial recent advances in the areas of individual differences in the way attachment behavior becomes organized, differential experiences associated with the various attachment patterns, and the value of such patterns in forecasting subsequent development. These advances have been much aided by a standardized laboratory situation that was devised to supplement a naturalistic, longitudinal investigation of the development of infant-mother attachment in the first year of life. This strange situation, as we entitled it, has proved to be an excellent basis for the assessment of such attachment in 1-year-olds (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978). The assessment procedure consists of classification according to the pattern of behavior shown in the strange situation, particularly in the episodes of reunion after separation. Eight patterns were identified, but I shall deal here only with the three main groups into which they fell—Groups A, B, and C. To summarize, Group B babies use their mothers as a secure base from which to explore in the preseparation episodes; their attachment behavior is greatly intensified by the separation episodes so that exploration diminishes and distress is likely; and in the reunion episodes they seek contact with, proximity to, or at least interaction",1979.0,35.0,1423.0,"{'volume': '34 10', 'pages': '\n          932-7\n        ', 'name': 'The American psychologist'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ainsworth1979InfantmotherA,\n author = {M.

No interaction effects emerged among ethnic groups, but there were significant ethnic main effects for appraisal and coping. Compared with the Caucasian Americans, both Asian American groups appraised stressors as more challenging, and the Korean Americans appraised them also as greater losses. Both Asian American groups reported using more strategies of accepting responsibility, religious coping, distancing, and escape-avoidance than the Caucasian Americans did; the Filipino Americans also reported more problem-solving strategies than the Caucasian Americans. For all participants, challenge appraisals predicted adaptive coping (problem solving and positive reappraisal) and less distress. Problem solving, seeking social support, and positive reappraisal predicted less distress; self-control, accepting responsibility, and escape-avoidance predicted greater distress.

Yet in the absence of personal relationships or the expectation of direct reciprocity, help from weak ties might not be forthcoming or could be of low quality. We examined the practice of distant employees (strangers) exchanging technical advice through a large organizational computer network. A survey of advice seekers and those who replied was conducted to test hypotheses about the viability and usefulness of such electronic weak tie exchanges.Theories of organizational motivation suggest that positive regard for the larger organization can substitute for direct incentives or personal relationships in motivating people to help others. Theories of weak ties suggest that the usefulness of this help may depend on the number of ties, the diversity of ties, or the resources of help providers. We hypothesized that, in an organizational context, the firm-specific resources and organizational motivation of people who provide advice will predict the usefulness of advice.We investigated these theories in a study of employees of a global computer manufacturer. We collected survey and observational data on the relationships between information seekers and information providers; the number, diversity, resources, and motivations of information providers, and subjective ratings of the usefulness of the advice (from both parties in the exchange) and whether or not the advice solved information seekers' problems.We found that information providers gave useful advice and solved the problems of information seekers, despite their lack of a personal connection with the seekers.

886,591f62081b72a1a82e5cd8ad145cb359b74fc53c,Increased amygdala and insula activation during emotion processing in anxiety-prone subjects.,"OBJECTIVE
Increased amygdala reactivity during processing of certain types of emotional stimuli (e.g., fear, anger) has been observed in patients with anxiety disorders such as social phobia and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is uncertain whether this heightened amygdala reactivity is specific to treatment-seeking patients with anxiety disorders or is a general feature of individuals with increased anxiety-related temperamental traits.


METHOD
Thirty-two physically healthy subjects 18-21 years old were recruited from a large pool of college students. Of these, 16 were chosen on the basis of scoring in the upper-15th percentile on a measure of trait anxiety (anxiety-prone group), and 16 were chosen on the basis of scoring in the normative range (40th-60th percentile). Subjects participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an emotion face assessment task that has been shown to reliably engage amygdala and associated limbic structures.


RESULTS
Anxiety-prone subjects had significantly greater bilateral amygdala and insula activation to emotional faces than did the anxiety-normative comparison subjects. Higher scores on several measures assessing anxiety proneness (e.g., neuroticism, trait anxiety, and anxiety sensitivity) were associated with greater activation of the amygdala (predominantly left-sided) and the anterior insula (bilateral).


CONCLUSIONS
Increased amygdala and insula reactivity to certain types of emotional processing is seen in young adults with increased anxiety-related temperamental traits.

Yet despite their proclaimed importance, research on their long-term effectiveness is surprisingly scarce. Furthermore, comparative research acknowledging the concepts' different theoretical roots and illuminating the differences in their long-term effectiveness is lacking. In addition, little is known about how competitive actions affect the long-term effectiveness of both concepts. This study makes a first attempt to address these research gaps and offers a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of customer satisfaction and customer–company identification in driving important customer outcomes over time. Latent growth analyses of rich longitudinal data from customers over nine measurement points spanning 43 weeks (n = 6,930) show that customer satisfaction and customer–company identification have positive initial effects on customers' loyalty and willingness to pay but differ in their ability to maintain these positive effects over time. Whereas the positive effects of customer satisfaction decrease more rapidly, the effects of customer–company identification are significantly more persistent. Analysis of the moderating effects of relative competitive advertising suggests that customer–company identification is more effective at immunizing customers against competitive actions.",2014.0,122.0,143.0,"{'volume': '78', 'pages': '102 - 78', 'name': 'Journal of Marketing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Haumann2014FootprintsIT,\n author = {Till Haumann and Benjamin Quaiser and J.

The stimulation used HTC Vive VR system showing pictures from NAPS database within a specifically designed virtual environment. The stimulation consisted of two distinct sequences with 10 pictures of happiness and 10 pictures of fear. Each picture was contained in a separate virtual room that the participants traveled through along a preset path. The estimation employed EMOTIV EPOC+ 14-channel EEG headset and a custom-developed application. The software wirelessly received EEG signals from alpha, beta low, beta high, gamma and theta bands, time-stamped them and dynamically stored in a relational database for subsequent analysis. Our preliminary results show that statistically significant correlations between valence and arousal ratings of pictures and EEG bands are present but highly personalized. Simultaneous correct placement of VR and EEG headsets is demanding and precise localization of electrodes is difficult. In fact, if emotion estimation is not strictly necessary we recommend using devices with fewer electrodes. Nevertheless, we found the EEG to be effective.

Online executives note that creating a compelling online experience for cyber customers is critical to creating competitive advantage on the Internet. Yet, very little is known about the factors that make using the Web a compelling experience for its users, and of the key consumer behavior outcomes of this compelling experience.Recently, the flow construct has been proposed as important for understanding consumer behavior on the World Wide Web, and as a way of defining the nature of compelling online experience. Although widely studied over the past 20 years, quantitative modeling efforts of the flow construct have been neither systematic nor comprehensive. In large parts, these efforts have been hampered by considerable confusion regarding the exact conceptual definition of flow. Lacking precise definition, it has been difficult to measure flow empirically, let alone apply the concept in practice.Following the conceptual model of flow proposed by Hoffman and Novak (1996), we conceptualize flow on the Web as a cognitive state experienced during navigation that is determined by (1) high levels of skill and control; (2) high levels of challenge and arousal; and (3) focused attention; and (4) is enhanced by interactivity and telepresence. Consumers who achieve flow on the Web are so acutely involved in the act of online navigation that thoughts and perceptions not relevant to navigation are screened out, and the consumer focuses entirely on the interaction. Concentration on the navigation experience is so intense that there is little attention left to consider anything else, and consequently, other events occurring in the consumer's surrounding physical environment lose significance. Self-consciousness disappears, the consumer's sense of time becomes distorted, and the state of mind arising as a result of achieving flow on the Web is extremely gratifying.In a quantitative modeling framework, we develop a structural model based on our previous conceptual model of flow that embodies the components of what makes for a compelling online experience. We use data collected from a largesample, Web-based consumer survey to measure these constructs, and we fit a series of structural equation models that test related prior theory. The conceptual model is largely supported, and the improved fit offered by the revised model provides additional insights into the direct and indirect influences of flow, as well as into the relationship of flow to key consumer behavior and Web usage variables.Our formulation provides marketing scientists with operational definitions of key model constructs and establishes reliability and validity in a comprehensive measurement framework. A key insight from the paper is that the degree to which the online experience is compelling can be defined, measured, and related well to important marketing variables. Our model constructs relate in significant ways to key consumer behavior variables, including online shopping and Web use applications such as the extent to which consumers search for product information and participate in chat rooms. As such, our model may be useful both theoretically and in practice as marketers strive to decipher the secrets of commercial success in interactive online environments.",2000.0,71.0,3013.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '22-42', 'name': 'Marketing Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Novak2000MeasuringTC,\n author = {T.

The HIBS is a 20-item, scale describing common behavioural problems following traumatic brain injury (TBI), which are typical of dysexecutive syndrome. A principal components analysis was conducted on caregiver distress ratings for the 20 items comprising the HIBS and produced a two-factor solution with 10 items loading on each factor. Consequently, two sub-scales were derived and labelled Emotional Regulation and Behavioural Regulation. The sub-scales were found to have good internal-consistency reliability. It is suggested that the Emotional Regulation sub-scale assesses behaviours reflecting impaired emotional control, occurring during interactions with caregivers. The Behavioural Regulation sub-scale assesses problems typical of dysexecutive syndrome, but which carry less emotional valence for caregivers.

We begin with a brief contextualizing the gendered nature of media in the history of Chinese video sites and how theories around gender – especially gender performativity – might be adapted. While acknowledging the homogenizing effect of the term nüzhubo, we focus on two performers on Douyu – Hani9 and Nvliu – that are challenging conventional nüzhubo tropes.

902,5a518c21ad9efb79318c7eb0530d8baa7f64dd44,Virtual reality therapy: an effective treatment for psychological disorders.,"Behavioral therapy techniques for treating phobias often includes graded exposure of the patient to anxiety-producing stimuli (Systematic Desensitization). However, in utilizing systematic desensitization, research reviews demonstrate that many patients appear to have difficulty imaging the prescribed anxiety-evoking scene. They also express strong aversion to experiencing real situations. This chapter describes the Virtual Reality Therapy (VRT), a new therapeutical approach that can be used to overcome some of the difficulties inherent in the traditional treatment of phobias. VRT, like current imaginal and in vivo modalities, can generate stimuli that could be utilized in desensitization therapy. Like systematic desensitization therapy, VRT can provide stimuli for patients who have difficulty in imagining scenes and/or are too phobic to experience real situations. Unlike in vivo systematic desensitization, VRT can be performed within the privacy of a room, thus avoiding public embarrassment and violation of patient confidentiality. VRT can generate stimuli of much greater magnitude than standard in vivo techniques. Since VRT is under patient control, it appears safer than in vivo desensitization and at the same time more realistic than imaginal desensitization. Finally, VRT adds the advantage of greater efficiency and economy in delivering the equivalent of in vivo systematic desensitization within the therapist's office. The chapter also describes how to use virtual reality in the treatment of specific phobias: fear of flying, fear of heights, fear of being in certain situations (such as a dark barn, an enclosed bridge over a river, and in the presence of an animal [a black cat] in a dark room), and fear of public speaking.",1997.0,26.0,126.0,"{'volume': '44', 'pages': '\n          59-70\n        ', 'name': 'Studies in health technology and informatics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{North1997VirtualRT,\n author = {M.

This study is the first trial examining the utility of VRET from the perspective of OCD patients. Four OCD women assessed the sense of presence, emotional engagement, and reality judgment, and the anxiety and disgust levels they experimented in four scenarios, called the Contaminated Virtual Environment (COVE), in which they had to perform several activities. The COVE scenarios were presented on a Full HD 46” TV connected to a laptop and to a Kinect device. Results indicate that the COVE scenarios generated a good sense of presence.

Affordance, adopted from ecological psychology, is now widely used in technology studies, yet the term lacks a clear definition. This is especially problematic for scholars grappling with how to theorize the relationship between technology and sociality for complex socio-technical systems such as machine-learning algorithms, pervasive computing, the Internet of Things, and other such “smart” innovations. Within technology studies, emerging theories of materiality, affect, and mediation all necessitate a richer and more nuanced definition for affordance than the field currently uses. To solve this, we develop the concept of imagined affordance. Imagined affordances emerge between users’ perceptions, attitudes, and expectations; between the materiality and functionality of technologies; and between the intentions and perceptions of designers. We use imagined affordance to evoke the importance of imagination in affordances—expectations for technology that are not fully realized in conscious, rational knowledge. We also use imagined affordance to distinguish our process-oriented, socio-technical definition of affordance from the “imagined” consensus of the field around a flimsier use of the term. We also use it in order to better capture the importance of mediation, materiality, and affect. We suggest that imagined affordance helps to theorize the duality of materiality and communication technology: namely, that people shape their media environments, perceive them, and have agency within them because of imagined affordances.",2015.0,67.0,367.0,"{'volume': '1', 'name': 'Social Media + Society'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Nagy2015ImaginedAR,\n author = {Péter Nagy and Gina Neff},\n journal = {Social Media + Society},\n title = {Imagined Affordance: Reconstructing a Keyword for Communication Theory},\n volume = {1},\n year = {2015}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '144210454', 'name': 'Péter Nagy'}, {'authorId': '37998480', 'name': 'Gina Neff'}]"

The model shows how behavioral inhibition is related to and necessary for the proficient performance of four executive functions that subserve self-regulation: nonverbal working memory; the internalization of speech; the self-regulation of affect, motivation, and arousal; and reconstitution. These functions permit the construction, execution, and control of behavior by internally represented information, which removes behavior from control by the immediate context and brings it under the control of time. ADHD disrupts this process and returns control of behavior to the temporal now. A blindness to past, future, and time more generally, as well as an inability to direct behavior toward the future and to sustain it are among many of the deficits predicted by this model for persons with ADHD.",1997.0,0.0,423.0,"{'volume': '18', 'pages': '271–279', 'name': 'Journal of Developmental & Behavioral Pediatrics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Barkley1997AttentionDeficitHyperactivityDS,\n author = {R.

We investigate children's (age 1 - 5) transitions to and from screen-based activities to understand the boundaries families have set and their experiences living within them. We report on interviews with 27 parents and a diary study with a separate 28 families examining these transitions. These families turn on screens primarily to facilitate parents' independent activities. Parents feel this is appropriate but self-audit and express hesitation, as they feel they are benefiting from an activity that can be detrimental to their child's well-being. We found that families turn off screens when parents are ready to give their child their full attention and technology presents a natural stopping point. Transitioning away from screens is often painful, and predictive factors determine the pain of a transition. Technology-mediated transitions are significantly more successful than parent-mediated transitions, suggesting that the design community has the power to make this experience better for parents and children by creating technologies that facilitate boundary-setting and respect families' self-defined limits.",2016.0,57.0,99.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Hiniker2016ScreenTT,\n author = {Alexis Hiniker and Hye-Ji Suh and Sabina Cao and J.

Thus we used fMRI to determine which brain areas subserve processing of high‐valence expressions and if distinct brain areas are activated when facial expressions are processed explicitly or implicitly. Nine healthy volunteers were scanned (1.5T GE Signa with ANMR, TE/TR 40/3,000 ms) during two similar experiments in which blocks of mixed happy and angry facial expressions (“on” condition) were alternated with blocks of neutral faces (control “off” condition). Experiment 1 examined explicit processing of expressions by requiring subjects to attend to, and judge, facial expression. Experiment 2 examined implicit processing of expressions by requiring subjects to attend to, and judge, facial gender, which was counterbalanced in both experimental conditions. Processing of facial expressions significantly increased regional blood oxygenation level‐dependent (BOLD) activity in fusiform and middle temporal gyri, hippocampus, amygdalohippocampal junction, and pulvinar nucleus. Explicit processing evoked significantly more activity in temporal lobe cortex than implicit processing, whereas implicit processing evoked significantly greater activity in amygdala region. Mixed high‐valence facial expressions are processed within temporal lobe visual cortex, thalamus, and amygdalohippocampal complex. Also, neural substrates for explicit and implicit processing of facial expressions are dissociable: explicit processing activates temporal lobe cortex, whereas implicit processing activates amygdala region.

922,5ba703643f74d4017def0f3509fd113866c02d0f,Medical students’ motivation and academic performance: the mediating roles of self-efficacy and learning engagement,"ABSTRACT Background: Motivation matters in medical students’ academic performance. However, few studies have specifically examined how motivation and external environmental factors (e.g., institutions) affect medical students’ performance with large-scale data sets. The roles of self-efficacy and learning engagement in the mechanisms that govern how motivation affects academic performance are still unclear. Objective: This study aims to advance a comprehensive understanding about the relationships between medical students’ motivation, self-efficacy, learning engagement, and academic performance in a nationwide survey, taking students’ demographic factors and sociocultural environments into consideration. Design: We collected data from 1930 medical students in China. We probed the relations between studying variables. We then performed structural equation model (SEM) analysis to examine the mediating roles of self-efficacy and learning engagement on the relationship between motivation and academic performance. We further carried out multiple-group SEM analyses to compare differences between males and females, and between students in key universities and colleges (KUCs) and non-key universities and colleges (NKUCs). Results: Medical students in KUCs demonstrated significantly higher intrinsic motivation, better academic performance and lower extrinsic motivation than those in NKUCs. Male students reported higher intrinsic motivation but surprisingly lower academic performance than females. The total effect of intrinsic motivation on academic performance was larger than that of extrinsic motivation. There were significant indirect effects of either intrinsic or extrinsic motivation on academic performance through learning engagement. Besides, both intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation predicted self-efficacy; however, the direct effect of self-efficacy on academic performance was not significant. Conclusions: This study provided researchers with a holistic picture of students’ types of motivation in relation to academic performance. Findings from this study can help in rethinking the role of self-efficacy in medicine, in finding more effective interventions for promoting medical students’ levels of motivation, and in developing motivation-related counselling methods for different groups of medical students.",2020.0,31.0,127.0,"{'volume': '25', 'name': 'Medical Education Online'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wu2020MedicalSM,\n author = {Hongbin Wu and Shan Li and Juan Zheng and Jianru Guo},\n journal = {Medical Education Online},\n title = {Medical students’ motivation and academic performance: the mediating roles of self-efficacy and learning engagement},\n volume = {25},\n year = {2020}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '49498788', 'name': 'Hongbin Wu'}, {'authorId': '1739185543', 'name': 'Shan Li'}, {'authorId': '48510527', 'name': 'Juan Zheng'}, {'authorId': '1566647899', 'name': 'Jianru Guo'}]"

Nearly all boys and about half of the girls selected same‐sex favorites. Regression analyses used perceived character traits (attractiveness, strength, humor, intelligence, social behavior) to predict wishful identification and parasocial interaction with characters. For male characters, wishful identification was predicted by intelligence and (for girls only) humor; parasocial interaction was predicted by intelligence, attractiveness, and (for boys only) strength. In marked contrast, for female characters (chosen only by girls), attractiveness was the only significant predictor. Although girls rated female characters as more intelligent than male characters, this trait apparently was not an important determinant of attraction. Interpretations of the findings and implications for socialization effects are discussed.",1996.0,35.0,502.0,"{'volume': '40', 'pages': '389-402', 'name': 'Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Hoffner1996ChildrensWI,\n author = {C.

Lazarus's cognitive-phenomenological analysis of psychological stress provides the theoreticalframework. Information about recently experienced stressful encounters was elicited through monthly interviews and self-report questionnaires completed between interviews. At the end of each interview and questionnaire, the participant indicated on a 68-item Ways of Coping checklist those coping thoughts and actions used in the specific encounter. A mean of 13.3 episodes was reported by each participant. Two functions of coping, problem-focused and emotion-focused, are analyzed with separate measures. Both problemand emotion-focused coping were used in 98% of the 1,332 episodes, emphasizing that coping conceptualized in either defensive or problem-solving terms is incomplete-both functions are usually involved. Intraindividual analyses show that people are more variable than consistent in their coping patterns. The context of an event, who is involved, how it is appraised, age, and gender are examined as potential influences on coping. Context and how the event is appraised are the most potent factors. Work contexts favor problem-focused coping, and health contexts favor emotionfocused coping. Situations in which the person thinks something constructive can be done or that are appraised as requiring more information favor problem-focused coping, whereas those having to be acceptedfavor emotion-focused coping. There are no effects associated with age, and gender differences emerge only in problem-focused coping: Men use more problem-focused coping than women at work and in situations having to be accepted and requiring more information. Contrary to the cultural stereotype, there are no gender differences in emotionfocused coping.",1980.0,3.0,5282.0,"{'volume': '21 4', 'pages': '\n          337-59\n        ', 'name': 'Kango kenkyu.

Electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that inherent negatively valent contexts modulate cortical face processing as assessed with ERP components. However, it is not well understood whether learned (rather than inherent) and three-dimensional aversive contexts similarly modulate the neural processing of faces. Using full immersive virtual reality (VR) and mobile EEG techniques, 25 participants underwent a differential fear conditioning paradigm, in which one virtual room was paired with an aversive noise burst (threat context) and another with a nonaversive noise burst (safe context). Subsequently, avatars with neutral or angry facial expressions were presented in the threat and safe contexts while EEG was recorded. Analysis of the late positive potential (LPP), which presumably indicates motivational salience, revealed a significant interaction of context (threat vs. safe) and face type (neutral vs. angry). Neutral faces evoked increased LPP amplitudes in threat versus safe contexts, while angry faces evoked increased early LPP amplitudes regardless of context. In addition to indicating that threat-conditioned contexts alter the processing of ambiguous faces, the present study demonstrates the successful integration of EEG and VR with particular relevance for affective neuroscience research.",2018.0,105.0,33.0,"{'volume': '56 4', 'pages': '\n          e13308\n        ', 'name': 'Psychophysiology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Stolz2018ThreatconditionedCM,\n author = {C.

Despite extensive research, there is still the need to build a unique model based on multidisciplinary research illuminating questions as regards the real nature of metacognition and the methods to develop metacognitive abilities. The current study presents a new layered model of metacognition based on well-established theories derived from cognitive science, psychology, physical and computer sciences, environmental and other sciences, even from philosophy. We describe in detail the cognitive and metacognitive processes involved in each layer, while particular emphasis is placed on the relation between the control processes as well as the special role of attention. According to our model, each layer of metacognition describes a higher-order control system which operates under the rule of a series of attention processes at an ever more refined, abstract, united and holistic level. The same applies to the cognitive processes and abilities such as attention, memory, perception, pattern recognition. At each higher level, they display more advanced attributes and functions responding to the necessity of creating more abstract mental representations and upper class motivations, thoughts and emotions.  In addition, we recommend a number of strategies that support the metacognitive development at each level of the hierarchy.

However, current findings are lacking as to whether the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and cortical regions are involved in the learning effect when subjects retrieve associative memory, and whether their activations differentially change over time due to learning experience. To address these issues, we designed an fMRI experiment in which face-scene pairs were learned once (L1) or six times (L6). Subjects learned the pairs at four retention intervals, 30-min, 1-day, 1-week and 1-month, after which they finished an associative recognition task in the scanner. The results showed that compared to learning once, learning six times led to stronger activation in the hippocampus, but weaker activation in the perirhinal cortex (PRC) as well as anterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vLPFC). In addition, the hippocampal activation was positively correlated with that of the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and negatively correlated with that of the vLPFC when the L6 group was compared to the L1 group. The hippocampal activation decreased over time after L1 but remained stable after L6.

933,5de85c3d846bb04aee7d2edc04fe4206c901cf22,"Breathing, Attention & Consciousness in Sync: The role of Breathing Training, Metacognition & Virtual Reality","The purpose of the current review study is to shed light on the relationship between respiration and attention. Specifically, we examined whether and how respiration can provoke alterations in attentional states. Secondly, we investigated the benefits of breath-control training techniques in attention. Furthermore, we explored the effectiveness of virtual reality breathing training in improving respiration along with attention. Finally, we discussed the role of metacognition in the conscious synchronization of respiration with attention. It was revealed that every time respiration loses stability, attention fluctuates. Every time respiration is stabilized, attention finds steadiness. The results confirmed that respiration, attention, and as a result consciousness are characterized by bidirectional synchronization since their systems present coupling functions and dynamical interactions. It was also confirmed that breath control practices guarantee instant as well as long-lasting attentional improvements regulating all those mechanisms that strengthen mental alertness firing either the pathways of relaxation or excitation. Conscious-breath training is a practice of mindful metacognition that supports the coupling of attention with respiration. Metacognition in breathing utilizes respiration to improve attention but at the same time attention is used as a tool to consciously control breathing. Finally, breathing control training in virtual reality not only improves attention along with respiration but may finetune internal and external attention. This study concludes that breathing and attention are two ‘giant’ mechanisms that go hand-in-hand and carry on their ‘shoulders’ the whole cognition. Training conscious breathing via advanced technologies should be incorporated into the dialogue of education as methods for brain rewiring assuring better inclusion and academic achievement, especially for those with disabilities.",2022.0,0.0,48.0,{'name': 'Technium Social Sciences Journal'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Mitsea2022BreathingA,\n author = {Eleni Mitsea and A.

Relying on social identity theory and reciprocal action theory, we develop a framework that explores the process of how a firm's online community enhances consumers' brand commitment. We empirically examine how online communities influence brand commitment and subsequent customer behaviour in a field study of over 1,500 members of an existing online community for herbal products. In our analysis, we confirm that online community commitment is a key influence on brand commitment. We also find that online community participants possess stronger brand commitment than consumers who are not members of the community.

Self-efficacy is a construct that can measure the likelihood preventive behaviors will be performed, and thus could be applied to identify specific areas where AIDS education should be augmented. In this study, pregnant, mostly black, teens (N = 58) attending an alternative school in a large, midwestern city completed a self-efficacy scale to identify self-perceived areas of vulnerability to participating in preventive behaviors and avoiding high-risk behaviors concerning AIDS. The AIDS Self-efficacy Scale identified four areas of greatest vulnerability: using condoms, discussing previous homosexual activity, discussing previous bisexual activity, and telling a partner about an experience with a bisexual. The last three situations result from an inability to discuss a partner's past sexual history, indicating a need to be very specific in these areas. School health interventions should recognize and deal with issues sexually active teens have identified as most difficult, particularly specific aspects of sexual histories, and provide these adolescents with prevention skills necessary to reduce high-risk behaviors.",1990.0,11.0,50.0,"{'volume': '60 1', 'pages': '\n          19-24\n        ', 'name': 'The Journal of school health'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lawrance1990SelfefficacyAA,\n author = {L.

Twenty-eight male participants, aged 14-18, with social problems, took part in this study. They were separated into three groups: a control group, a VR group, and a non-VR group. The VR and non-VR groups underwent eight sessions of neurofeedback training over 2 weeks, while the control group just waited during the same period. The VR group used a head-mounted display (HMD) and a head tracker, which let them look around the virtual world. Conversely, the non-VR group used only a computer monitor with a fixed viewpoint. All participants performed a continuous performance task (CPT) before and after the complete training session. The results showed that both the VR and non-VR groups achieved better scores in the CPT after the training session, while the control group showed no significant difference. Compared with the other groups, the VR group presented a tendency to get better results, suggesting that immersive VR is applicable to neurofeedback for the rehabilitation of inattention and impulsiveness.",2004.0,37.0,65.0,"{'volume': '7 5', 'pages': '\n          519-26\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology & behavior : the impact of the Internet, multimedia and virtual reality on behavior and society'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cho2004NeurofeedbackTW,\n author = {B.

Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder face disproportionately high levels of demand both as caregivers, and as partners in multiple, complex, intervention programs. This study examines the relationship between parents’ experiences with their child’s interventions—specifically their sense of involvement in treatment and satisfaction with intervention-related training—and their confidence in parenting a child with autism spectrum disorder, defined as autism-specific parenting self-efficacy. Participants (N = 438, 93% mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder aged 2–17 years) completed our novel autism-specific parenting self-efficacy scale and rated their experience of involvement in their child’s interventions and satisfaction with intervention-related training across a range of common autism spectrum disorder–related treatments. Respondents also completed a caregiver burden scale. Findings indicate that parents who report greater involvement in their child’s interventions, and note greater satisfaction with intervention-related training, also report greater autism-specific parenting self-efficacy. Parents who report greater financial and social burden report lower autism-specific parenting self-efficacy. We propose that these results are important in creating intervention experiences that foster parental self-efficacy through involvement, productive training experiences, and addressing parental burden. Lay abstract What is already known about the topic? Parents of children with autism experience enormous challenges managing the complex needs of caring for their children. This includes coordinating multiple and complex therapies and acting as partners in treatment. Parenting self-efficacy is the confidence a person has in their ability to manage the tasks that are part of raising a child. People who have more confidence, or greater parenting self-efficacy, often feel less stressed and are more able to manage the demands of family life. This is particularly important for parents with children who have autism spectrum disorder, since they experience more parenting pressures. Although a lot is known about parenting self-efficacy in parents of neurotypical children, we do not know enough about how to help parents of children with autism spectrum disorder develop greater parenting self-efficacy. What this paper adds? This study shows that parents gain a greater sense of parenting self-efficacy when they feel more involved in their child’s therapy and are more satisfied with the training they receive as part of these therapies. We also find that feeling pressure related to being a caregiver of a child with autism spectrum disorder can undermine autism-specific parenting self-efficacy. However, parents’ sense of confidence was not limited by the severity of their child’s symptoms. Implications for practice, research, or policy The results suggest that there is an opportunity to help parents develop a greater sense of confidence in their ability to manage the complexities of raising a child with autism spectrum disorder by helping them feel more involved in treatment and by creating intervention-related training experiences that are more satisfying. Providers might also help by taking time to address the challenges and pressures that parents are experiencing, and helping them find ways to deal with these challenges. We suggest that there needs to be more research exploring how providers can best design interventions that support autism-specific parenting self-efficacy as a way of improving parental and child well-being.",2021.0,85.0,16.0,"{'volume': '25', 'pages': '1395 - 1408', 'name': 'Autism'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kurzrok2021AutismspecificPS,\n author = {Jennifer Kurzrok and Eileen McBride and R.

The total sample was comprised of 508 participants from Grades 7 to 12, 241 males (47.4%) and 267 females (52.6%), each of whom completed the questionnaires on two separate occasions. Three [intrapersonal (α = .83, CR = .86, and McDonald Omega = .86), stress management (α = .83, CR = .86, and McDonald Omega = .85) and adaptability (α = .82, CR = .85, and McDonald Omega = .85)] of the four scales had acceptable internal consistency. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were used with FACTOR and EQS version 6.1 software to examine validity evidence based on internal structure drawn from the scores on the EQ-i: YV-S, supporting the multidimensionality of the questionnaire. Three models were tested; the best fit to the data was the hierarchical model (S-Bχ2 / df = 2.11, CFI = .93 and RMSEA = .047), which hypothesized that the four specific factors (interpersonal, intrapersonal, stress management, and adaptability) were explained with a second-order factor, Emotional-Social-Intelligence (ESI). Finally, significant positive correlations were found between general self-concept and EQ-i: YV-S [interpersonal (r = .153, p < .001), intrapersonal (r = .235, p < .001), stress management (r = .145, p < .001), adaptability (r = .311, p < .001) and ESI (r = .360, p < .001)]; ESI showed significant direct power prediction of the general self-concept (.52) as demonstrated through structural equation modeling.",2016.0,40.0,17.0,"{'volume': '19', 'name': 'The Spanish Journal of Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Esnaola2016ValidityEB,\n author = {I.

Little research, however, has explored cross-cultural differences in emotion regulation in everyday interactions. Using a daily social interaction method, we examined whether people from collectivistic backgrounds (Chinese exchange students and immigrants from the Moluccas, Indonesia) living in the Netherlands differed from those from individualistic backgrounds (Dutch natives) in emotion suppression during everyday interactions. We also examined whether this depended on their relationship with the interaction partner(s). We found that Chinese participants suppressed positive and negative emotions more than Dutch and Moluccan participants and that this was related to differences in interdependent and independent self-construal across the samples. We also found that Chinese participants suppressed positive emotions less in interactions with close others, whereas Dutch participants suppressed negative emotions more with non-close others. No such differences were found for Moluccans. Our findings support the idea that people from collectivistic cultures suppress emotions more than those from individualistic cultures, but they also suggest that this depends on who the interaction partner is. Furthermore, they suggest that emotion suppression may change when people with collectivistic backgrounds have been raised in individualistic cultures.",2018.0,15.0,19.0,"{'volume': '53', 'pages': '176–183', 'name': 'International Journal of Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Huwaë2018CrossculturalDI,\n author = {Sylvia Huwaë and J.

Lesion and neuroimaging studies concur with the importance of these regions for attachment and the experience of affiliation in humans as well. Yet it remains obscure whether the neural bases of affiliative experiences can be differentiated from the emotional valence with which they are inextricably associated at the experiential level. Here we show, using functional MRI, that kinship-related social scenarios evocative of affiliative emotion induce septal–preoptic–anterior hypothalamic activity that cannot be explained by positive or negative emotional valence alone. Our findings suggest that a phylogenetically conserved ensemble of basal forebrain structures, especially the septohypothalamic area, may play a key role in enabling human affiliative emotion. Our finding of a neural signature of human affiliative experience bears direct implications for the neurobiological mechanisms underpinning impaired affiliative experiences and behaviors in neuropsychiatric conditions.",2012.0,59.0,58.0,"{'volume': '32', 'pages': '12499 - 12505', 'name': 'The Journal of Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Moll2012ANS,\n author = {J.

956,613f25ee20e07dfc7532cbfe703599967625f541,Learning together for effective collaboration in school-based occupational therapy practice,"Background. School-based occupational therapy (SBOT) practice takes place within a complex system that includes service recipients, service providers, and program decision makers across health and education sectors. Despite the promotion of collaborative consultation at a policy level, there is little practical guidance about how to coordinate multi-agency service and interprofessional collaboration among these stakeholders. Purpose. This paper reports on a process used to engage program administrators in an examination of SBOT collaborative consultation practice in one region of Ontario to provide an evidence-informed foundation for decision making about implementation of these services. Methods Within an appreciative inquiry framework (Cooperrider, Whitney, & Stavros, 2008), Developmental Work Research methods (Engeström, 2000) were used to facilitate shared learning for improved SBOT collaborative consultation. Program administrators participated alongside program providers and service recipients in a series of facilitated workshops to develop principles that will guide future planning and decision making about the delivery of SBOT services.

Common issues in these days are increasing nuclear family life style and emphasizing on materialistic prospects. All these changes have their own pros and cons. Changing shades of life in the contemporary world gave way to idyllic as well as harmful life style in individuals. Working parents, increased use of virtual social media, irrational following of western culture and lack of supporting guidance from elders are making our youth isolated, negative and specifically prone to drug addiction. One of the modem world's evils is drug abuse and intensified addiction. Governments all over the world dispatch constant efforts to reduce the drug trafficking by enacting strict laws and enforcing the same. But the corruption of human resource is still high due to drug addictions and the positive potentials of individuals are stunted. One such which has rooted strongly, is Opioid Addiction and for sure it is a hindrance for the progress of youth as well as the nation.Opioid Addiction: Opioid Addiction is characterized by individual inability to stop using opiates like heroin, smack, dodhe, afeem, brown sugar etc. and also presence of strong desire to take such drugs. It is mainly used initially as experimenting and for the sake of pleasure; and later to relieve cravings. The pattem of addiction starts primarily from abuse, gradually moving towards dependence or craving and ending up engaged in compulsion. This compulsion is harmful to an individual in psychological and biological modalities as well. It has been reported by Kosten and George (2002) that brain abnormalities are resulted from the use of heroin, morphine derived drugs. As per International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-IO (2009) any three or more following signs must be present to diagnose opioid withdrawal state - (i) Craving for an opioid drug, (ii) Rhinorrhea or sneezing, (iii) Lacrimation, (iv) Muscle aches or cramps, (v) Abdominal cramps, (vi) Nausea or vomiting, (v) Diarrhea, (vi) Pupillary dilatation, (vii) recurrent chills, (viii) Tachycardia or hypertension, (ix) Yawning, and (x) restless sleep. Chronic use of opioids may lead to weight loss, loss of libido, epilepsy, fatigue and skin changes.These drugs are derived from opium poppy which can be abused by inhaling through nose, injected into a vein or smoked in a cigarette. It is strongly believed that these drugs create euphoria, a feeling of intense pleasure in an individual. As a result, individuals become dependent upon them and when they need more of the opioids to get desired effect, they tend to have 'High Tolerance', i.e., the expansion of threshold in consuming drugs. Its intoxication can cause confusion, hallucinations, provide analgesia by binding to specific receptors in the brain, spinal cord, and to a lesser degree, the peripheral nervous system. When the opioid binds to the appropriate receptor, transmission of pain impulses is inhibited. The three main classes of these opioid receptors that constitute the endogenous opioid system are referred to as mu, delta, and kappa. This system is involved in many functions including modulation of the response to painful stimuli and stressors; reward and reinforcement; and homeostatic adaptive functions such as regulation of food, water, and temperature (Hilaire, 2010).Causes of addiction There are many reasons that are responsible for drug abuse. Kreek (2012) suggested that the internal as well as external factors are responsible including stress, social setting and addict mindset. Now-a-days, the very first reason for addiction among youth can be logically identified as relationship problems or breakups. They are engaged in relationships and when they find difficult to maintain it or doesn't get attention from the partner they start engaging themselves in drugs. Instead of facing or solving the problems, they disengage themselves and seek pleasure from substances. …",2017.0,0.0,0.0,"{'name': 'Indian journal of positive psychology', 'pages': '138-141', 'volume': '8'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sharma2017EmotionalRA,\n author = {G.

Epidemiological studies indicate that experimentation with addictive drugs and onset of addictive disorders is primarily concentrated in adolescence and young adulthood. The authors describe basic and clinical data supporting adolescent neurodevelopment as a biologically critical period of greater vulnerability for experimentation with substances and acquisition of substance use disorders.


METHOD
The authors reviewed recent literature regarding neurocircuitry underlying motivation, impulsivity, and addiction, with a focus on studies investigating adolescent neurodevelopment.


RESULTS
Adolescent neurodevelopment occurs in brain regions associated with motivation, impulsivity, and addiction. Adolescent impulsivity and/or novelty seeking as a transitional trait behavior can be explained in part by maturational changes in frontal cortical and subcortical monoaminergic systems. These developmental processes may advantageously promote learning drives for adaptation to adult roles but may also confer greater vulnerability to the addictive actions of drugs.

An exploration of developmental changes in neurocircuitry involved in impulse control has significant implications for understanding adolescent behavior, addiction vulnerability, and the prevention of addiction in adolescence and adulthood.",2003.0,140.0,1562.0,"{'volume': '160 6', 'pages': '\n          1041-52\n        ', 'name': 'The American journal of psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chambers2003DevelopmentalNO,\n author = {R.

This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of digital eye strain (DES), describe the pattern of gadget usage, and analyse the risk factors for DES. Methods: This online survey analysed 941 responses from students of online classes (688), teachers of online classes (45), and general population (208). A pre-validated questionnaire was used to calculate the DES score. Non-parametric tests of medians were used to compare the median DES score, Chi-square test to compare categorical variables, and binary logistic regression to find the predictors of DES. Results: The prevalence of eye strain was higher among students taking online classes compared to the general public (50.6% vs 33.2%; χ2 = 22.5, df = 1, p < .0001). There was an increase in screen time during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic time. The DES score was highest among students attending online classes (p < .0001), in those with eye diseases (p = .001), greater screen time (p = <0.0001), screen distance <20 cm (p = .002), those who used gadgets in dark (p = .017) and those who took infrequent/no breaks (p = .018). The DES scores were proportional to the increase in the number of hours of gadget usage during the pandemic. Conclusion: There is a need to educate people about limiting overall screen exposure and ergonomic methods of screen viewing. Efforts from policymakers to reduce the duration of online classes for students and online work hours for professionals are warranted to control this epidemic of eye strain.",2020.0,31.0,77.0,"{'volume': '28', 'pages': '285 - 292', 'name': 'Ophthalmic Epidemiology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ganne2020DigitalES,\n author = {P.

Discussion is organized around processes of reward and memory formation that occur during approach and consummatory phases of affiliation. Appetitive and consummatory reward processes are mediated independently by the activity of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA)-nucleus accumbens shell (NAS) pathway and the central corticolimbic projections of the u-opiate system of the medial basal arcuate nucleus, respectively, although these two projection systems functionally interact across time. We next explicate the manner in which DA and glutamate interact in both the VTA and NAS to form incentive-encoded contextual memory ensembles that are predictive of reward derived from affiliative objects. Affiliative stimuli, in particular, are incorporated within contextual ensembles predictive of affiliative reward via: (a) the binding of affiliative stimuli in the rostral circuit of the medial extended amygdala and subsequent transmission to the NAS shell; (b) affiliative stimulus-induced opiate potentiation of DA processes in the VTA and NAS; and (c) permissive or facilitatory effects of gonadal steroids, oxytocin (in interaction with DA), and vasopressin on (i) sensory, perceptual, and attentional processing of affiliative stimuli and (ii) formation of social memories. Among these various processes, we propose that the capacity to experience affiliative reward via opiate functioning has a disproportionate weight in determining individual differences in affiliation. We delineate sources of these individual differences, and provide the first human data that support an association between opiate functioning and variation in trait affiliation.",2005.0,766.0,814.0,"{'volume': '28 3', 'pages': '\n          313-50; discussion 350-95\n        ', 'name': 'The Behavioral and brain sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Depue2005ANM,\n author = {R.

972,632afe17608c32e8318ba8c1a2e42b617671012d,Investigating the Feasibility of Virtual Reality for Emotion Regulation with Youth,"Investigating the Feasibility of Virtual Reality for Emotion Regulation with Youth Background: In the last ten years, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has seen a rise in research on how features of interactive technologies can be designed to enhance emotion regulation training [1]–a response in part due to the increase of mental health issues. Youth are a vulnerable population at risk for mental health issues with long wait times to get help [2]. Emotion regulation, the ability to modulate the intensity and duration of emotional states, has been explored as a trans-diagnostic intervention to improve mental health [3]. Youth aged 12-15 use less adaptive or maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (e.g., suppression) that can contribute to depression or anxiety disorders. Thus, training adaptive emotion regulation skills is crucial for this age group [4]. One of the most effective emotion regulation strategies for youth is cognitive reappraisal–changing how we think about a situation in order to decrease its emotional impact [5]. However, learning is difficult because it requires: (1) generation of meaningful emotionally laden social situations; (2) real-time feedback of internal psychological and physiological states; and (3) practice modifying the interpretation of multiple situations [6]. Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated 3D environment that allows the user to experience a simulated world through stereoscopic 360 visuals, stereo audio, and 3D interaction with tracking sensors. The affordances of VR have been shown to strongly affect human emotional responses and interpretations of social situations when used in other intervention contexts [7]. As such, VR may provide unique opportunities for cognitive reappraisal skills development through three mechanisms: Mechanism #1: virtual environment–a simulated world that evokes the visceral experience of a realistic emotional response; Mechanism #2: interaction & feedback–possibilities to control and modify emotionally evocative aspects of the virtual environment; Mechanism #3: taking multiple perspectives–the ability to put the user in another’s shoes. As an example, you put on a VR headset and find yourself walking down the halls on the first day of high school; there are lots of new faces and you hope to make a good first impression (Mech #1). You hear the sound of your heart beating and your breathing getting heavier and uneven, and other kids laughing–are they laughing at you (Mech #2)? Luckily, you have a super power that allows you to embody other peoples’ perspectives (Mech #3). You take the VR controller, point it at the older kid who was laughing, and teleport into their virtual body (Mech #2). Suddenly, you can see yourself from their perspective and hear their thoughts–“look at all these new kids. I remember my first day I tripped down the stairs and broke a tooth. So embarrassing!” (Mech #3). You teleport back to your body and hear your heart rate drop to indicate that you have regulated the anxiety response (Mech #2). They weren’t laughing at you, but empathizing with your experience. Seeing and understanding this new perspective is cognitively reappraising the event. In this scenario, VR offers youth a way to practice cognitive reappraisal in a safe, meaningful, and emotionally laden environment with real-time feedback; thus meeting the reappraisal requirements (1-3) listed above, which are normally difficult to meet. Objectives & Research Questions: There is a rise in VR’s accessibility and popularity among youth (e.g., Oculus Quest 2 VR headset does not require a computer, costs $400 CAD, and has sold over 5 million units). My expertise in technology development of VR systems and content, design for mental health, and field evaluation skills make me well positioned to take this unique opportunity to investigate the overarching research question: can the above three VR mechanisms (Mechanisms #1-3) address the three learning requirements of cognitive reappraisal skill development in youth aged 12-15? Methodology: I will conduct research that investigates the following research questions that derive from my objectives above: (1) Requirements: What are the minimum technical and design requirements for a VR platform to help youth learn and practice emotion regulation? (2) Usability: What are the system and interface usability factors that youth suggest for the VR prototypes? (3) Feasibility: What is the feasibility of using VR’s three mechanisms to address the three learning requirements of cognitive reappraisal skill development during a six-week deployment with youth in their homes? (4) Efficacy: What are the subjective indicators of effects on cognitive reappraisal skills development (whether positive or negative) reported by youth? I will answer these research questions in three phases.",2022.0,9.0,0.0,"{'name': 'ArXiv', 'volume': 'abs/2212.00002'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kitson2022InvestigatingTF,\n author = {Alexandra Kitson},\n booktitle = {arXiv.org},\n journal = {ArXiv},\n title = {Investigating the Feasibility of Virtual Reality for Emotion Regulation with Youth},\n volume = {abs/2212.00002},\n year = {2022}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '11189596', 'name': 'Alexandra Kitson'}]"

The product may have high or low quality, and consumers are heterogeneously informed. The firm chooses a slow or (at a cost) a fast service rate. In equilibrium, informed consumers join the queue if it is below a threshold. The threshold varies with the quality of the good, so an uninformed consumer updates her belief about quality on observing the length of the queue. The strategy of an uninformed consumer has a “hole”: she joins the queue at lengths both below and above the hole, but not at the hole itself. We show that if the prior probability the product has high quality and the proportion of informed consumers are both low, a high-quality firm may select a slower service rate than a low-quality firm. The queue can therefore be a valuable signaling device for a high-quality firm. Strikingly, in some scenarios, the high-quality firm may choose the slow service rate even if the technological cost of speeding up is zero.

At the nexus of technological infrastructure, social organization, and interpersonal relations, the authors aim to explicate the complex dynamics between the gift economy and the commodity economy in the context of the increasingly platformized Chinese society. This paper will first discuss how the platform infrastructure is geared toward maximizing content monetization through virtual gifting. The paper then examines how corporatized streamer guilds foreground the moneymaking capacity of virtual gifting at the expense of its potential for building communitarian and reciprocal relationships. Based on these structural dynamics, the commodification of virtual relations is further analyzed to demonstrate how the hegemonic construct of virtual gifting is perceived and reproduced at the individual level. The paper concludes by offering a reconsideration of the role of critical communication studies in turning the tide of China’s live streaming industry.",2019.0,83.0,49.0,"{'volume': '12', 'pages': '340 - 355', 'name': 'Chinese Journal of Communication'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zhang2019VirtualGO,\n author = {Xiaoxing Zhang and Yu Xiang and Lei Hao},\n journal = {Chinese Journal of Communication},\n pages = {340 - 355},\n title = {Virtual gifting on China’s live streaming platforms: hijacking the online gift economy},\n volume = {12},\n year = {2019}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2108099413', 'name': 'Xiaoxing Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2068337056', 'name': 'Yu Xiang'}, {'authorId': '49953375', 'name': 'Lei Hao'}]"

However, no systematic research has been done to review the empirical studies conducted on the impact of teacher immediacy on students' motivation. Hence, the aim of the present study was to systematically review the available literature on different types of teacher immediacy and student motivation. Some common databases were searched and 30 eligible manuscripts were identified. With regard to the key features of the included studies, the review's findings were categorized into different sections, namely “the measures of teacher immediacy employed,” “the measures of student motivation employed,” “designs,” and “educational contexts”. The main findings of the studies were also discussed. The reviewed studies pointed to positive associations between teacher immediacy and student motivation.

In a previous functional magnetic resonance imaging study utilizing a working memory task, we demonstrated that activity levels in scene-selective VAC (ssVAC) regions can be enhanced above or suppressed below a passive viewing baseline level depending on whether scene stimuli were attended or ignored (Gazzaley, Cooney, McEvoy, et al. 2005). Here, we use functional connectivity analysis to identify possible sources of these modulatory influences by examining how network interactions with VAC are influenced by attentional goals at the time of encoding. Our findings reveal a network of regions that exhibit strong positive correlations with a ssVAC seed during all task conditions, including foci in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG). This PFC region is more correlated with the VAC seed when scenes were remembered and less correlated when scenes were ignored, relative to passive viewing. Moreover, the strength of MFG-VAC coupling correlates with the magnitude of attentional enhancement and suppression of VAC activity. Although our correlation analyses do not permit assessment of directionality, these findings suggest that PFC biases activity levels in VAC by adjusting the strength of functional coupling in accordance with stimulus relevance.",2007.0,117.0,263.0,"{'volume': '17 Suppl 1', 'pages': '\n          i125-35\n        ', 'name': 'Cerebral cortex'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gazzaley2007FunctionalIB,\n author = {A.

However, there has been a 'lack of supervision' problem that e-learner's learning unit state(LUS) can't be supervised automatically. In this paper, we present a fusion framework considering three channel data sources: 1) videos/images from a camera, 2) eye movement information tracked by a low solution eye tracker and 3) mouse movement. Based on these data modalities, we propose a novel approach of multi-channel data fusion to explore the learning unit state recognition. We also propose a method to build a learning state recognition model to avoid manually labeling image data. The experiments were carried on our designed online learning prototype system, and we choose CART, Random Forest and GBDT regression model to predict e-learner's learning state. The results show that multi-channel data fusion model have a better recognition performance in comparison with single channel model. In addition, a best recognition performance can be reached when image, eye movement and mouse movement features are fused.",2018.0,23.0,3.0,"{'volume': 'abs/1806.07372', 'name': 'ArXiv'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tian2018LearningUS,\n author = {Feng Tian and Jia Yue and Xing Wan and K.

The recent emergence of online environments as new sites for the temporal, spatial and social expansion of death and mourning (Brubaker and Hayes 2011; Brubaker, Hayes and Dourish 2013) has attracted scholarly interest in digital post-death rituals of mourning and memorialisation as an important social phenomenon (Walter et al. 2011; de Vries and Roberts 2004). While previous studies have been largely based on content analyses of individual MySpace logs and Facebook or discussion forum posts, the present study approaches digital memorial posts as entextualised moments of mourning shared with and for a networked audience (John 2013; Androutsopoulos 2014). The article analyses a corpus of Facebook memorial posts (N=525) as post sequences, wall events and texts, looking at how content on the site is produced, shared and discursively regimented. Based on the analysis, it is suggested that the intextualisation of moments of mourning on Facebook is participatory: it involves users’ selection of moments for public display relating to offline ceremonies of mourning, calendar-important dates or personal updates and contributing to the production of a textured wall in memory of the dead. The textuality of posts is found to rely on an ad hoc blending of formal genres of mourning and vernacular genres of writing dependent on (i) situational (date of posting activity, position in the post sequence) and (ii) extra-textual parameters (gender of poster, relationship with the deceased). The present socio-discursive investigation contributes to the growing, in-depth understanding of the texture and textuality of Web 2.0 mourning practices.",2014.0,69.0,19.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Giaxoglou2014RIPMA,\n author = {K.

989,64b9f38d26d98e098f1a799fb7ce81fe526ee26d,Soldiers' personal technologies on deployment and at home.,"OBJECTIVE
Personal technologies such as smartphones, computers, and gaming devices, are ubiquitous in the civilian world. Consequently they represent ideal vehicles for disseminating psychological and other health resources and interventions. However, almost nothing is known about personal technology use in the U.S. military. We conducted the most comprehensive survey to date of the use, availability, and need for personal technologies by U.S. military service members. Our survey asked detailed questions about computers and the Internet, phones and smartphones, other mobile or portable technologies, gaming devices, and TV and video media used during deployment and at permanent duty station or home.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We collected data by paper-and-pencil survey in 2010 and 2011 from 331 active Army service members at a processing and registration center in a large military installation in the western United States. Two cohorts were surveyed: Soldiers who had previously been deployed to a warzone and soldiers who had never been deployed.


RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
We measured high rates of personal technology use by service members at home across all popular electronic media. Soldiers at home essentially resembled civilian consumers in their use of popular technologies. Some technologies, including the Internet, gaming, and TV, were widespread on deployment. Others, most notably cellphones, were more restricted by availability, connectivity, opportunity, and military regulation in the warzone. Results will enable researchers and technology developers target their efforts on the most promising and popular technologies for psychological health in the military.",2012.0,8.0,32.0,"{'volume': '18 4', 'pages': '\n          253-63\n        ', 'name': 'Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Bush2012SoldiersPT,\n author = {N.

Accordingly, this paper endeavours to investigate the relationship between flow experience and Internet shopping behavior to which the moderating role of consumer characteristics (trust propensity, willingness to buy and self-confidence) is concerned. Data collected from 395 customers of an online shopping store provide support for the proposed research model. The results show that flow experience is significantly and positively related to Internet shopping behavior (continuance intention, purchase intention and impulsive buying). In addition, it also suggests that the relationship between flow experience and Internet shopping behavior is moderated by consumer characteristics. Specifically, when the extent of a customer's trust propensity, willingness to buy or self-confidence is relatively high, the influence of flow experience on Internet shopping behaviors is maximized. According to the findings, the implications and future research suggestions are provided.

Method: Systematic review and meta-analytic procedures were employed to synthesize experimental and quasi-experimental studies authored between 1980 and 2015. Results: The search yielded five studies from five countries reporting results for a total of 188 youth between the ages of 5 and 18 (mean age 13.26) who met criteria for an anxiety disorder. Risk of bias varied across studies. Meta-analytic results suggest a moderate and significant effect (g = .62; 95% confidence interval = [0.20, 1.04], p = .004). Heterogeneity was moderate (I 2 = 47.22) and not statistically significant (Q = 7.58, df = 4, p = .11), thus moderator analyses were not warranted.

Virtual reality therapy (VRT) uses multimodal stimulation that includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and gustatory stimuli. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of VRT in treating subjects with alcohol dependence (AD) by evaluating changes in brain metabolism.


METHOD
The VRT protocol consisted of three steps: relaxation, presentation of a high-risk situation, and presentation of an aversive situation. Twelve alcohol-dependent subjects underwent 10 sessions of VRT. The alcohol-dependent subjects were assessed with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography images before and after VRT, whereas the control group underwent imaging according to the same protocol only at baseline.


RESULTS
Compared with the healthy control group, AD subjects showed higher metabolism in the right lentiform nucleus and right temporal lobe (BA20) at baseline (P(FDR < .05) = .026). In addition, the metabolism in the left anterior cingulate was lower in subjects with AD (P(uncorr) = .001). After VRT, alcohol-dependent subjects showed decreased brain metabolism in the right lentiform nucleus (P(FDR < .05) = .026) and right temporal lobe (BA38, P(FDR < .05) = .032) relative to that at baseline.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest a neurobiological imbalance, notably, a high sensitivity to stimuli, in the limbic system in subjects with AD. Furthermore, we determined that metabolism decreased in the basal ganglia after VRT, which may explain the limbic-regulated responses of reward and regulation. Therefore, we tentatively recommend VRT to treat AD through its regulating effect on limbic circuits.",2015.0,0.0,45.0,"{'volume': '76 4', 'pages': '\n          620-7\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of studies on alcohol and drugs'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Son2015VirtualRT,\n author = {J.

Bucci’s theory of the referential process (1997) concerns three phases whereby a person activates emotional, or bodily experience (Arousal Phase), conveys the images and events associated with it (Symbolizing Phase), and reconsiders them (Reorganizing Phase). The Symbolizing Phase is the major focus of this study and is operationalized by a measure called referential activity (RA) based on judges’ ratings of the concreteness, specificity, clarity and imagery of language style. Computational models of RA have previously been created in several languages, however, due to the complexity of modeling RA, different modeling strategies have been employed for each language and common features that predict RA across languages are not well understood. Working from previous computational models developed in English and Italian, this study specifies a new model of predictors common to both languages that correlates between r = .36 and.45 with RA.

The authors extend the processing fluency model to examine the effect of conceptual fluency on attitudes. In three experiments, the authors show that when a target comes to mind more readily and becomes conceptually fluent, as when it is presented in a predictive context (e.g., a bottle of beer featured in an advertisement that shows a man entering a bar) or when it is primed by a related construct (e.g., an image of ketchup following an advertisement of mayonnaise), participants develop more favorable attitudes toward the target.

The client attends to alternating bilateral visual, auditory or sensory stimulation while confronted with emotionally disturbing material. It is thought that the bilateral stimulation as a specific element of EMDR facilitates accessing and processing of negative material while presumably creating new associative links. We hypothesized that the putatively facilitated access should be reflected in increased activation of the amygdala upon bilateral EMDR stimulation even in healthy subjects. Methods We investigated 22 healthy female university students (mean 23.5 years) with fMRI. Subjects were scanned while confronted with blocks of disgusting and neutral picture stimuli. One third of the blocks was presented without any additional stimulation, one third with bilateral simultaneous auditory stimulation, and one third with bilateral alternating auditory stimulation as used in EMDR. Results Contrasting disgusting vs. neutral picture stimuli confirmed the expected robust effect of amygdala activation for all auditory stimulation conditions. The interaction analysis with the type of auditory stimulation revealed a specific increase in activation of the right amygdala for the bilateral alternating auditory stimulation. Activation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex showed the opposite effect with decreased activation. Conclusions We demonstrate first time evidence for a putative neurobiological basis of the bilateral alternating stimulation as used in the EMDR method. The increase in limbic processing along with decreased frontal activation is in line with theoretical models of how bilateral alternating stimulation could help with therapeutic reintegration of information, and present findings may pave the way for future research on EMDR in the context of posttraumatic stress disorder.",2014.0,61.0,41.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Herkt2014FacilitatingAT,\n author = {Deborah Herkt and V.

Suicide attempts constitute a major risk factor for completed suicide, yet few interventions specifically designed to prevent suicide attempts have been evaluated.


OBJECTIVE
To determine the effectiveness of a 10-session cognitive therapy intervention designed to prevent repeat suicide attempts in adults who recently attempted suicide.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
Randomized controlled trial of adults (N = 120) who attempted suicide and were evaluated at a hospital emergency department within 48 hours of the attempt. Potential participants (N = 350) were consecutively recruited from October 1999 to September 2002; 66 refused to participate and 164 were ineligible. Participants were followed up for 18 months.


INTERVENTION
Cognitive therapy or enhanced usual care with tracking and referral services.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Incidence of repeat suicide attempts and number of days until a repeat suicide attempt. Suicide ideation (dichotomized), hopelessness, and depression severity at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months.


RESULTS
From baseline to the 18-month assessment, 13 participants (24.1%) in the cognitive therapy group and 23 participants (41.6%) in the usual care group made at least 1 subsequent suicide attempt (asymptotic z score, 1.97; P = .049). Using the Kaplan-Meier method, the estimated 18-month reattempt-free probability in the cognitive therapy group was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62-0.85) and in the usual care group was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.44-0.70). Participants in the cognitive therapy group had a significantly lower reattempt rate (Wald chi2(1) = 3.9; P = .049) and were 50% less likely to reattempt suicide than participants in the usual care group (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.26-0.997). The severity of self-reported depression was significantly lower for the cognitive therapy group than for the usual care group at 6 months (P= .02), 12 months (P = .009), and 18 months (P = .046). The cognitive therapy group reported significantly less hopelessness than the usual care group at 6 months (P = .045). There were no significant differences between groups based on rates of suicide ideation at any assessment point.


CONCLUSION
Cognitive therapy was effective in preventing suicide attempts for adults who recently attempted suicide.",2005.0,44.0,897.0,"{'volume': '294 5', 'pages': '\n          563-70\n        ', 'name': 'JAMA'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Brown2005CognitiveTF,\n author = {Gregory K Brown and T.

1011,677a8d2d8a7cb4d21a786dad22c0504ef04004f2,Virtual Reality Meditation Among Youth Experiencing Homelessness: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial of Feasibility,"Background Homelessness among youth is devastating, with high rates of substance use disorders and mental health comorbidity. Mindfulness-based interventions that include meditation and mindfulness skills training reduce stress and symptoms of anxiety or depression. However, engaging high-risk youth in interventions is challenging. Virtual reality is a more flexible platform for delivering meditation and may be appealing to youth. Objective The study objectives were to evaluate the feasibility of delivering virtual reality meditation and of collecting outcome measures, including anxiety and physiologic stress. Methods A sample of 30 youth experiencing homelessness was enrolled in the study. Youth were randomized to receive 10 minutes of one of three interventions: (1) virtual reality meditation, (2) audio meditation (through a web-based platform), or (3) virtual reality imagery of historical pictures and text. Subjects who consented to the study attended two research visits. The first visit collected survey measures of demographics, mental health, and substance use, and oriented subjects to the intervention platforms. The second visit (1-3 days later) delivered the intervention and collected pre and post outcome measures of anxiety and physiologic stress (salivary cortisol). Changes in anxiety and cortisol at the second visit were compared across groups using a linear regression model in which the primary analysis compared virtual reality meditation to audio meditation and secondary analyses compared virtual reality meditation to virtual reality imagery. Results Anxiety scores decreased in all groups, with a larger reduction among the virtual reality meditation group (difference=10.8) compared to the web-based meditation or virtual reality images groups (difference=5.8 and 5.0, respectively). After controlling for baseline values, there were no significant group differences in changes in anxiety scores or cortisol levels. In comparing virtual reality meditation and audio meditation, the effect size for anxiety was moderate (Cohen d=0.58) while the effect size for cortisol was small (Cohen d=0.08). Conclusions Preliminary results suggest that virtual reality meditation has a moderate benefit for anxiety but not physiologic stress. Future research is needed to confirm these results in a larger sample and to investigate whether the effects are sustained or increase with repeated use of virtual reality mediation. Virtual reality meditation appears feasible to deliver among homeless youth and merits further study.

This study tested the theory that there is primarily an indirect association between disaster exposure and aggression via posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. The current study also examined the association between aggression and academic achievement. A sample of 191 4th- to 8th-grade minority youth who experienced Hurricane Katrina were assessed for aggressive behavior using the Peer Conflict Scale (PCS), disaster exposure, PTSD symptoms, and academic achievement. Structural equation modeling of the set of associations was consistent with the theory suggesting that there is an indirect link between disaster exposure and aggression through PTSD symptoms. Aggression was negatively associated with academic achievement, and modeling indicated that the set of associations was age and gender invariant. Findings advance the theoretical understanding of the linkage between aggression and disaster exposure. Findings also support the utility of the PCS in disaster research and the link between PCS scores and academic achievement.",2014.0,44.0,61.0,"{'volume': '43', 'pages': '43 - 50', 'name': 'Journal of Clinical Child & Adolescent Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Scott2014AggressiveBA,\n author = {Brandon G.

De-spite the indisputable scientific interest, there are various unanswered questions concerning the identity of metacognition, its fundamental mechanisms and its limits. In this study, a holistic and multi-disciplinary approach is attempted by collecting and utilizing data from sciences such as cognitive psychology and neuropsychology, and philosophy. The research has led us to the 8 pillars that underpin metacognition. These pillars follow the model of the hierarchical or-ganization of knowledge. According to this approach, cognitive and metacogni-tive skills evolve progressively depending on the effort an individual exerts. It is worth noting that some cognitive functions such as attention and working memory seem to surpass the rest, since they operate simultaneously as cognitive and metacognitive abilities, affecting the functioning of the pillars, other cogni-tive functions, and in particular the higher mental abilities. Among the conclu-sions of greatest importance we can cite that the metacognition pillars are, like reality itself, a field of multiple readings. They contribute to the proper func-tioning of the cognitive and psychophysiological mechanism, the melioration of intelligence in all fields (physical, intellectual, emotional and spiritual), the emergence of consciousness and self-knowledge. In practical terms, the pillars of metacognition are the most valuable tool of self-learning, self-development, self-treatment and self-knowledge. Metacognition, also, constitutes a key factor in effective leadership, in medical and health professions. Lastly, the pillars of metacognition should be the cornerstone of general, special, vocational and ac-ademic education so as to promote holistic learning.",2020.0,69.0,88.0,"{'volume': '15', 'pages': '162-178', 'name': 'Int.

Design: A randomized controlled trial with a sample of 100 general educators, who were randomly assigned to the In the Classroom Web site (treatment group) or the LEARNet Web site (control group). Participants completed the pretest, accessed the In the Classroom or LEARNet site and the posttest and completed follow-up assessments 60 days after posttest. Measures: (1) Knowledge of effective strategies for working with students with TBI; (2) knowledge application; (3) self-efficacy in handling situations presented in text and video scenarios, and (4) a standardized self-efficacy measure. Results: On the posttest assessment, In the Classroom educators showed significantly greater gains in knowledge (P < .0001, d = 1.36 [large effect]), TBI knowledge application (P = .0261, d = 0.46), and general self-efficacy (P = .0106, d = 0.39) than the LEARNet controls.

Understanding the way we react to the interaction with virtual agents and the impact of emotions on social dynamics in the virtual world is fundamental. Therefore, in this study we investigated the implicit effect of emotional information by adopting a perceptual discrimination task. Specifically, we devised a task that explicitly required perceptual discrimination of a target while involving distance regulation in the presence of happy, neutral, or angry virtual agents. In two Immersive Virtual Reality experiments, participants were instructed to discriminate a target on the virtual agents’ t-shirts, and they had to provide the response by stopping the virtual agents (or themselves) at the distance where they could identify the target. Thus, facial expressions were completely irrelevant to the perceptual task. The results showed that the perceptual discrimination implied a longer response time when t-shirts were worn by angry rather than happy or neutral virtual agents. This suggests that angry faces interfered with the explicit perceptual task people had to perform. From a theoretical standpoint, this anger-superiority effect could reflect an ancestral fear/avoidance mechanism that prompts automatic defensive reactions and bypasses other cognitive processes.",2023.0,59.0,1.0,"{'name': 'Journal of Clinical Medicine', 'volume': '12'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rapuano2023InteractionWV,\n author = {M.

This article selectively reviews current findings in order to answer the following questions: (a) What is extrinsic ER, and how can it be distinguished from related constructs such as emotion contagion, empathy, prosocial behavior, and social support? (b) How can we best model the processes through which extrinsic ER occurs as well as individual differences in extrinsic ER ability? The answers show that although extrinsic ER has much in common with intrinsic ER, the 2 cannot be equated. Research is therefore needed on the extrinsic side of ER.

1022,68e68be43512e0db8dd150df38fbd91360934c31,Emotion regulation as a transdiagnostic process.,"The current article addresses the consequences of emotion regulation (ER) for mental health. A large body of research has shown that alterations in ER are related to psychological disorders across different diagnostic categories. Because of the apparent ubiquity of ER difficulties in psychopathology, several authors have proposed that ER should be regarded as a transdiagnostic process. This article critically examines evidence regarding alterations in the use of cognitive ER strategies as a transdiagnostic process. Cognitive ER strategies are examined as 1 example of several possible ER-related processes that could be involved in psychopathology. There is consistent evidence showing that a reduced use of cognitive reappraisal and an increased use of negative rumination are present across a number of disorders, whereas increased levels of positive rumination appear to be confined to bipolar disorder. However, there is only preliminary evidence from prospective and/or experimental studies on the causal nature of altered ER strategy use in the development or maintenance of psychopathology. The article concludes by discussing future directions, including methodological and design issues, as well as implications for assessment and treatment when studying alterations in ER from a transdiagnostic perspective.

The primary focus of this study is to identify the correlation between fluctuating level of attention and its implications on the cardiac rhythm recorded in the ECG. Furthermore, Electroencephalograph (EEG) signals are also analyzed and classified for use as a benchmark for comparison with ECG analysis. Several advanced signal processing techniques have been implemented and investigated to derive multiple clandestine and informative features from both these physiological signals. Decomposition and feature extraction are done using Stockwell-transform for the ECG signal, while Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used for EEG. These features are then applied to various machine-learning algorithms to produce classification models that are capable of differentiating between the cases of a person being attentive and a person not being attentive.

Investigating the neural underpinnings of adaptive emotion regulation and the extent to which such processes are compromised in MDD may be helpful in understanding the pathophysiology of depression. We report results from a functional magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrating left-lateralized activation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) when downregulating negative affect in nondepressed individuals, whereas depressed individuals showed bilateral PFC activation. Furthermore, during an effortful affective reappraisal task, nondepressed individuals showed an inverse relationship between activation in left ventrolateral PFC and the amygdala that is mediated by the ventromedial PFC (VMPFC). No such relationship was found for depressed individuals, who instead show a positive association between VMPFC and amygdala. Pupil dilation data suggest that those depressed patients who expend more effort to reappraise negative stimuli are characterized by accentuated activation in the amygdala, insula, and thalamus, whereas nondepressed individuals exhibit the opposite pattern. These findings indicate that a key feature underlying the pathophysiology of major depression is the counterproductive engagement of right prefrontal cortex and the lack of engagement of left lateral-ventromedial prefrontal circuitry important for the downregulation of amygdala responses to negative stimuli.",2007.0,53.0,947.0,"{'volume': '27', 'pages': '8877 - 8884', 'name': 'The Journal of Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Johnstone2007FailureTR,\n author = {T.

Therefore, there is a need to establish the protective factors of aggressive behavior in adolescence. While some research has demonstrated the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and various aggressive responses in adolescence, indicating that EI—or the ability to perceive, use, understand, and regulate emotions—could be considered a protective factor for the development of aggressive behavior in adolescence, the strength of this effect is not clear. The aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature concerning the relationship between aggressive behavior and EI in adolescents and provide a reliable estimate of the relationship between both constructs through a meta-analysis. For this purpose, we searched for relevant articles in English and Spanish in Medline, PsycINFO, and Scopus, obtaining 17 selectable articles based on the search terms used in research in the adolescent population. These studies provide scientific evidence of the relationship between the level of EI assessed from the three theoretical models of EI (performance-based ability model, self-report ability model, and self-report mixed model) and various aggressive responses, showing that adolescents with higher levels of EI show less aggressive behavior.

A century later, we are engaged in another major advance within psychoanalytic theory that involves recognition of the inherently relational nature of emotional experience. This paper examines the basis for the relational perspective in current views of psychic organization, as formulated in terms of multiple code theory, supported by research in affective neuroscience, and also emphasizes the therapeutic implications of the new approach. As I discuss, the process of change in psychoanalysis requires an interpersonal space in which the threatening experience can play out, while the associated arousal of painful affect can be managed to an adequate degree. From this perspective, the authenticity of the therapist's emotional engagement is crucial to enabling the explorations and enactments that are required, while avoiding (or minimizing) retraumatization.",2007.0,14.0,20.0,"{'volume': '43', 'pages': '305 - 326', 'name': 'Contemporary Psychoanalysis'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bucci2007DissociationFT,\n author = {W.

In this article, using a “reverse engineering” approach, we suggest that emotion inference from facial expression mirrors the expression process. As a strong case can be made for an appraisal theory account of emotional expression, which holds that appraisal results directly determine the nature of facial muscle actions, we claim that observers first detect specific appraisals from different facial muscle actions and then use implicit inference rules to categorize and name specific emotions. We report three experiments in which, guided by theoretical predictions and past empirical evidence, we systematically manipulated specific facial action units individually and in different configurations via synthesized avatar expressions. Large, diverse groups of participants judged the resulting videos for the underlying appraisals and/or the ensuing emotions. The results confirm that participants can infer targeted appraisals and emotions from synthesized facial actions based on appraisal predictions. We also report evidence that the ability to correctly interpret the synthesized stimuli is highly correlated with emotion recognition ability as part of emotional competence. We conclude by highlighting the importance of adopting a theory-based experimental approach in future research, focusing on the dynamic unfolding of facial expressions of emotion.",2018.0,78.0,37.0,"{'volume': '114', 'pages': '358–379', 'name': 'Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Scherer2018AppraisalDrivenFA,\n author = {K.

However, many clinicians feel ill equipped to deliver therapy via telehealth, while adhering to evidence‐based interventions. This article draws together clinician experiences of the issues that should be attended to, and how to address them within a telehealth framework. Method Seventy clinical colleagues of the authors were emailed and invited to share their concerns online about how to deliver cognitive‐behavioral therapy for eating disorders (CBT‐ED) via telehealth, and how to adapt clinical practice to deal with the problems that they and others had encountered. After 96 hr, all the suggestions that had been shared by 22 clinicians were collated to provide timely advice for other clinicians. Results A range of themes emerged from the online discussion. A large proportion were general clinical and practical domains (patient and therapist concerns about telehealth; technical issues in implementing telehealth; changes in the environment), but there were also specific considerations and clinical recommendations about the delivery of CBT‐ED methods. Discussion Through interaction and sharing of ideas, clinicians across the world produced a substantial number of recommendations about how to use telehealth to work with people with eating disorders while remaining on track with evidence‐based practice.

In particular, according to the allocentric lock hypothesis, individuals with obesity may be locked to an allocentric (observer view) negative memory of the body that is no longer updated by contrasting egocentric representations driven by perception. In other words, these patients may be locked to an allocentric negative representation of their body that their sensory inputs are no longer able to update even after a demanding diet and a significant weight loss. Objective To test the brief and long-term clinical efficacy of an enhanced cognitive-behavioral therapy including a virtual reality protocol aimed at unlocking the negative memory of the body (ECT) in morbidly obese patients with binge eating disorders (BED) compared with standard cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and an inpatient multimodal treatment (IP) on weight loss, weight loss maintenance, BED remission, and body satisfaction improvement, including psychonutritional groups, a low-calorie diet (1200 kcal/day), and physical training. Methods 90 obese (BMI>40) female patients with BED upon referral to an obesity rehabilitation center were randomly assigned to conditions (31 to ECT, 30 to CBT, and 29 to IP). Before treatment completion, 24 patients discharged themselves from hospital (4 in ECT, 10 in CBT, and 10 in IP). The remaining 66 inpatients received either 15 sessions of ECT, 15 sessions of CBT, or no additional treatment over a 5-week usual care inpatient regimen (IP). ECT and CBT treatments were administered by 3 licensed psychotherapists, and patients were blinded to conditions. At start, upon completion of the inpatient treatment, and at 1-year follow-up, patients' weight, number of binge eating episodes during the previous month, and body satisfaction were assessed by self-report questionnaires and compared across conditions. 22 patients who received all sessions did not provide follow-up data (9 in ECT, 6 in CBT, and 7 in IP). Results Only ECT was effective at improving weight loss at 1-year follow-up. Conversely, control participants regained on average most of the weight they had lost during the inpatient program. Binge eating episodes decreased to zero during the inpatient program but were reported again in all the three groups at 1-year follow-up. However, a substantial regain was observed only in the group who received the inpatient program alone, while both ECT and CBT were successful in maintaining a low rate of monthly binge eating episodes. Conclusions Despite study limitations, findings support the hypothesis that the integration of a VR-based treatment, aimed at both unlocking the negative memory of the body and at modifying its behavioral and emotional correlates, may improve the long-term outcome of a treatment for obese BED patients. As expected, the VR-based treatment, in comparison with the standard CBT approach, was able to better prevent weight regain but not to better manage binge eating episodes.

1046,6b0165e1aa808b29d4790f9f725e867a97cb2789,Next-generation psychiatric assessment: Using smartphone sensors to monitor behavior and mental health.,"OBJECTIVE
Optimal mental health care is dependent upon sensitive and early detection of mental health problems. We have introduced a state-of-the-art method for the current study for remote behavioral monitoring that transports assessment out of the clinic and into the environments in which individuals negotiate their daily lives. The objective of this study was to examine whether the information captured with multimodal smartphone sensors can serve as behavioral markers for one's mental health. We hypothesized that (a) unobtrusively collected smartphone sensor data would be associated with individuals' daily levels of stress, and (b) sensor data would be associated with changes in depression, stress, and subjective loneliness over time.


METHOD
A total of 47 young adults (age range: 19-30 years) were recruited for the study. Individuals were enrolled as a single cohort and participated in the study over a 10-week period. Participants were provided with smartphones embedded with a range of sensors and software that enabled continuous tracking of their geospatial activity (using the Global Positioning System and wireless fidelity), kinesthetic activity (using multiaxial accelerometers), sleep duration (modeled using device-usage data, accelerometer inferences, ambient sound features, and ambient light levels), and time spent proximal to human speech (i.e., speech duration using microphone and speech detection algorithms). Participants completed daily ratings of stress, as well as pre- and postmeasures of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; Spitzer, Kroenke, & Williams, 1999), stress (Perceived Stress Scale; Cohen et al., 1983), and loneliness (Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale; Russell, Peplau, & Cutrona, 1980).


RESULTS
Mixed-effects linear modeling showed that sensor-derived geospatial activity (p < .05), sleep duration (p < .05), and variability in geospatial activity (p < .05), were associated with daily stress levels. Penalized functional regression showed associations between changes in depression and sensor-derived speech duration (p < .05), geospatial activity (p < .05), and sleep duration (p < .05). Changes in loneliness were associated with sensor-derived kinesthetic activity (p < .01).


CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE
Smartphones can be harnessed as instruments for unobtrusive monitoring of several behavioral indicators of mental health. Creative leveraging of smartphone sensing could provide novel opportunities for close-to-invisible psychiatric assessment at a scale and efficiency that far exceeds what is currently feasible with existing assessment technologies.",2015.0,48.0,314.0,"{'volume': '38 3', 'pages': '\n          218-226\n        ', 'name': 'Psychiatric rehabilitation journal'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ben-Zeev2015NextgenerationPA,\n author = {Dror Ben-Zeev and E.

We investigated the feasibility of training healthy humans to self-regulate the hemodynamic activity of the amygdala, which plays major roles in emotional processing. Participants in the experimental group were provided with ongoing information about the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activity in the left amygdala (LA) and were instructed to raise the BOLD rtfMRI signal by contemplating positive autobiographical memories. A control group was assigned the same task but was instead provided with sham feedback from the left horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (HIPS) region. In the LA, we found a significant BOLD signal increase due to rtfMRI neurofeedback training in the experimental group versus the control group. This effect persisted during the Transfer run without neurofeedback. For the individual subjects in the experimental group the training effect on the LA BOLD activity correlated inversely with scores on the Difficulty Identifying Feelings subscale of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. The whole brain data analysis revealed significant differences for Happy Memories versus Rest condition between the experimental and control groups. Functional connectivity analysis of the amygdala network revealed significant widespread correlations in a fronto-temporo-limbic network. Additionally, we identified six regions — right medial frontal polar cortex, bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, left anterior cingulate cortex, and bilateral superior frontal gyrus — where the functional connectivity with the LA increased significantly across the rtfMRI neurofeedback runs and the Transfer run. The findings demonstrate that healthy subjects can learn to regulate their amygdala activation using rtfMRI neurofeedback, suggesting possible applications of rtfMRI neurofeedback training in the treatment of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.",2011.0,76.0,287.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zotev2011SelfRegulationOA,\n author = {V.

In addition the paper investigates whether internet experience moderates these relationships. Design/methodology/approach – To achieve the paper's objectives an experiment that involved visiting the ten most visited e-commerce web sites in Spain was conducted. Hypotheses were tested by using structural equation modelling on a data set of 1,396 online shopping customers. Findings – The results suggest a positive relationship between information overload and customer purchase intention and that internet experience reinforces this positive effect. Moreover the results confirm that the relationship between information disorganisation and customer purchase intention is not significant and that internet experience does not moderate the relationship.

An attentive student will naturally be more open to obtaining knowledge than a bored or frustrated student. In recent years, tools such as skin temperature measurements and body posture calculations have been developed for the purpose of determining a student's affect, or emotional state of mind. However, measuring eye-gaze data is particularly noteworthy in that it can collect measurements non-intrusively, while also being relatively simple to set up and use. This paper details how data obtained from an eye-tracker can indeed be used to predict a student's attention as a measure of affect over the course of a class. From this research, an accuracy of 77% was achieved using the Extreme Gradient Boosting technique of machine learning. The outcome indicates that eye-gaze can be indeed used as a basis for constructing a predictive model.",2019.0,15.0,17.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 2019 ACM Southeast Conference'},"{'bibtex': ""@Article{Veliyath2019ModelingSA,\n author = {Narayanan Veliyath and Pradipta De and Andrew A.

Four prototypic attachment patterns are defined using combinations of a person's self-image (positive or negative) and image of others (positive or negative). In Study 1, an interview was developed to yield continuous and categorical ratings of the 4 attachment styles. Intercorrelations of the attachment ratings were consistent with the proposed model. Attachment ratings were validated by self-report measures of self-concept and interpersonal functioning. Each style was associated with a distinct profile of interpersonal problems, according to both self- and friend-reports. In Study 2, attachment styles within the family of origin and with peers were assessed independently. Results of Study 1 were replicated.

The authors proposed a three-session treatment protocol with an emphasis on the process of externalizing and shifting problem-focused identities using concrete metaphors. Trained clinicians from four post-secondary student counseling centers in Ontario, Canada, implemented externalizing metaphors therapy (EMT) to 50 participants who presented with anxiety and/or depression. Participating clients completed two self-report measures of dysphoria (DASS-21, STAI) before beginning and at the end of treatment. The results were then compared to a small sample of participants who engaged in treatment as usual (TAU).

Emily J. Doolittle is team lead for social behavioral research in the National Center for Education Research, Institute of Education Sciences, US Department of Education. Research increasingly suggests that social and emotional learning (SEL) matters a great deal for important life outcomes like success in school, college entry and completion, and later earnings. This research also tells us that SEL can be taught and nurtured in schools so that students increase their ability to integrate thinking, emotions, and behavior in ways that lead to positive school and life outcomes. Although the term social and emotional learning has been around for 20 years, we’ve recently seen a rapid surge in interest in SEL among parents, educators, and policymakers. For example, the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) is supporting 10 large school districts and 45 smaller ones through its Collaborating Districts Initiative as they begin to incorporate a variety of SEL programs and practices into their schools. CASEL also recently launched a Collaborating States Initiative to support states as they develop policies, standards, and guidelines for SEL in schools. All 50 states have SEL standards in place at the preschool level, and four (Illinois, Kansas, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania) have SEL standards for kindergarten through 12th grade. And the Aspen Institute recently launched a National Commission on Social, Emotional, and Academic Development to explore how schools can fully integrate SEL into policies and instruction that have traditionally emphasized academics. We also know that teachers believe SEL skills can be taught, although they may not always know the best way to do so in their classrooms.1",2017.0,12.0,114.0,"{'volume': '27', 'pages': '11 - 3', 'name': 'The Future of Children'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Jones2017SocialAE,\n author = {Stephanie M.

Range-dependent utility enables experimental results to be explained without recourse to the probability weighting function. Experimental data show that range-dependent utilities can be normalized to obtain decision utility -- a single utility function able to describe decisions involving lotteries denied over different ranges.

This text argues that our view of human intelligence is far too narrow, ignoring a crucial range of abilities that matter immensely in terms of how we do in life. Drawing on brain and behavioural research, the author shows the factors at work when people of high IQ flounder and those of modest IQ do surprisingly well. These factors add up to a different way of succeeding in life - one the author terms ""emotional intelligence"". Emotional intelligence includes self-awareness and impulse control, persistence, zeal and self-motivation, empathy and social deftness. These are the qualities that mark people that excel. They are also the hallmarks of character and self-discipline, of altruism and compassion. As Goleman demonstrates, the personal costs of deficits in emotional intelligence can range from problems in marriage and poor physical health in adults to eating disorders and depression in children. But the news is hopeful. Emotional intelligence is not fixed at birth. Goleman's argument gives insights into the brain architecture underlying emotion and rationality. He shows how emotional intelligence can be nurtured and strengthened in all of us. Since the emotional lessons a child learns actually sculpt the brain's circuitry, Goleman provides detailed guidance as to how parents and schools can benefit from this.",1995.0,0.0,6759.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Goleman1995EmotionalIW,\n author = {D.

Consistent with hedonic contingency theory, happy participants weighted potential for creativity as well as the pleasantness of the task more heavily in their preference ratings. In Study 2, participants were given either a neutral or mood-threatening item generation task to perform. Results illustrated that happy participants exhibited greater cognitive flexibility in all cases; when confronted with a potentially mood-threatening task, happy participants were able to creatively transform the task so as to maintain positive mood and interest. Finally, Study 3 manipulated participants' beliefs that moods could or could not be altered. Results replicated the standard positive mood-increased cognitive flexibility effect in the nonmood-freezing condition, but no effects of mood on creativity were found in the mood-freezing condition.

Indeed, the science, practice, and implementation of Mindfulness Based Interventions (MBIs) have dramatically increased in recent years. At its base, mindfulness is a natural human state in which an individual experiences and attends to the present moment. Interventions have been developed to train individuals how to incorporate this practice into daily life. The current article will discuss the concept of mindfulness and describe its implementation in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. We further identify for whom MBIs have been shown to be efficacious and provide an up-to-date summary of how these interventions work. This includes research support for the cognitive, psychological, and neural mechanisms that lead to psychiatric improvements. This review provides a basis for incorporating these interventions into treatment.",2018.0,95.0,69.0,"{'volume': '16 1', 'pages': '\n          32-39\n        ', 'name': 'Focus'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Shapero2018MindfulnessBasedII,\n author = {Benjamin G.

Two core dimensions along which affect is organized are approach and withdrawal. Some of the key circuitry underlying approach and withdrawal components of emotion is reviewed with an emphasis on the role played by different sectors of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and amygdala. Affective style refers to individual differences in valence-specific features of emotional reactivity and regulation. The different parameters of affective style can be objectively measured using specific laboratory probes. Relations between individual differences in prefrontal and amygdala function and specific components of affective style are illustrated. The final section of the article concludes with a brief discussion of plasticity in the central circuitry of emotion and the possibility that this circuitry can be shaped by training experiences that might potentially promote a more resilient, positive affective style. The implications of this body of work for a broader conception of psychophysiology and for training the next generation of psychophysiologists are considered in the conclusion.",2003.0,107.0,510.0,"{'volume': '40 5', 'pages': '\n          655-65\n        ', 'name': 'Psychophysiology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Davidson2003AffectiveNA,\n author = {R.

The exclusive focus on pathology that has dominated so much of our discipline results in a model of the human being lacking the positive features that make life worth living. Hope, wisdom, creativity, future mindedness, courage, spirituality, responsibility, and perseverance are ignored or explained as transformations of more authentic negative impulses. The 15 articles in this millennial issue of the American Psychologist discuss such issues as what enables happiness, the effects of autonomy and self-regulation, how optimism and hope affect health, what constitutes wisdom, and how talent and creativity come to fruition.

This can be particularly apt for more at‐risk young people who may not engage readily with other approaches. Published evaluation of such interventions is however sparse. This paper aims to describe an evaluation of the DRUMBEAT program which uses drumming as a way to engage at‐risk youth, whilst simultaneously incorporating themes relating to mental wellbeing and healthy relationships., – An evaluation was undertaken in 19 schools participating in the ten‐week DRUMBEAT program. Pre, interim and post‐program surveys were administered to participating students (n=180). School‐based data on student behaviour and teacher feedback was also collected., – Positive changes were observed on several measures, including a 10 per cent increase in self‐esteem scores by program completion. School data showed a decrease in reported behaviour incidents for 29 per cent of participants. Overall, the evaluation indicated that the DRUMBEAT program provides a creative medium for working with at‐risk young people and helps develop self‐esteem and social relationship skills., – There is a paucity of published evaluations of interventions of this kind. Also novel is the delivery of the program in a school‐based rather than clinical therapy setting.

Developmental Changes in Mental Performance. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 1973, 38 (3, Serial No. 150). A distinction was made between the general level of a person's IQ (i.e., the average of his scores across age) and his profile contour (i.e., the developmental pattern of inflections in performance). Most research has focused on the general level of IQ and its correlates; this project systematically investigated patterns of IQ change with data from the Fels Longitudinal Study. Normal middle-class children changed an average of 28.5 IQ points between 21/2 and 17 years of age, and one in seven displayed shifts of more than 40 points. While siblings were more similar in their general level of IQ than unrelated children matched or unmatched for social class, the pattern of developmental changes in childhood IQs or infant DQs was not more similar among siblings than among unrelated children. Twins and triplets scored lower in general level and were less variable in IQ over age than singletons, thus potentially qualifying attempts to generalize IQ change results based upon multiple-birth samples to singletons. Parent-child IQ correlations were higher when the parent was assessed as an adult than if both parent and child were tested at the same chronological ages. A sample of 80 subjects who had relatively complete IQ data (maximum of 17 tests) between 2/2 and 17 years were clustered into five groups which represented different patterns of IQ change over age. These profiles were relatively simple linear or quadratic trends and not random fluctuations about a constant value. Major inflection points occurred at 6 and 10 years of age. It was not obvious that these patterns were simple products of repeated testing or the changing nature of the IQ test. The children in the five IQ profile clusters had parents who were different in the extent to which they attempted to accelerate their child's development and the severity of punishments they administered. These parental correlates appeared to hold up even when parental education and IQ as well as the general level of the child's IQ were statistically controlled. Given the assumptions prompted by these data, the changing nature of environmental circumstances across the childhood years for a given individual may be as potent in changing IQ as the differences between family environments.

THE LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES IN IQ Several reviews of the literature on the development of mental performance are available (Bayley 1970; Bloom 1964; Pinneau 1961). However, most of the research surveyed involves correlations between mental test performance at several different ages and correlations between personality and social variables with IQ at one age versus another. Such research strategies are valuable and have yielded important results, but they are ""developmental"" only in the sense that data are available at several ages on the same subjects and correlational relationships are derived within and across age periods. Because the correlation coefficient is independent of the means of the distributions, it is possible to obtain high correlational stability of IQ across age but marked fluctuations in the group mean. In short, cross-age correlations reveal little about the nature of absolute changes in level of performance, and they provide only partial information about individual differences in developmental pattern. This project focuses on developmental patterns of change in the level of mental performance as assessed by traditional intelligence tests.",2016.0,97.0,6663.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Mccall2016MONOGRAPHSOT,\n author = {R.

Drawing on the experiences of a group of informants who participated in an ethnographical study of house moving in Montreal, Canada, this article provides significant evidence that the unattractiveness of the gift economy can incite people to turn to the market as an escape. It examines how people use the market to free themselves from the straitjacket of social expectations—from the sense of indebtedness and emotional oppression—which constrains them in their reciprocity relations inside the gift economy.

Cluster analysis highlighted four distinct burnout risk profiles: Low Burnout, Medium Risk, High Risk, and High Burnout. The High Burnout group showed both lower Resilience and lower CISS Task-oriented coping strategy than the Medium Risk group and higher IU Prospective than the Low Burnout group. Results of a linear regression analysis confirmed that CISS Emotion-oriented style positively predicted MBI Emotional Exhaustion, CISS Task-oriented and Emotion-oriented emerged as significant predictors (negatively and positively, respectively) of MBI Depersonalization, and Resilience positively predicted MBI Personal Accomplishment. In conclusion, the results showed that the COVID-19 emergency had a significant impact on GPs’ work management. Implementing task-oriented problem management, rather than emotional strategies, appears to protect against burnout in these circumstances. It is possible that the emotions related to the pandemic are too intense to be regulated and used productively to manage the professional issues that the COVID-19 pandemic presents.",2020.0,53.0,97.0,"{'volume': '11', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Monte2020FromRT,\n author = {C.

The objectives of this study were to analyze the relationship between emotional intelligence, resilience, and family functioning in adolescent use of alcohol and tobacco, and to find emotional profiles for their use with regard to self-concept. The sample was made up of 317 high school students aged 13 to 18, who filled out the Brief Emotional Intelligence Inventory, the Resilience Scale for Adolescents, the APGAR Scale, the Alcohol Expectancy Questionnaire–Adolescents, and the Five-Factor Self-Concept Questionnaire. The results revealed that emotional intelligence and resilience, specifically stress management and family cohesion, were significant in the group of non-users. Family functioning acts as a predictor for the onset of use of tobacco and alcohol. Positive expectancies about drinking alcohol were found to be a risk factor, and the intrapersonal factor was found to be protective. Both stress management and family cohesion were protective factors against smoking. Furthermore, cluster analysis revealed the emotional profiles for users of both substances based on self-concept. Finally, the importance of the direction of the relationship between the variables studied for intervention in this problem should be mentioned.

This paper extends current understanding about the concept of self-efficacy in the context of computer software. We describe how two broad types of computer self-efficacy beliefs, general self-efficacy and task-specific self-efficacy, are constructed across different computing tasks by suggesting that initial general CSE beliefs will strongly predict subsequentspecific CSE beliefs. The theorized causal relationships illustrate the malleability and development of CSE beliefs over time, within a training environment where individuals are progressively provided with greater opportunity for hands-on experience and practice with different software. Consistent with the findings of prior research, judgments of self-efficacy then serve as key antecedents of the perceived cognitive effort (ease of use) associated with technology usage. Further, we theorize that self-efficacy judgments in the task domain of computing are strongly influenced by the extent to which individuals believe that they are personally innovative with respect to information technology. Panel data were collected using a longitudinal research design within a training context where 186 subjects were taught two software packages in a sequential manner over a 14-week period. The emergent patterns of the hypothesized relationships are examined using structural equation modeling techniques.

However, research shows spousal carers often reporting poorer health and well-being with psychosocial challenges including increased marital dissatisfaction. This study explores the accounts of participants caring for a spouse with brain injury. Materials and methods: This study used semi-structured interviewing and interpretative phenomenological analysis. Results: One theme, “Living in and beyond the loop of fear”, with two subheadings is reported. Participants’ attempts to manage their fears prominently defined their early caregiving. Fears were aggravated by the vulnerability of their spouse’s health which partially owed to brain injury sometimes having no symptoms prior to its onset. Consequently, participants anxiously strove to prevent further harm to their spouse’s health due to what they perceived as the continued “hidden” threat of brain injury. Therefore, participants became hypervigilant, leaving themselves vulnerable to burnout. Over time, some participants modified care practices and managed fears using beliefs accepting their limits to protect their spouses’ health. Conclusions: Findings suggest that beliefs conducive to acceptance helped carers to develop more sustainable, less over-protective, care. Interventions to help carers develop similar beliefs could be provided in therapeutic settings. Recommendations for future research are made. Implications for Rehabilitation Caring for a long-term partner with acquired brain injury has considerable challenges which can threaten an individual’s health and well-being. Our research reports on carers’ experiences of anxiety which they managed through hypervigilant and overprotective practices which put them at risk of burnout. Consequently, we recommend the promotion of care beliefs that reframe caregiving: recognising the carer’s limitations to safeguard a spouse, whilst accepting the vulnerability of the spouse’s health. We propose that promoting such principles in therapeutic settings may better equip carers emotionally to provide sustainable care, something which could benefit the carer and spouse’s rehabilitation alike.",2018.0,35.0,11.0,"{'volume': '40', 'pages': '2907 - 2915', 'name': 'Disability and Rehabilitation'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lond2018StuckIA,\n author = {B.

A conceptual framework for defining user engagement with technology,"The purpose of this article is to critically deconstruct the term engagement as it applies to peoples' experiences with technology. Through an extensive, critical multidisciplinary literature review and exploratory study of users of Web searching, online shopping, Webcasting, and gaming applications, we conceptually and operationally defined engagement. Building on past research, we conducted semistructured interviews with the users of four applications to explore their perception of being engaged with the technology. Results indicate that engagement is a process comprised of four distinct stages: point of engagement, period of sustained engagement, disengagement, and reengagement. Furthermore, the process is characterized by attributes of engagement that pertain to the user, the system, and user-system interaction. We also found evidence of the factors that contribute to nonengagement. Emerging from this research is a definition of engagement—a term not defined consistently in past work—as a quality of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety-novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control. This exploratory work provides the foundation for future work to test the conceptual model in various application areas, and to develop methods to measure engaging user experiences. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2008.0,66.0,1353.0,"{'volume': '59', 'pages': '938-955', 'name': 'J.

People ≥70 were deemed “Clinically Vulnerable.” Distancing measures were introduced to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19. However, these may have a negative impact on older people who are vulnerable to social isolation and may have challenges accessing services and provisions. Objectives: To investigate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on the lives of older people. Study design and setting: Cross-sectional telephone survey. Participants: Community-dwelling older people, 76–97 years. Outcomes: Health anxiety; General health (RAND Short-form 36 Survey); Physical activity; Depression (PHQ-8); Anxiety (GAD-2); Loneliness; Access to services; Challenges, concerns and positive experiences. Data analysis: Counts (%), means (SDs). Thematic analysis was used to identify themes from open questions. Results: n = 142. 52% did not worry about their health; 76% rated their health as “good”, “very good” or “excellent”. < 10% met the criteria indicative of depression (PHQ-8), or anxiety (GAD-2). 42% were less active than before lockdown. 27% were lonely at least some of the time. Over half of participants identified positive aspects. Conclusions: Most participants reported good health with low levels of health anxiety, anxiety and depression.

Dicha calidad parece depender en gran parte de la competencia social de los escolares y particularmente de su participación en fenómenos de riesgo de violencia, como es el acoso escolar. Los objetivos de esta investigación fueron describir el nivel de competencia social y de implicación en bullying y las diferencias en función del sexo y la edad en una amplia muestra representativa de escolares de Andalucía en el periodo de edad entre los 10 y los 16 años, así como observar el efecto moderador del sexo y la edad en la relación entre competencia social, medida en sus diversas dimensiones, y la implicación en conductas de agresión y victimización en bullying.

Nonetheless, it is not clear whether EP‐ and ER‐related areas are regionally and/or connectively disturbed in MDD. In addition, it is yet to be known how EP‐ and ER‐related areas are interactively linked to regulatory behavior, and whether this interaction is disrupted in MDD. In our study, regional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and whole‐brain functional connectivity (FC) of meta‐analytic‐driven EP‐ and ER‐related areas were compared between 32 healthy controls (HC) and 20 MDD patients. Then, we aimed to investigate whether the EP‐related areas can predict the ER‐related areas and regulatory behavior in both groups. Finally, the brain–behavior correlations between the EP‐ and ER‐related areas and depression severity were assessed. We found that: (a) affective areas are regionally and/or connectively disturbed in MDD; (b) EP‐ER interaction seems to be disrupted in MDD; overburden of emotional reactivity in amygdala may inversely affect cognitive control processes in prefrontal cortices, which leads to diminished regulatory actions. (c) Depression severity is correlated with FC of affective areas.

Student participants (N = 302) completed a survey about their most demanding class of the semester and reported on how demanding the class was, how much stress they experienced related to the class, and how often student peers communicated academic support in the class. A conditional process analysis revealed that (a) academic demands were positively associated with academic stress, (b) academic support from peers buffered the negative effect of stress on academic performance (moderation), and (c) academic demands produced a negative indirect effect on academic performance through stress, but this indirect effect was buffered by student academic support (moderated mediation). This study provides evidence that students earn lower grades when academic demands create stressors, but highlights the importance of peers communicating support in mitigating the effects of these stressors on grades.",2020.0,81.0,11.0,"{'volume': '69', 'pages': '335 - 355', 'name': 'Communication Education'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Knoster2020ACP,\n author = {Kevin C.

The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship of resilience and emotional intelligence with functional performance in the main caregivers of people with dementia in Spain according to the phase of the disease. Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive, and analytical study was carried out. A total of 144 primary family caregivers of patients with dementia in Spain were included in the study. The following variables were measured: sociodemographic, psychosocial, and occupational, as well as resilience and emotional intelligence. Results: The caregivers obtained a low moderate resilience (mean = 64.01 ± 14.5), an emotional intelligence bordering between moderate and high (mean = 78.48 ± 14.82), and a 61.8% self-care categorized as somewhat and quite a bit. The presence of higher levels of resilience in family caregivers of people with dementia were positively related to the time spent on self-care (r = 0.227; p = 0.033) and leisure (r = 0.262; p = 0.014), especially in the moderate phase of the disease, while in the severe phase, this relationship appeared with productivity (r = 0.355; p = 0.034). The higher levels of emotional intelligence were positively related to a greater time dedicated to self-care (r = 0.233, p = 0.005), as well as the data observed in the moderate and severe phase (r = 0.214; p = 0.046 and r = 0.398; p = 0.016 respectively). Conclusions: The primary caregivers of relatives with dementia who have higher levels of resilience and emotional intelligence spend more time on self-care and leisure activities, especially in the moderate phase of the disease.",2021.0,77.0,4.0,"{'volume': '10', 'name': 'Journal of Clinical Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gómez-Trinidad2021ResilienceEI,\n author = {María Nieves Gómez-Trinidad and C.

Within the framework of the Range-Frequency model, we tested whether temporal presentation of an emotional context, known to produce a contrast effect on valence ratings, also influences the regulation of interpersonal distances. Two groups of participants were shown virtual characters with either a neutral facial expression (target stimuli) or an emotional facial expression (contextual stimuli) in two successive sessions (angry then happy emotional context, or vice-versa). Participants rated the valence of the characters and judged the appropriateness of various interpersonal distances. The results showed a contrast effect of the emotional context on the valence rating of neutral characters, which extended to preferred interpersonal distance, although sparingly. The findings revealed thus that the emotional context alters more perceptual-related valence-based judgments than action-related interpersonal distance judgments.",2021.0,43.0,1.0,"{'name': 'Cognition', 'volume': '218'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cartaud2021ContrastEO,\n author = {A.

In this article, the author: (1) argues for the validity of the relationship proposition in the consumer-brand context, including a debate as to the legitimacy of the brand as an active relationship partner and empirical support for the phenomenological significance of consumer-brand bonds; (2) provides a framework for characterizing and better understanding the types of relationships consumers form with brands; and (3) inducts from the data the concept of brand relationship quality, a diagnostic tool for conceptualizing and evaluating relationship strength. Three in-depth case studies inform this agenda, their interpretation guided by an integrative review of the literature on person-to-person relationships. Insights offered through application of inducted concepts to two relevant research domains — brand loyalty and brand personality — are advanced in closing.

1104,728e1adf786a3639fef94977ef1258fd42cb9b3f,Virtual Reality for the Enhancement of Emotion Regulation.,"In recent decades, a growing body of literature has focused on emotion regulation (ER), which refers to the ability to implement strategies in order to modulate emotional responses and reach desirable goals. To date, impaired ER (i.e., emotion dysregulation) has been identified as a transdiagnostic factor across a wide range of psychopathological conditions, which shows the importance of improving patients' ability to regulate negative and positive emotions in clinical practice. In addition to the increasing evidence showing its efficacy in the treatment of several clinical conditions, virtual reality (VR) has recently emerged as a potentially powerful tool for enhancing ER, thus breaking new ground in the development of cutting-edge transdiagnostic interventions. In the present narrative review, we will provide an overview of the existing evidence about VR-based interventions in the field of ER, emphasizing the promising findings and the barriers that still have to be addressed. To this aim, the available VR-based literature will be analysed in relation to four categories of ER strategies: Situational strategies, attentional strategies, cognitive strategies and response modulation strategies. Furthermore, new emerging fields of research targeting innovative aspects of ER will be highlighted, including the use of VR to promote positive emotions and interpersonal ER skills. Besides, its cost-effectiveness will be discussed, taking into account the costs for both developers (e.g., clinicians and researchers) and end-users. Finally, future directions in this promising field of research will be outlined.",2021.0,61.0,15.0,{'name': 'Clinical psychology & psychotherapy'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Colombo2021VirtualRF,\n author = {D.

This pilot study used a mixed-method approach to test this hypothesis. Participants completed surveys before and after the brief workshop and participated in a 1-hr focus group within 1 week of completing the surveys. The findings indicate that a short, 3-day virtual workshop may be effective toward improving parents’ mindfulness and self-compassion. Parents reported feeling more mindful in their day-to-day life, more self-compassionate during difficult times, and more patient with themselves and other people in their family.

Such appraisals can be modulated by cognitive regulation strategies in order to promote goal-directed choices. Little is known about how cognitive regulation strategies, especially reappraisal, alter risk taking during decision making. To characterise the effect of reappraisal on risk taking, we systematically varied both the goal of regulation and the value of the decision options. Participants engaged in two reappraisal strategies with opposite goals, to increase (“emphasise”) or decrease (“de-emphasise”) the importance of an upcoming decision, during the presentation of cues signalling monetary decisions. The expected value of taking a risk was systematically varied across decisions such that a risky choice could be beneficial or disadvantageous. Reappraisal strategies increased or decreased risk taking in accordance both with regulation goals and expected value information. These results suggest that reappraisal can be used to flexibly alter behaviour associated with appetitive cues while maintaining value information.",2014.0,26.0,14.0,"{'volume': '28', 'pages': '172 - 181', 'name': 'Cognition & Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Braunstein2014ReappraisalAE,\n author = {Laura Martin Braunstein and Stefanie J Herrera and M.

In the current study, we integrate transactional stress theory (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) with self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000) to advance and test a model predicting that CovH anxiety prompts individuals to suppress emotions, which has detrimental implications for their psychological need fulfillment. In turn, lack of psychological need fulfillment hinders employees' abilities to work effectively, engage with their family, and experience heightened well-being. Our model further predicts that handwashing frequency-a form of problem-focused coping-will mitigate the effects of CovH anxiety. We test our propositions using a longitudinal design that followed 503 employees across the first four weeks that stay-at-home and social distancing orders were enacted. Consistent with predictions, CovH anxiety was found to impair critical work (goal progress), home (family engagement) and health (somatic complaints) outcomes due to increased emotion suppression and lack of psychological need fulfillment. Further, individuals who frequently engage in handwashing behavior were buffered from the negative impact of CovH anxiety. Combined, our work integrates and extends existing theory and has a number of important practical implications. Our research represents a first step to understanding the work-, home-, and health-related implications of this unprecedented situation, highlighting the detrimental impact of the anxiety stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Control over the endogenous pain modulatory system is a particularly important target because it could enable a unique mechanism for clinical control over pain. Here, we found that by using real-time functional MRI (rtfMRI) to guide training, subjects were able to learn to control activation in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), a region putatively involved in pain perception and regulation. When subjects deliberately induced increases or decreases in rACC fMRI activation, there was a corresponding change in the perception of pain caused by an applied noxious thermal stimulus. Control experiments demonstrated that this effect was not observed after similar training conducted without rtfMRI information, or using rtfMRI information derived from a different brain region, or sham rtfMRI information derived previously from a different subject. Chronic pain patients were also trained to control activation in rACC and reported decreases in the ongoing level of chronic pain after training. These findings show that individuals can gain voluntary control over activation in a specific brain region given appropriate training, that voluntary control over activation in rACC leads to control over pain perception, and that these effects were powerful enough to impact severe, chronic clinical pain.",2005.0,124.0,821.0,"{'volume': '102 51', 'pages': '\n          18626-31\n        ', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{DeCharms2005ControlOB,\n author = {R.

There has also been an explosion of studies and writings about sharing via the Internet. This includes a series of books, articles, and web discussions on the topic. However, many of these apparent cases of sharing are better characterized as pseudo-sharing — commodity exchanges wrapped in a vocabulary of sharing. The present paper reviews subsequent research and theorizing as well as controversies that have emerged surrounding sharing and what is best regarded as pseudo-sharing — a wolf-insheep’s-clothing phenomenon whereby commodity exchange and potential exploitation of consumer co-creators present themselves in the guise of sharing. The paper begins with a pair of vignettes that highlight some of the contested meanings of sharing. By detailing four types of pseudo-sharing and four types of sharing that are specifically enabled or enhanced by Internet technologies, the paper argues that pseudo-sharing is distinguished by the presence of profit motives, the absence of feelings of community, and expectations of reciprocity. It concludes with a discussion of theoretical, practical, and ethical implications of pseudo-sharing and offer suggestions for future research.",2014.0,122.0,530.0,"{'volume': '18', 'pages': '23 - 7', 'name': 'The Anthropologist'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Belk2014SharingVP,\n author = {R.

Emotion regulation (ER) supports multiple individual functions and promotes mental health and wellbeing. Among the tools that may be used to help people in managing their affective states, videogames are reaching attention and are showing positive effects. Yet, little is known about their effectiveness.


OBJECTIVE
This study aims to assess the amount and quality of studies investigating the effects and modalities of the use of videogames for ER.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A systematic literature search according to PRISMA guidelines was performed. Subsequently, according to expert advice other few studies have been added.


RESULTS
Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review; they can be categorized into three groups, namely (1) cross-sectional and qualitative studies, (2) experimental studies investigating the effects of videogame experience on ER and (3) ER intervention with serious games.


DISCUSSION
Discussion of the reviewed studies highlights that frequent gaming with commercial games offers more opportunities for ER improvement (related to gameplay and enjoyment of fictional properties) than limited-time experiences, such as those supported by bespoke serious games. This research area is still in its infancy and findings need to be interpreted with caution; furthermore, future reviews are encouraged to include clinical populations.


CONCLUSION
Videogames offer several opportunities for ER and a challenge for educational and psychological interventions.",2018.0,84.0,149.0,"{'volume': '7 2', 'pages': '\n          85-99\n        ', 'name': 'Games for health journal'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Villani2018VideogamesFE,\n author = {D.

In Psychiatry, most of the current interventions involving the usage of virtual reality technology is limited to its application for anxiety disorders. With the advances in technology, Internet addiction and Internet gaming disorders are increasingly prevalent. To date, these disorders are still being treated using conventional psychotherapy methods such as cognitive behavioural therapy. However, there is an increasing number of research combining various other therapies alongside with cognitive behavioural therapy, as an attempt possibly to reduce the drop-out rates and to make such interventions more relevant to the targeted group of addicts, who are mostly adolescents. To date, there has been a prior study done in Korea that has demonstrated the comparable efficacy of virtual reality therapy with that of cognitive behavioural therapy. However, the intervention requires the usage of specialized screens and devices. It is thus the objective of the current article to highlight how smartphone applications could be designed and be utilized for immersive virtual reality treatment, alongside low cost wearables.",2017.0,12.0,40.0,"{'volume': '25 2', 'pages': '\n          367-372\n        ', 'name': 'Technology and health care : official journal of the European Society for Engineering and Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zhang2017SmartphoneAF,\n author = {M.

Method The Reading the Mind in the Eyes task, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and a computerized pictorial (angry and neutral faces) Stroop task were administered to 190 women [50 with AN, 50 with BN and 90 healthy controls (HCs)]. Results Those with an ED showed attentional biases to faces in general (medium effect), but specifically to angry faces over neutral faces (large effect) compared to HCs. The ED group also reported significantly higher emotion regulation difficulties (large effect) than HCs. There was a small difference between the ED and HC groups for the emotion recognition task (small-medium effect), particularly in the restricting AN (RAN) group. Depression and attentional bias to faces significantly predicted emotion regulation difficulties in a regression model. Conclusions The data provide support for conceptualizations of EDs that emphasize the role of emotional functioning in the development and maintenance of EDs.

Our technology skills transfer program entailed a cost effective online delivery mode from the United States  to Mexico and explored mechanisms to counter the non-social aspects of online learning in cultures which are highly collectivist, have a high power distance, and have a high level of uncertainty avoidance. Our study also investigates the potential of online technology skills transfer programs to impact the entrepreneurship of participants in a developing economy by raising their self-efficacy scores and by integrating their learning with the entrepreneurial context of small businesses. A total of 60 vocational Mexican students and 115 Mexican small entrepreneurs were identified as participants in this study. 30 of these students and 15 of these Mexican companies participated in the online technology skills transfer part of the study which involved two online courses in database design and development as well as implementation while being integrated with the real-life context of a small entrepreneurial venture.

1132,750e22d38256b3a69e64c81affaa4c22416145a6,The Developmental Mismatch in Structural Brain Maturation during Adolescence,"Regions of the human brain develop at different rates across the first two decades of life, with some maturing before others. It has been hypothesized that a mismatch in the timing of maturation between subcortical regions (involved in affect and reward processing) and prefrontal regions (involved in cognitive control) underlies the increase in risk-taking and sensation-seeking behaviors observed during adolescence. Most support for this ‘dual systems' hypothesis relies on cross-sectional data, and it is not known whether this pattern is present at an individual level. The current study utilizes longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to describe the developmental trajectories of regions associated with risk-taking and sensation-seeking behaviors, namely, the amygdala, nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Structural trajectories of gray matter volumes were analyzed using FreeSurfer in 33 participants aged 7-30 years, each of whom had at least three high-quality MRI scans spanning three developmental periods: late childhood, adolescence and early adulthood (total 152 scans). The majority of individuals in our sample showed relatively earlier maturation in the amygdala and/or NAcc compared to the PFC, providing evidence for a mismatch in the timing of structural maturation between these structures. We then related individual developmental trajectories to retrospectively assessed self-reported risk-taking and sensation-seeking behaviors during adolescence in a subsample of 24 participants. Analysis of this smaller sample failed to find a relationship between the presence of a mismatch in brain maturation and risk-taking and sensation-seeking behaviors during adolescence. Taken together, it appears that the developmental mismatch in structural brain maturation is present in neurotypically developing individuals. This pattern of development did not directly relate to self-reported behaviors at an individual level in our sample, highlighting the need for prospective studies combining anatomical and behavioral measures.",2014.0,51.0,292.0,"{'volume': '36', 'pages': '147 - 160', 'name': 'Developmental Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mills2014TheDM,\n author = {K.

This study reveals the ways in which social media platforms (specifically, Douyin and Momo) design their showroom livestreaming interfaces and aff ordances to normalise and commodify the aff ective interactions between female streamers and their male viewers and to establish a gendered power relationship. Using the walkthrough method during two stages of the apps (entry to live-streaming chatrooms and the everyday use of live-streaming chatrooms), this study analyses various aff ordances regarding their functional, sensory, and cognitive impacts on users. This research thereby demonstrates that the live-streaming interface design constructs two types of subject positions.

Depression, anxiety, and apathy are commonly observed neuropsychiatric features in MCI, which have been linked to cognitive and functional decline in daily activities, as well as disease progression. Accordingly, the study’s objective is to review the prevalence, neuropsychological characteristics, and conversion rates to dementia between MCI patients with and without depression, anxiety, and apathy. Methods: A PubMed search and critical review were performed relating to studies of MCI, depression, anxiety, and apathy. Results: MCI patients have a high prevalence of depression/anxiety/apathy; furthermore, patients with MCI and concomitant depression/anxiety/apathy have more pronounced cognitive deficits and progress more often to dementia than MCI patients without depression/anxiety/apathy.

Students were asked to programmatically choreograph dance performances for virtual characters within an educational desktop application we built earlier called Virtual Environment Interactions (VEnvI). As part of a middle school science class, 90 students from the 6th and 7th grades participated in our study. All students first visually programmed dance choreography for a virtual character they created in VEnvI on a laptop. Then, they viewed and interacted with the resulting dance performance in a between-subjects design in one of the three conditions. We compared and contrasted the benefits of embodied immersive virtual reality (EVR) viewing utilizing a head-mounted display with a body-scaled and gender-matched self-avatar, immersive virtual reality only (IVR) viewing, and desktop VR (NVR) viewing with VEnvI on pedagogical outcomes, programming performance, presence, and attitudes towards STEM and computational thinking. Results from a cognition questionnaire showed that, in the learning dimensions of Knowledge and Understanding (Bloom's taxonomy) as well as Multistructural (SOLO taxonomy), participants in EVR and IVR scored significantly higher than NVR. Also, participants in EVR scored significantly higher than IVR. We also discovered similar results in objective programming performance and presence scores in VEnvI. Furthermore, students’ attitudes towards computer science, programming confidence, and impressions significantly improved to be the highest in EVR and then IVR as compared to NVR condition. Our work suggests that educators and developers of educational VR simulations, who want to enhance knowledge and understanding as well as simultaneous acquisition of multiple abstract concepts, can do so by employing immersion and self-avatars in VR learning experiences.",2022.0,63.0,5.0,"{'volume': '29', 'pages': '3698-3713', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Parmar2022HowIA,\n author = {Dhaval Parmar and Lorraine Lin and Nikeetha Dsouza and S.

Medically managed opioid withdrawal (detox) can increase the risk of subsequent opioid overdose. We assessed the association between mortality following detox and receipt of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and residential treatment after detox.


DESIGN
Cohort study generated from individually linked public health data sets.


SETTING
Massachusetts, USA.


PARTICIPANTS
A total of 30 681 opioid detox patients with 61 819 detox episodes between 2012 and 2014.


MEASUREMENTS
Treatment categories included no post-detox treatment, MOUD, residential treatment or both MOUD and residential treatment identified at monthly intervals. We classified treatment exposures in two ways: (a) 'on-treatment' included any month where a treatment was received and (b) 'with-discontinuation' individuals were considered exposed through the month following treatment discontinuation. We conducted multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses and extended Kaplan-Meier estimator cumulative incidence for all-cause and opioid-related mortality for the treatment categories as monthly time-varying exposure variables.


FINDINGS
Twelve months after detox, 41% received MOUD for a median of 3 months, 35% received residential treatment for a median of 2 months and 13% received both for a median of 5 months. In on-treatment analyses for all-cause mortality compared with no treatment, adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) were 0.34 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.27-0.43] for MOUD, 0.63 (95% CI = 0.47-0.84) for residential treatment and 0.11 (95% CI = 0.03-0.43) for both. In with-discontinuation analyses for all-cause mortality, compared with no treatment, AHRs were 0.52 (95% CI = 0.42-0.63) for MOUD, 0.76 (95% CI = 0.59-0.96) for residential treatment and 0.21 (95% CI = 0.08-0.55) for both. Results were similar for opioid-related overdose mortality.


CONCLUSIONS
Among people who have undergone medically managed opioid withdrawal, receipt of medications for opioid use disorder, residential treatment or the combination of medications for opioid use disorder and residential treatment were associated with substantially reduced mortality compared with no treatment.",2020.0,40.0,27.0,{'name': 'Addiction'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Walley2020AssociationBM,\n author = {A.

Do some emotion regulation strategies have more to recommend them than others? According to Gross's (1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271-299) process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners. This review concludes with a consideration of five important directions for future research on emotion regulation processes.",2002.0,83.0,3648.0,"{'volume': '39 3', 'pages': '\n          281-91\n        ', 'name': 'Psychophysiology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gross2002EmotionRA,\n author = {J.

The idea is put forward, based on the experience of a large number of experimental studies, that there are two orthogonal components that contribute to this realistic response. The first is ‘being there’, often called ‘presence’, the qualia of having a sensation of being in a real place. We call this place illusion (PI). Second, plausibility illusion (Psi) refers to the illusion that the scenario being depicted is actually occurring. In the case of both PI and Psi the participant knows for sure that they are not ‘there’ and that the events are not occurring. PI is constrained by the sensorimotor contingencies afforded by the virtual reality system. Psi is determined by the extent to which the system can produce events that directly relate to the participant, the overall credibility of the scenario being depicted in comparison with expectations. We argue that when both PI and Psi occur, participants will respond realistically to the virtual reality.",2009.0,49.0,1485.0,"{'volume': '364', 'pages': '3549 - 3557', 'name': 'Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Slater2009PlaceIA,\n author = {M.

However, it has a disadvantage that the network structure and parameters are basically determined by experiences. In this article, an improved quantum-inspired differential evolution (MSIQDE), namely MSIQDE algorithm based on making use of the merits of the Mexh wavelet function, standard normal distribution, adaptive quantum state update, and quantum nongate mutation, is proposed to avoid premature convergence and improve the global search ability. Then, the MSIQDE with global optimization ability is used to optimize the parameters of the DBN to construct an optimal DBN model, which is further applied to propose a new fault classification, namely MSIQDE-DBN method. Finally, the vibration data of rolling bearings from the Case Western Reserve University and a real-world engineering application are carried out to verify the performance of the MSIQDE-DBN method.

This paper begins by reviewing e-tandem and telecollaborative approaches to virtual exchange which are currently being used extensively in FL education and presents two case studies which illustrate the common learning outcomes and limitations of such approaches. I then propose an alternative model of virtual exchange which maintains many of the key characteristics of earlier approaches but which incorporates the principles of global citizenship education and which moves away from bilingual–bicultural approaches. I conclude by outlining the main characteristics of this model and presenting some examples of how this approach could be put into practice.,2019.0,78.0,50.0,"{'volume': '53', 'pages': '477 - 490', 'name': 'Language Teaching'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{O’Dowd2019ATM,\n author = {R.

1156,779fc55e37f71c78b1e44cfd0df755ea9c8efaea,Cultural adaptation of the difficulties in emotion regulation scale: reliability and validity of an Italian version.,"OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of an Italian version of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz & Roemer, 2004).


METHOD
Three studies were completed. First, factorial structure, internal consistency, and concurrent validity of our Italian version of the DERS were examined with a sample of 323 students (77% female; mean age 25.6). Second, test-retest analyses were completed using a different sample of 61 students (80% female; mean age 24.7). Third, the scores produced by a small clinical sample of participants (N = 38; mean age = 24.2) affected by anorexia, binge eating disorder, or bulimia were compared to those of an age-matched, nonclinical female sample (N = 38; mean age = 24.7).


RESULTS
The factorial structure replicated quite well the six-factor structure proposed by Gratz and Roemer. The internal consistency and test-retest reliability were adequate and comparable to previous findings. The validity was good, as indicated by both the concurrent validity analysis and the clinical-nonclinical sample comparison.


CONCLUSIONS
These studies provide further support for the multidimensional model of emotion regulation postulated by Gratz and Roemer and strengthen the rationale for cross-cultural utilization of the DERS.",2012.0,88.0,226.0,"{'volume': '68 9', 'pages': '\n          989-1007\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of clinical psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Giromini2012CulturalAO,\n author = {L.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of using a newly developed ChatBot to learn Chinese vocabulary by comparing how it works in different learning environments and to explore the ChatBot with reference to the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). This study was conducted with 58 students divided into two independent groups. The control group used ChatBot in a one-on-many classroom. The experimental group applied the ChatBot in one-on-one tutor sessions. A pretest and a posttest were used to measure the effect of the ChatBot, while TAM was explored through questionnaire and interview. Data analysis includes a paired-sample t test, analysis of covariance, and levels of effect. The results indicated that the ChatBot significantly improved the students’ learning achievement and that having a one-on-one environment may lead to better outcome than what could be achieved in a classroom. The TAM model was tested using partial least square. The result showed that perceived usefulness was the predictor of behavioral intention, whereas perceived ease of use was not.

The aim of this paper is to review studies on the course of mental health problems during and after the first lockdown phase. Methods We conducted a rapid review of multi-wave studies in general populations with time points during and after the first lockdown phase. Repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that utilised validated instruments were included. The main outcome was whether indicators of mental health problems have changed during and after the first lockdown phase. The study was registered with PROSPERO No. CRD42020218640. Results Twenty-three studies with 56 indicators were included in the qualitative review. Studies that reported data from pre-pandemic assessments through lockdown indicated an increase in mental health problems. During lockdown, no uniform trend could be identified. After lockdown, mental health problems decreased slightly. Conclusions As mental health care utilisation indicators and data on suicides do not suggest an increase in demand during the first lockdown phase, we regard the increase in mental health problems as general distress that is to be expected during a global health crisis.

1162,786b438c6df8969d97700a765e3ca931a34a40c4,Influence of consumers’ perceived risk on consumers’ online purchase intention,"
Purpose
This paper aims to examine the relationship between six factors of consumers’ perceived risk and consumers’ online purchase intentions. In particular, this study will examine the relationship between financial risk, product risk, security risk, time risk, social risk and psychological risk and online purchase intention.


Design/methodology/approach
Survey method was used for the purpose of data collection, and quantitative analysis was used to test the hypotheses. A total of 350 respondents participated on an online survey, and data were quantitatively analyzed via IBM SPSS Statistics 24.


Findings
The findings from this study suggest consumers’ perceived risks when they intend to purchase online. Five factors of perceived risk have a significant negative influence on consumer online purchase intention, while social risk was found to be insignificant. Among these factors, security risk is the main contributor for consumers to deter from purchasing online.


Practical implications
This study provides useful information to online retailers in electronic commerce (e-commerce) activities. Previous studies show that many online retailers are still facing some risks in online business, and this will affect the transaction and performance of the retailers. It is hoped that the findings can help online retailers to formulate strategies to reduce risks in the online shopping environment, especially security risks for better e-commerce.


Originality/value
The development of online shopping has led to some challenges to consumers, which comprise security of payment, data protection, the validity and enforceability of e-contract, insufficient information disclosure, product quality and enforcement of rights. This issue emerged because many online retailers do not understand the main factors that will contribute to consumers’ perceived risk. Consumers’ perceived risks will influence consumer attitudes toward online shopping and purchase behaviors. Studies on consumers’ perceived risks toward online purchase intentions are still inconclusive. Thus, this paper fills the gap in the research area.

Access to psychology services is limited, with some estimates suggesting that over 50% of sufferers are not accessing the existing services available to them for reasons such as inconvenience, embarrassment, or stigmatization concerns around mental health. Health service providers have increasingly been turning to drug-free therapies, such as mindfulness programs, as complementary treatments. Objective Virtual reality (VR) as a new delivery method for meditation-based stress and anxiety reduction therapy offers configurable environments and privacy protection. Our objective was to design a serious learning-meditation environment and to test the feasibility of the developed telemindfulness approach based on cloud technologies. Methods We developed a cloud-based system, which consisted of a Web interface for the mindfulness instructor and remote clients, who had 3D VR headsets. The mindfulness instructor could communicate over the Web interface with the participants using the headset. Additionally, the Web app enabled group sessions in virtual rooms, 360-degree videos, and real interactions or standalone meditation. The mindfulness program was designed as an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction course specifically for the developed virtual environments. The program was tested with four employees and four patients with TBI. The effects were measured with psychometric tests, the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) and the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). Patients also carried out the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). An additional objective evaluation has also been carried out by tracking head motion. Additionally, the power spectrum analyses of similar tasks between sessions were tested. Results The patients achieved a higher level of life satisfaction during the study (SWLS: mean 23.0, SD 1.8 vs mean 18.3, SD 3.9) and a slight increase of the MAAS score (mean 3.4, SD 0.6 vs mean 3.3, SD 0.4). Particular insight into the MAAS items revealed that one patient had a lower MAAS score (mean 2.3). Employees showed high MAAS scores (mean 4.3, SD 0.7) and although their SWLS dropped to mean 26, their SWLS was still high (mean 27.3, SD 2.8). The power spectrum showed that the employees had a considerable reduction in high-frequency movements less than 0.34 Hz, particularly with the 360-degree video. As expected, the patients demonstrated a gradual decrease of high-frequency movements while sitting during the mindfulness practices in the virtual environment. Conclusions With such a small sample size, it is too early to make any specific conclusions, but the presented results may accelerate the use of innovative technologies and challenge new ideas in research and development in the field of mindfulness/telemindfulness.",2017.0,36.0,37.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'JMIR Research Protocols'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cikajlo2017ACV,\n author = {I.

Considering that online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic may be an opportunity for university students to take greater responsibility for their learning, it is essential to explore the strategies they have developed in the face of emotional and learning challenges during the health crisis. This study aimed at analyzing the relationships between students' emotions, coping strategies, and self-regulated learning in online learning during COVID-19 home confinement. The participants were 1,290 Mexican students from different universities throughout the country, who answered an online self-report questionnaire from standardized instruments adapted to the pandemic. Data were analyzed with descriptive and inferential analyses, including a structural equation model (SEM). Findings indicate that, although anxiety, boredom, and frustration were present among participants during confinement, the primary emotions were gratitude, joy, and hope. Second, the main coping strategies used by students participating were focused on facing and reassessing the situation. Furthermore, tranquility, hope, gratitude, and joy were positively related to self-regulated learning, although, loneliness and disinterest were negatively related. Finally, it was found that an approach to coping strategies mediated the relationship between emotions and self-regulated learning. Thus, teachers should help students understand the relevance of active coping strategies and use student-centered learning models that promote autonomous and self-regulated learning, considering each learner's needs, during and after confinement.",2021.0,63.0,40.0,"{'volume': '12', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gaeta2021TheIO,\n author = {M.

Method A thorough review of relevant databases was undertaken to locate published studies reporting client outcomes following SST. The focus of the review is research involving clients and presenting problems typically seen in community-based mental health and family counselling agencies. Results The findings suggest that the majority of clients attending either previously scheduled or walk-in SST find it sufficient and helpful. The studies imply that this model of service delivery leads to perceived improvement in presenting problems in general, and on specific measures of variables such as depression, anxiety, distress level and confidence in parenting skills.

1186,7b0248cb101486188cf71cb021235e4413e54ff5,Facial Expressions Evoke Differential Neural Coupling in Macaques,"Abstract In humans and monkeys, face perception activates a distributed cortical network that includes extrastriate, limbic, and prefrontal regions. Within face‐responsive regions, emotional faces evoke stronger responses than neutral faces (“valence effect”). We used fMRI and Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) to test the hypothesis that emotional faces differentially alter the functional coupling among face‐responsive regions. Three monkeys viewed conspecific faces with neutral, threatening, fearful, and appeasing expressions. Using Bayesian model selection, various models of neural interactions between the posterior (TEO) and anterior (TE) portions of inferior temporal (IT) cortex, the amygdala, the orbitofrontal (OFC), and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) were tested. The valence effect was mediated by feedback connections from the amygdala to TE and TEO, and feedback connections from VLPFC to the amygdala and TE. Emotional faces were associated with differential effective connectivity: Fearful faces evoked stronger modulations in the connections from the amygdala to TE and TEO; threatening faces evoked weaker modulations in the connections from the amygdala and VLPFC to TE; and appeasing faces evoked weaker modulations in the connection from VLPFC to the amygdala.

Older adults showed the highest levels of resilience following the September 11th (9/11) terrorist attacks, but during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak there were no age-related differences in well-being. The current study examined the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) disruption on well-being throughout adulthood. Research Design and Methods Perceived stress and affect were examined in 166 community-dwelling adults (Mage=35.65; SD=15.53; range=18-79) in relation to the perceived disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic to their lives. Results A significant moderation was found for age and COVID-19 disruption on perceived stress [F(5, 153) = 8.88, p & .05, R2= .22] and negative affect [F(5, 154) = 4.91, p & .05, R2= .14], but not for positive affect. For participants over 50, those who rated COVID-19 as a low or high disruption had similar scores on stress and negative affect, but with younger aged participants, perceiving high disruption corresponded with higher levels of stress and negative affect. Discussion and Implications Findings are consistent with the strength and vulnerability integration (SAVI) model, wherein older adults try to maintain positive emotional well-being; with middle-aged and older adults in the current study having experienced less negative impact on well-being. Middle-aged and older adults may be better able to regulate negative emotions, from COVID-19, than younger adults. SAVI proposes a greater negative impact on older adults when they experience sustained stressors; as the challenges with COVID-19 continue, further data will need to be examined.",2020.0,33.0,60.0,{'name': 'The Gerontologist'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Carney2020AgeMP,\n author = {Amy Knepple Carney and Allyson S.

These contradictory findings arise, in part, because of a lack of consideration of the different aspects of context with which facial expressions of emotion can be combined, and different meanings of face-context pairings vis-a`-vis real-life phenomena. In this paper, we provide a framework of how faces and contexts combine and describe possible meanings of consistent and inconsistent face-context pairings. We also discuss methodological caveats that should be considered in the conduct of such judgment studies. We argue that future research in this area will benefit not from more studies of different combinations of stimuli created merely because we have the technological ability to create them, but instead from careful consideration of the ecological validity of the various types of combinations that can be produced, and their meaning.",2010.0,44.0,42.0,"{'volume': '4', 'pages': '393-402', 'name': 'Social and Personality Psychology Compass'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Matsumoto2010JudgingFI,\n author = {D.

Recent studies suggest the involvement of frontal cortical regions in the modulation of amygdala reactivity and the mediation of effective emotion regulation. However, within-subject inter-regional connectivity between amygdala and prefrontal cortex in the context of affect regulation is unknown. Here, using psychophysiological interaction analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we show that activity in specific areas of the frontal cortex (dorsolateral, dorsal medial, anterior cingulate, orbital) covaries with amygdala activity and that this functional connectivity is dependent on the reappraisal task. Moreover, strength of amygdala coupling with orbitofrontal cortex and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex predicts the extent of attenuation of negative affect following reappraisal. These findings highlight the importance of functional connectivity within limbic-frontal circuitry during emotion regulation.",2007.0,91.0,1049.0,"{'volume': '2 4', 'pages': '\n          303-12\n        ', 'name': 'Social cognitive and affective neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Banks2007AmygdalafrontalCD,\n author = {S.

Studies have shown that virtual reality (VR) can trigger stronger and more specific emotional reactivity in users than other visual/audio media. Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) usually suffer from social impairments, such as challenges in emotion perception and emotion expression. A smart VR eHealth system that carefully triggers specific emotional reactions and detects the patterns in children with ASD can help with early screening, intervention, and emotional regulation. This paper proposes a VR gaming system that makes use of psychophysiological sensor signals, in-game performance and responses, stressor mini-games to detect different emotional reactivity patterns, and dynamically changes the game scene according to the current emotional status.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder, which presents a high comorbidity with anxiety and affective signs and symptoms. It has repercussions on the functioning of those suffering from it, who also have low therapy compliance and generate a significant cost both at a personal level and for society. Mindfulness is a psychological treatment that has proved to be effective for ADHD. Virtual reality is widely used as treatment in cases of phobias and other pathologies, with positive results.


AIMS
To develop the first treatment for ADHD in adults based on virtual reality and mindfulness, while also resulting in increased treatment adherence and reduced costs.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
We conducted a pilot study with 25 patients treated by means of virtual reality, in four 30-minute sessions, and 25 treated with psychostimulants. Measures will be taken pre-treatment, post-treatment and at 3 and 12 months post-treatment, to evaluate both ADHD and also depression, anxiety, functionality and quality of life. Data will be later analysed with the SPSS v. 20 statistical program. An ANOVA of independent groups will be performed to see the differences between treatments and also a test-retest to detect whether the changes will be maintained.


RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
It is necessary to use treatments that are effective, reduce costs and increase therapy adherence. Treatment with virtual reality is an interesting alternative to the classical treatments, and is shorter and more attractive for patients.",2017.0,0.0,1.0,"{'volume': '64 s01', 'pages': '\n          S117-S122\n        ', 'name': 'Revista de neurologia'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Serra-Pla2017TreatmentOA,\n author = {J.

1204,7bc0ee95aa6ea393b4378983b614817b15cfdec6,A dual-process model of early substance use: tests in two diverse populations of adolescents.,"OBJECTIVE
We tested a dual-process model based on behavioral and emotional regulation constructs, which posits that good self-control and poor regulation make independent contributions and have different types of pathways to outcomes. The utility of the model for predicting substance use was tested in two diverse populations of younger adolescents.


METHOD
A survey was administered in classrooms to middle-school students in Westchester County, New York (N = 601) and Honolulu, Hawaii (N = 881). The New York sample was 8% African American, 5% Asian American, 47% Caucasian, 31% Hispanic, and 9% other ethnicity. The Hawaii sample was 21% Asian American, 8% Caucasian, 26% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 34% Filipino, and 10% other ethnicity. Structural equation modeling analyses tested pathways from the four regulation variables through six hypothesized mediators to a criterion construct of substance use (tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana).


RESULTS
Results were replicated across samples and were consistent with prediction. Unique contributions were found for good self-control and poor regulation, including both behavioral and emotional aspects. Good self-control had an inverse effect on substance use primarily through relations to higher levels of protective factors (e.g., academic competence). Poor regulation independently had a risk-promoting effect on substance use through relations to higher levels of risk factors (e.g., negative life events).


CONCLUSIONS
Two field studies showed the dual-process model is robust across different populations. Substance prevention programs should consider approaches for enhancing good self-control as well as procedures for reducing poor regulation and minimizing its impact. Extensions to health behaviors including dietary intake and physical activity are discussed.",2013.0,63.0,45.0,"{'volume': '32 5', 'pages': '\n          533-42\n        ', 'name': 'Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wills2013ADM,\n author = {T.

Respondents were 12-13 years old in 1994 and 16-17 in 1998. Controlling for demographic and contextual factors, self-regulation--but not risk proneness--was significantly (modestly) associated with overall sexual risk taking 4 years later. Analyses of individual sexual behaviors indicated that self-regulation may affect choices made after becoming sexually active (e.g., number of partners) rather than the initiation of sexual activity. Measures of parent and peer influence had independent effects on sexual risk taking but did not moderate the effects of self-regulation and risk proneness.

Therefore, this research examines the psychological effects of foreign-language signs on potential diners. More specifically, psychological influences of restaurant signs’ language are explored in the following three laboratory experiments: Study 1, a Mexican restaurant sign manipulation (Spanish vs. English script) on a non-Hispanic sample; Study 2, a Korean restaurant sign manipulation (Korean vs. English script) on a non-Asian sample; and Study 3, a Korean restaurant sign manipulation (Korean vs. English script) on a Korean-American sample. In each of these three experiments, the authors found that a restaurant sign’s language has statistically significant effects on potential diner’s perceptions of the restaurant’s brand personality. On the other hand, a sign’s language does not appear to influence perceptions of anticipated food authenticity or perceptions of the restaurant’s target marketing efforts. Based on these research findings, the article concludes with a presentation of managerial and research implications.",2011.0,70.0,35.0,"{'volume': '35', 'pages': '24 - 44', 'name': 'Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Magnini2011ThePE,\n author = {V.

Behavioural activation has attracted increased interest in recent years. It has been over 5 years since our meta-analyses summarised the evidence supporting and this systematic review updates those findings and examines moderators of treatment effect. Method Randomised trials of behavioural activation for depression versus controls or anti-depressant medication were identified using electronic database searches, previous reviews and reference lists. Data on symptom level and study level moderators were extracted and analysed using meta-analysis, sub-group analysis and meta-regression respectively. Results Twenty six randomised controlled trials including 1524 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. A random effects meta-analysis of symptom level post treatment showed behavioural activation to be superior to controls (SMD −0.74 CI −0.91 to −0.56, k = 25, N = 1088) and medication (SMD −0.42 CI −0.83 to-0.00, k = 4, N = 283). Study quality was low in the majority of studies and follow- up time periods short. There was no indication of publication bias and subgroup analysis showed limited association between moderators and effect size.

We combine these data sources to predict elementary students’ success within the system as well as components of their math identity as measured though a standardized survey. Data from 147 students was examined longitudinally over a year of study. The results indicated links between math success and non-cognitive measures of math identity. Additionally, the results indicate that math identity was strongly predicted by click-stream variables and the production of more lexically sophisticated and cohesive language. In addition, significant variance in math identity was explained by affective and cognitive variables.

We begin with the crucial role of supporting educators in developing their own emotion regulation skills. We also discuss concrete and accessible tools that can be used to support both educators' own skill development and that of their students. We demonstrate how educators can integrate the teaching of emotion regulation through direct instruction, its integration into existing curricula, and daily practices and routines. The examples we provide are part of RULER, an evidence-based, whole school approach to social and emotional learning (SEL) that was developed at the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence.

Dementia is a progressive global cognitive impairment syndrome. In 2010, more than 35 million people worldwide were estimated to be living with dementia. Some people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will progress to dementia but others remain stable or recover full function. There is great interest in finding good predictors of dementia in people with MCI. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is the best-known and the most often used short screening tool for providing an overall measure of cognitive impairment in clinical, research and community settings.


OBJECTIVES
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the MMSE at various thresholds for detecting individuals with baseline MCI who would clinically convert to dementia in general, Alzheimer's disease dementia or other forms of dementia at follow-up.


SEARCH METHODS
We searched ALOIS (Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Specialized Register of diagnostic and intervention studies (inception to May 2014); MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to May 2014); EMBASE (OvidSP) (1980 to May 2014); BIOSIS (Web of Science) (inception to May 2014); Web of Science Core Collection, including the Conference Proceedings Citation Index (ISI Web of Science) (inception to May 2014); PsycINFO (OvidSP) (inception to May 2014), and LILACS (BIREME) (1982 to May 2014). We also searched specialized sources of diagnostic test accuracy studies and reviews, most recently in May 2014: MEDION (Universities of Maastricht and Leuven, www.mediondatabase.nl), DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, via the Cochrane Library), HTA Database (Health Technology Assessment Database, via the Cochrane Library), and ARIF (University of Birmingham, UK, www.arif.bham.ac.uk). No language or date restrictions were applied to the electronic searches and methodological filters were not used as a method to restrict the search overall so as to maximize sensitivity. We also checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews, tracked citations in Scopus and Science Citation Index, used searches of known relevant studies in PubMed to track related articles, and contacted research groups conducting work on MMSE for dementia diagnosis to try to locate possibly relevant but unpublished data.


SELECTION CRITERIA
We considered longitudinal studies in which results of the MMSE administered to MCI participants at baseline were obtained and the reference standard was obtained by follow-up over time. We included participants recruited and clinically classified as individuals with MCI under Petersen and revised Petersen criteria, Matthews criteria, or a Clinical Dementia Rating = 0.5. We used acceptable and commonly used reference standards for dementia in general, Alzheimer's dementia, Lewy body dementia, vascular dementia and frontotemporal dementia.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
We screened all titles generated by the electronic database searches. Two review authors independently assessed the abstracts of all potentially relevant studies. We assessed the identified full papers for eligibility and extracted data to create two by two tables for dementia in general and other dementias. Two authors independently performed quality assessment using the QUADAS-2 tool. Due to high heterogeneity and scarcity of data, we derived estimates of sensitivity at fixed values of specificity from the model we fitted to produce the summary receiver operating characteristic curve.


MAIN RESULTS
In this review, we included 11 heterogeneous studies with a total number of 1569 MCI patients followed for conversion to dementia. Four studies assessed the role of baseline scores of the MMSE in conversion from MCI to all-cause dementia and eight studies assessed this test in conversion from MCI to Alzheimer´s disease dementia. Only one study provided information about the MMSE and conversion from MCI to vascular dementia. For conversion from MCI to dementia in general, the accuracy of baseline MMSE scores ranged from sensitivities of 23% to 76% and specificities from 40% to 94%. In relationship to conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's disease dementia, the accuracy of baseline MMSE scores ranged from sensitivities of 27% to 89% and specificities from 32% to 90%. Only one study provided information about conversion from MCI to vascular dementia, presenting a sensitivity of 36% and a specificity of 80% with an incidence of vascular dementia of 6.2%. Although we had planned to explore possible sources of heterogeneity, this was not undertaken due to the scarcity of studies included in our analysis.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
Our review did not find evidence supporting a substantial role of MMSE as a stand-alone single-administration test in the identification of MCI patients who could develop dementia. Clinicians could prefer to request additional and extensive tests to be sure about the management of these patients. An important aspect to assess in future updates is if conversion to dementia from MCI stages could be predicted better by MMSE changes over time instead of single measurements. It is also important to assess if a set of tests, rather than an isolated one, may be more successful in predicting conversion from MCI to dementia.",2015.0,135.0,583.0,"{'volume': '3', 'pages': '\n          CD010783\n        ', 'name': 'The Cochrane database of systematic reviews'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Arévalo-Rodriguez2015MiniMentalSE,\n author = {I.

A systematic search has been conducted for required articles which have been published between 1990 and 2015. Only those studies have been included in the review which reported either cognitive reappraisal or expressive suppression in their findings. Review indicates that individualistic cultures prefer emotional expression to regulate emotions while collectivistic cultures, such as in Pakistan, focus more on expressive suppression. Emotional suppression can cause mental disease, physiological illness, and poor social and psychological adjustment. To sum up, culture predicts whether individuals are motivated to express or suppress their emotions. Collectivist culture encourages greatest control on emotion expression while interacting with family and friends with more emphasis on maintaining social harmony. On the other hand, individualistic culture endorses comparatively less expression of negative emotions especially towards strangers.

The procedure essentially involves the construction of functions of the observed proportions which are directed at the extent to which the observers agree among themselves and the construction of test statistics for hypotheses involving these functions. Tests for interobserver bias are presented in terms of first-order marginal homogeneity and measures of interobserver agreement are developed as generalized kappa-type statistics. These procedures are illustrated with a clinical diagnosis example from the epidemiological literature.,1977.0,42.0,65136.0,"{'volume': '33 1', 'pages': '\n          159-74\n        ', 'name': 'Biometrics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Landis1977TheMO,\n author = {J.

In general, depression is treated with antidepressant drugs, and usually assisted by non-medication treatments, such as psychotherapy and physical therapy. Due to their expensive and time-consuming nature, these therapy sessions often ended with patients losing motivation to continue, and results unsatisfied recovery progress. In addition, both psychotherapy and physical therapy are highly human intensive. Thus, a novel neurofeedback game framework, which supports depression rehabilitation may provide new opportunities. In this paper, we present a new Virtual-Reality based neurofeedback game framework for depression rehabilitation, which would increase patients' motivation for therapy, and lower the cost for both patients and therapists. In our framework, patients' EEG data are pervasively recorded using an innovative three-electrode EEG collector. Then the data are processed and calculated into feedback features, and finally represented back to patients through Virtual-Reality games in real-time.

Understanding and Modeling the Virtual Gifts Behavior of Users in Live Streaming Economy,"Recently, live streaming is gaining increasing en- thusiasm, like Twitch, Inke and YouTube. Online streamers can interact with viewers in real time in live platforms with audio, video and text. The virtual gift is one of the most important business models for these live streaming platforms. The viewers can purchase and send virtual gifts to the streamers during the live process. These behaviors have great market potential and economic value, but little previous research paid attention about this. In this paper, we measured the basic information and economic behavior of users on a large representative live streaming platform (Inke1). To be specific, we discovered 20% of viewers contributed 97% of all gifts, and 77% of viewers only present for top three streamers. Especially, we also found that most gifting behaviors broke out in short periods when barrage increased, and gifting behaviors could be inspired by others due to competitiveness. Moreover, we investigated the correlation of various factors, proposed a decision tree based prediction model to infer the future revenue of the streamers. The result will bring benefit for both industrial entrepreneurs (for improving the design of the system operating mechanism of live platforms) and researchers (for interesting problems in personalized recommendation, etc.).",2018.0,9.0,18.0,"{'pages': '118-123', 'name': '2018 IEEE Conference on Multimedia Information Processing and Retrieval (MIPR)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tu2018WhoIE,\n author = {Wei Tu and Chen Yan and Yiping Yan and Xuan Ding and Lifeng Sun},\n journal = {2018 IEEE Conference on Multimedia Information Processing and Retrieval (MIPR)},\n pages = {118-123},\n title = {Who Is Earning?

1244,7fe3234bd35d814caed6e3cf43a3f3ed76ecd6e2,The psychology of change: self-affirmation and social psychological intervention.,"People have a basic need to maintain the integrity of the self, a global sense of personal adequacy. Events that threaten self-integrity arouse stress and self-protective defenses that can hamper performance and growth. However, an intervention known as self-affirmation can curb these negative outcomes. Self-affirmation interventions typically have people write about core personal values. The interventions bring about a more expansive view of the self and its resources, weakening the implications of a threat for personal integrity. Timely affirmations have been shown to improve education, health, and relationship outcomes, with benefits that sometimes persist for months and years. Like other interventions and experiences, self-affirmations can have lasting benefits when they touch off a cycle of adaptive potential, a positive feedback loop between the self-system and the social system that propagates adaptive outcomes over time.

Previous research has suggested that emotional regulation (ER) and emotional dysregulation (ED) may be factors which are correlated with symptom severity and maintenance of TR-PTSD. This embedded mixed-methods pilot study (n = 9) sought to explore the impact of 3MDR on ER and ED of MMs and veterans. Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale (DERS-18) data were collected at baseline, prior to each session, and at one week, one month, and three months postintervention and analyzed. Qualitative data collected from sessions, debriefs, and follow-up interviews were transcribed and descriptively analyzed. Results demonstrated statistically significant decreases in DERS-18 scores from preintervention to postintervention at each timepoint. Qualitatively, participants perceived improvements in ER within specified DERS-18 domains. We describe how 3MDR’s unique and novel approach addresses ED through cognitive–motor stimulation, narration, divergent thinking, reappraisal of aversive stimuli, dual-task processing, and reconsolidation of traumatic memories.

We investigated, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and healthy volunteers, how the amygdala interacts with other cortical regions while subjects are judging the sex of faces with negative, positive, or neutral emotion. The data were analyzed by a subtractive method, then, to clarify possible interaction among regions within the brain, several kinds of analysis (i.e., a correlation analysis, a psychophysiological interaction analysis and a structural equation modeling) were performed. Overall, significant activation was observed in the bilateral fusiform gyrus, medial temporal lobe, prefrontal cortex, and the right parietal lobe during the task. The results of subtraction between the conditions showed that the left amygdala, right orbitofrontal cortex, and temporal cortices were predominantly involved in the processing of the negative expressions. The right angular gyrus was involved in the processing of the positive expressions when the negative condition was subtracted from the positive condition. The correlation analysis showed that activity in the left amygdala positively correlated with activity in the left prefrontal cortex under the negative minus neutral subtraction condition. The psychophysiological interaction revealed that the neural responses in the left amygdala and the right prefrontal cortex underwent the condition-specific changes between the negative and positive face conditions. The right amygdaloid activity also had an interactive effect with activity in the right hippocampus and middle temporal gyrus. These results may suggest that the left and right amygdalae play a differential role in effective processing of facial expressions in collaboration with other cortical or subcortical regions, with the left being related with the bilateral prefrontal cortex, and the right with the right temporal lobe.",2001.0,59.0,237.0,"{'volume': '13', 'pages': '1035-1047', 'name': 'Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Iidaka2001NeuralIO,\n author = {T.

A breathing exercise feature for emotion regulation is activated when a negative emotion is detected from the child’s input. Interviews with parents and a child psychologist informed the design of Amy as well as the 12 social stories themes that Amy shares with children.

1254,80ee3e22301bff51bd2385b8111c77a65c1025e1,Virtual Environments Supporting Learning and Communication in Special Needs Education,"Virtual reality (VR) describes a set of technologies that allow users to explore and experience 3-dimensional computer-generated “worlds” or “environments.” These virtual environments can contain representations of real or imaginary objects on a small or large scale (from modeling of molecular structures to buildings, streets, and scenery of a virtual city). Potential use in education was first considered in the early 1990s, when it was suggested that VR technology could provide powerful learning environments not available through other means (M. Bricken, 1991). A growing VR research community has since sought to examine the benefits of using this technology in mainstream and special needs education, as well as other learning environments. This article first presents a brief description of VR technology and its use in teaching and learning. VR can be used as a tool for communication, as a medium through which individuals express ideas, and for learning about communication, through guided training and rehearsal in simulated social scenarios. This article concentrates on the latter application and presents 4 research projects conducted by the Virtual Reality Applications Research Team and associated colleagues in special needs education since 1991. These projects involved the development and evaluation of virtual environment applications intended to support training for individuals with learning needs and communication difficulties in preparation for more independence in their everyday activities and communications in the community.",2007.0,64.0,47.0,"{'volume': '27', 'pages': '211–225', 'name': 'Topics in Language Disorders'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cobb2007VirtualES,\n author = {S.

At the first step, according to the type of signals, effective features were extracted in the time and frequency domains; then, by using the Fisher’s Linear Discriminant (FLD) method, the most effective features were selected. Based on these features, six classifiers were used: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Nearest Mean (NM), K-Nearest Neighborhood (K-NN), 1-Nearest Neighborhood (1-NN), FLD and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). They classified emotions in two classes (low and high) through arousal, valence and liking dimensions. The leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method has been implemented to evaluate the performance of classifiers. To enhance the accuracy of classification, combination at feature and classifier levels were performed. Via the concatenation method, combination at feature level was done. Then, by Majority voting, Fixed and Stacking algorithms, combination at classifier level were implemented. Results showed that these classifiers were selected properly and comparing with previous works, good improvements were achieved by them. Finally, by using combination methods, obtained recognition accuracy was much more reliable and combination at classifier level resulted in significant improvement",2017.0,29.0,6.0,"{'volume': '24', 'pages': '3157-3170', 'name': 'Scientia Iranica'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Amjadzadeh2017AnIE,\n author = {M.

The study included 341 articles (19% unpublished) gathered through a search in PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, ERIC, and ProQuest, and a hand search of 11 relevant journals. Using a random effects model, the overall effect size based on k = 341 studies and N = 273,149 participants was r = .26 (95% CI [.24, .28]), with robust support for the GB model and support for the SB model among medically ill youth. Stress-buffering analyses suggest that different stressful contexts may not allow youth to fully draw on the benefits of social support, and we propose value in seeking to better understand both stress-buffering (effects of social support are enhanced) and reverse stress-buffering (effects of social support are dampened) processes. Key findings regarding other moderators include a different pattern of effect sizes across various sources of support. In addition, gender differences were largely absent from this study, suggesting that social support may be a more critical resource for boys than is typically acknowledged. Results also demonstrated the importance of using instruments with adequate psychometric support, with careful consideration of methodological and conceptual issues.

Tony is a 6-year-old multiracial boy diagnosed as having attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-combined type who is followed in your primary care practice and has started on a stimulant medication. Tony continues to have difficulty with emotion regulation and impulse control both at home and at school. He was asked to leave his private school soon after beginning first grade because of physical fighting, emotional outbursts, and arguing with teachers.His mother made the decision to enroll Tony in online virtual schooling for the remainder of the academic year, with the plan to transition back to traditional school for the next academic year. They have enrolled in a program that offers lessons online and sends materials to the home for the child to use to complete certain types of assignments (e.g., science experiments). Virtual schools are different from traditional home schooling because children receive their instruction from teachers online with parental assistance as opposed to parents being responsible for teaching all material. Tony's mother comes to your practice requesting assistance with setting up an appropriate school environment for her son at home, where she can monitor and support his academic progress.Tony is a bright child, with an Intelligence Quotient in the superior range. He has advanced academic skills, but he becomes dysregulated if he is told he is wrong or that he has answered a question incorrectly. For example, if he answered a question incorrectly in class, he would become verbally abusive toward his teacher and often have temper tantrums. This challenging behavior occurred daily at school and was one of the factors leading to his expulsion. The behavior had predated the introduction of stimulant medication and had remained consistent after he began medication.Tony's parents are highly educated, and both parents hold professional jobs with steady income. His parents have good command of typical behavior management strategies such as the use of rewards, time out, and behavioral contingencies to target noncompliance and temper tantrums. However, Tony's difficulty identifying and regulating his emotions leads to emotional outbursts and shutdowns that have thus far been unresponsive to standard behavior management techniques. Tony continued to have outbursts even when the behavior was ignored. His mother is concerned not only about his learning during the coming year but also about his social relationships and the family dynamic. Tony's outbursts cause significant disruption in the home and are a source of tension among parents and siblings.His mother is asking for advice on how to support his behavior better at home now that he will be spending his entire day there.

Although a variety of functions have been proposed and examined at different levels of abstraction, what is undeniable is that when emotional processing is compromised, most things social go awry. In this review we survey the research findings documenting the functions of emotion and link these to new discoveries about how emotion is accurately processed and transmitted. We focus specifically on emotion processing in dyads and groups, which reflects the current scientific trend. Within dyads, emotional expressions and learning and understanding through vicarious emotion are the phenomena of interest.

1262,8240f949b557df58ad139958e0efdcfd39eda40b,A validity and reliability study of the coping self-efficacy scale.,"OBJECTIVES
Investigate the psychometric characteristics of the coping self-efficacy (CSE) scale, a 26-item measure of one's confidence in performing coping behaviors when faced with life challenges.


DESIGN
Data came from two randomized clinical trials (N1=149, N2=199) evaluating a theory-based Coping Effectiveness Training (CET) intervention in reducing psychological distress and increasing positive mood in persons coping with chronic illness.


METHODS
The 348 participants were HIV-seropositive men with depressed mood who have sex with men. Participants were randomly assigned to intervention and comparison conditions and assessed pre- and post-intervention. Outcome variables included the CSE scale, ways of coping, and measures of social support and psychological distress and well-being.


RESULTS
Exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) revealed a 13-item reduced form of the CSE scale with three factors: Use problem-focused coping (6 items, alpha=.91), stop unpleasant emotions and thoughts (4 items, alpha=.91), and get support from friends and family (3 items, alpha=.80). Internal consistency and test-retest reliability are strong for all three factors. Concurrent validity analyses showed these factors assess self-efficacy for different types of coping. Predictive validity analyses showed that residualized change scores in using problem- and emotion-focused coping skills were predictive of reduced psychological distress and increased psychological well-being over time.


CONCLUSIONS
The CSE scale provides a measure of a person's perceived ability to cope effectively with life challenges, as well as a way to assess changes in CSE over time in intervention research.",2006.0,46.0,627.0,"{'volume': '11 Pt 3', 'pages': '\n          421-37\n        ', 'name': 'British journal of health psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chesney2006AVA,\n author = {M.

1264,82cf74c4246e5d078ce320ab6e417dbc4f3a66f3,Emotion recognition techniques using physiological signals and video games -Systematic review-,"Emotion recognition systems from physiological signals are innovative techniques that allow studying the behavior and reaction of an individual when exposed to information that may evoke emotional reactions through multimedia tools, for example, video games. This type of approach is used to identify the behavior of an individual in different fields, such as medicine, education, psychology, etc., in order to assess the effect that the content has on the individual that is interacting with it. This article shows a systematic review of articles that report studies on emotion recognition with physiological signals and video games, between January 2010 and April 2016. We searched in eight databases, and found 15 articles that met the selection criteria. With this systematic review, we found that the use of video games as emotion stimulation tools has become an innovative field of study, due to their potential to involve stories and multimedia tools that can interact directly with the person in fields like rehabilitation. We detected clear examples where video games and physiological signal measurement became an important approach in rehabilitation processes, for example, in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) treatments.",2017.0,60.0,28.0,"{'volume': '26', 'pages': '19-28', 'name': 'Revista Facultad De Ingenieria-universidad De Antioquia'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Callejas-Cuervo2017EmotionRT,\n author = {M.

The COVID-19 pandemic is a public emergency of international concern that affects several nations. The widespread outbreak of COVID-19 virus has brought not only the risk of death but also major psychological pressure. However, the psychological impact on university students has not been studied in Ethiopia. Objective To assess the psychological impacts of COVID-19 pandemic among university students in Bench-Sheko Zone, South-west, Ethiopia, 2020. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 15 to June 15/2020. A systematic sampling technique was employed to select the study participants. The data were entered into EpiData 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 24 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify candidates and independent factors respectively. Independent factors of depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed using AORs with 95% confidence level at P-value <0.05 cut point. Results Three hundred and twenty-two university students were included with a 97.5% response rate. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was 21.2%, 27.7%, and 32.5%, respectively. Being female, staying at home, history of medical illness, and poor and moderate social support increased the risk of depression. Not living with their parents, relatives got coronavirus and low family income were risk factors for anxiety. Moreover, substance use, depression, anxiety, and poor social support were increasing the risk of stress among university students. Conclusions and Recommendations This study revealed a higher prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among university students.

To explore the effect of acculturation attitudes and ethnic and national identity on behavior problems in arctic minority adolescents in northern Norway.


METHOD
The Youth Self-Report, the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure, and acculturation strategies were completed by 581 indigenous Sami and 291 Kven high school students in 1994-1995, at age 15-18 years. Response rate was 85%. Behavior problems were in addition to ethnic/national identity and acculturation attitudes studied in relation to ethnicity, gender, age, socioeconomic status, parentage, ethnic language, and ethnic context.


RESULTS
Although there were no ethnic group differences in behavior problems, the impact of ethnocultural predictors differed between ethnocultural and indigenous adolescents. Acculturation attitudes were most significant for indigenous adolescents' mental health, and identity issues showed the strongest impact on ethnocultural peers. The study revealed significant gender differences regarding the influence of ethnocultural factors, and contextual variation among Sami adolescents with the strongest impact in contexts with low density of Sami people.

Attentional difficulties may be associated with duration of illness. Method Female participants with AN (restricting subtype; n=24) and healthy comparison women (n=24) were randomly allocated to subliminal or supraliminal exposure to visual stimuli (food, neutral and aversive images) while performing the 1-back and 2-back working-memory tasks. Results Participants with AN made fewer errors than the healthy comparison group in the subliminal condition but significantly more errors in the supraliminal condition [condition×group interaction, F(1, 44)=6.82, p<0.01]: this was irrespective of stimulus type (food, neutral and aversive) and task (1-back or 2-back).

1279,850ce84d97927da3180ebe99d511ed84b99520f8,A Virtual Hope Box: Randomized Controlled Trial of a Smartphone App for Emotional Regulation and Coping With Distress.,"OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the Virtual Hope Box (VHB), a smartphone app to improve stress coping skills, suicidal ideation, and perceived reasons for living among patients at elevated risk of suicide and self-harm.


METHODS
The authors conducted a parallel-group randomized controlled trial with two groups of U.S. service veterans in active mental health treatment who had recently expressed suicidal ideation. Between March 2014 and April 2015, 118 patients were enrolled in the study. Participants were assigned to use the VHB (N=58) or to a control group that received printed materials about coping with suicidality (N=60) to supplement treatment as usual over a 12-week period. Three measures-the Coping Self-Efficacy Scale, Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, and Brief Reasons for Living Inventory-were collected at baseline (before randomization) and three, six, and 12 weeks. Secondary measures-the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale, and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale-were collected at baseline and 12 weeks.


RESULTS
VHB users reported significantly greater ability to cope with unpleasant emotions and thoughts (Coping Self-Efficacy Scale) at three (b=2.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]=.29-4.55) and 12 weeks (b=2.99, 95% CI=.08-5.90) compared with the control group. No significant advantage was found on other outcome measures for treatment augmented by the VHB.


CONCLUSIONS
The VHB is a demonstrably useful accessory to treatment-an easily accessible tool that can increase stress coping skills. Because the app is easily disseminated across a large population, it is likely to have broad, positive utility in behavioral health care.",2017.0,26.0,85.0,"{'name': 'Psychiatric services', 'pages': '\n          330-336\n        ', 'volume': '68 4'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bush2017AVH,\n author = {N.

A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","Introduction The development and use of serious games for mental health disorders are on the rise. Yet, little is known about the impact of these games on clinical mental health symptoms. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of serious games on symptoms of mental disorder. Method We conducted a systematic search in the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase databases, using mental health and serious games-related keywords. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review, and nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. Results All of the serious games were provided via personal computer, mostly on CD-ROM without the need for an internet connection. The studies targeted age groups ranging from 7 to 80 years old. The serious games focused on symptoms of depression (n = 2), post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 2), autism spectrum disorder (n = 2), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (n = 1), cognitive functioning (n = 2), and alcohol use disorder (n = 1). The studies used goal-oriented (n = 4) and cognitive training games (n = 6). A total of 674 participants were included in the meta-analysis (380 in experimental and 294 in control groups). A meta-analysis of 9 studies comprising 10 comparisons, using a random effects model, showed a moderate effect on improvement of symptoms [g = 0.55 (95% confidence interval 0.28–0.83); P < 0.001], favoring serious games over no intervention controls. Discussion/conclusion Though the number of comparisons in the meta-analysis was small, these findings suggest that serious gaming interventions may be effective for reducing disorder-related symptoms. More studies are needed in order to attain deeper knowledge of the efficacy for specific mental disorders and the longer term effects of this new type of treatment for mental disorders.",2017.0,94.0,230.0,"{'volume': '7', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lau2017SeriousGF,\n author = {Ho Ming Lau and J.

1284,855539facf8c4712fde0bb746a4e8bd5da0db33a,"Remotely delivered information, training and support for informal caregivers of people with dementia.","BACKGROUND
Many people with dementia are cared for at home by unpaid informal caregivers, usually family members. Caregivers may experience a range of physical, emotional, financial and social harms, which are often described collectively as caregiver burden. The degree of burden experienced is associated with characteristics of the caregiver, such as gender, and characteristics of the person with dementia, such as dementia stage, and the presence of behavioural problems or neuropsychiatric disturbances. It is a strong predictor of admission to residential care for people with dementia. Psychoeducational interventions might prevent or reduce caregiver burden. Overall, they are intended to improve caregivers' knowledge about the disease and its care; to increase caregivers' sense of competence and their ability to cope with difficult situations; to relieve feelings of isolation and allow caregivers to attend to their own emotional and physical needs. These interventions are heterogeneous, varying in their theoretical framework, components, and delivery formats. Interventions that are delivered remotely, using printed materials, telephone or video technologies, may be particularly suitable for caregivers who have difficulty accessing face-to-face services because of their own health problems, poor access to transport, or absence of substitute care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, containment measures in many countries required people to be isolated in their homes, including people with dementia and their family carers. In such circumstances, there is no alternative to remote delivery of interventions.


OBJECTIVES
To assess the efficacy and acceptability of remotely delivered interventions aiming to reduce burden and improve mood and quality of life of informal caregivers of people with dementia.


SEARCH METHODS
We searched the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, MEDLINE, Embase and four other databases, as well as two international trials registries, on 10 April 2020. We also examined the bibliographies of relevant review papers and published trials.


SELECTION CRITERIA
We included only randomised controlled trials that assessed the remote delivery of structured interventions for informal caregivers who were providing care for people with dementia living at home. Caregivers had to be unpaid adults (relatives or members of the person's community). The interventions could be delivered using printed materials, the telephone, the Internet or a mixture of these, but could not involve any face-to-face contact with professionals. We categorised intervention components as information, training or support. Information interventions included two key elements: (i) they provided standardised information, and (ii) the caregiver played a passive role. Support interventions promoted interaction with other people (professionals or peers). Training interventions trained caregivers in practical skills to manage care. We excluded interventions that were primarily individual psychotherapy. Our primary outcomes were caregiver burden, mood, health-related quality of life and dropout for any reason. Secondary outcomes were caregiver knowledge and skills, use of health and social care resources, admission of the person with dementia to institutional care, and quality of life of the person with dementia.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Study selection, data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias in included studies were done independently by two review authors. We used the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) to describe the interventions. We conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model to derive estimates of effect size. We used GRADE methods to describe our degree of certainty about effect estimates.


MAIN RESULTS
We included 26 studies in this review (2367 participants). We compared (1) interventions involving training, support or both, with or without information (experimental interventions) with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control (12 studies, 944 participants); and (2) the same experimental interventions with provision of information alone (14 studies, 1423 participants). We downgraded evidence for study limitations and, for some outcomes, for inconsistency between studies. There was a frequent risk of bias from self-rating of subjective outcomes by participants who were not blind to the intervention. Randomisation methods were not always well-reported and there was potential for attrition bias in some studies. Therefore, all evidence was of moderate or low certainty. In the comparison of experimental interventions with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control, we found that the experimental interventions probably have little or no effect on caregiver burden (nine studies, 597 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.35 to 0.23); depressive symptoms (eight studies, 638 participants; SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.12); or health-related quality of life (two studies, 311 participants; SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.32). The experimental interventions probably result in little or no difference in dropout for any reason (eight studies, 661 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.53). In the comparison of experimental interventions with a control condition of information alone, we found that experimental interventions may result in a slight reduction in caregiver burden (nine studies, 650 participants; SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.51 to 0.04); probably result in a slight improvement in depressive symptoms (11 studies, 1100 participants; SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.06); may result in little or no difference in caregiver health-related quality of life (two studies, 257 participants; SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.21); and probably result in an increase in dropouts for any reason (12 studies, 1266 participants; RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.20).


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
Remotely delivered interventions including support, training or both, with or without information, may slightly reduce caregiver burden and improve caregiver depressive symptoms when compared with provision of information alone, but not when compared with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control. They seem to make little or no difference to health-related quality of life. Caregivers receiving training or support were more likely than those receiving information alone to drop out of the studies, which might limit applicability. The efficacy of these interventions may depend on the nature and availability of usual services in the study settings.",2021.0,125.0,27.0,"{'volume': '1', 'pages': '\n          CD006440\n        ', 'name': 'The Cochrane database of systematic reviews'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{González-Fraile2021RemotelyDI,\n author = {E.

Depression and substance abuse are common and costly disorders that frequently co-occur, but controversy about effective treatment for patients with both disorders persists.


OBJECTIVE
To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the efficacy of antidepressant medications for treatment of combined depression and substance use disorders.


DATA SOURCES
PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane database search (1970-2003), using the keywords antidepressant treatment or treatment depressed in conjunction with each of the following alcohol dependence, benzodiazepine dependence, opiate dependence, cocaine dependence, marijuana dependence, and methadone; a search of bibliographies; and consultation with experts in the field.


STUDY SELECTION
Among inclusion criteria used for study selection were prospective, parallel group, double-blind, controlled clinical trials with random assignment to an antidepressant medication or placebo for which trial patients met standard diagnostic criteria for current alcohol or other drug use and a current unipolar depressive disorder. Of the more than 300 citations extracted, 44 were placebo-controlled clinical trials, 14 of which were selected for this analysis and included 848 patients: 5 studies of tricyclic antidepressants, 7 of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, and 2 from other classes


DATA EXTRACTION
We independently screened the titles and abstracts of each citation, identified placebo-controlled trials of patients with both substance dependence and depression, applied the inclusion criteria, and reached consensus. Data on study methods, sample characteristics, and depression and substance use outcomes were extracted. The principal measure of effect size was the standardized difference between means on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS).


DATA SYNTHESIS
For the HDS score, the pooled effect size from the random-effects model was 0.38 (95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.58). Heterogeneity of effect on HDS across studies was significant (P <.02), and studies with low placebo response showed larger effects. Moderator analysis suggested that diagnostic methods and concurrent psychosocial interventions influenced outcome. Studies with larger depression effect sizes (>0.5) demonstrated favorable effects of medication on measures of quantity of substance use, but rates of sustained abstinence were low.


CONCLUSIONS
Antidepressant medication exerts a modest beneficial effect for patients with combined depressive- and substance-use disorders. It is not a stand-alone treatment, and concurrent therapy directly targeting the addiction is also indicated. More research is needed to understand variations in the strength of the effect, but the data suggest that care be exercised in the diagnosis of depression-either by observing depression to persist during at least a brief period of abstinence or through efforts by clinical history to screen out substance-related depressive symptoms.",2004.0,78.0,500.0,"{'volume': '291 15', 'pages': '\n          1887-96\n        ', 'name': 'JAMA'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Nunes2004TreatmentOD,\n author = {E.

1288,8649124e8acb5b825604fa2d43e9191ed4d93bb3,Exploring Followers' Intention of Donating Online Game Streamers,"Online game livestreaming is an emerging industry. Followers' donation is major source of live streamers' income. The reactions induced by the immediacy and interactivity of online game livestreaming are critical to viewers' engrossment in such livestreams. This study explores viewers' intention of following and donation toward streamers of online game livestreams, by considering characteristics of the livestreaming context, streamers, as well as viewers' feelings and perceptions. Results from analyzing data collected by online survey show that the relationship among loyalty, intention to follow, and intention to donate is significant. Value co-creation and flow experience are the main factors promoting viewers' loyalty. Enjoyment indirectly affects loyalty through the flow experience.

Objective: To evaluate possible relationship among emotional intelligence, emotional status, resilience, and burden sensation of caregivers of patients with cognitive-behavioral impairment due to acquired brain injury in isolation circumstances because of COVID-19 pandemic. Material and methods: An observational descriptive cross-sectional study of prevalence was designed with a sample of 17 caregivers of patients with cognitive-behavioral impairment due to acquired brain injury. Main outcome measures: Caregiver Burden Interview, the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Emotional Health, the Trait Meta-Mood Scale and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. Results: The median age of the 17 caregivers was 47.5 years, 71% of women had a median care-time of 3.5 years, and 65% of the total sample were spouses of the patients. 70% of the patients were affected by stroke (hemorrhagic or ischemic cause). 59% of the caregivers presented a low level of emotional attention and emotional clarity, and 47 %, low emotional repair ability. 82% of them did not report overload, 53% showed low resilience level. Emotional intelligence showed strong correlation with resilience and mental health of caregivers. All of them were positively correlated with daily positive emotions and negatively correlated with negative emotions and overload. Conclusions: Emotional intelligence, resilience, and mental health of caregivers are strongly correlated.

Besides traditional audio-visual techniques, physiological signals provide a promising alternative for automatic emotion recognition. Ever since Dr. Picard and colleagues brought forward the initial concept of physiological signals based emotion recognition, various studies have been reported following the same system structure. In this paper, we implemented a novel 2-stage architecture of the emotion recognition system in order to improve the performance when dealing with multi-subject context. This type of system is more realistic practical implementation. Instead of directly classifying data from all the mixed subjects, one step was added ahead to transform a traditional subjectindependent case into several subject-dependent cases by classifying new coming sample into each existing subject model using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). For simultaneous classification on four affective states, the correct classification ration (CCR) shows significant improvement from 80.7% to over 90% which supports the feasibility of the system.",2010.0,25.0,12.0,{'pages': '3'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Gu2010AGB,\n author = {Yuan Gu and Su-Lim Tan and K.

Although deep belief network (DBN) has witnessed the success in various domains including early works in emotion recognition based on EEG, it remains unclear whether DBN could improve emotion classification in music domains, especially in dynamic strategy that considers time-varying characteristics of emotion. This paper presents an early study of applying DBNs to improve emotion recognition in music listening where emotions were annotated continuously in time by subjects. Our subject-dependent results using stratified 10-fold cross-validation strategy suggested that DBNs could improve performance in valence classification with fractal dimension (FD), power spectral density (PSD), and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) features and improve performance in arousal classification with FD and DWT features. Furthermore, we found that the size of sliding window affected classification accuracies when using features in time (FD) and time-frequency (DWT) domains, while smaller window (1-4 seconds) could achieve higher performance compared with a larger window (5-8 seconds).",2016.0,33.0,40.0,"{'pages': '881-888', 'name': '2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Thammasan2016ApplicationOD,\n author = {Nattapong Thammasan and Ken-ichi Fukui and M.

A latent growth curve approach was used to investigate level and stability of emotional stability and self–efficacy in managing negative emotions and in expressing positive emotions. We found that initial levels of emotional stability and self–efficacy beliefs are highly correlated. In accordance with the posited hypothesis, the growth rate of perceived self–efficacy in managing negative emotions predicted the growth rate of emotional stability, whereas the opposite path was not significant. The growth rates of perceived self–efficacy in expressing positive emotions and emotional stability were not related to each other. Taken together, these findings point to self–efficacy beliefs as instrumental to the change of traits. Practical implications of results are discussed, highlighting the role of social cognitive theory in supplying the proper strategies to design effective interventions to enable people to make the best use of their potentials.

In Study 1 we developed a questionnaire to assess five dimensions of competence: initiating relationships, self-disclosure, asserting displeasure with others' actions, providing emotional support, and managing interpersonal conflicts. Initial validation evidence was gathered. We found that self-perceptions of competence varied as a function of sex of subject, sex of interaction partner, and competence domain. In Study 2 we found moderate levels of agreement between ratings of competence by subjects and their roommates. Interpersonal competence scores were also related in predictable ways to subject and roommate reports of masculinity and femininity, social self-esteem, loneliness, and social desirability. In Study 3 we obtained ratings of subjects' competence from their close friends and new acquaintances. Relationship satisfaction among new acquaintances was predicted best by initiation competence, whereas satisfaction in friendships was most strongly related to emotional support competence.

Our main contribution is to propose a perceptual evaluation of a simple virtual reality system. The goal is to assess whether real humans are also able to accurately estimate a virtual human motion before collision avoidance. Results show that, even through a simple system, users are able to correctly evaluate the situation of an interaction on the qualitative point of view. Especially, in comparison with real interactions, users accurately decide whether they should give way to the virtual human or not. However, on the quantitative point of view, it is not easy for users to determine whether they will collide with virtual humans or not. On one hand, deciding to give way or not is a two-choice problem. On the other hand, detecting future collision requires to determine whether some visual variables belong some interval or not.

This research looked at what it is like to have a relationship with someone with a learning disability when doing psychological therapy. 
It is important we know what it is like to have this relationship, so we can be good at doing therapy and get good outcomes for people. 
The results say that the relationship is complicated but very important, and we need to know more about it. 
 
 
Summary 
The therapeutic relationship, between client and therapist, is seen as a fundamental aspect in the outcome of therapy in the nonlearning disabled population. Literature suggests that the issues that are important in psychological therapy with the nonlearning disabled population should not lose significance with individuals with learning disabilities. Despite this, there exists a poor empirical and theoretical understanding of the complexities of the therapeutic relationship, when the individual has a learning disability. As a discipline, Counselling Psychology has a particular interest and skill base in understanding the therapeutic relationship and is therefore in a position to offer a valuable contribution to understanding the therapeutic relationship when an individual has a learning disability. Through eight semi-structured interviews, counselling psychologists currently working with individuals with learning disabilities were asked to share their experiences and understanding of the nature and role of the therapeutic relationship. A qualitative methodology guided by interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) enabled detailed exploration of the counselling psychologists' perspective. Themes emerged identifying the therapeutic relationship as fundamental yet difficult due to variables such as the client's experience in relationships, the need for multiple relationships, the experience of needing to facilitate reassurance and the necessary skills for therapeutic approaches.

Feminist perspectives assume patriarchal control to be at the root of domestic violence, and see anger and alcohol as excuses for abusive behaviour. Psychological approaches identify anger and alcohol as risk factors for violence in some subgroups of offenders. A risk–needs model is presented, in which a distinction is drawn between acute and stable dynamic risk factors. Both may be targets of intervention, but addressing stable dynamic risk factors is more likely to effect enduring change. A theoretical understanding is required to identify stable dynamic risk factors, and here we suggest an affective defence approach to anger-related domestic violence and a social problem solving approach to alcohol-related domestic violence. Further developments in risk assessment and treatment matching are recommended.",2008.0,62.0,59.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '107 - 116', 'name': 'Psychology, Crime & Law'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{McMurran2008AngerCA,\n author = {M.

This study examined burden of care, social support and emotional intelligence among caregivers of mentally ill patients as correlates of psychological health 
Materials and Methods: The research sample included two hundred (200) caregivers that were selected from the Federal Neuro-psychiatric hospital Yaba, Nigeia, using simple random sampling. They were individually administered the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), multidimensional scale of perceived social support (MSPSS), emotional intelligence scale (EI) and General Health Questionnaire. The study adopted a correlational design. A multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data. Four hypotheses were tested using statistical package for social sciences version 23. 
Findings: The results indicate that there was significant inverse relationship between burden of care and psychological health (r= -.643, df = 200, p<.01). Also, there was positive significant relationship between emotional intelligence and psychological health (r= .172, df = 200, p<.05). There was significant positive relationship between social support and psychological health (r= .322, df = 200, p<.01). Finally, caregivers’ burden of care, emotional intelligence and perceived social support jointly predicted psychological health (R2 = 0.44, F (3,196) = 51.63, p < .01). Burden of care (β = -.595, t=-10.64, p<.05) and perceived social support (β = .210, t=2.39, p<.05) were significant independent predictors of psychological health. While emotional intelligence (β = .052, t=0.61, p>.05) found to have no independent significant prediction on the psychological health. The findings of the study were discussed and it suggested the need for caregiver education and support programs. 
Recommendation: The study recommends that family support groups should be created for assisting caregivers and advocating for the promotion of their well-being in society.",2021.0,50.0,1.0,{'name': 'American Journal of Psychology'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Nwonu-Ezeanya2021BURDENOC,\n author = {Immaculata Nwonu-Ezeanya and H.

However, the ever-increasing costs of looking after an aging population, many of whom suffer chronic diseases, is straining the finances of healthcare systems around Europe. This situation has given rise to a great deal of attention being paid to the development of telerehabilitation (TR) systems, which have been designed to take rehabilitation beyond hospitals and care centers. In this article, we propose which features should be addressed in the development of TR systems, that is, they should consider adaptive, multisensorial, physiological and social aspects. For this aim, the research project Vi-SMARt is being conducted for evaluating whether and how different technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), multi-sensorial feedback, or telemonitoring, may be exploited for the development of the next generation of TR systems. Beyond traditional aural and visual feedback, the exploitation of haptic sense by using devices such as haptic gloves or wristbands, can provide patients with additional guidance in the rehabilitation process. For telemonitoring, Electroencephalography (EEG) devices show signs of being a promising approach, not only to monitor patients’ emotions, but also to obtain neuro-feedback useful for controlling his/her interaction with the system and thus to provide a better rehabilitation experience.",2018.0,61.0,17.0,"{'volume': '12', 'name': 'Frontiers in Neuroinformatics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Navarro2018AdaptiveMP,\n author = {Elena Navarro and P.

Thirty volunteers were recruited and asked to watch a series of short VR videos designed in three dimensions: time, action (characters), and space. Electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded simultaneously during their participation. Subjective results show that any of the editing methods used would lead to an increased load and reduced immersion. Furthermore, the cognition of event segmentation theory also plays an instructive role in VR editing, with differences mainly focusing on frontal, parietal, and central regions. On this basis, visual evoked potential (VEP) analysis was performed, and the standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography algorithm (sLORETA) traceability method was used to analyze the data. The results of the VEP analysis suggest that shearing usually elicits a late event-related potential component, while the sources of VEP are mainly the frontal and parietal lobes. The insights derived from this work can be used as guidance for VR content creation, allowing VR image editing to reveal greater richness and unique beauty.",2021.0,52.0,5.0,"{'volume': '21', 'name': 'Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tian2021AHE,\n author = {Feng Tian and Hui Wang and Wanqiu Cheng and Wenrui Zhang and Yingjie Li},\n journal = {Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)},\n title = {A High-Density EEG Study Investigating VR Film Editing and Cognitive Event Segmentation Theory},\n volume = {21},\n year = {2021}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2052643558', 'name': 'Feng Tian'}, {'authorId': '2113637747', 'name': 'Hui Wang'}, {'authorId': '2152126032', 'name': 'Wanqiu Cheng'}, {'authorId': '2107986696', 'name': 'Wenrui Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2155506205', 'name': 'Yingjie Li'}]"

In many experiments, however, these arm movements are ambiguous. Arm flexion can be interpreted either as pulling (approach) or as withdrawing (avoidance). On the contrary, arm extension can be interpreted as reaching (approach) or as pushing (avoidance). This ambiguity can be resolved by regarding approach and avoidance as flexible action plans that are represented in terms of their effects. Approach actions reduce the distance between a stimulus and the self, whereas avoidance actions increase that distance. In this view, action effects are an integral part of the representation of an action. As a result, a neutral action can become an approach or avoidance reaction if it repeatedly results in decreasing or increasing the distance to a valenced stimulus. This hypothesis was tested in the current study. Participants responded to positive and negative words using key-presses. These “neutral” responses (not involving arm flexion or extension) were consistently followed by a stimulus movement toward or away from the participant. Responses to emotional words were faster when the response's effect was congruent with stimulus valence, suggesting that approach/avoidance actions are indeed defined in terms of their outcomes.",2008.0,18.0,109.0,"{'volume': '61', 'pages': '1298 - 1306', 'name': 'Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Dantzig2008ApproachAA,\n author = {Saskia van Dantzig and D.

To conduct a scoping review on the use of technology to deliver mental health services to children and youth in order to identify the breadth of peer-reviewed literature, summarize findings and identify gaps.


METHOD
A literature database search identified 126 original studies meeting criteria for review. Descriptive numerical summary and thematic analyses were conducted. Two reviewers independently extracted data.


RESULTS
Studies were characterized by diverse technologies including videoconferencing, telephone and mobile phone applications and Internet-based applications such as email, web sites and CD-ROMs.


CONCLUSION
The use of technologies plays a major role in the delivery of mental health services and supports to children and youth in providing prevention, assessment, diagnosis, counseling and treatment programs. Strategies are growing exponentially on a global basis, thus it is critical to study the impact of these technologies on child and youth mental health service delivery. An in-depth review and synthesis of the quality of findings of studies on effectiveness of the use of technologies in service delivery are also warranted.

However, it remains unclear whether these 2 strategies are associated with differential consequences for emotion, physiology, or perceived cognitive costs in the short-term. The present study used a within-subjects design to examine the effects of reappraisal (reframing one’s thoughts) and acceptance (accepting feelings without trying to control or judge them) on the subjective experience of negative emotions, positive emotions, and physiological responses during and following recovery from sad film clips shown in the laboratory. Participants also reported on perceived regulatory effort, difficulty, and success after deploying each emotion regulation strategy. In 2 samples of participants (N = 142), reappraisal (vs. acceptance) was associated with larger decreases in negative and larger increases in positive emotions, both during the film clips and recovery period. However, acceptance was perceived as less difficult to deploy than reappraisal, and was associated with a smaller dampening of skin conductance level (indicating more successful regulation) during the film clips in 1 sample. These results suggest that reappraisal and acceptance may exert differential short-term effects: Whereas reappraisal is more effective for changing subjective experiences in the short term, acceptance may be less difficult to deploy and be more effective at changing one’s physiological response.

1324,8a70970a0c533017c904a5afdda3da872b4dff3f,Perceptual and affective mechanisms in facial expression recognition: An integrative review,"Facial expressions of emotion involve a physical component of morphological changes in a face and an affective component conveying information about the expresser’s internal feelings. It remains unresolved how much recognition and discrimination of expressions rely on the perception of morphological patterns or the processing of affective content. This review of research on the role of visual and emotional factors in expression recognition reached three major conclusions. First, behavioral, neurophysiological, and computational measures indicate that basic expressions are reliably recognized and discriminated from one another, albeit the effect may be inflated by the use of prototypical expression stimuli and forced-choice responses. Second, affective content along the dimensions of valence and arousal is extracted early from facial expressions, although this coarse affective representation contributes minimally to categorical recognition of specific expressions. Third, the physical configuration and visual saliency of facial features contribute significantly to expression recognition, with “emotionless” computational models being able to reproduce some of the basic phenomena demonstrated in human observers. We conclude that facial expression recognition, as it has been investigated in conventional laboratory tasks, depends to a greater extent on perceptual than affective information and mechanisms.",2016.0,150.0,183.0,"{'volume': '30', 'pages': '1081 - 1106', 'name': 'Cognition and Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Calvo2016PerceptualAA,\n author = {M.

The emotional regulation (ER) strategies that we use determine the way in which we feel, express, and behave. Moreover, ER strategies are particularly important in adolescents, a population for which ER strategy deficits can be linked to the appearance of numerous mental health disorders, such as depression or anxiety, or disruptive behaviors. Thus, the early detection of dysfunctional ER strategies and training in adaptive ER strategies can help prevent future occurrences of possible behavioral and psychosocial disorders. In this article, the authors present the GameTeen System (GT-System), a novel instrument based on virtual reality and serious games for the assessment and training of ER strategies in adolescents.

This has served to motivate research on how to better develop and disseminate evidence-based treatments for PTSD. One emerging form of treatment for combat-related PTSD that has shown promise involves the delivery of exposure therapy using immersive Virtual Reality (VR). Initial outcomes from open clinical trials have been positive and fully randomized controlled trials are currently in progress to further validate this approach. Based on our research group's initial positive outcomes using VR to emotionally engage and successfully treat persons undergoing exposure therapy for PTSD, we have begun development in a similar VR-based approach to deliver stress resilience training with military service members prior to their initial deployment. The Stress Resilience In Virtual Environments (STRIVE) project aims to create a set of combat simulations (derived from our existing Virtual Iraq/Afghanistan exposure therapy system) that are part of a multi-episode narrative experience. Users can be immersed within challenging combat contexts and interact with virtual characters within these episodes as part of an experiential learning approach for training a range of psychoeducational and cognitive-behavioral emotional coping strategies believed to enhance stress resilience. The STRIVE project aims to present this approach to service members prior to deployment as part of a program designed to better prepare military personnel for the types of emotional challenges that are inherent in the combat environment. During these virtual training experiences users are monitored physiologically as part of a larger investigation into the biomarkers of the stress response. One such construct, Allostatic Load, is being directly investigated via physiological and neuro-hormonal analysis from specimen collections taken immediately before and after engagement in the STRIVE virtual experience.",2012.0,34.0,39.0,"{'volume': '173', 'pages': '\n          379-85\n        ', 'name': 'Studies in health technology and informatics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rizzo2012STRIVESR,\n author = {A.

The role of Emerging Technologies","Traditionally, metacognition & higher mental abilities are thought to be exclusively linked to consciousness. However, a growing number of researchers support the idea that nonconscious processes may hold the keys to higher forms of intelligence. Subliminal messages expose individuals to visual or/and auditory stimuli below the threshold of perception. The current review aims to explore the effectiveness of subliminal cues on fundamental aspects of metacognition such as higher cognitive and emotional meta-abilities, affective and behavioral regulation, and academic achievement. In this context, we search for and classify the existing subliminal training techniques, while evaluating the usability of ICTs such as virtual reality, mobile apps, intelligent tutoring systems, and software in subliminal learning and training. The results of this review revealed that subliminal techniques improve all those aspects that assure metacognitive improvements in terms of self- & emotional regulation, higher mental abilities, and behavioral modification. Subliminal cues lower people's shields and update filtering mechanisms enabling people to focus on positive rather than negative interpretations. Subliminal techniques are under the umbrella of metacognitive strategies, since they can used consciously to increase self-regulation capacity as wells as expand the horizons of consciousness. Subliminal teaching techniques can be used by teachers and parents in general and special education to instill higher-level needs & motives, accelerate students’ performance and unfold students’ existing but underdeveloped abilities. Therapists can also utilize these methods to help patients with phobia, anxiety and depression to overcome fear. Subliminal techniques can be also used as a strategy by leaders, mentors, and employees to build trust, inspire and provide humanity with innovative ideas.

Theoretical neuroanatomic models of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the results of previous neuroimaging studies of PTSD highlight the potential importance of the amygdala and medial prefrontal regions in this disorder. However, the functional relationship between these brain regions in PTSD has not been directly examined.


OBJECTIVE
To examine the relationship between the amygdala and medial prefrontal regions during symptom provocation in male combat veterans (MCVs) and female nurse veterans (FNVs) with PTSD.


DESIGN
Case-control study.


SETTING
Academic medical center.


PARTICIPANTS
Volunteer sample of 17 (7 men and 10 women) Vietnam veterans with PTSD (PTSD group) and 19 (9 men and 10 women) Vietnam veterans without PTSD (control group).


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
We used positron emission tomography and the script-driven imagery paradigm to study regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during the recollection of personal traumatic and neutral events. Psychophysiologic and emotional self-report data also were obtained to confirm the intended effects of script-driven imagery.


RESULTS
The PTSD group exhibited rCBF decreases in medial frontal gyrus in the traumatic vs neutral comparison. When this comparison was conducted separately by subgroup, MCVs and FNVs with PTSD exhibited these medial frontal gyrus decreases. Only MCVs exhibited rCBF increases in the left amygdala. However, for both subgroups with PTSD, rCBF changes in medial frontal gyrus were inversely correlated with rCBF changes in the left amygdala and the right amygdala/periamygdaloid cortex. Furthermore, in the traumatic condition, for both subgroups with PTSD, symptom severity was positively related to rCBF in the right amygdala and negatively related to rCBF in medial frontal gyrus.


CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest a reciprocal relationship between medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala function in PTSD and opposing associations between activity in these regions and symptom severity consistent with current functional neuroanatomic models of this disorder.",2004.0,44.0,759.0,"{'volume': '61 2', 'pages': '\n          168-76\n        ', 'name': 'Archives of general psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Shin2004RegionalCB,\n author = {L.

The collected data were analyzed using a constant comparative analysis method. The results revealed that multiple proactive supports (i.e., social, pedagogical, and technical support) play critical roles in fostering meaningful collaboration. Instructor presence is an essential factor that enables collaboration to occur as desired through setting the stage, modeling desired expectations, and guiding students to reach expected outcomes. Assessments also have an impact on students’ level of engagement; therefore, incorporating both formative and summative assessments for both the product and the process of collaboration is recommended.

Most patients with GAD never seek treatment, and those who do seek treatment often drop out before completing treatment. Although it is an understudied treatment, Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) indicate preliminary efficacy for the treatment of GAD symptoms, but many patients with GAD present other associated symptoms (e.g., attention deficits) that complicate the treatment. Virtual Reality DBT® Mindfulness Skills learning has recently been developed to make learning mindfulness easier for patients with emotion dysregulation who have trouble concentrating. Virtual Reality (VR) might serve as a visual guide for practicing mindfulness as it gives patients the illusion of “being there” in the 3D computer generated world. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of two MBIs (a MBI in a group setting alone and the same MBI plus 10 min VR DBT® Mindfulness skills training) to reduce GAD symptoms. A secondary aim was to explore the effect in depression, emotion regulation, mindfulness, and interoceptive awareness. Other exploratory aims regarding the use of VR DBT® Mindfulness skills were also carried out. The sample was composed of 42 patients (roughly half in each group) with GAD attending PC visits. After treatment, both groups of patients showed significant improvements in General Anxiety Disorder measured by the GAD-7 using mixed regression models [MBI alone (B = -5.70; p < 0.001; d = -1.36), MBI+VR DBT® Mindfulness skills (B = -4.38; p < 0.001; d = -1.33)]. Both groups also showed significant improvements in anxiety, depression, difficulties of emotion regulation and several aspects of mindfulness and interoceptive awareness. Patients in the group that received additional 10 min VR DBT Mindfulness Skills training were significantly more adherent to the treatment than those receiving only standard MBI (100% completion rate in MBI + VR vs. 70% completion rate in MBI alone; Fisher = 0.020). Although randomized controlled studies with larger samples are needed, this pilot study shows preliminary effectiveness of MBI to treat GAD, and preliminary evidence that adjunctive VR DBT® Mindfulness Skills may reduce dropouts.",2019.0,60.0,83.0,"{'volume': '10', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Navarro-Haro2019EvaluationOA,\n author = {M.

1348,8beec556fe7a650120544a99e9e063eb8fcd987b,Self-efficacy mechanism in human agency.,"This article addresses the centrality of the self-efficacy mechanism in human agency. Self-per- cepts of efficacy influence thought patterns, actions, and emotional arousal. In causal tests the higher the level of induced self-efficacy, the higher the perfor- mance accomplishments and the lower the emotional arousal. Different lines of research are reviewed, show- ing that the self-efficacy mechanism may have wide explanatory power. Perceived self-efficacy helps to ac- count for such diverse phenomena as changes in coping behavior produced by different modes of influence, level of physiological stress reactions, self-regulation of refractory behavior, resignation and despondency to failure experiences, self-debilitating effects of proxy control and illusory inefficaciousness, achievement strivings, growth of intrinsic interest, and career pur- suits. The influential role of perceived collective effi- cacy in social change is analyzed, as are the social con- ditions conducive to development of collective inefficacy. Psychological theorizing and research tend to cen- ter on issues concerning either acquisition of knowledge or execution of response patterns. As a result the processes governing the interrelation- ship between knowledge and action have been largely neglected (Newell, 1978). Some of the re- cent efforts to bridge this gap have been directed at the biomechanics problem—how efferent com- mands of action plans guide the production of ap- propriate response patterns (Stelmach, 1976,1978). Others have approached the matter in terms of algorithmic knowledge, which furnishes guides for executing action sequences (Greeno, 1973; Newell, 1973). ,",1982.0,111.0,14871.0,"{'volume': '37', 'pages': '122-147', 'name': 'American Psychologist'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bandura1982SelfefficacyMI,\n author = {A.

It proposes an overarching framework comprising conceptual and technical frameworks for enhancing the online communication skills of lifelong learners. Our approach interprets the emotional state of people using webcams and microphones and combines relevant and timely feedback based upon learner's facial expressions and verbalizations (like sadness, anger, disgust, fear, happiness, surprise, and neutral). The feedback generated from the webcams is expected to to-face trainings and better helps the interests of lifelong learners who prefer to study at their own pace, place and time. Our small-scale proof of concept study exemplifies the practical application of FILTWAM and provides first evaluation results on that. This study will guide future development of software, training materials, and research. It will validate the use of webcam data for a real-time and adequate interpretation of facial expressions into emotional states. Participants' behaviour is recorded on videos so that videos will be replayed, rated, annotated and evaluated by expert observers and contrasted with participants' own opinions in future research. © 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Despite the fact that attitudinal theories from social psychology have been quite extensively applied to the study of user intentions and behavior, these theories have been developed for predicting user acceptance of the information technology rather than for providing systematic analysis and design methods for developing persuasive software solutions. This article is conceptual and theory-creating by its nature, suggesting a framework for Persuasive Systems Design (PSD). It discusses the process of designing and evaluating persuasive systems and describes what kind of content and software functionality may be found in the final product. It also highlights seven underlying postulates behind persuasive systems and ways to analyze the persuasion context (the intent, the event, and the strategy). The article further lists 28 design principles for persuasive system content and functionality, describing example software requirements and implementations. Some of the design principles are novel.

This research is contextualised within the growing field of short‐term therapy as it intersects the growing demand to therapeutically address clients on the autism spectrum. The treatment intervention is delineated through five sequential phases within the walk‐in clinic setting for the practitioner clinician. A rationale, overview, and instruction for the practitioner clinician utilising this novel model is provided through a case study format. By using a more structured and integrated approach to treatment, organised through an externalised metaphor, it is suggested that the current model will be more effective for this specific clinical population. Additionally, a case illustration is provided that scaffolds the treatment model, which includes table formats and pictures. The case study illustrates the self‐regulation map metaphor visually and interactively linking client challenges, strategies, and motivations simultaneously on multiple electronic devices in session. Relevant works were selected to explore the effectiveness of single‐session consultation models for those presenting on the autism spectrum. Treatment interventions for specific clinical populations are recommended, especially within walk‐in clinic therapy.

METHOD: The sample was comprised of 50 healthy subjects, 19-75 years of age, with at least five years of formal education. The assessment was done individually, in two meetings with an interval from 1 to 6 months between test and retest. RESULTS: The findings showed a significant moderate positive correlation between test-retest in the overall calculation. In the analysis by segments, a significant moderate positive correlation was found for blocks 4 and 5, whereas there were no significant correlations for blocks 1, 2 and 3. CONCLUSION: These data corroborate recent studies that found moderate correlations between test-retest measures of executive functions, and suggest that the IGT can be used to assess decision making over time if specific analyses are taken into account.",2010.0,36.0,22.0,"{'volume': '59', 'pages': '279-285', 'name': 'Jornal Brasileiro De Psiquiatria'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cardoso2010EstudoDF,\n author = {C.

Taken separately, specific studies vary in task dimensions and in type(s) of emotion studied and are limited by statistical power and sensitivity. By examining findings across studies, we sought to determine if common or segregated patterns of activations exist across various emotional tasks. We reviewed 55 PET and fMRI activation studies (yielding 761 individual peaks) which investigated emotion in healthy subjects. Peak activation coordinates were transformed into a standard space and plotted onto canonical 3-D brain renderings. We divided the brain into 20 nonoverlapping regions, and characterized each region by its responsiveness across individual emotions (positive, negative, happiness, fear, anger, sadness, disgust), to different induction methods (visual, auditory, recall/imagery), and in emotional tasks with and without cognitive demand. Our review yielded the following summary observations: (1) The medial prefrontal cortex had a general role in emotional processing; (2) fear specifically engaged the amygdala; (3) sadness was associated with activity in the subcallosal cingulate; (4) emotional induction by visual stimuli activated the occipital cortex and the amygdala; (5) induction by emotional recall/imagery recruited the anterior cingulate and insula; (6) emotional tasks with cognitive demand also involved the anterior cingulate and insula. This review provides a critical comparison of findings across individual studies and suggests that separate brain regions are involved in different aspects of emotion.",2002.0,133.0,3372.0,"{'volume': '16', 'pages': '331-348', 'name': 'NeuroImage'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Phan2002FunctionalNO,\n author = {K.

The emotion process helps to determine how humans perceive their internal status and needs in order to form consciousness of an individual. Emotions have been studied from multidisciplinary perspectives and covered a wide range of empirical and psychological topics, such as understanding the emotional processes, creating cognitive and computational models of emotions, and applications in computational intelligence. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of cognitive and computational models of emotions resulted from multidisciplinary studies. We concentrate on exploring how cognitive models have served as the theoretical basis of the computational models of emotions. A comparative analysis of current approaches is elaborated with discussions of how recent advances in this area may improve the development of a coherent Cognitive Computational Model of Emotions (C2MEs), which leads to the machine simulated emotions for cognitive robots and autonomous agent systems in cognitive informatics and cognitive computing.",2011.0,41.0,17.0,"{'pages': '75-84', 'name': ""IEEE 10th International Conference on Cognitive Informatics and Cognitive Computing (ICCI-CC'11)""}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Rodríguez2011CognitiveCM,\n author = {Luis-Felipe Rodríguez and Félix F.

It was declared pandemic in March 2020. It is important to know predictors of poor outcomes in order to optimize the strategies of care in newly diagnosed patients. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) constitutes a novel prognostic marker for oncologic, cardiovascular and infectious diseases. We aimed to assess its prognostic value in COVID-19. We evaluated a retrospective cohort of 131 patients with COVID-19 from March to May 2020. We analyzed the association of an NLR = 3 with severe COVID-19, baseline characteristics of the population and the mortality rate. The median age was 52 years, and 54% were men. 21 patients presented criteria of severe disease, 9 of them required mechanical ventilation. NLR = 3 was found in 81% (18/21) of severe patients and in 33% (36/110) of mild patients (OR = 8.74. 95% CI 2.74-27.86; p < 0.001). Age and hypertension were associated with severe disease. A mortality rate of 7% (9) was obtained. Seven of the 9 patients who died presented NLR = 3, with a significant association between mortality and NLR = 3 (p = 0.03). NLR could be used in conjunction with other predictors, as an early prognostic marker in COVID-19 given its accessibility and low cost.",2020.0,0.0,12.0,"{'volume': '80 Suppl 3', 'pages': '\n          31-36\n        ', 'name': 'Medicina'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Basbus2020NeutrophilTL,\n author = {L.

1372,8d611c2a1d9ee423b465f35dbda1d30d05e26c85,"Cybertherapy: Advantages, Limitations, and Ethical Issues","Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are becoming more and more common in Clinical Psychology. Two of the technologies that are more consolidated in this field are virtual reality (VR) and telepsychology. There are other technological innovations that are beginning to be used in clinical and health psychology such as ambient intelligence, ubiquitous computing or persuasive computing. In the last fifteen years there has been a proliferation of studies testing the efficacy of immersive virtual reality in the delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for several mental disorders and health conditions. The essence of VR is that it can simulate reality and add a new possibility: the user has the illusion of “being” in the computer-generated environment while interacting with the VR objects. This unique feature of VR is very relevant for its use in Clinical Psychology. At the same time, it can raise several ethical issues. It is important to investigate the possible effects of blurring the distinction between real and virtual worlds in vulnerable populations. Some other concerns regarding the use of VR in therapy have already been investigated, such as cybersickness. After ten years of experience treating patients with VR, this has not been a problem in the published efficacy studies. Telepsychology has also been used to improve the delivery of CBT. A number of Internetdelivered programs have already become important tools in the health system. The main advantage is that online therapy can reach people who might not otherwise seek therapy, such as disabled people or those who live in remote areas. However, several concerns have been raised about self-help procedures, like the issue of self-diagnosis. and the fact that patients usually have all of the necessary self-help information at their disposal. It is important to establish criteria to protect people from the possible negative effects of this. Other innovations such as ambient intelligence and pervasive computing bring up other ethical issues. For example, is privacy being compromised too much when people are located using GPS or physiologically monitored 24 hours a day? Criteria for considering these issues must be established. Our research group has been working with new technologies and therapies for the last fifteen years. This paper addresses the ethical issues we have encountered in our research and clinical practice; it also explores ethical issues that will become increasingly important.",2009.0,62.0,58.0,"{'volume': '7', 'pages': '77-100', 'name': 'PsychNology J.'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Botella2009CybertherapyAL,\n author = {C.

For a long time, it has represented a sort of “oral encyclopedia” which, through narrative, has passed down from generation to generation traditions, customs and knowledge (Halverson, 1992). The role that storytelling played, even before the discovery of writing, in the diffusion of knowledge, in the construction of interpersonal relationships and in the birth of new societies, is well known. Without doubt writing is the earliest “technology” invented by man, through which culture and knowledge have been passed down over time, after having been transmitted orally for a long time. According to Barthes and Duisit (1975), in fact, storytelling begins with the same story of the human race, almost as if to represent an ontogenetically distinctive trait of the species, which unites homo sapiens with the homo digitalis of today’s society (Montag & Diefenbach, 2018). Other authors (Kenyon et al., 1996) argue that men and women not only have stories to tell, but that they are the stories they tell. Storytelling, therefore, always reinterprets in a new way and with different tools a natural propensity of human beings to tell about themselves, to build memories capable of projecting the past into the future.",2020.0,28.0,2.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Capperucci2020STORYTELLINGFI,\n author = {Davide Capperucci},\n title = {STORYTELLING FOR INCLUSION},\n year = {2020}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '100833814', 'name': 'Davide Capperucci'}]"

In doing so, we provide data that address 3 important and often overlooked research questions in the field of autism and technology, working in school-based settings with 31 autistic children from 6 to 16 years of age. First, what type of VR HMD device (and experiences therein) are preferred by children on the autism spectrum using HMDs (given possible sensory concerns). Second, how do children on the autism spectrum report the physical experience, enjoyment, and potential of VR HMDs in their classrooms? Finally, we were interested in exploring what children on the autism spectrum would like to use VR in schools for? Through a mixed methods approach, we found that costly and technologically advanced HMDs were preferred (namely: HTC Vive). In addition, HMDs were reported as being enjoyable, physically and visually comfortable, easy to use, and exciting, and children wanted to use them again. They identified several potential usages for HMDs, including relaxing/feeling calm, being able to explore somewhere virtually before visiting in the real world, and to develop learning opportunities in school.

There are several software options, including the use of native smartphone applications and text messages (short message service, SMS). Little is known about the strengths and limitations of these two approaches in monitoring symptoms in individuals with serious mental illness. Objective The objective of this study was to compare two different delivery modalities of the same diagnostic assessment for individuals with non-affective psychosis—a native smartphone application employing a graphical, touch user interface against an SMS text-only implementation. The overall hypothesis of the study was that patient participants with sewrious mental illness would find both delivery modalities feasible and acceptable to use, measured by the quantitative post-assessment feedback questionnaire scores, the number of data points completed, and the time taken to complete the assessment. It was also predicted that a native smartphone application would (1) yield a greater number of data points, (2) take less time, and (3) be more positively appraised by patient participant users than the text-based system. Methods A randomized repeated measures crossover design was employed. Participants with currently treated Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (Fourth Edition) schizophrenia or related disorders (n=24) were randomly allocated to completing 6 days of assessment (four sets of questions per day) with a native smartphone application or the SMS text-only implementation. There was then a 1-week break before completing a further 6 days with the alternative delivery modality. Quantitative feedback questionnaires were administered at the end of each period of sampling. Results A greater proportion of data points were completed with the native smartphone application in comparison to the SMS text-only implementation (β = -.25, SE=.11, P=.02), which also took significantly less time to complete (β =.78, SE= .09, P<.001). Although there were no significant differences in participants’ quantitative feedback for the two delivery modalities, most participants reported preferring the native smartphone application (67%; n=16) and found it easier to use (71%; n=16). 33% of participants reported that they would be willing to complete mobile phone assessment for 5 weeks or longer. Conclusions Native smartphone applications and SMS text are both valuable methods of delivering real-time assessment in individuals with schizophrenia. However, a more streamlined graphical user interface may lead to better compliance and shorter entry times. Further research is needed to test the efficacy of this technology within clinical services, to assess validity over longer periods of time and when delivered on patients’ own phones.",2013.0,26.0,152.0,"{'volume': '15', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ainsworth2013ACO,\n author = {J.

Past research indicates that foreign experience helps problem solving because the experience of adapting one's lifestyle imparts cognitive flexibility. We propose that an independent process involves studying cultural traditions and systems, which imparts foreign concepts that enable unconventional solutions. If so, advantages on unconventionality problems should be associated with experiences studying of another culture, such as typically occurs in study-abroad programs. The link should be especially strong for individuals with personalities high in openness and in contexts featuring choice. A survey of MBA students' past foreign stays found that greater study abroad was associated with more unconventional solutions and provided mixed support for the two moderating conditions. Study 2 experimentally varied the presence of choice before putting participants through a simulated foreign internship featuring study and situations demanding adaptation. Subsequent solutions to a product design problem were more conventionally Asian and (marginally) less conventionally American in the choice condition, and these effects were mediated by the amount of foreign knowledge acquisition. Implications for selecting employees and developing employees on the basis of foreign experiences are discussed.

In this paper, a new effective EEG feature named differential entropy is proposed to represent the characteristics associated with emotional states. Differential entropy (DE) and its combination on symmetrical electrodes (Differential asymmetry, DASM; and rational asymmetry, RASM) are compared with traditional frequency domain feature (energy spectrum, ES). The average classification accuracies using features DE, DASM, RASM, and ES on EEG data collected in our experiment are 84.22%, 80.96%, 83.28%, and 76.56%, respectively. This result indicates that DE is more suited for emotion recognition than traditional feature, ES. It is also confirmed that EEG signals on frequency band Gamma relates to emotional states more closely than other frequency bands. Feature smoothing method- linear dynamical system (LDS), and feature selection algorithm- minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance (MRMR) algorithm also help to increase the accuracies and efficiencies of EEG-based emotion classifiers.",2013.0,9.0,532.0,"{'pages': '81-84', 'name': '2013 6th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Duan2013DifferentialEF,\n author = {Ruo-Nan Duan and Jia-Yi Zhu and Bao-Liang Lu},\n journal = {2013 6th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)},\n pages = {81-84},\n title = {Differential entropy feature for EEG-based emotion classification},\n year = {2013}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '7899830', 'name': 'Ruo-Nan Duan'}, {'authorId': '2682019', 'name': 'Jia-Yi Zhu'}, {'authorId': '1715839', 'name': 'Bao-Liang Lu'}]"

Instead, individuals often turn to others for help in shaping their affective lives. How and under what circumstances does such interpersonal regulation modulate emotional experience? Although scientists have examined allied phenomena such as social sharing, empathy, social support, and prosocial behavior for decades, there have been surprisingly few attempts to integrate these data into a single conceptual framework of interpersonal regulation. Here we propose such a framework. We first map a ""space"" differentiating classes of interpersonal regulation according to whether an individual uses an interpersonal regulatory episode to alter their own or another person's emotion. We then identify 2 types of processes--response-dependent and response-independent--that could support interpersonal regulation. This framework classifies an array of processes through which interpersonal contact fulfills regulatory goals. More broadly, it organizes diffuse, heretofore independent data on ""pieces"" of interpersonal regulation, and identifies growth points for this young and exciting research domain.",2013.0,105.0,654.0,"{'volume': '13 5', 'pages': '\n          803-10\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zaki2013InterpersonalER,\n author = {Jamil Zaki and W.

1387,8e9100a9da0858a6c9c2ebc96d9501e80da73380,Ensuring balanced distribution of prognostic factors in treatment outcome research.,"In comparative or matching research involving two or more treatments, the equivalence of the patient groups is of critical importance. In the past, equivalence has either been imposed by matching or balancing, or has been assured statistically by randomization. Matching and balancing, while useful in many contexts, nonetheless have important limitations, as does simple randomization. In recent years, a new tool has been developed that represents a compromise between balancing and randomization. This method, urn randomization, gives clinical investigators new options for improving the credibility of studies at a relatively modest cost. Urn randomization is randomization that is systematically based in favor of balancing. It can be used with several covariates, both marginally and jointly, producing optimal multivariate equivalence of treatment groups for large sample sizes. It preserves randomization as the primary basis for assignment to treatment and is less susceptible to experimenter bias or manipulation of the allocation process by staff than is balancing. Disadvantages include the fact that it is more difficult to implement, and that it violates the simple probability model of simple randomization. A number of research studies on addictions, including client-treatment matching trials, have used urn randomization. A summary of the mechanics of urn randomization is presented, and guidelines for its use in treatment studies are discussed.",1994.0,8.0,452.0,"{'volume': '12', 'pages': '\n          70-5\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of studies on alcohol.

1389,8ebd0593d8c4e34a3e86545e45f78ad4df625194,A novel walk-in clinic treatment intervention for youth presenting with anxiety and depression.,"TOPIC
This article explores a novel, single-session treatment intervention for anxiety and depression through an externalizing process, transforming of metaphoric imagery, and shifting of underlying maladaptive emotional schemas within the Walk-in counseling setting.


PURPOSE
The purpose of this paper is to present a novel, single-session treatment protocol that is delineated through a six-stage process (or mediators of change) for the clinical population of youth presenting with anxiety and/or depression, mild-to-moderate severity. These are two of the most common presenting concerns for this population and the proposed treatment intervention is from a very brief format. A case study is used to illustrate the treatment protocol which is presented in table format and within-session description.


SOURCES USED
A composite literature review was conducted with relevant works specific to single-session consultation including Walk-in clinic models to mental health treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
The interconnected theoretical constructs both map and manualize its key clinical processes, which reflects the mechanism of change in this brief model. This proposed line of clinical research may introduce a paradigm shift towards specific treatments for specific presenting concerns in the Walk-in counseling modality for youth.",2021.0,0.0,1.0,"{'name': 'Journal of child and adolescent psychiatric nursing : official publication of the Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Nurses, Inc'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{McGuinty2021ANW,\n author = {Jazlyn McGuinty and A.

Electroencephalograms (EEGs) are one of the techniques which provides an electrical representation of biosignals that reflect changes in the activity of the human brain. Monitoring the levels of anesthesia is a very important subject, which has been proposed to avoid both patient awareness caused by inadequate dosage of anesthetic drugs and excessive use of anesthesia during surgery. This article reviews the bases of these techniques and their development within the last decades and provides a synopsis of the relevant methodologies and algorithms that are used to analyze EEG signals. In addition, it aims to present some of the physiological background of the EEG signal, developments in EEG signal processing, and the effective methods used to remove various types of noise. This review will hopefully increase efforts to develop methods that use EEG signals for determining and classifying the depth of anesthesia with a high data rate to produce a flexible and reliable detection device.",2013.0,123.0,58.0,"{'volume': '13', 'pages': '6605 - 6635', 'name': 'Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Al-Kadi2013EvolutionOE,\n author = {M.

Yogasanas, pranayama, and meditation have shown to improve cognitive functions. There has been no assessment of Trataka (yogic visual concentration) on working or on spatial memory. The present study was planned to assess the immediate effects of Trataka and of eye exercise sessions on the Corsi-block tapping task (CBTT). Methods: A total of 41 healthy volunteers of both genders with age 23.21 ± 2.81 years were recruited. All participants underwent baseline assessment, followed by 2 weeks of training in Trataka (including eye exercise). Each training session lasted for 20 min/day for 6 days a week. After completion of the training period, a 1-week washout period was given. Each participant then was assessed in two sessions in Trataka and in eye exercise on two separate days, maintaining the same time of the day. Repeated measure analysis of variance with Holm’s adjustment was performed to check the difference between the sessions. Results: Significant within-subjects effects were observed for forward Corsi span andforward total score (p < 0.001), and also for backward Corsi span (p < 0.05) and backward total score (p < 0.05). Post hoc analyses revealed Trataka session to be better than eye exercises and baseline. The eye exercise session did not show any significant changes in the CBTT. Conclusion: The result suggests that Trataka session improves working memory, spatial memory, and spatial attention.",2021.0,37.0,6.0,"{'volume': '12', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Swathi2021EffectOT,\n author = {P.

However, the full values and potential of online communities cannot be realised without users' ongoing participation. Thus, this study aims at developing and empirically testing a research model to examine users' continuance intention to participate in an online community based on an extended information systems (IS) continuance model. Specifically, entertainment value and affective commitment are included in the IS continuance model and empirically examined in the context of online communities. A total of 240 returns collected from an online survey, which was conducted among users of a website bulletin board-based community in China, were analysed using partial least squares. The results reveal that users' continuance intention to participate in an online community is determined by both satisfaction and affective commitment. Satisfaction and affective commitment are, in turn, influenced by positive disconfirmations of purposive and entertainment values. The findings of this study contribute not only to theory building in online community continuance but also inform online community moderators in their effort to develop strategies for retaining their users.",2010.0,55.0,160.0,"{'volume': '29', 'pages': '383 - 394', 'name': 'Behaviour & Information Technology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Jin2010PredictingCI,\n author = {Xiaoling Jin and Matthew K.

Expanding on the upper part of this framework, we then propose the Multilevel Personality in Context (MPIC) model, showing how it integrates and extends past theorizing on the hierarchical organization of personality. The model builds upon McAdams's three-tier (traits, goals, and selves) conception of personality, adding a foundational level (psychological needs) beneath individual differences and incorporating social relations and cultural factors as higher level influences upon behavior and individual differences. New data (N= 3,665 in 21 cultures) are briefly presented showing that culture, self, motive, and trait variables each have independent effects upon subjective well-being (SWB) and showing that psychological need satisfaction (at the foundational level) mediates these effects as predicted. Consistent with McAdams and Pals's (2006) “fifth principle” of personality, culture had top-down effects upon self-level variables and moderated several of the relations to SWB.

To date, we know that the virtual learning environment has been posing heavy demands particularly on the students. Learning from their own homes, they had to learn in isolation, deprived from the support of the instructor and peers as in conventional classrooms. As we continue to pursue online program offerings beyond the pandemic period, it is important to address students’ sense of isolation and their efforts to stay engaged in learning.  This study aims to identify the extent to which the challenges students faced in a virtual learning environment during the pandemic, have impacted their intention to effectively use the online learning method. Respondents for this study consist of students in one private university. This study employs a quantitative method. A set of questionnaire survey was administered online with a return of 367 respondents. The research data was analyzed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) and Smart PLS. The findings gathered indicate that self-regulation, students' sense of isolation and lack of learning resources significantly impact their intention to effectively use e-learning methods. It is thus evident that students’ intention to learn effectively must be supported by factors outside of themselves, to keep them highly motivated, disciplined, as well as proactive through self-directed learning.",2023.0,0.0,2.0,{'name': 'International Journal of Technology in Education'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Mokhtar2023ChallengesIS,\n author = {Shaharina Mokhtar and Thaharah Hilaluddin and Nik Nadian Niza Nik Nazli},\n journal = {International Journal of Technology in Education},\n title = {Challenges Impacting Students’ Intention to Effectively Use E-Learning Method in a Virtual Learning Environment},\n year = {2023}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '116296660', 'name': 'Shaharina Mokhtar'}, {'authorId': '117680044', 'name': 'Thaharah Hilaluddin'}, {'authorId': None, 'name': 'Nik Nadian Niza Nik Nazli'}]"

Yet despite this, educational software has traditionally attempted to harness games as extrinsic motivation by using them as a sugar coating for learning content. This article tests the concept of intrinsic integration as a way of creating a more productive relationship between educational games and their learning content. Two studies assessed this approach by designing and evaluating an educational game called Zombie Division to teach mathematics to 7- to 11-year-olds. Study 1 examined the learning gains of 58 children who played either the intrinsic, extrinsic, or control variants of Zombie Division for 2 hr, supported by their classroom teacher. Study 2 compared time on task for the intrinsic and extrinsic variants of the game when 16 children had free choice of which game to play. The results showed that children learned more from the intrinsic version of the game under fixed time limits and spent 7 times longer playing it in free-time situations. Together, these studies offer evidence for the genuine value of an intrinsic approach for creating effective educational games. The theoretical and commercial implications of these findings are discussed.",2011.0,81.0,515.0,"{'volume': '20', 'pages': '169 - 206', 'name': 'Journal of the Learning Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Nair2011MotivatingCT,\n author = {C.

Few measures have been developed specifically to assess individual differences in the use of emotion regulation strategies. This paper reports on a new self-report instrument designed to assess the frequency with which adolescents use both functional and dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies, which draw on both internal (intrapersonal) and external (interpersonal) resources to regulate emotions. The new measure was used in a cross-sectional survey of 225 adolescents. Factor analyses supported the structure of the measure, which has four scales: ‘internal-functional’, ‘internal-dysfunctional’, ‘external-functional’ and ‘external-dysfunctional’ emotion regulation. The new measure demonstrated good psychometric properties. Frequent use of dysfunctional emotion regulation was significantly positively correlated with parent reports of level of emotional and behavioural problems, and also with self-reported level of psychosomatic health problems. Frequent use of functional emotion regulation was significantly positively correlated with self-reported quality of life across a number of different dimensions. These results provide evidence for the validity of the measure. The results also highlight that assessment of both functional and dysfunctional emotion regulation is important. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2007.0,26.0,162.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '145-156', 'name': 'Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Phillips2007ANS,\n author = {K.

It remains unclear whether NFB can be used to aid and sustain complex emotions, with ecological validity implications. We provide a technical proof of concept of a novel real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) NFB procedure. Using rtfMRI-NFB, we enabled participants to voluntarily enhance their own neural activity while they experienced complex emotions. The rtfMRI-NFB software (FRIEND Engine) was adapted to provide a virtual environment as brain computer interface (BCI) and musical excerpts to induce two emotions (tenderness and anguish), aided by participants' preferred personalized strategies to maximize the intensity of these emotions. Eight participants from two experimental sites performed rtfMRI-NFB on two consecutive days in a counterbalanced design. On one day, rtfMRI-NFB was delivered to participants using a region of interest (ROI) method, while on the other day using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Our multimodal VR/NFB approach was technically feasible and robust as a method for real-time measurement of the neural correlates of complex emotional states and their voluntary modulation. Guided by the color changes of the virtual environment BCI during rtfMRI-NFB, participants successfully increased in real time, the activity of the septo-hypothalamic area and the amygdala during the ROI based rtfMRI-NFB, and successfully evoked distributed patterns of brain activity classified as tenderness and anguish during SVM-based rtfMRI-NFB. Offline fMRI analyses confirmed that during tenderness rtfMRI-NFB conditions, participants recruited the septo-hypothalamic area and other regions ascribed to social affiliative emotions (medial frontal / temporal pole and precuneus). During anguish rtfMRI-NFB conditions, participants recruited the amygdala and other dorsolateral prefrontal and additional regions associated with negative affect. These findings were robust and were demonstrable at the individual subject level, and were reflected in self-reported emotion intensity during rtfMRI-NFB, being observed with both ROI and SVM methods and across the two sites. Our multimodal VR/rtfMRI-NFB protocol provides an engaging tool for brain-based interventions to enhance emotional states in healthy subjects and may find applications in clinical conditions associated with anxiety, stress and impaired empathy among others.",2018.0,76.0,59.0,"{'name': 'Frontiers in Neurology', 'volume': '9'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lorenzetti2018EmotionRU,\n author = {V.

Fear of flying was assessed before, immediately after, and 6 months after treatment. Posttreatment and 6-month follow-up assessments revealed reduced fear of flying only in the VR exposure groups.

The tendency for people to present a favourable image
of themselves on questionnaires is called socially
desirable responding (SDR). SDR confounds research
results by creating false relationships or obscuring
relationships between variables. Social desirability (SD)
scales can be used to detect, minimise, and correct for
SDR in order to improve the validity of questionnairebased
research. The aim of this review was to
determine the proportion of health-related studies that
used questionnaires and used SD scales and estimate
the proportion that were potentially affected by SDR.
Methods:
Questionnaire-based research studies listed on CINAHL
in 2004-2005 were reviewed. The proportion of studies
that used an SD scale was calculated. The influence of
SDR on study outcomes and the proportion of studies
that used statistical methods to control for social
desirability response bias are reported.
Results:
Fourteen thousand two hundred and seventy-five
eligible studies were identified. Only 0.2% (31) used
an SD scale. Of these, 43% found SDR influenced their
results. A further 10% controlled for SDR bias when
analysing the data. The outcomes in 45% of studies
that used an SD scale were not influenced by SDR.
Conclusions:
While few studies used an SD scale to detect or control
for SD bias, almost half of those that used an SD scale
found SDR influenced their results.
Recommendations:
Researchers using questionnaires containing socially
sensitive items should consider the impact of SDR on
the validity of their research and use an SD scale to
detect and control for SD bias.",2008.0,51.0,1604.0,"{'volume': '25', 'pages': '40-48', 'name': 'Australian Journal of Advanced Nursing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mortel2008FakingIS,\n author = {van de Mortel and F.

In this article, we first present an overview of IVET and review IVET-based research within psychology and other fields. Next, we propose a general model of social influence within immersive virtual environments and present some preliminary findings regarding its utility for social psychology. Finally, we present a new paradigm for experimental social psychology that may enable researchers to unravel the very fabric of social interaction.",2002.0,103.0,926.0,"{'volume': '13', 'pages': '103 - 124', 'name': 'Psychological Inquiry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Blascovich2002TARGETAI,\n author = {J.

The treatment of choice for this disorder is considered to be cognitive-behavioral therapy, which uses exposure techniques. This technique is underused in clinical practice on account of both psychologist and patients considering it to be highly aversive and painful. Currently there are several studies supporting the usefulness of virtual reality (VR) in the treatment of PTSD, overcoming some of the limitations of exposure therapy. Dr. C. Botella’s team from the University Jaime I of Castellon, has developed a VR system called «EMMA’s world» with a view to easing the emotional processing of emotions related to post-traumatic reactions in adults. For its use in traumatized children we adapted the EMMA system, called EMMA-Childhood. In this paper we present the VR system, and the treatment protocol (cognitive-behavioral-emotional) that was used based upon this new technology in a minor abuse case study.",2011.0,47.0,13.0,"{'volume': '16', 'pages': '189-206', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{López-Soler2011SISTEMADR,\n author = {Concepción López-Soler and M.

Having proper emotion regulation skills is critical to health, academic achievement, and work performance. In order to facilitate participants to manage emotions, we are developing a series of training programs by using HTC© ViveTM headset and Neuracle. The HTC Vive is to improve immersion in presence to lead to more effective training, and the Neuracle is using Electroencephalography (EEG) techniques for reading user's brainwave signals. In this paper, we focused on analyzing if emotion, which was reflected in brainwave signals, had changes when participants were exposed to positive/negative stimuli. The testing results indicated that there were noticeable changes in brainwave signals to stimuli.

In an Italian undergraduate sample (N = 416), the two-scale ERQ structure was confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis, and each of the two scales (Reappraisal and Suppression) showed good internal consistency. The Italian ERQ also showed the predicted associations with measures of coping, affect, personality, and social functioning. Specifically, Reappraisal was positively correlated with positive reinterpretation, positive affect, and extraversion, and negatively correlated with negative affect and neuroticism. Suppression, by contrast, was negatively correlated with the venting of emotions, positive affect, extraversion, social support and social diversion. Taken together, these findings suggest that the Italian ERQ is a reliable and valid measure that inherits the nomological network of associations from the original version of the ERQ.",2010.0,50.0,344.0,"{'volume': '26', 'pages': '61-67', 'name': 'European Journal of Psychological Assessment'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Balzarotti2010ASA,\n author = {S.

1433,93fd66ca773c081576ba3eb385eb6fd37cd54302,Understanding the social effects of emotion regulation: the mediating role of authenticity for individual differences in suppression.,"Individuals differ in the strategies they use to regulate their emotions (e.g., suppression, reappraisal), and these regulatory strategies can differentially influence social outcomes. However, the mechanisms underlying these social effects remain to be specified. We examined one potential mediator that arises directly from emotion-regulatory effort (expression of positive emotion), and another mediator that does not involve emotion processes per se, but instead results from the link between regulation and self-processes (subjective inauthenticity). Across three studies, only inauthenticity mediated the link between habitual use of suppression and poor social functioning (lower relationship satisfaction, lower social support). These findings replicated across individuals socialized in Western and East Asian cultural contexts, younger and older adults, when predicting social functioning concurrently and a decade later, and even when broader adjustment was controlled. Thus, the social costs of suppression do not seem to be due to reduced positive emotion expression but rather the incongruence between inner-self and outer-behavior. Reappraisal was not consistently related to social functioning. Implications of these findings for emotion processes, self processes, and interpersonal relationships are discussed.",2013.0,93.0,260.0,"{'volume': '13 2', 'pages': '\n          314-329\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{English2013UnderstandingTS,\n author = {T.

We show how path information can be categorized and modeled using a dynamic multinomial probit model of Web browsing. We estimate this model using data from a major online bookseller. Our results show that the memory component of the model is crucial in accurately predicting a path. In comparison, traditional multinomial probit and first-order Markov models predict paths poorly. These results suggest that paths may reflect a user's goals, which could be helpful in predicting future movements at a website. One potential application of our model is to predict purchase conversion. We find that after only six viewings purchasers can be predicted with more than 40% accuracy, which is much better than the benchmark 7% purchase conversion prediction rate made without path information.

The rapid expansion of environmental psychology can be gauged by the diversity and sheer quantity of publications that have appeared since Kenneth Craik’s 1973 review of this area in the present series (92). During the past 5 years (from early 1972 through early 1977), no fewer than ten text books (13, 72, 151,194, 214, 271,306, 307a, 344, 372) and six edited readers (160, 210, 320, 352, 360, 400) were published, all of which pertain to the interface between human behavior and the sociophysical environment. In addition, two multiple volume series designed to communicate significant theoretical and methodological dvances in the field (15, 16, 41) were established, while more than 30 ""state of the art"" monographs and edited volumes on specific topics within the environment-and-behavior area appeared (5, 18, 33, 39, 42, 82, 89, 96, 102, 115, 116, 135, 157, 172, 176, 179, 212, 259, 264, 276, 304, 305, 307, 315, 318, 324, 388, 389, 408, 415, 426, 433, 443, 453, 490, 494). Also during the same period, numerous reviews and programmatic analyses of environmental psychology were published in existing psychological, sociological, and geographical journals (11, 12, 38, 69, 95, 180, 234, 277, 349, 375, 407, 432, 437), as well as in several textbooks on social psychology (36, 158, 330, 390, 423).

This study proposes the use of virtual reality technology as an alternative to in vivo exposure, and assesses the ability of different virtual environments to elicit anxiety and craving for food in a non-clinical sample. The results show that exposure to virtual environments provokes changes in reported craving for food.

Evidence shows that these two processes interact extensively in the human brain. In fields such as human-computer interactions and artificial intelligence, computational models of attention and emotions have been developed to be included in cognitive agent architectures. However, these have been implemented as two separated processes. Although this strategy has allowed the development of intelligent agents capable of showing very believable behavior, the modeling of the interactions between the attention and emotion processes has been widely ignored. In this paper, we propose a biologically inspired computational model of emotional attention. This model is designed to provide intelligent agents with adequate mechanisms to attend and react to emotionally salient elements in the environment.

It is now found across a wide range of disciplines (e.g., business, health, psychology, accounting, information technology) and program levels (e.g., from associate degrees to doctorate degrees). Online delivery is also strongly represented in the teacher education sector at many universities. Research of online delivery in higher education generally and teacher education specifically has pointed to a range of benefits and challenges associated with this mode of learning. Within the teacher education literature, many aspects of the online preparation of teachers remain poorly understood. More specifically, there is scant literature on the experiences and beliefs of teacher educators in relation to their readiness and preparation for online teaching as well as their beliefs in relation to the appropriateness of online education for preservice teachers. This article responds to this gap in the literature and reports on an exploratory study that worked with academic staff, teaching in a fully online teacher education course, at a mid-size Australian university. Twenty-seven teacher educators completed a 34-item questionnaire that consisted of closed and open-ended questions. With regards to readiness and preparation for teaching online, the majority of teacher educators reported lacking confidence and competence in the technological and pedagogical skills required to teach online. By and large, the study participants were welcoming of individualized “at-elbow” support that seemed to abate some of their fears of online teaching. The teacher educators were generally divided on whether the online classroom was an appropriate method for preparing preservice teachers. This article concludes with several recommendations for consideration by teacher educators who work in an online environment and sets the stage for a more ambitious study.",2013.0,63.0,129.0,"{'volume': '48', 'pages': '109 - 96', 'name': 'The Teacher Educator'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Downing2013TeacherER,\n author = {Jillian Downing and Janet E.

Generally, social skills training designed to help patients develop social skills includes role-playing, but this form of training has typical shortcomings, which are largely due to a trainer's difficulties to project emotion. Virtual reality (VR)-based techniques have the potential to solve these difficulties, because they provide a computer-generated but realistic three-dimensional world and humanlike avatars that can provide emotional stimuli. In this paper, we report on a method of implementing virtual environments (VEs) in order to train people with schizophrenia to develop conversational skills in specific situations, which could overcome the shortcomings of or complement conventional role-playing techniques.

Findings revealed that although most of the teachers had heard of the concept of social-emotional learning, they could not give a detailed explanation of it. Additionally, most of them were not aware of the Emotional and Social Development program implemented since 2012 in Turkey. The findings imply that teachers should be informed about social-emotional learning and that efforts should be made to implement the Emotional and Social Development program effectively. Through this research, primary teachers' views of social-emotional learning were identified for the first time in Turkey.

Critically, interpersonal distance (IPD) depends on the affective dimension of social interaction, which might be affected by the current Covid-19 context. In the present internet-based experimental study, we analyzed the preferred IPD of 457 French participants when facing human-like characters that were either wearing a face mask or displaying a neutral, happy or angry facial expression. Results showed that IPD was significantly reduced when characters were wearing a face mask, as they were perceived as more trustworthy compared to the other conditions. Importantly, IPD was even more reduced in participants infected with Covid-19 or living in low-risk areas, while it was not affected by the predicted health of the characters. These findings shed further light on the psychological factors that motivate IPD adjustments, in particular when facing a collective threat. They are also of crucial importance for policy makers as they reveal that despite the indisputable value of wearing a face mask in the current pandemic context, their use should be accompanied by an emphasis on social distancing to prevent detrimental health consequences.",2020.0,33.0,93.0,"{'volume': '15', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cartaud2020WearingAF,\n author = {A.

1461,976c5579338aa76988fee9a8bdaa3056a0f6462e,Shape shifting pain: chronification of back pain shifts brain representation from nociceptive to emotional circuits.,"Chronic pain conditions are associated with abnormalities in brain structure and function. Moreover, some studies indicate that brain activity related to the subjective perception of chronic pain may be distinct from activity for acute pain. However, the latter are based on observations from cross-sectional studies. How brain activity reorganizes with transition from acute to chronic pain has remained unexplored. Here we study this transition by examining brain activity for rating fluctuations of back pain magnitude. First we compared back pain-related brain activity between subjects who have had the condition for ∼2 months with no prior history of back pain for 1 year (early, acute/subacute back pain group, n = 94), to subjects who have lived with back pain for >10 years (chronic back pain group, n = 59). In a subset of subacute back pain patients, we followed brain activity for back pain longitudinally over a 1-year period, and compared brain activity between those who recover (recovered acute/sub-acute back pain group, n = 19) and those in which the back pain persists (persistent acute/sub-acute back pain group, n = 20; based on a 20% decrease in intensity of back pain in 1 year). We report results in relation to meta-analytic probabilistic maps related to the terms pain, emotion, and reward (each map is based on >200 brain imaging studies, derived from neurosynth.org). We observed that brain activity for back pain in the early, acute/subacute back pain group is limited to regions involved in acute pain, whereas in the chronic back pain group, activity is confined to emotion-related circuitry. Reward circuitry was equally represented in both groups. In the recovered acute/subacute back pain group, brain activity diminished in time, whereas in the persistent acute/subacute back pain group, activity diminished in acute pain regions, increased in emotion-related circuitry, and remained unchanged in reward circuitry. The results demonstrate that brain representation for a constant percept, back pain, can undergo large-scale shifts in brain activity with the transition to chronic pain. These observations challenge long-standing theoretical concepts regarding brain and mind relationships, as well as provide important novel insights regarding definitions and mechanisms of chronic pain.",2013.0,91.0,561.0,"{'volume': '136 Pt 9', 'pages': '\n          2751-68\n        ', 'name': 'Brain : a journal of neurology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hashmi2013ShapeSP,\n author = {J.

In a replication with 164 eighth graders, a behavioral delay-of-gratification task, a questionnaire on study habits, and a group-administered IQ test were added. Self-discipline measured in the fall accounted for more than twice as much variance as IQ in final grades, high school selection, school attendance, hours spent doing homework, hours spent watching television (inversely), and the time of day students began their homework. The effect of self-discipline on final grades held even when controlling for first-marking-period grades, achievement-test scores, and measured IQ.

Experiential learning is the process of acquiring knowledge and skills from challenging situations through focused attention and reflection. For instance, many organisations place employees in challenging or developmental job assignments in the hope that the employee will learn something from the experience and transfer that learning to other situations.

Previous work highlights the role of emotion regulation difficulties in multiple forms of psychological distress and identifies emotion regulation capacities as especially compromised among survivors of betrayal trauma: physical, sexual, or emotional maltreatment perpetrated by someone to whom the victim is close, such as a parent or partner. It is unknown, however, whether links between emotion regulation difficulties and psychological symptoms differ following exposure to betrayal trauma as compared with other trauma types. In the present study, 593 male and female university undergraduates completed the Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale (Gratz & Roemer, 2004), the Brief Betrayal Trauma Scale (Goldberg & Freyd, 2006), the Impact of Event Scale (Horowitz, Wilner, & Alvarez, 1979), and the Trauma Symptom Checklist (Elliott & Briere, 1992). A path analytic model demonstrated that betrayal trauma indirectly impacted symptoms of intrusion (β = .11), avoidance (β = .13), depression (β = .17), and anxiety (β = .14) via emotion regulation difficulties, an effect consistent with mediation. Emotion regulation difficulties did not mediate the relationship between other trauma exposure and psychological symptoms.

Twenty-one older adults in a senior living community and a family member (who participated in the VR with the older adult from a distance) engaged in a baseline telephone call, followed by three weekly VR sessions. The VR was associated with improvements in older adultsʻ affect and stress, relationship with their family member, and overall quality of life, compared to baseline. Family membersʻ negative affect, depressive symptoms, and caregiver burden also decreased and their mental health improved after using the VR, compared to baseline. Using the VR, however, did not change their relationship with the older adult. In addition, older adults and family members who experienced the VR sessions as more socially engaging reported better psychological and relational well-being, with older adults also experiencing greater improvements in overall quality of life. Finally, preliminary results suggest that older adults with dementia and their family members might benefit even more from using the VR than older adults with MCI and their family members.",2022.0,57.0,6.0,"{'volume': '38', 'pages': '1904 - 1915', 'name': 'Health Communication'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Afifi2022UsingVR,\n author = {T.

Unlike other animals, humans have the unique ability to control and modulate instinctive emotional reactions through intellectual processes such as reasoning, rationalizing, and labeling our experiences. This study used functional MRI to identify the neural networks underlying this ability. Subjects either matched the affect of one of two faces to that of a simultaneously presented target face (a perceptual task) or identified the affect of a target face by choosing one of two simultaneously presented linguistic labels (an intellectual task). Matching angry or frightened expressions was associated with increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the left and right amygdala, the brain's primary fear centers. Labeling these same expressions was associated with a diminished rCBF response in the amygdalae. This decrease correlated with a simultaneous increase in rCBF in the right prefrontal cortex, a neocortical region implicated in regulating emotional responses. These results provide evidence for a network in which higher regions attenuate emotional responses at the most fundamental levels in the brain and suggest a neural basis for modulating emotional experience through interpretation and labeling.",2000.0,19.0,1242.0,"{'volume': '11', 'pages': '43–48', 'name': 'NeuroReport'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hariri2000ModulatingER,\n author = {A.

1477,99b0926673c7a727eff3697d579ce1a69056fc75,Relaxation with Immersive Natural Scenes Presented Using Virtual Reality.,"INTRODUCTION
Virtual reality (VR) can provide exposure to nature for those living in isolated confined environments. We evaluated VR-presented natural settings for reducing stress and improving mood.


METHODS
There were 18 participants (9 men, 9 women), ages 32 ± 12 yr, who viewed three 15-min 360° scenes (an indoor control, rural Ireland, and remote beaches). Subjects were mentally stressed with arithmetic before scenes. Electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate variability measured psycho-physiological arousal. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the 15-question Modified Reality Judgment and Presence Questionnaire (MRJPQ) measured mood and scene quality.


RESULTS
Reductions in EDA from baseline were greater at the end of the natural scenes compared to the control scene (-0.59, -0.52, and 0.32 μS, respectively). The natural scenes reduced negative affect from baseline ( 1.2 and 1.1 points), but the control scene did not ( 0.4 points). MRJPQ scores for the control scene were lower than both natural scenes (4.9, 6.7, and 6.5 points, respectively). Within the two natural scenes, the preferred scene reduced negative affect ( 2.4 points) more than the second choice scene ( 1.8 points) and scored higher on the MRJPQ (6.8 vs. 6.4 points).


DISCUSSION
Natural scene VR provided relaxation both objectively and subjectively, and scene preference had a significant effect on mood and perception of scene quality. VR may enable relaxation for people living in isolated confined environments, particularly when matched to personal preferences.Anderson AP, Mayer MD, Fellows AM, Cowan DR, Hegel MT, Buckey JC.

Automatic thoughts, negative beliefs and implicit bias demotivate, disrupt students’ behavior, and lower the quality of learning outcomes. Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) is a psychological approach that employs appropriate techniques to help individuals deal with their dysfunctional schemas. The present paper aims at reviewing the research studies regarding the effectiveness of neurolinguistic programming (NLP) in challenging situations as those that people with disabilities face. In addition, we will co-examine the possible applications of NLP on virtual reality (VR) environments. The findings of this review support the idea that neuro-linguistic programming provides influencing strategies for students with special educational needs to be rapidly engaged in those states of mind that eliminate implicit bias and promote positive behaviors and academic achievement. It was found that VR is in line with NLP methodology contributing to unintended bias reduction, cultivating users’ ability to change perspective with flexibility, expecting a positive future and perceiving themselves more realistically with less symptoms of depression. This study takes the view of a new pedagogy in Special Education that integrates the overlapping areas of neurolinguistic programming, positive and social psychology and recognizes their role in developing brain rewiring and sub-conscious training techniques -even in virtual environments-.",2021.0,49.0,41.0,{'name': 'Scientific Electronic Archives'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Drigas2021NeuroLinguisticPP,\n author = {A.

However, CVEs differ in type of avatar representation and level of behavioral realism afforded to users. The present investigation compared the effect of behavioral realism on users' nonverbal behavior, self-presence, social presence, and interpersonal attraction during a dyadic interaction. Fifty-one dyads (aged 18 to 26) embodied either a full-bodied avatar with mapped hands and inferred arm movements, an avatar consisting of only a floating head and mapped hands, or a static full-bodied avatar. Planned contrasts compared the effect of behavioral realism against no behavioral realism, and compared the effect of low versus high behavioral realism. Results show that participants who embodied the avatar with only a floating head and hands experienced greater social presence, self-presence, and interpersonal attraction than participants who embodied a full-bodied avatar with mapped hands. In contrast, there were no significant differences on these measures between participants in the two mapped-hands conditions and those who embodied a static avatar. Participants in the static-avatar condition rotated their own physical head and hands significantly less than participants in the other two conditions during the dyadic interaction. Additionally, side-to-side head movements were negatively correlated with interpersonal attraction regardless of condition. We discuss implications of the finding that behavioral realism influences nonverbal behavior and communication outcomes.",2018.0,62.0,37.0,"{'volume': '27', 'pages': '163-182', 'name': 'PRESENCE: Virtual and Augmented Reality'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Herrera2018EffectOB,\n author = {Fernanda Herrera and Soo Youn Oh and J.

We demonstrated for the first time that three important context effects from the preferential-choice literature—similarity, attraction, and compromise effects—all occurred within a single perceptual-decision task.

However, online training is challenged to reproduce the hands-on element that is critical to adult learning. Since most adults learn better when they manipulate objects in a real environment, a virtual environment can help replicate the physical training environment while maintaining effectiveness. This pilot study focused on the use of 3-D virtual safety exercises to enhance online training. In these simulations, workers interacted within a virtual environment that simulates a live, hands-on environment, but without risk. Results indicate that participants in a virtual environment retained as much information as peers trained in the mechanical lab environment.

Little is known, however, about whether emotion regulation also has cognitive consequences. A process model of emotion suggests that expressive suppression should reduce memory for emotional events but that reappraisal should not. Three studies tested this hypothesis. Study 1 experimentally manipulated expressive suppression during film viewing, showing that suppression led to poorer memory for the details of the film. Study 2 manipulated expressive suppression and reappraisal during slide viewing. Only suppression led to poorer slide memory. Study 3 examined individual differences in typical expressive suppression and reappraisal and found that suppression was associated with poorer self-reported and objective memory but that reappraisal was not.

In this context, it is increasingly common for preschool schools to incorporate students with special educational needs, including those with Down syndrome. These inclusion cases have been sparsely documented, so an investigation was proposed whose main objective was to know the characteristics of the teaching practice of those who work with these students. This approach was generated from four dimensions: personal, interpersonal, institutional and didactic. A qualitative research perspective and case study method were adopted. Three educators with experience in inclusion to students with Down syndrome participated. The technique used was the semi-structured interview, the data were categorized inductively. It was identified that teachers: have conceptual clarity in inclusive education and barriers to learning and participation; are looking for continuous training spaces for a relevant practice; emphasize the leadership as favorable for an inclusive education; its didactic planning privileges learning for life with the use of teaching materials; emphasize the importance of taking care of the student's location in the classroom, as well as following work routines; develop a qualitative evaluation of learning and promote collaborative work with parents and regular classroom support services.

The purpose of this paper is to review the emerging VR applications developed for the evaluation and treatment of patients with neurological diseases. We start by discussing the impact of novel VR tasks that encourage and facilitate the patient's empowerment and involvement in the rehabilitation process. Then, a systematic review was carried out on six well-known electronic libraries using the terms: “Virtual Reality AND Neurorehabilitation,” or “Head Mounted Display AND Neurorehabilitation.” This review focused on fully-immersive VR systems for which 12 relevant studies published in the time span of the last five years (from 2014 to 2019) were identified. Overall, this review paper examined the use of VR in certain neurological conditions such as dementia, stroke, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's, and multiple sclerosis. Most of the studies reveal positive results suggesting that VR is a feasible and effective tool in the treatment of neurological disorders. In addition, the finding of this systematic literature review suggested that low-cost, immersive VR technologies can prove to be effective for clinical rehabilitation in healthcare, and home-based setting with practical implications and uses. The development of VR technologies in recent years has resulted in more accessible and affordable solutions that can still provide promising results. Concluding, VR and interactive devices resulted in the development of holistic, portable, accessible, and usable systems for certain neurological disease interventions. It is expected that emerging VR technologies and tools will further facilitate the development of state of the art applications in the future, exerting a significant impact on the wellbeing of the patient.",2019.0,38.0,40.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'Frontiers in Robotics and AI'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Schiza2019VirtualRA,\n author = {Eirini C.

Perceived agency was manipulated by telling the participants that the image was either an avatar controlled by a human, or an agent controlled by a computer. The results support the prediction that people respond socially to both human and computer-controlled entities, and that the existence of a virtual image increases tele-presence. Participants interacting with the less-anthropomorphic image reported more copresence and social presence than those interacting with partners represented by either no image at all or by a highly anthropomorphic image of the other, indicating that the more anthropomorphic images set up higher expectations that lead to reduced presence when these expectations were not met.",2003.0,67.0,846.0,"{'volume': '12', 'pages': '481-494', 'name': 'Presence: Teleoperators & Virtual Environments'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Nowak2003TheEO,\n author = {Kristine L.

Yet, it is unclear whether these strategies represent distinct cognitive styles associated with psychopathology, such that there are individuals who are predominantly “suppressors” or “reappraisers.” Using cluster analysis, we examined whether women with and without exposure to potentially traumatic events evidence distinct patterns of emotion regulation frequency, capacity, suppression, and cognitive reappraisal. Four patterns emerged: high regulators; high reappraisers/low suppressors; moderate reappraisers/low suppressors; and low regulators. Individuals who reported infrequently and ineffectively regulating their emotions (low regulators) also reported higher depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In contrast, individuals who reported frequently and effectively using reappraisal and low levels of suppression (high reappraisers/low suppressors) reported the lowest levels of these symptoms, suggesting that this specific combination of emotion regulation may be most adaptive. Our findings highlight that the capacity to regulate emotions and the ability to flexibly apply different strategies based on the context and timing may be associated with reduced psychopathology and more adaptive functioning.",2009.0,79.0,197.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '571 - 586', 'name': 'Anxiety, Stress, & Coping'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Eftekhari2009PatternsOE,\n author = {A.

Proposing Mechanisms of Action From a Conceptual and Neural Perspective,"Cultivation of mindfulness, the nonjudgmental awareness of experiences in the present moment, produces beneficial effects on well-being and ameliorates psychiatric and stress-related symptoms. Mindfulness meditation has therefore increasingly been incorporated into psychotherapeutic interventions. Although the number of publications in the field has sharply increased over the last two decades, there is a paucity of theoretical reviews that integrate the existing literature into a comprehensive theoretical framework. In this article, we explore several components through which mindfulness meditation exerts its effects: (a) attention regulation, (b) body awareness, (c) emotion regulation (including reappraisal and exposure, extinction, and reconsolidation), and (d) change in perspective on the self. Recent empirical research, including practitioners’ self-reports and experimental data, provides evidence supporting these mechanisms. Functional and structural neuroimaging studies have begun to explore the neuroscientific processes underlying these components. Evidence suggests that mindfulness practice is associated with neuroplastic changes in the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, temporo-parietal junction, fronto-limbic network, and default mode network structures. The authors suggest that the mechanisms described here work synergistically, establishing a process of enhanced self-regulation. Differentiating between these components seems useful to guide future basic research and to specifically target areas of development in the treatment of psychological disorders.",2011.0,252.0,398.0,"{'volume': '6', 'pages': '537 - 559', 'name': 'Perspectives on Psychological Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hölzel2011HowDM,\n author = {Britta K.

Existing lifestyle coaching services offer individual users access to web portals where they can communicate about a growing number of ingredients of everyday life concern: physical activity, nutrition, medication, mood, sleep and sexual health. Mobile technology in combination with body worn sensors support user’s awareness of their physical condition and lifestyle. Despite the large number of available lifestyle interventions and pilot trials, only very few are successfully transferred into the real health care practice. Low usability and lack of transparency on the reliability and trustworthiness of the information are just a few examples of the major barriers for successful implementation. Traditional metric for measuring effects of behavior change support system are not suited for early stage health technologies. Professionals 
from the ﬁeld of health and social psychology, and potential end users should be involved not only in the design and effects evaluation of BCSS, but also in the iterative process evaluation of these systems. Qualitative evaluation studies focused on the user experiences with technology can help researchers to understand what persuasive features can enhance adherence, motivate people and how this technology should be further developed to optimally match the needs of real users in daily healthcare practice. Based on two user studies, we present general guidelines for design and evaluation of lifestyle support systems with personalized virtual coaching. The ﬁrst ﬁeld study focuses on design and evaluation of a mobile physical activity coaching system. The second user study focuses on design factors that inﬂuence the attitudes of high-risk adolescents towards virtual coaching in mobile eHealth applications and social media.

Among the main consequences of chronic and excessive alcohol use are cognitive and executive deficits. Some of these deficits may be reversed in specific cognitive and executive domains with behavioral approaches consisting of cognitive training. The advent of computer-based interventions may leverage these improvements, but randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of digital interactive-based interventions are still scarce. Objective The aim of this study is to explore whether a cognitive training approach using VR exercises based on activities of daily living is feasible for improving the cognitive function of patients with AUD undergoing residential treatment, as well as to estimate the effect size for this intervention to power future definitive RCTs. Methods This study consisted of a two-arm pilot RCT with a sample of 36 individuals recovering from AUD in a therapeutic community; experimental group participants received a therapist-guided, VR-based cognitive training intervention combined with treatment as usual, and control group participants received treatment as usual without cognitive training. A comprehensive neuropsychological battery of tests was used both at pre- and postassessments, including measurement of global cognition, executive functions, attention, visual memory, and cognitive flexibility. Results In order to control for potential effects of global cognition and executive functions at baseline, these domains were controlled for in the statistical analysis for each individual outcome. Results indicate intervention effects on attention in two out of five outcomes and on cognitive flexibility in two out of six outcomes, with effect sizes in significant comparisons being larger for attention than for cognitive flexibility. Patient retention in cognitive training was high, in line with previous studies. Conclusions Overall, the data suggest that VR-based cognitive training results in specific contributions to improving attention ability and cognitive flexibility of patients recovering from AUD.

EnglishA review of the applications of the Information and Communication Technologies in Clinical and Health Psychology in childhood and adolescence. The development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) has meant a radical change in a variety of disciplines, including Clinical and Health Psychology. During childhood and adolescence, interaction with the ICTs is common and regular, and it is also facilitated because they are digital natives who are naturally identified with the technological advances. The last decade has seen a clear revolution regarding the use of different technologies for the application of psychological treatments and the promotion of health, so as to facilitate and improve the learning of a variety of emotional competences and healthy behaviors in those populations that are in a continuous process of development and change. Cognitive-behavioral orientation and evidence-based psychological treatments have been successfully transferred to the ICTs and there are many studies that support this. The present article addresses a review of the main ICT-based devices for the treatment of different psychological disorders during childhood and adolescence, as well as in other important areas of health at these ages.

In a series of ten ninety minute drives on public roads and highways, ECG, EMG, respiration and skin conductance sensors were used to measure the autonomic nervous system activation. The signals were digitized in real time and stored on the SmartCar's Pentium class computer. Each drive followed a pre-specified route through fifteen different events, from which four stress level categories were created according to the results of the subjects self report questionnaires. In total, 545 one minute segments were classified. A linear discriminant function was used to rank each feature individually based on the recognition performance, and a sequential forward floating selection algorithm was used to find an optimal set of features for recognizing patterns of driver stress. Using multiple features improved performance significantly over the best single feature performance.",2000.0,8.0,282.0,"{'volume': '4', 'pages': '218-221 vol.4', 'name': 'Proceedings 15th International Conference on Pattern Recognition.

Ten boys diagnosed with ADHD and ten normal control boys participated in the study. Groups did not significantly differ in mean age, grade level, ethnicity, or handedness. No participants reported simulator sickness following VR exposure. Children with ADHD exhibited more omission errors, commission errors, and overall body movement than normal control children in the VR classroom. Children with ADHD were more impacted by distraction in the VR classroom. VR classroom measures were correlated with traditional ADHD assessment tools and the flatscreen CPT. Of note, the small sample size incorporated in each group and higher WISC-III scores of normal controls might have some bearing on the overall interpretation of results.

The proposed internalization model of reflective emotion regulation argues that caregivers’ co-regulation of emotionally challenging events plays a constitutive role for the development of 4- to 6-year-olds’ reflective emotion regulation. The model specifies the gradual shift from co- to self-regulation by focusing on two important ways how caregivers structure emotionally challenging interactions: Through emotion talk, caregivers promote the development of preschoolers’ emotional awareness. Once established, they support children in establishing a repertoire of effective emotion regulation strategies and they guide preschoolers’ emerging skills to generate, evaluate, and select from alternative appraisals or behavioral responses.",2016.0,87.0,23.0,"{'volume': '2', 'pages': '17-32', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Silkenbeumer2016TheRO,\n author = {Judith Rebecca Silkenbeumer and Eva-Maria Schiller and Manfred Holodynski and Joscha Kärtner},\n pages = {17-32},\n title = {The role of co-regulation for the development of social-emotional competence},\n volume = {2},\n year = {2016}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '115964516', 'name': 'Judith Rebecca Silkenbeumer'}, {'authorId': '2052760391', 'name': 'Eva-Maria Schiller'}, {'authorId': '6051757', 'name': 'Manfred Holodynski'}, {'authorId': '4185170', 'name': 'Joscha Kärtner'}]"

A novel virtual reality and motion-assisted exposure therapy, called 3MDR, provides treatment in an immersive, personalized and activating context. Objective: To study the efficacy of 3MDR for veterans with treatment-resistant PTSD. Method: In a randomized controlled trial (n = 43) 3MDR was compared to a non-specific treatment component control group. Primary outcome was clinician-rated PTSD symptoms at baseline, after 3MDR, and at the 12-week and 16-week follow-up (primary end point). Intention-to-treat analyses of covariance and mixed models were applied to study differences between groups at the end point and over the course of intervention, controlling for baseline scores. Results: The decrease in PTSD symptom severity from baseline to end point was significantly greater for 3MDR as compared to the control group, with a large effect size (F[1, 37] = 6.43, p = 0.016, d = 0.83). No significant between-group difference was detected in the course of PTSD symptoms during treatment when including all time points. The dropout rate was low (7%), and 45% of the patients in the 3MDR group improved clinically. The number needed to treat was 2.86. Conclusions: In this trial, 3MDR significantly decreased PTSD symptoms in veterans with, on average, a history of 4 unsuccessful treatments. The low dropout rate may be indicative of high engagement. However, a lack of significant differences on secondary outcomes limits conclusions that can be drawn on its efficacy and underlines the need for larger phase III trials. These data show emerging evidence for 3MDR and its potential to progress PTSD treatment for veterans (Dutch Trial Register Identifier: NL5126).",2020.0,58.0,31.0,"{'volume': '89', 'pages': '215 - 227', 'name': 'Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gelderen2020InteractiveME,\n author = {M.

Because regions of PFC and the amygdala are known to influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, here we test whether PFC and amygdala responses during emotion regulation predict the diurnal pattern of salivary cortisol secretion. We also test whether PFC and amygdala regions are engaged during emotion regulation in older (62- to 64-year-old) rather than younger individuals. We measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging as participants regulated (increased or decreased) their affective responses or attended to negative picture stimuli. We also collected saliva samples for 1 week at home for cortisol assay. Consistent with previous work in younger samples, increasing negative affect resulted in ventral lateral, dorsolateral, and dorsomedial regions of PFC and amygdala activation. In contrast to previous work, decreasing negative affect did not produce the predicted robust pattern of higher PFC and lower amygdala activation. Individuals demonstrating the predicted effect (decrease < attend in the amygdala), however, exhibited higher signal in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) for the same contrast. Furthermore, participants displaying higher VMPFC and lower amygdala signal when decreasing compared with the attention control condition evidenced steeper, more normative declines in cortisol over the course of the day. Individual differences yielded the predicted link between brain function while reducing negative affect in the laboratory and diurnal regulation of endocrine activity in the home environment.",2006.0,44.0,997.0,"{'volume': '26', 'pages': '4415 - 4425', 'name': 'The Journal of Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Urry2006AmygdalaAV,\n author = {Heather L.

Information Technology can have an effect on quality and efficiency of care. Aims: The aim of this study is to gain the viewpoint of service users from a local mental health service in developing a mental health app. Method: A qualitative descriptive approach was used. Eight volunteers aged 18–49 years were interviewed with the aid of a semi-structured questionnaire. Results: Interviewees defined a good app by its ease of use. Common themes included availability of contact information, identifying triggers, the ability to rate mood/anxiety levels on a scale, guided relaxation techniques, and the option to personalise the app. The researchers will aim to produce an app that is easily accessible, highly personalisable and will include functions highlighted as important (i.e. contact information, etc.). Conclusions: This research will assist in the development of an easy-to-use app that could increase access to services, and allow service users to take an active role in their care. In previous studies, apps were developed without the involvement of service users.

1528,9e2f156e3b1c83540ed412e803e2ce414ba914aa,The amygdala: contributions to fear and stress,"Abstract Recent studies have identified major components of the neural system mediating the classical conditioning of defense or fear responses to sensory stimuli. The pathways involve transmission to the amygdala from sensory processing areas in the thalamus and cortex. Within the amygdala, the lateral nucleus receives the sensory inputs and the central nucleus provides the interface with motor systems controlling specific defense responses. Internal connections between the lateral and central nuclei allow the structures involved in receiving inputs and generating outputs to communicate. This circuitry contributes to stress reactions in two important ways. First, by way of these pathways environmental events that are interpreted as threatening activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and thereby initiate so-called stress reactions. Second, nuclear regions of the amygdala contain receptors for adrenal steroids. Steroids released from the adrenal gland as a result of amygdala activity can therefore influence the processing of the environment by the amygdala. Although the amygdala is likely to play a major role in stress responses, relatively little work has been done to elucidate the nature of its role. This is an important topic for future research aimed at understanding how the biological cascade that constitutes the stress response fits into a broader network involved in emotional and cognitive information processing functions. In contrast to other models of stress, fear conditioning allows as to approach this complex problem armed with a clear understanding of major aspects of the circuitry involved in processing stress-inducing stimuli.",1994.0,0.0,100.0,"{'volume': '6', 'pages': '231-237', 'name': 'Seminars in Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{LeDoux1994TheAC,\n author = {Joseph E LeDoux},\n journal = {Seminars in Neuroscience},\n pages = {231-237},\n title = {The amygdala: contributions to fear and stress},\n volume = {6},\n year = {1994}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2332694', 'name': 'Joseph E LeDoux'}]"

Despite numerous attempts to promote physical activity and healthy diet, existing interventions do not focus on the common emotional causes of obesity. There is a need for self-management support of this vulnerable target group: emotional eaters. This paper presents the results of the design case study focusing on a holistic design and evaluation of a personalised virtual mHealth coach that provides self-management training ‘Denk je zelf!’ (Dutch for ‘Develop a wise mind and counsel yourself’). The target group are young adults with an emotional eating disorder and who are obese. The contextual inquiry study was conducted to gain insights into the needs and experiences of the target users, including interviews and questionnaires with emotional eaters, patients undergoing obesity treatment, and healthcare practitioners. Personas and the use-case scenario were derived from these results and translated into the new ‘Denk je zelf!’ virtual coach, based on Dialectical Behaviour Therapy and experience sampling measures to capture user experience and emotional state. The main contributions of this paper are: (a) combining holistic eHealth design, behavior chain analysis, and dialectic behaviour therapy in one personalised virtual mHealth coaching application for emotional eaters; (b) applying emotionenriched Personas to guide the design; (c) the results of the initial user evaluation. Preliminary results suggest that the ‘Denk je zelf!’ virtual coach is useful for helping the target group.

In this paper, a real-time automatic student engagement measure is proposed through investigating two of the main components of engagement: the behavioral engagement and the emotional engagement. A biometric sensor network (BSN) consisting of web cameras, a wall-mounted camera and a high-performance computing machine was designed to capture students’ head poses, eye gaze, body movements, and facial emotions. These low-level features are used to train an AI-based model to estimate the behavioral and emotional engagement in the class environment. A set of experiments was conducted to compare the proposed technology with the state-of-the-art frameworks. The proposed framework shows better accuracy in estimating both behavioral and emotional engagement. In addition, it offers superior flexibility to work in any educational environment.

The Army and other Services have responded by increasing the availability of language and regional training. These efforts develop the knowledge and skills needed to understand and interact with a particular population in a particular location. However, full-spectrum operations demand a broader cultural capability, whereby Army leaders are able to adapt successfully to any cultural setting. Meeting this capability will require the development of culture-general knowledge and skills as a necessary complement to language skills and regional knowledge. This report presents a framework for cross-cultural competence in Army leaders, reviews empirical research on predictors of intercultural effectiveness, and describes existing measures of cross-cultural competence and related constructs.",2007.0,211.0,185.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Abbe2007CrossCulturalCI,\n author = {A.

Adolescent substance users face serious health and social consequences and benefit from early diagnosis and treatment. The objectives of this study were to observe trends in treatment utilization; examine correlates of treatment utilization and treatment types/settings among adolescent substance users with and without substance use disorder (SUD); and assess gender differences.


METHODS
National Survey on Drug Use and Health data were pooled across 2002 to 2013, with a combined sample of 79,885 past-year substance users ages 12 to 17 (17,510 with SUD and 62,375 without SUD). Treatment was defined as receiving treatment or counseling for use of alcohol or any drug, not counting cigarettes. Trends were assessed by joinpoint linear regression, and multivariable logistic regression assessed odds ratios of treatment utilization.


RESULTS
Percentages of past-year treatment use did not change in 2002 to 2013. Treatment utilization was more prevalent among adolescents with SUD than without (11.4% vs. 1.4%) and among males than females. Among adolescents with and without SUD, criminal justice involvement and perceiving a need for treatment increased adolescent treatment utilization, while SUDs other than alcohol abuse, older age, and talking to parents increased treatment use among adolescents with SUD, and polysubstance use and male gender increased treatment among those without SUD. Treatment gaps persisted among non-Hispanic Blacks for both groups with and without SUD, male Hispanics with SUD, female non-Hispanic Asians without SUD, and private insurance coverages. Gender differences were observed in SUD, race/ethnicity, and insurance coverage. Most adolescents received treatment for both alcohol and drug use, and self-help group and outpatient rehabilitation facility were the most used treatment settings.


CONCLUSIONS
Treatment utilization among adolescents with past-year substance use remained low and unimproved in 2002 to 2013. Treatment gaps among minority populations, insurance coverage, and in educating adolescents on seeking relevant treatment must be addressed. Using screening processes such as Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment, health professionals can help prevent lifelong SUD by recognizing and addressing substance misuse early.",2016.0,45.0,22.0,"{'volume': '40 8', 'pages': '\n          1717-27\n        ', 'name': 'Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Haughwout2016TreatmentUA,\n author = {Sarah P.

Across six studies using a combination of field and laboratory methods, the authors find that products are more accessible, evaluated more favorably, and chosen more frequently when the surrounding environment contains more perceptually or conceptually related cues. The findings highlight the impact of frequent—in addition to recent—priming in shaping product evaluation and choice: More frequent exposure to perceptually or conceptually related cues increases product accessibility and makes the product easier to process. In turn, this increased accessibility influences product evaluation and choice, which are found to vary directly with the frequency of exposure to conceptually related cues.

On average, self-esteem is relatively high in childhood, drops during adolescence (particularly for girls), rises gradually throughout adulthood, and then declines sharply in old age. Despite these general age differences, individuals tend to maintain their ordering relative to one another: Individuals who have relatively high self-esteem at one point in time tend to have relatively high self-esteem years later. This type of stability (i.e., rank-order stability) is somewhat lower during childhood and old age than during adulthood, but the overall level of stability is comparable to that found for other personality characteristics. Directions for further research include (a) replication of the basic trajectory using more sophisticated longitudinal designs, (b) identification of the mediating mechanisms underlying self-esteem change, (c) the development of an integrative theoretical model of the life-course trajectory of self-esteem.",2005.0,16.0,585.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '158 - 162', 'name': 'Current Directions in Psychological Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Robins2005SelfEsteemDA,\n author = {R.

According to the predominant “basic emotion” approach, the perception of emotion in faces is based on the rapid, automatic categorization of prototypical, universal expressions. Consequently, the perception of facial expressions has typically been investigated using isolated, de-contextualized, static pictures of facial expressions that maximize the distinction between categories. However, in everyday life, an individual’s face is not perceived in isolation, but almost always appears within a situational context, which may arise from other people, the physical environment surrounding the face, as well as multichannel information from the sender. Furthermore, situational context may be provided by the perceiver, including already present social information gained from affective learning and implicit processing biases such as race bias. Thus, the perception of facial expressions is presumably always influenced by contextual variables. In this comprehensive review, we aim at (1) systematizing the contextual variables that may influence the perception of facial expressions and (2) summarizing experimental paradigms and findings that have been used to investigate these influences. The studies reviewed here demonstrate that perception and neural processing of facial expressions are substantially modified by contextual information, including verbal, visual, and auditory information presented together with the face as well as knowledge or processing biases already present in the observer. These findings further challenge the assumption of automatic, hardwired categorical emotion extraction mechanisms predicted by basic emotion theories. Taking into account a recent model on face processing, we discuss where and when these different contextual influences may take place, thus outlining potential avenues in future research.",2012.0,156.0,316.0,"{'volume': '3', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wieser2012FacesIC,\n author = {M.

Through a 3-week controlled deployment, we examine how voice-based and chat-based interaction affect workers' reflection and support self-learning. We demonstrate that, while many current technical limitations exist, adding dedicated mobile voice interaction separate from the already busy chat modality may further enable users to step back and reflect on their work.

The results indicated that meaningful dimensions of cultural variability can be a potentially useful theoretical and empirical construct in future cross-cultural research on the emotions.",1989.0,15.0,372.0,"{'volume': '20', 'pages': '105 - 92', 'name': 'Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Matsumoto1989CulturalIO,\n author = {D.

1558,a0650855634a156db81a01dcdceff931e9f1ac04,The Soar Cognitive Architecture,"In development for thirty years, Soar is a general cognitive architecture that integrates knowledge-intensive reasoning, reactive execution, hierarchical reasoning, planning, and learning from experience, with the goal of creating a general computational system that has the same cognitive abilities as humans. In contrast, most AI systems are designed to solve only one type of problem, such as playing chess, searching the Internet, or scheduling aircraft departures. Soar is both a software system for agent development and a theory of what computational structures are necessary to support human-level agents. Over the years, both software system and theory have evolved. This book offers the definitive presentation of Soar from theoretical and practical perspectives, providing comprehensive descriptions of fundamental aspects and new components. The current version of Soar features major extensions, adding reinforcement learning, semantic memory, episodic memory, mental imagery, and an appraisal-based model of emotion. This book describes details of Soar's component memories and processes and offers demonstrations of individual components, components working in combination, and real-world applications. Beyond these functional considerations, the book also proposes requirements for general cognitive architectures and explicitly evaluates how well Soar meets those requirements.",2012.0,27.0,878.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Laird2012TheSC,\n author = {J.

Current treatments are limited and there is increasing interest in the use of mindfulness, which is growing in popularity. Previous systematic reviews have typically focused on specific ages, outcome measures or interventions. The current review aimed to take a more comprehensive approach. Title and abstract searches were performed in five databases for randomized and non-randomized controlled trials or pre-post studies with participants with an ADHD diagnosis or a score above a clinically relevant cut-off on a validated ADHD measure. Studies had to measure symptoms of ADHD, global or social functioning. Extraction of key information including participant status (i.e., diagnosis, scale scores, comorbidities, medication use), study design, and outcome measures was conducted. Effect sizes (Hedge’s g) were calculated and where a measure had been used in at least three studies with the same population, meta-analyses were considered. Twenty-nine studies were initially identified, with seven deemed poor quality and removed from further analysis leaving, 22 studies containing data from 1237 children and adults with ADHD along with data from 525 family members. The data indicate possible benefits of mindfulness on self-compassion, quality of life, wellbeing, depression, and anxiety. The findings also suggest that mindfulness may also improve ADHD symptoms, executive function, problematic behaviours, and emotional dysregulation, although results vary by age of patient and measures used. Parent stress and parenting style have received limited attention, highlighting the need for more studies in these areas. Whilst the data presented suggest that mindfulness may be beneficial, the evidence base is not as strong as the popularity of the approach. Many of the studies lacked blind assessment, adequate randomization, or suitable control conditions. As such high-quality controlled studies considering medication, other psychosocial interventions, use of active and in active controls and comorbidity as well as longer follow-up periods, are needed to confirm this.",2022.0,119.0,1.0,{'name': 'Psychiatry International'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Kretschmer2022MindfulnessIF,\n author = {Clara Kretschmer and Burcu Göz Tebrizcik and E.

Both the detrimental impact of LD on social adjustment and the significance of peer relations for developmental needs make group therapy a natural intervention. Despite modifications that are required due to their cognitive deficits, many students with LD fit the criteria and can benefit from group psychotherapy. In this paper, a model of group therapy for older children and adolescents with LD is presented. The approach is informed by a combination of self psychology, mutual aid, and interpersonal group therapy. The leaders use special techniques to accommodate the LD and to foster the group process.

In Experiment 1, consistent with resource allocation theory (H. C. Ellis & P. W.

Holyoak, 1985)—participants confirmed where they normally falsify. Experiment 2 revealed the same confirmatory responses for participants performing a concurrent distracter task, indicating that induced mood states suppress reasoning by depleting central executive resources. This hypothesis was directly tested in Experiment 3. Participants in a positive, but not in a negative, mood state showed suppressed performance on the Tower of London task (T. Shallice, 1982)—the classical central executive task. The robust positive mood effects and the confirmation effects are discussed in terms of the D. A. Norman and T.

The interface is intended to enable private conversation practice anywhere, anytime using a web-browser. Users converse informally with a virtual agent, receiving feedback on nonverbal cues in realtime, and summary feedback. The prototype was developed in consultation with an expert UX designer, two psychologists, and a pediatrician. Using the data from 47 individuals, feedback and dialogue generation were automated using a hidden Markov model and a schema-driven dialogue manager capable of handling multi-topic conversations. We conducted a study with nine high-functioning ASD teenagers. Through a thematic analysis of post-experiment interviews, identified several key design considerations, notably: 1) Users should be fully briefed at the outset about the purpose and limitations of the system, to avoid unrealistic expectations. 2) An interface should incorporate positive acknowledgment of behavior change. 3) Realistic appearance of a virtual agent and responsiveness are important in engaging users. 4) Conversation personalization, for instance in prompting laconic users for more input and reciprocal questions, would help the teenagers engage for longer terms and increase the system's utility.",2018.0,68.0,30.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 20th ACM International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Ali2018AVC,\n author = {M.

The results of this study revealed a close relationship between breathing problems and learning, mental or/and behavioral disorders. In addition, it was found that breath-control training can help people with various disorders to improve cognitive and metacognitive abilities, to better manage emotional and behavioral problems, and achieve better learning outcomes. Technologies such as robots, virtual reality, mobile apps, and digital games were found to assist breathing training in various ways fostering therapeutic outcomes. We conclude that breathing training should constitute not just an alternative method of intervention but an essential practice for prevention and intervention in daily life, in school settings, at home, and workplace. It is essential to train appropriate breathing habits as early as possible in young children because many of the damaging effects on cognitive functions by disordered breathing can have lasting consequences.",2022.0,0.0,4.0,{'name': 'Technium Social Sciences Journal'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Mitsea2022CuttingEdgeTI,\n author = {Eleni Mitsea and A.

The person is seen as attempting to manage and cope with their difficulties, through a variety of coping mechanisms. Some are able to seek to maximize their cognitive capacities, and there are a number of strategies now available to assist in this process. However, the emotional aspects merit increased attention, with more awareness needed of the range of powerful emotions that may be present, and of the possibility of therapeutic interventions to alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Many of the difficult behaviours seen in dementia may be understood more fully with an appreciation of their emotional underpinning, in feelings of anger, fear, insecurity and hopelessness. The interaction between caregiver strain and challenging behaviour also merits further exploration. The person-centred approach has many implications for practice, as well as for research. The perspective of the person with dementia, and outcomes reflecting that perspective, must be represented in research studies in dementia care.

We examined three different, commonly used approaches to stress relaxation—progressive muscle relaxation, deep breathing, and guided imagery—and evaluated them in a head-to-head comparison against each other and a control condition. Sixty healthy undergraduate participants were randomized to one of the four conditions and completed 20 minutes of progressive muscle relaxation, deep breathing, or guided imagery training that was delivered by recorded audio instruction. Baseline and follow-up assessment of psychological relaxation states were completed. Physiological relaxation was also assessed continuously using measures of electrodermal activity and heart rate. Results showed that progressive muscle relaxation, deep breathing, and guided imagery all increased the state of relaxation for participants in those groups, compared to participants in the control group. In each case, the increase was statistically significant and although the groups did not differ on relaxation before training, all groups were significantly higher on relaxation after training, as compared to the control group. Progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery showed an immediate linear trend toward physiological relaxation, compared to the control group, and the deep breathing group showed an immediate increase in physiological arousal followed quickly by a return to initial levels. Our results lend support to the body of research showing that stress relaxation training can be effective in improving relaxation states at both the psychological and physiological level.

The sample comprised 2283 participants aged 12–17 years from the Basque Country (northern Spain). Results: (1) Females had greater emotional attention capacity but there were no sex differences in emotional comprehension and emotion regulation; (2) adolescents aged 12–14 showed higher scores in comprehension and emotion regulation than those aged 15–17; (3) adolescents who consulted a psychologist for problems (anxiety, depression, violence, etc.) had lower emotion regulation; (4) adolescents with low IEI had less empathy, self-esteem, extroversion, openness, agreeableness, and responsibility, and lower use of cooperative and passive conflict-resolution strategies, and their parents had a low level of acceptance-affection towards their children.

1576,a3461eaf51016f9d6e85ea47173b27e019e801c4,State of the Art,"We are concerned with the inference (induction) of theories (hypotheses) from observations (data). This problem is common to philosophy (Aristotle 1988), statistical inference (Casella & Berger 2001) and machine learning (Mitchell 1997, Agluin & Smith 1983). We constrain ourselves only to the latter two frameworks. Within machine-learning, we further concentrate on its subfield called inductive logic programming (Nienhuys-Cheng & de Wolf 1997). Whereas in statistics we namely concentrate on evaluating hypotheses, in machine learning we study ways of constructing the theories. From the theoretical viewpoint, however, the construction is also viewed as a selection of a hypothesis from an a priori given set. Unlike in statistics, however, the range of considered hypotheses is usually large so that hypotheses cannot by inspected individually by a human. Such a set of hypotheses may be conveniently viewed as (equivalent to) a language L H generated by a certain formal grammar. Every hypothesis H ∈ L H induces a mapping h : X → O where X is a predefined (usually countable) set of instances (which we also call the domain of L H) and O is a set usually assumed to be finite and its elements called classes. Very often, O has just two elements. The assigned mapping gives the hypothesis its meaning (semantics). The usual formalization of the concept learning task is then as follows. Let there be a hypothesis C ∈ L H called the target concept and let n examples (x 1 , c(x 1)),(x 2 , c(x 2)),... ,(x n , c(x n))= S drawn from a predefined distribution D X on X be provided to the algorithm L called the learner (S is called a sample). We ask L to output an hypothesis H ∈ L H such that a specified error function Err(H, C) is minimized with respect to D X. The error function may be defined as e.g. Err(H, C) = 0 if H ≡ C (i.e. h(x) = c(x) ∀x ∈ X) and Err(H, C) = 1 otherwise, that is, irrespectively of the distribution D X. We would thus require the learner to exactly identify the target concept. This would be close to the theoretical framework of identification in the limit (Gold 1967), which, roughly said, demands that the learner converges to the correct hypothesis in the limit as n → ∞. Such a requirement is however very rigid and does not comply to the …",1997.0,65.0,5506.0,"{'volume': '41', 'pages': '17-19', 'name': 'Pediatric Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Voelter1997StateOT,\n author = {Markus Voelter},\n journal = {Pediatric Research},\n pages = {17-19},\n title = {State of the Art},\n volume = {41},\n year = {1997}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2262448783', 'name': 'Markus Voelter'}]"

Expectation-confirmation theory is adapted from the consumer behavior literature and integrated with theoretical and empirical findings from prior IS usage research to theorize a model of IS continuance. Five research hypotheses derived from this model are empirically validated using a field survey of online banking users. The results suggest that users' continuance intention is determined by their satisfaction with IS use and perceived usefulness of continued IS use. User satisfaction, in turn, is influenced by their confirmation of expectation from prior IS use and perceived usefulness. Post-acceptance perceived usefulness is influenced by users' confirmation level. This study draws attention to the substantive differences between acceptance and continuance behaviors, theorizes and validates one of the earliest theoretical models of IS continuance, integrates confirmation and user satisfaction constructs within our current understanding of IS use, conceptualizes and creates an initial scale for measuring IS continuance, and offers an initial explanation for the acceptance-discontinuance anomaly.",2001.0,58.0,6412.0,"{'volume': '25', 'pages': '351-370', 'name': 'MIS Q.'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bhattacherjee2001UnderstandingIS,\n author = {Anol Bhattacherjee},\n journal = {MIS Q.},\n pages = {351-370},\n title = {Understanding Information Systems Continuance: An Expectation-Confirmation Model},\n volume = {25},\n year = {2001}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '1772304', 'name': 'Anol Bhattacherjee'}]"

This dependence model asserts that the primary issue in understanding breakup decisions is degree of dependence on a relationship. Dependence is great when important outcomes in the current relationship are not available elsewhere. Need satisfaction dependence measures identify important needs in a relationship and compare satisfaction of those needs in the current relationship to satisfaction in alternative relationships. Two longitudinal studies provide good support for the dependence model. Need satisfaction dependence measures significantly differentiated between subjects who remained in their relationships and those who voluntarily broke up. The studies also compared the model to simpler breakup models and assessed whether commitment mediates the link between dependence and breakup decisions. Why do individuals sometimes remain in relationships that are not terribly satisfying? This article advances a dependence model of breakups. The dependence model clarifies and extends concepts from interdependence theory (Kelley & Thibaut, 1978; Thibaut & Kelley, 1959), proposing that the decision to remain in or voluntarily end a given relationship is strongly related to the degree of dependence on that relationship. Dependence is asserted to be great when the most important needs a relationship fulfills cannot be gratified elsewhere. Thus, we suggest that an individual may sometimes remain in a relationship that is not terribly satisfying because of high dependence on that relationship—dissatisfying as it is, the relationship may nevertheless fulfill important needs that cannot be gratified in alternative relationships. From the outset, it is important to distinguish between the concepts of satisfaction and dependence. These constructs were first introduced in Thibaut and Kelley's (1959) interdependence theory, in their discussion of two subjective criteria for Editors Note.

We provide experimental evidence that emotional contagion occurs without direct interaction between people (exposure to a friend expressing an emotion is sufficient), and in the complete absence of nonverbal cues. Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’ positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.",2014.0,15.0,2527.0,"{'volume': '111', 'pages': '8788 - 8790', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kramer2014ExperimentalEO,\n author = {Adam D.

The implementation and early demonstrations of this skill by our robot is the topic of this paper.",2007.0,15.0,14.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Breazeal2007EarlyEU,\n author = {C.

This study complicates the role of self-branding on social media through the case of real-time creative labor on a social live streaming platform. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth interviews with live creators and viewers, this study suggests that the affordances of social live streaming platforms create a media and relational environment wherein personal branding practices are belabored by both creators and audiences. This phenomenon, which we term participatory branding, redistributes the labor of personal branding on social media and emphasizes the work of audiences in helping to shape the brand of a creative worker. We then advance a typology that maps the terrain of personal branding on social media as it relates to platform affordances, cross-platform promotion, and audience activity in content creation.",2020.0,49.0,24.0,"{'volume': '24', 'pages': '1179 - 1195', 'name': 'New Media & Society'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Meisner2020ParticipatoryBO,\n author = {Colten Meisner and Andrew M.

J. hanger (1978) remains true today: that much of contemporary psychological research is based on the assumption that people are consciously and systematically processing incoming information in order to construe and interpret their world and to plan and engage in courses of action. As did E. J. hanger, the authors question this assumption. First, they review evidence that the ability to exercise such conscious, intentional control is actually quite limited, so that most of moment-to-mom ent psychological life must occur through nonconscious means if it is to occur at all. The authors then describe the different possible mechanisms that produce automatic, environmental control over these various phenomena and review evidence establishing both the existence of these mechanisms as well as their consequences for judgments, emotions, and behavior. Three major forms of automatic self-regulation are identified: an automatic effect of perception on action, automatic goal pursuit, and a continual automatic evaluation of one's experience. From the accumulating evidence, the authors conclude that these various nonconscious mental systems perform the lion's share of the self-regulatory burden, beneficently keeping the individual grounded in his or her current environment. The strongest knowledge—that of the total unfreedom of the human will—is nonetheless the poorest in successes, for it always has the strongest opponent: human vanity. —Nietzsche, Human, All Too Human",1999.0,166.0,3492.0,"{'volume': '54', 'pages': '462-479', 'name': 'American Psychologist'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bargh1999THEUA,\n author = {J.

Yet, its relation to teachers’ emotional experiences and emotional labor (EL) during instruction remains unclear. Thirty-nine German secondary teachers were surveyed about their EE (trait), and via the experience sampling method on their momentary (state; N = 794) emotional experiences (enjoyment, anxiety, anger) and momentary EL (suppression, faking). Teachers reported that in 99 and 39% of all lessons, they experienced enjoyment and anger, respectively, whereas they experienced anxiety less frequently. Teachers reported suppressing or faking their emotions during roughly a third of all lessons. Furthermore, EE was reflected in teachers’ decreased experiences of enjoyment and increased experiences of anger. On an intra-individual level, all three emotions predict EL, whereas on an inter-individual level, only anger evokes EL. Explained variances in EL (within: 39%, between: 67%) stress the relevance of emotions in teaching and within the context of teacher burnout. Beyond implying the importance of reducing anger, our findings suggest the potential of enjoyment lessening EL and thereby reducing teacher burnout.",2014.0,69.0,207.0,"{'volume': '5', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Keller2014TeachersEE,\n author = {M.

Consequently, almost no research has investigated the potential importance of subconscious (automatic) behaviors, also known as habits. This study represents a first step toward validating the idea that one can add explanatory power to a behavioral model such as Ajzen’s [1985] theory of planned behavior (TPB) by including the habit construct. We conducted a two-stage questionnaire-based survey involving two different groups of students who had access to a sophisticated internet-based communication tool (IBCT). These data were used to test a behavioral model integrating theoretical constructs of TPB and a relevant subset of Triandis’ [1980] behavioral framework. Our findings highlight the importance of considering both conscious (intentions) and subconscious (habits) factors in explaining usage behavior.

To answer this question, we investigated whether these spaces refer to a similar or different physical distance. Methodology Participants provided reachability-distance (for potential action) and comfort-distance (for social processing) judgments towards human and non-human virtual stimuli while standing still (passive) or walking toward stimuli (active). Principal Findings Comfort-distance was larger than other conditions when participants were passive, but reachability and comfort distances were similar when participants were active. Both spaces were modulated by the social valence of stimuli (reduction with virtual females vs males, expansion with cylinder vs robot) and the gender of participants. Conclusions These findings reveal that peripersonal reaching and interpersonal comfort spaces share a common motor nature and are sensitive, at different degrees, to social modulation.

1603,a760fdf65fc93146ae62e492df1c0f24693aff5c,Alienable gifts: Uses and meanings of gold in Turkey,"Gold coins and bracelets, standardized and generic items readily available in every jewelry shop, feature predominantly in gift exchange in Turkey. In this study, we investigate why these objects are valued, what they mean to people, and how they are used. Through in-depth interviews and ethnographic observations, we identify three occasions that gifts of gold take a prominent role. First, we discuss giving gold coins and bracelets in ritualized occasions and locate this traditional practice within a system of economically embedded solidarity. Second, we explain self-gifting of gold items and discuss how such gift giving enables consumers to exercise self-control. Finally, we look at how gold gifts serve as means for women to build socioeconomic power and discuss traditional and modern versions of gold accumulation. Overall, we observe that, in the context of Turkish consumer culture, gifting of gold contains a bundle of meanings that cannot be polarized into utilitarian or symbolic. Gold gifts serve multiple purposes simultaneously, and economic motives do not necessarily contradict with and jeopardize the social nature of gift-giving behavior. Gold coins and bracelets stand as ambiguous objects that maintain their commodity status and financial value and at the same time gain relational and symbolic value. The appeal of gold gifts lies in their ability to navigate between the economic and the social, without subordinating one to the other.

The instrumentation shows reasonably good measurement properties and the constructs are validated as a nomological network.A questionnaire-based empirical study is used to test this nomological network. Results confirm the double identity of the online consumer as a shopper and a computer user because both shopping enjoyment and perceived usefulness of the site strongly predict intention to return.

1608,a7d8c8f8e9c381b258ecbbec6c7a7c436f72372c,Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Virtual Reality in Pediatrics: Effects on Pain and Anxiety,"BACKGROUND: Medical procedures often evoke pain and anxiety in pediatric patients. Virtual reality (VR) is a relatively new intervention that can be used to provide distraction during, or to prepare patients for, medical procedures. This meta-analysis is the first to collate evidence on the effectiveness of VR on reducing pain and anxiety in pediatric patients undergoing medical procedures. METHODS: On April 25, 2018, we searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO with the keywords “VR,” “children,” and “adolescents.” Studies that applied VR in a somatic setting with participants ≤21 years of age were included. VR was defined as a fully immersive 3-dimensional environment displayed in surround stereoscopic vision on a head-mounted display (HMD). We evaluated pain and anxiety outcomes during medical procedures in VR and standard care conditions. RESULTS: We identified 2889 citations, of which 17 met our inclusion criteria. VR was applied as distraction (n = 16) during venous access, dental, burn, or oncological care or as exposure (n = 1) before elective surgery under general anesthesia. The effect of VR was mostly studied in patients receiving burn care (n = 6). The overall weighted standardized mean difference (SMD) for VR was 1.30 (95% CI, 0.68–1.91) on patient-reported pain (based on 14 studies) and 1.32 (95% CI, 0.21–2.44) on patient-reported anxiety (based on 7 studies). The effect of VR on pediatric pain was also significant when observed by caregivers (SMD = 2.08; 95% CI, 0.55–3.61) or professionals (SMD = 3.02; 95% CI, 0.79–2.25). For anxiety, limited observer data were available. CONCLUSIONS: VR research in pediatrics has mainly focused on distraction. Large effect sizes indicate that VR is an effective distraction intervention to reduce pain and anxiety in pediatric patients undergoing a wide variety of medical procedures. However, further research on the effect of VR exposure as a preparation tool for medical procedures is needed because of the paucity of research into this field.",2019.0,57.0,205.0,"{'volume': '129', 'pages': '1344 - 1353', 'name': 'Anesthesia and Analgesia'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Eijlers2019SystematicRA,\n author = {R.

Yet there exists a dearth of information on mental health issues concerning Filipino Americans, who represent a diverse mixture of culture, beliefs, and practices and vary widely from other minorities as well as from the larger population. This group has experienced emotional and behavioral challenges in acclimatizing to Western culture. Their historical underpinnings, native core values, and traditions exert a crucial influence on their mental well-being. Filipino Americans underutilize existing mental health care services that are culturally, socially, and linguistically incompatible with their needs. Along with stigma, the adherence of traditional practices and healing methods remains a formidable barrier to the appropriate provision of care. The authors review factors influencing perceptions of mental health and illness, including religion, family, support systems, coping styles, and indigenous culture-bound traits.

In the current clinical practice, the psychiatric diagnosis is made through clinician-administered rating scales and questionnaires, disregarding the potential contribution provided by physiological signs. The aim of this paper is to investigate how changes in the autonomic nervous system activity can be correlated with clinical mood swings. More specifically, a group of ten bipolar patients underwent an emotional elicitation protocol to investigate the autonomic nervous system dynamics, through the electrodermal activity (EDA), among different mood states. In addition, a control group of ten healthy subjects were recruited and underwent the same protocol. Physiological signals were analyzed by applying the deconvolutive method to reconstruct EDA tonic and phasic components, from which several significant features were extracted to quantify the sympathetic activation. Experimental results performed on both the healthy subjects and the bipolar patients supported the hypothesis of a relationship between autonomic dysfunctions and pathological mood states.",2014.0,43.0,86.0,"{'volume': '18', 'pages': '1865-1873', 'name': 'IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Greco2014ElectrodermalAI,\n author = {A.

A randomized controlled trial (n = 138) was conducted to test the effectiveness of a biofeedback video game (Dojo) for adolescents with elevated levels of anxiety. Adolescents (11–15 years old) were randomly assigned to play Dojo or a control game (Rayman 2: The Great Escape). Initial screening for anxiety was done on 1,347 adolescents in five high schools; only adolescents who scored above the “at-risk” cut-off on the Spence Children Anxiety Survey were eligible. Adolescents’ anxiety levels were assessed at pre-test, post-test, and at three month follow-up to examine the extent to which playing Dojo decreased adolescents’ anxiety. The present study revealed equal improvements in anxiety symptoms in both conditions at follow-up and no differences between Dojo and the closely matched control game condition. Latent growth curve models did reveal a steeper decrease of personalized anxiety symptoms (not of total anxiety symptoms) in the Dojo condition compared to the control condition. Moderation analyses did not show any differences in outcomes between boys and girls nor did age differentiate outcomes. The present results are of importance for prevention science, as this was the first full-scale randomized controlled trial testing indicated prevention effects of a video game aimed at reducing anxiety. Future research should carefully consider the choice of control condition and outcome measurements, address the potentially high impact of participants’ expectations, and take critical design issues into consideration, such as individual- versus group-based intervention and contamination issues.",2016.0,93.0,82.0,"{'volume': '11', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Scholten2016ARC,\n author = {H.

Syrian (Mesocricetus auratus) and dwarf (Phodopus sp.) hamsters are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the laboratory setting. However, pet shop-related COVID-19 outbreaks have not been reported. Methods We conducted an investigation of a pet shop-related COVID-19 outbreak due to Delta variant AY.127 involving at least three patients in Hong Kong. We tested samples collected from the patients, environment, and hamsters linked to this outbreak and performed whole genome sequencing analysis of the RT-PCR-positive samples. Results The patients included a pet shop keeper (Patient 1), a female customer of the pet shop (Patient 2), and the husband of Patient 2 (Patient 3). Investigation showed that 17.2% (5/29) and 25.5% (13/51) environmental specimens collected from the pet shop and its related warehouse, respectively, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR. Among euthanized hamsters randomly collected from the storehouse, 3% (3/100) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR and seropositive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody by ELISA. Whole genome analysis showed that although all genomes from the outbreak belonged to the Delta variant AY.127, there were at least 3 nucleotide differences among the genomes from different patients and the hamster cages. Genomic analysis suggests that multiple strains have emerged within the hamster population, and these different strains have likely transmitted to human either via direct contact or via the environment. Conclusions Our study demonstrated probable hamster-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. As pet trading is common around the world, this can represent a route of international spread of this pandemic virus.",2022.0,0.0,18.0,{'name': 'Clinical Infectious Diseases: An Official Publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Chan2022ProbableAT,\n author = {J.

To optimize online assessment of suicidal patients, there is a need for short, good-quality tools to assess elevated risk of future suicidal behavior. Computer adaptive testing (CAT) can be used to reduce response burden and improve accuracy, and make the available pencil-and-paper tools more appropriate for online administration. Objective The aim was to test whether an item response–based computer adaptive simulation can be used to reduce the length of the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS). Methods The data used for our simulation was obtained from a large multicenter trial from The Netherlands: the Professionals in Training to STOP suicide (PITSTOP suicide) study. We applied a principal components analysis (PCA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), a graded response model (GRM), and simulated a CAT. Results The scores of 505 patients were analyzed. Psychometric analyses showed the questionnaire to be unidimensional with good internal consistency. The computer adaptive simulation showed that for the estimation of elevation of risk of future suicidal behavior 4 items (instead of the full 19) were sufficient, on average. Conclusions This study demonstrated that CAT can be applied successfully to reduce the length of the Dutch version of the BSS. We argue that the use of CAT can improve the accuracy and the response burden when assessing the risk of future suicidal behavior online. Because CAT can be daunting for clinicians and applied scientists, we offer a concrete example of our computer adaptive simulation of the Dutch version of the BSS at the end of the paper.",2014.0,40.0,55.0,"{'volume': '16', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Beurs2014ApplyingCA,\n author = {D.

Self-efficacy beliefs strongly predicted mathematics performance for both cultural groups, but there were differences between the 2 groups in the sources of self-efficacy, the predictiveness of the secondary motivation variables, and the vertical dimensions of individualism and collectivism. It is argued that the Indo Canadian students are more vertical or hierarchical than the Anglo Canadian students and that comparison with others strongly influences their motivation beliefs and the formation of their efficacy beliefs. Self-efficacy in some cultures may be more other-oriented than is typically seen in Western cultures.

Our approach leverages state-of-the-art motion capture technology and advanced 3D scanning technology for facial performance acquisition. We start the process by recording 3D facial performances of an actor using a marker-based motion capture system and perform facial analysis on the captured data, thereby determining a minimal set of face scans required for accurate facial reconstruction. We introduce a two-step registration process to efficiently build dense consistent surface correspondences across all the face scans. We reconstruct high-fidelity 3D facial performances by combining motion capture data with the minimal set of face scans in the blendshape interpolation framework. We have evaluated the performance of our system on both real and synthetic data. Our results show that the system can capture facial performances that match both the spatial resolution of static face scans and the acquisition speed of motion capture systems.",2011.0,28.0,112.0,{'name': 'ACM SIGGRAPH 2011 papers'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Huang2011LeveragingMC,\n author = {Hao-Da Huang and Jinxiang Chai and Xin Tong and Hsiang-Tao Wu},\n journal = {ACM SIGGRAPH 2011 papers},\n title = {Leveraging motion capture and 3D scanning for high-fidelity facial performance acquisition},\n year = {2011}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '1777480', 'name': 'Hao-Da Huang'}, {'authorId': '1759700', 'name': 'Jinxiang Chai'}, {'authorId': '2241956709', 'name': 'Xin Tong'}, {'authorId': '1775992', 'name': 'Hsiang-Tao Wu'}]"

This gross mismatch can be alleviated by improving farmers' access to information and expert advice (e.g., knowing which seeds to sow and how to treat pests can significantly impact yield). In this paper, we report our experience of designing a conversational agent, called FarmChat, to meet the information needs of farmers in rural India. We conducted an evaluative study with 34 farmers near Ranchi in India, focusing on assessing the usability of the system, acceptability of the information provided, and understanding the user population's unique preferences, needs, and challenges in using the technology. We performed a comparative study with two different modalities: audio-only and audio+text. Our results provide a detailed understanding on how literacy level, digital literacy, and other factors impact users' preferences for the interaction modality. We found that a conversational agent has the potential to effectively meet the information needs of farmers at scale.

Along with the high-precision sensors and weapons they connect, networks are finding information power into military power. Defense investment priorities are shifting from mechanized platforms and weapons to the information collectors, processors, links and services that compose these networks. With its unmatched defense resources and technological talents, the United States has pioneered networked warfare. But the United States will have company not all of it friendly. For example, China and Al Qaeda, using very different doctrines, are showing interest in tapping the power of information.

Emotional labor was shown to play an important role for the health of teachers. In a full two-wave longitudinal study over the period of 1 year, the effect of emotional labor on emotional exhaustion and dedication of 102 teachers was investigated. Teachers who were able to influence their emotions to feel the emotion appropriate in a situation (so called deep acting) felt significantly less emotionally exhausted after 1 year. From this result, deep acting can, thus, be characterized as health-beneficial. Once teachers felt emotionally exhausted, they used more surface acting. More dedicated teachers, on the contrary, did neither engage more in deep acting nor in surface acting at Time 2. This indicates that those teachers who are dedicated to teaching seem less likely to act. To prevent emotional exhaustion of teachers, the development of interventions to promote health-beneficial emotional labor is necessary. This can be achieved by fostering deep acting, which reduces emotional exhaustion over longer periods of time.",2010.0,51.0,162.0,"{'volume': '15 4', 'pages': '\n          494-504\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of occupational health psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Philipp2010LongitudinalEO,\n author = {Anja Philipp and Heinz Schüpbach},\n journal = {Journal of occupational health psychology},\n pages = {\n          494-504\n        },\n title = {Longitudinal effects of emotional labour on emotional exhaustion and dedication of teachers.},\n volume = {15 4},\n year = {2010}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2075254519', 'name': 'Anja Philipp'}, {'authorId': '69555409', 'name': 'Heinz Schüpbach'}]"

In this opinion paper, we highlight the potential of combining two recently developed behavioural and neural training techniques (cognitive bias modification and functional magnetic neuroimaging-based neurofeedback) into a research approach that could help make the most of increased levels of plasticity during childhood and adolescence. We discuss how this powerful combination could be used to explore changing brain-behaviour relationships throughout development in the context of emotion processing, a cognitive domain that exhibits continuous development throughout the second decade of life. By targeting both behaviour and brain response, we would also be in an excellent position to define sensible time windows for enhancing plasticity, thereby allowing for targeted intervention approaches that can help improve emotion processing in both typically and atypically developing populations.",2013.0,63.0,56.0,"{'volume': '16 4', 'pages': '\n          574-83\n        ', 'name': 'Developmental science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kadosh2013PlasticityDC,\n author = {Kathrin Cohen Kadosh and D.

Although intravenous ketamine infusions can lift mood within hours, the current review describes how intranasal ketamine administration can have ultra-rapid antidepressant effects, beginning within minutes (5–40 minutes) and lasting hours, but with repeated treatments needed for sustained antidepressant actions. Research in rodents suggests that increased synaptogenesis in PFC may contribute to the prolonged benefit of ketamine administration, beginning hours after administration. However, these data cannot explain the relief that occurs within minutes of intranasal ketamine delivery. We hypothesize that the ultra-rapid effects of intranasal administration in humans may be due to ketamine blocking the NMDAR circuits that generate the emotional representations of pain (eg, Brodmann Areas 24 and 25, insular cortex), cortical areas that can be overactive in depression and which sit above the nasal epithelium. In contrast, NMDAR blockade in the dorsolateral PFC following systemic administration of ketamine may contribute to cognitive deficits. This novel view may help to explain how intravenous ketamine can treat the symptoms of depression yet worsen the symptoms of schizophrenia.",2015.0,84.0,25.0,"{'volume': '21', 'pages': '12 - 22', 'name': 'CNS Spectrums'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Opler2015AmelioratingTD,\n author = {L.

Yet, there remains a lack of clarity in the operationalization of this construct, and underlying mechanisms. Here, we provide an integrative theoretical framework and systems-based neurobiological model that explains the mechanisms by which mindfulness reduces biases related to self-processing and creates a sustainable healthy mind. Mindfulness is described through systematic mental training that develops meta-awareness (self-awareness), an ability to effectively modulate one's behavior (self-regulation), and a positive relationship between self and other that transcends self-focused needs and increases prosocial characteristics (self-transcendence). This framework of self-awareness, -regulation, and -transcendence (S-ART) illustrates a method for becoming aware of the conditions that cause (and remove) distortions or biases. The development of S-ART through meditation is proposed to modulate self-specifying and narrative self-networks through an integrative fronto-parietal control network. Relevant perceptual, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral neuropsychological processes are highlighted as supporting mechanisms for S-ART, including intention and motivation, attention regulation, emotion regulation, extinction and reconsolidation, prosociality, non-attachment, and decentering. The S-ART framework and neurobiological model is based on our growing understanding of the mechanisms for neurocognition, empirical literature, and through dismantling the specific meditation practices thought to cultivate mindfulness. The proposed framework will inform future research in the contemplative sciences and target specific areas for development in the treatment of psychological disorders.",2012.0,318.0,938.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vago2012SelfawarenessSA,\n author = {David R.

In sensory systems, divisive normalization seems to be a canonical neural computation, observed in areas ranging from retina to cortex and mediating processes including contrast adaptation, surround suppression, visual attention, and multisensory integration. Recent electrophysiological studies have extended these insights beyond the sensory domain, demonstrating an analogous algorithm for the value signals that guide decision making, but the effects of normalization on choice behavior are unknown. Here, we show that choice models using normalization generate significant (and classically irrational) choice phenomena driven by either the value or number of alternative options. In value-guided choice experiments, both monkey and human choosers show novel context-dependent behavior consistent with normalization. These findings suggest that the neural mechanism of value coding critically influences stochastic choice behavior and provide a generalizable quantitative framework for examining context effects in decision making.",2013.0,52.0,254.0,"{'volume': '110', 'pages': '6139 - 6144', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Louie2013NormalizationIA,\n author = {K.

Emotion was measured by self-report questionnaires based on a three-dimensional model (pleasantness, tense arousal and energetic arousal) and presence was measured using four items (Sense of physical space, Engagement, Ecological Validity and Negative Effects). Participants experienced a significant increase in pleasantness and all dimensions of presence in VR compared to the desktop condition. Ratings of felt arousal and perceived emotions did not significantly differ between conditions. The “engagement” component of presence was positively correlated with emotion felt and perceived, whereas “ecological validity” and “sense of physical space” were related to emotions experienced in the desktop condition only.

To address this issue, brain activation was measured in normal male subjects while they either responded in a normal manner to erotic film excerpts or voluntarily attempted to inhibit the sexual arousal induced by viewing erotic stimuli. Results demonstrated that the sexual arousal experienced, in response to the erotic film excerpts, was associated with activation in ""limbic"" and paralimbic structures, such as the right amygdala, right anterior temporal pole, and hypothalamus. In addition, the attempted inhibition of the sexual arousal generated by viewing the erotic stimuli was associated with activation of the right superior frontal gyrus and right anterior cingulate gyrus. No activation was found in limbic areas. These findings reinforce the view that emotional self-regulation is normally implemented by a neural circuit comprising various prefrontal regions and subcortical limbic structures.

The current study tested whether emotion dysregulation, assessed by the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), would predict posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) through anxiety sensitivity (AS). Alternate cognitive-affective mediators (i.e., distress tolerance and intolerance of uncertainty) were explored.


METHOD
A total of 259 trauma-exposed community members (ages averaging 37.39; evenly distributed by gender) from a larger clinical trial targeting suicide risk factors completed a clinical interview and self-report questionnaires at baseline, Week-3, and 1-month follow-up appointments.


RESULTS
AS at Week 3 significantly mediated the relationship between initial emotion dysregulation and 1-month follow-up posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) after controlling for condition and baseline symptoms (β = .07; standard error = 0.03; 95% confidence interval = [0.01, 0.14]). Effects held for one out of six emotion dysregulation subscales. Distress tolerance and intolerance of uncertainty were not significant mediators (ps > .05).

This study demonstrates that emotion dysregulation may confer maintenance of PTSS through AS.

Over the same period, the CAF strengthened its mental health system. This article explores the effect of these events on the prevalence of past-year mental disorders over the period 2002-2013. Method: The data sources were 2 highly comparable population-based mental health surveys of CAF Regular Force personnel done in 2002 and 2013 (n = 5155 and 6996, respectively). Data were collected via in-person interviews with Statistics Canada personnel using the World Health Organization’s Composite International Diagnostic Interview to assess past-year disorders. Results: In 2013, 16.5% had 1 or more of the 6 past-year disorders assessed in the survey, with the most common conditions being major depressive episode (MDE), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), which affected 8.0%, 5.3%, and 4.7%, respectively. The prevalence of PTSD, GAD, and panic disorder has increased significantly since 2002 (adjusted odds ratios from logistic regression models = 2.1, 3.0, and 1.9, respectively), while no change was seen for MDE. The comorbidity of mood and anxiety disorders increased significantly over time, being seen in 27.4% and 41.0% of those with mental disorders in 2002 and 2013, respectively.

In a combined positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging study of mood disorders, we demonstrated that the mean gray matter volume of this “subgenual” ACC (sgACC) cortex is abnormally reduced in subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder, irrespective of mood state. Neuropathological assessments of sgACC tissue acquired postmortem from subjects with MDD or bipolar disorder confirmed the decrement in gray matter volume, and revealed that this abnormality was associated with a reduction in glia, with no equivalent loss of neurons. In positron emission tomography studies, the metabolic activity was elevated in this region in the depressed relative to the remitted phases of the same MDD subjects, and effective antidepressant treatment was associated with a reduction in sgACC activity. Other laboratories replicated and extended these findings, and the clinical importance of this treatment effect was underscored by a study showing that deep brain stimulation of the sgACC ameliorates depressive symptoms in treatment-resistant MDD. This article discusses the functional significance of these findings within the context of the preclinical literature that implicates the putative homologue of this region in the regulation of emotional behavior and stress response. In experimental animals, this region participates in an extended “visceromotor network” of structures that modulates autonomic/neuroendocrine responses and neurotransmitter transmission during the neural processing of reward, fear, and stress. These data thus hold important implications for the development of neural models of depression that can account for the abnormal motivational, neuroendocrine, autonomic, and emotional manifestations evident in human mood disorders.",2008.0,115.0,945.0,"{'volume': '13', 'pages': '663 - 681', 'name': 'CNS Spectrums'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Drevets2008TheSA,\n author = {W.

But what exactly do people seek when they seek emotions? What kinds of gratifications do they obtain from the experience of emotions during media use? An overview of research on emotional gratifications shows that emotions can be gratifying in multiple ways – ranging from simple hedonistic gratifications to more complex gratifications such as feeling competent or morally good. An integrative framework is outlined that aims at a more systematic understanding of emotional gratifications and their influence on selective media use. We suggest that different aspects of an emotion's gratification potential are appraised simultaneously, and integrated into a holistic appraisal outcome that can be conceptualized as ‘meta-emotion’. Meta-emotions guide the recipient's intuitive decision to accept, or reject a media offer's invitation to experience emotions.",2006.0,53.0,46.0,"{'volume': '31', 'pages': '261 - 278'}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Bartsch2006EmotionalGD,\n author = {Anne Bartsch and Roland Mangold and R.

Although the symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in the general and military population seem very similar, combat-related PTSD (cr-PTSD) is typically thought to be more severe due to the repeated and prolonged exposure of traumatic events. Therapeutic adherence is reported a problem in military populations compromising treatment efficacy. Therefore, a new potential supplementary treatment is specially designed for patients with cr-PTSD. This intervention is called Military Motion Memory Desensitization and Reprocessing (3MDR). The treatment incorporates key elements of successful treatments as Virtual Reality Exposure (VRE) and Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing (EMDR) and adds motion to the condition. We aimed at designing a treatment procedure that preserved dual task processing principle, yet introduced new engagement by performing the desensitization during motion by to walking on a treadmill. Moreover, we aimed at exposure to real high-affect pictures of deployment setting. Subjects walk a repetitive cycle while walking and viewing high affect pictures of deployment scenes. Dual task processing was maintained by an oscillating ball. Aspects of presence are adhered to, to maximize possible positive outcome.


METHOD
Two veterans with chronic PTSD, received four weekly sessions of 3MDR therapy. The indicator of effectiveness was difference in CAPS (Clinical Administrated PTSD Scale)-score. The treatment was designed on the Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment (CAREN) facility.


RESULTS
The 3MDR treatment did further decrease PTSD symptoms. Patients were highly satisfied about the treatment and had no attention to drop out.


CONCLUSION
The results of the two cases suggest that the 3MDR treatment is a successful, more additional treatment that goes further into the patients affect where other treatment may stagnate. The presence was highly appreciated. Further research with more patients needs to be performed to obtain more reliable results.",2013.0,0.0,24.0,"{'volume': '191', 'pages': '\n          125-7\n        ', 'name': 'Studies in health technology and informatics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vermetten2013TheEO,\n author = {E.

People with intellectual disability or borderline intellectual functioning may have poorer mental health than their peers. The present authors sought to (i) estimate the risk of poorer mental health among British adults with and without intellectual impairments and (ii) estimate the extent to which any between-group differences in mental health may reflect between-group differences in rates of exposure to common social determinants of poorer health.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The present authors undertook secondary analysis of confidentialized unit records collected in Wave 3 of Understanding Society.


RESULTS
British adults with intellectual impairments living in general households are at significantly increased risk of potential mental health problems than their non-disabled peers (e.g. GHQ Caseness OR = 1.77, 95% CI (1.25-2.52), P < 0.001). Adjusting for between-group differences in age, gender and indicators of socio-economic position eliminated this increased risk [GHQ Caseness adjusted OR = 1.06, 95% CI (0.73-1.52), n.s].


CONCLUSIONS
Our analyses are consistent with the hypothesis that the increased risk of poor mental health among people with intellectual impairments may be attributable to their poorer living conditions rather than their intellectual impairments per se. Greater attention should be given to understanding and addressing the impact of exposure to common social determinants of mental health among marginalized or vulnerable groups.",2017.0,45.0,22.0,"{'volume': '30', 'pages': '188–197', 'name': 'Journal of Applied Research in Intellectual Disabilities'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hatton2017TheMH,\n author = {C.

It has been suggested that one reason why obese children stop exercising is the perception of bodily sensations. In a counterbalanced design, a total of 109 children (33 overweight, 10-15 years old) were asked to walk twice for 6 minutes on a treadmill under one of two conditions: (a) traditional condition (TC)-focusing their attention on their physical feelings and sensations or (b) distraction condition (DC)-focusing their attention on a virtual environment. Attentional focus during exercise, bad-good feeling states (pre- and postexperimental), perceived exertion (3 minutes and post), heart rate, and enjoyment were assessed. Results indicated that overweight children focused on internal information under the TC, but they significantly shifted their attention to regard the external environment in the DC. This attentional distraction effect of VR was more intense in overweight than in normal-weight children. No differences between groups were found when examining changes in feeling states and perceived exertion. VR increased enjoyment during exercise, and children preferred exercise using virtual environments. VR is useful to promote distraction and may help overweight and obese children to enjoy exercise.",2016.0,0.0,49.0,"{'volume': '19 2', 'pages': '\n          115-9\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Baños2016UsingVR,\n author = {R.

One perennial challenge is that the magnitude of the task-evoked pupil response diminishes over the course of an experiment, a phenomenon we refer to as a fatigue effect. Reducing fatigue effects may improve sensitivity to task effects and reduce the likelihood of confounds due to systematic physiological changes over time. In this paper, we investigated the degree to which fatigue effects could be ameliorated by experimenter intervention. In Experiment 1, we assigned participants to one of three groups-no breaks, kinetic breaks (playing with toys, but no social interaction), or chatting with a research assistant-and compared the pupil response across conditions. In Experiment 2, we additionally tested the effect of researcher observation. Only breaks including social interaction significantly reduced the fatigue of the pupil response across trials. However, in all conditions we found robust evidence for fatigue effects: that is, regardless of protocol, the task-evoked pupil response was substantially diminished (at least 60%) over the duration of the experiment. We account for the variance of fatigue effects in our pupillometry data using multiple common statistical modeling approaches (e.g., linear mixed-effects models of peak, mean, and baseline pupil diameters, as well as growth curve models of time-course data). We conclude that pupil attenuation is a predictable phenomenon that should be accommodated in our experimental designs and statistical models.",2023.0,18.0,4.0,"{'pages': '\n          e14256\n        ', 'name': 'Psychophysiology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{McLaughlin2023GiveMA,\n author = {Drew J.

Virtual reality (VR) reminiscence was reported to improve anxiety, apathy, and cognitive function immediately after intervention in individuals at residential aged care facilities. However, its effect on elderly patients with dementia and how long this effect could last remain unknown. Objective The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of immersive VR reminiscence in people with dementia both immediately after and 3-6 months after intervention. Methods A pilot study was conducted in 2 dementia care units. VR reminiscence therapy sessions were conducted twice per week for a 3-month period. Cognitive function, global status, depressive symptoms, and caregiver burden were assessed before and immediately after VR intervention in 20 participants. Subsequently, 7 participants were reassessed 3-6 months after the VR intervention. Wilcoxon sign-rank test was used for statistical comparisons of the changes. Results There were no significant changes in cognitive function, global status, and caregiver burden immediately after the VR intervention, but there was a significant reduction in depressive symptoms (P=.008). Moreover, compared with the cognitive function immediately after VR, it kept declining 3-6 months after.

On the basis of a new process conception of emotion regulation, we hypothesized that in low-intensity negative situations, people would show a relative preference to choose to regulate emotions by engagement reappraisal, which allows emotional processing. However, we expected people in high-intensity negative situations to show a relative preference to choose to regulate emotions by disengagement distraction, which blocks emotional processing at an early stage before it gathers force. In three experiments, we created emotional contexts that varied in intensity, using either emotional pictures (Experiments 1 and 2) or unpredictable electric stimulation (Experiment 3). In response to these emotional contexts, participants chose between using either reappraisal or distraction as an emotion-regulation strategy. Results in all experiments supported our hypothesis. This pattern in the choice of emotion-regulation strategies has important implications for the understanding of healthy adaptation.",2011.0,25.0,1089.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '1391 - 1396', 'name': 'Psychological Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sheppes2011EmotionRegulationC,\n author = {G.

1693,b0a32fe8881ed6f7cf6e5344464f28521323ccd4,On the Varieties of People’s Relationships With Places,"Numerous studies show that place attachment correlates positively with age, length of residence and strength of local ties and negatively with community size, education, and economic development of the region of residence. Does that mean that along with education, mobility, economic development and urbanization and with the decrease in importance of local ties and territorial belonging, place attachment will wane? In a large representative survey carried out in Poland (N = 2,556) new measures of relationships with place and of identity (both territorial and nonterritorial) were used. Cluster analysis revealed five clusters: two types of place attachment (traditional and active attachment) and three types of nonattachment (alienation, place relativity, and placelessness), corresponding to David Hummon’s five types of sense of community. Whereas correlates of traditional attachment replicated the pattern known from other studies (e.g., traditional attachment was strongly positively correlated with age and negatively with education), active attachment was related positively to education and curvilinearly to age, with middle-aged participants the most frequently represented. Traditional place attachment was based solely on local identity, active place attachment was associated with European and nonterritorial identity, along with the local attachment. A number of other measures differentiated the five types: values, measures of social and cultural capital, self- and group-continuity measures, and general life satisfaction. It is concluded that places do preserve their importance in times of intensive urbanization, migration, and economic development, but that the form of place attachment changes: the active- and self-conscious attachment replaces the traditional attachment.",2011.0,50.0,179.0,"{'volume': '43', 'pages': '676 - 709', 'name': 'Environment and Behavior'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lewicka2011OnTV,\n author = {M.

In this paper, we explore how emotive Virtual Reality (VR) content can also cause pupil dilation. VR has been shown to be able to evoke negative and positive arousal in users when they are immersed in different virtual scenes. In our research, VR scenes were used as emotional triggers. Five emotional VR scenes were designed in our study and each scene had five emotion segments; happiness, fear, anxiety, sadness, and disgust. When participants experienced the VR scenes, their pupil dilation and the brightness in the headset were captured. We found that both the negative and positive emotion segments produced pupil dilation in the VR environments. We also explored the effect of showing heart beat cues to the users, and if this could cause difference in pupil dilation. In our study, three different heart beat cues were shown to users using a combination of three channels; haptic, audio, and visual. The results showed that the haptic-visual cue caused the most significant pupil dilation change from the baseline.

1697,b0dfdb9a4ff0b013beddc4874fc3d9e1fb68b6e5,A Serious Videogame as an Additional Therapy Tool for Training Emotional Regulation and Impulsivity Control in Severe Gambling Disorder,"Background: Gambling disorder (GD) is characterized by a significant lack of self-control and is associated with impulsivity-related personality traits. It is also linked to deficits in emotional regulation and frequently co-occurs with anxiety and depression symptoms. There is also evidence that emotional dysregulation may play a mediatory role between GD and psychopathological symptomatology. Few studies have reported the outcomes of psychological interventions that specifically address these underlying processes. Objectives: To assess the utility of the Playmancer platform, a serious video game, as an additional therapy tool in a CBT intervention for GD, and to estimate pre-post changes in measures of impulsivity, anger expression and psychopathological symptomatology. Method: The sample comprised a single group of 16 male treatment-seeking individuals with severe GD diagnosis. Therapy intervention consisted of 16 group weekly CBT sessions and, concurrently, 10 additional weekly sessions of a serious video game. Pre-post treatment scores on South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), I7 Impulsiveness Questionnaire (I7), State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory 2 (STAXI-2), Symptom Checklist-Revised (SCL-90-R), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S-T), and Novelty Seeking from the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R) were compared. Results: After the intervention, significant changes were observed in several measures of impulsivity, anger expression and other psychopathological symptoms. Dropout and relapse rates during treatment were similar to those described in the literature for CBT. Conclusion: Complementing CBT interventions for GD with a specific therapy approach like a serious video game might be helpful in addressing certain underlying factors which are usually difficult to change, including impulsivity and anger expression.",2015.0,115.0,67.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tarrega2015ASV,\n author = {S.

Load sharing varies by physical closeness and relationship quality. We investigated the effect of load sharing on emotional arousal via galvanic skin response, an indicator of sympathetic nervous system arousal, during a social stressor. Social stress was elicited in 66 adolescent girls (Mage = 15 years) using a spontaneous public-speaking task. Mother-daughter dyads reported their relationship quality, and physical closeness was manipulated by having mothers either touch or not touch their daughter's hand during the performance. We found evidence of load sharing among dyads who held hands, independent of relationship quality. However, without physical contact, load sharing was only evident among dyads with higher relationship quality. Thus, high relationship quality buffers against threat in a similar way to the physical comfort of a loved one.",2016.0,52.0,34.0,"{'volume': '16 1', 'pages': '\n          83-93\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lougheed2016SharingTB,\n author = {Jessica P.

Willingness to sacrifice was associated with strong commitment, high satisfaction, poor alternatives, and high investments; feelings of commitment largely mediated the associations of these variables with willingness to sacrifice. Moreover, willingness to sacrifice was associated with superior couple functioning, operationalized in terms of level of dyadic adjustment and probability of couple persistence. In predicting adjustment, willingness to sacrifice accounted for significant variance beyond commitment, partially mediating the link between commitment and adjustment; such mediation was not significant for persistence.",1997.0,71.0,691.0,"{'volume': '72 6', 'pages': '\n          1373-95\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lange1997WillingnessTS,\n author = {P.

It will not be long before governments begin to establish policies and regulations regarding the income generated by players of these game environments. This paper examines the issue of taxes in virtual world games. Two alternative places for recognizing income could be established by regulators: 1) at the point when in-game transactions take place; or 2) when players convert game assets into real-world currency. We argue for realization of income, and therefore taxation, at the exchange. We expect that burdensome policies such as requiring game operators to monitor and report taxable activities to the authorities will dissuade game play and likely result in the collapse of these vibrant economies.

Objectives: To develop and evaluate a synchronous online training program on emotional intelligence (EI) for the caregivers of adult patients with cognitive-behavioral impairment due to ABI. Methods: Quasi-experimental study. Ten caregivers attended a one-month virtual synchronous course about EI. The emotional status of the caregivers was registered one-month-previous and one-month-post program using comparative measures: The Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), Caregiver Burden Interview, the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and the Emotional Health Survey. Results: After the training course, the favorable changes related to emotional affect measured with the PANAS questionnaire were found; both positive (increase; Mdn = 39.5; effect size −12.79; adjusted variance 95.75) and negative (decrease; Mdn = 14.5; effect size 0.73; adjusted variance 95.50) presented a statistical significance of p < 0.05. The TMMS-24 post-test showed that 90% of the caregivers reported an adequate or excellent emotional repair (p < 0.05; effect size −0.68; adjusted variance 94.75). No other significant differences were found. Conclusions: After this training in EI, the caregivers had a more positive mood and improved aspects of their emotional intelligence, such as emotional regulation.

Specifically, this study investigates how specific emotions (anger, disappointment or regret, worry) influence consumers' behavioral intentions. To gain a richer understanding of consumers' coping behaviors, the authors examine customers' locus of failure attributions. By using a 3 × 2 factorial between-subjects design, three attribution types (internal, external, and control condition) are matched with two service recovery outcomes (positive and negative). Findings suggest that customers with feelings of anger and disappointment or regret are likely to engage in various dissatisfaction responses (e.g., direct complaining, negative word-of-mouth, and switching), whereas worried customers are not. Attributing the failure to internal or external causes reduce switching and negative word-of-mouth intentions. Finally, the study results indicate that feelings of anger spill over to postrecovery satisfaction.",2008.0,62.0,206.0,"{'volume': '32', 'pages': '107 - 89', 'name': 'Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mattila2008DiscreteNE,\n author = {A.

In the Greater China area, the purchase and donation of virtual gifts have created a unique ecological system where streamers benefit from splitting earnings with the platforms. This study aims to explore viewers’ motivation to participate in such systems. The concept of parasocial relationships is employed to examine the relationships between these viewers and streamers, whereas social presence theory is used to examine the relationships among viewers. The results of an online survey confirm that social presence moderates the relationships between parasocial relationships and other constructs. Meanwhile, constructs such as enjoyment, loyalty, and trust positively influence the virtual gift donation intention. The findings have both theoretical and practical implications.",2021.0,77.0,11.0,"{'volume': '7', 'pages': '173 - 188', 'name': 'Communication Research and Practice'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lin2021VirtualGD,\n author = {L.

1716,b35ef05cf12c8980684eb7e1d63452d3a5ffbb13,Bystander Responses to a Violent Incident in an Immersive Virtual Environment,"Under what conditions will a bystander intervene to try to stop a violent attack by one person on another? It is generally believed that the greater the size of the crowd of bystanders, the less the chance that any of them will intervene. A complementary model is that social identity is critical as an explanatory variable. For example, when the bystander shares common social identity with the victim the probability of intervention is enhanced, other things being equal. However, it is generally not possible to study such hypotheses experimentally for practical and ethical reasons. Here we show that an experiment that depicts a violent incident at life-size in immersive virtual reality lends support to the social identity explanation. 40 male supporters of Arsenal Football Club in England were recruited for a two-factor between-groups experiment: the victim was either an Arsenal supporter or not (in-group/out-group), and looked towards the participant for help or not during the confrontation. The response variables were the numbers of verbal and physical interventions by the participant during the violent argument. The number of physical interventions had a significantly greater mean in the in-group condition compared to the out-group. The more that participants perceived that the Victim was looking to them for help the greater the number of interventions in the in-group but not in the out-group. These results are supported by standard statistical analysis of variance, with more detailed findings obtained by a symbolic regression procedure based on genetic programming. Verbal interventions made during their experience, and analysis of post-experiment interview data suggest that in-group members were more prone to confrontational intervention compared to the out-group who were more prone to make statements to try to diffuse the situation.",2013.0,41.0,152.0,"{'volume': '8', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Slater2013BystanderRT,\n author = {M.

The overall purpose of the present paper was to bring some clarity to this concept by critically examining how it has been presented in the literature and by proposing both rationally and empirically derived typologies for organizing social support functions. From a review of prominent discussions of support functions, a rational typology was proposed that included six categories: Material Aid, Behavioral Assistance, Intimate Interaction, Feedback, and Positive Social Interaction. To empirically examine the structure of social support, a factor analysis was conducted on items from a scale of socially supportive behaviors. The four factors that subsequently emerged were labeled Directive Guidance, Non-directive Support, Positive Social Interaction, and Tangible Assistance. Application of these findings to the assessment of support and future research on support/well-being relationships were discussed.",1983.0,25.0,568.0,"{'volume': '11 2', 'pages': '\n          133-43\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of community psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Barrera1983TheSO,\n author = {M.

Despite the importance of social networks for health and well-being, relatively little is known about the ways in which adults with intellectual disabilities in the U.K. experience their social networks.


METHOD
A systematic review was completed to identify research focused on the social networks of adults with intellectual disabilities. Studies published from 1990 to 2019 were identified. Studies were thematically analysed.


RESULTS
Quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods studies were analysed to identify key factors influencing social networks. Experiences of people with intellectual disabilities identified themes of identity, powerlessness, inclusion, family and support. These themes are discussed with reference to theories of stigma and normalisation.


CONCLUSIONS
Stigma and normalisation can be used to better understand the needs, desires and dreams of people with intellectual disabilities for ordinary relationships, from which they are regularly excluded.

HR and LR subjects received noncontingent success feedback, failure feedback, or no feedback on a task that ostensibly assessed ""therapeutic abilities."" Subjects were subsequently tested on insolvable puzzles (Experiment 1) or on solvable anagrams (Experiment 2). According to Kanfer and Hagerman's (1981) self-regulation model, self-regulatory activities are evoked primarily in situations in which subjects are faced with repeated failure. Hence we predicted that individual differences in self-control would influence performance on the insolvable puzzles and not anagram performance after exposure to noncontingent failure. This prediction was confirmed: Only the performance of LR subjects on the insolvable puzzles was debilitated by the helplessness induction, whereas HR and LR subjects showed equal helplessness-induced deficits on the anagrams. The latter finding was interpreted in terms of the learned-helplessness model without the mediating effects of self-regulatory processes. As predicted from the self-control model, HR subjects more frequently checked statements indicating positive self-evaluations and task-oriented thoughts and less frequently checked negative self-evaluations than did LR subjects during exposure to uncontrollability in both experiments. We concluded that the self-control model accounts best for subjects' self-reactions during exposure to uncontrollability or failure, whereas the learned-helplessness model accounts for the generalization of helplessness from uncontrollable situations to controllable ones.",1985.0,41.0,127.0,"{'volume': '48 1', 'pages': '\n          198-215\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rosenbaum1985LearnedHA,\n author = {M.

In the survey, respondents are required to rate source credibility by applying items gathered from previous studies. To overcome inconsistencies and weaknesses of previous factor model studies, a rigorous analysis of the source credibility concept based on an extraction of a series of measurements is performed. Furthermore, an analysis procedure with various steps in order to ensure reliability and validity is applied to the data. The selected procedure led to a consistent and integrative solution of three highly discriminant main dimensions of source credibility in marketing communication. The three dimensions can be referred to as the inclination toward truth, the potential of truth and the presentation. Findings are discussed and methodological, theoretical and managerial implications are highlighted.",2006.0,98.0,177.0,"{'volume': '10', 'pages': '1-33', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Eisend2006SourceCD,\n author = {M.

Lots of countries had closed their schools. As the first country to do so, Chinese colleges and universities were making use of different modes of learning, including online-learning based on different platforms to achieve the goal suggested by Ministry of Education in China, “suspending classes without suspending learning,” since middle February. This paper is the first one which aims to investigate the anxiety of Chinese university students after the outbreak of COVID-19 right before the start of new spring term. 3611 university students (female: male = 1.48:1) aged between 18 to 24 from all over China were enrolled to this study from a top university in China. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale – SAS (Zung, 1971) was used to assess anxiety 2 days before the start of new spring term in middle February. All four-year undergraduate students were included in the study. The mean SAS score was 40.53 (SD = 10.15), significantly higher than the national norm (Mean = 29.78, SD = 10.07, and p ≤ .001), and there were still 557 (15.43%, Mean = 58.75, and SD = 8.9) students met the cutoff of 50 and were screened positive. Comparisons among sexes, grades and majors were also conducted. Significant differences were found between all males and all female (p ≤ .001), and between all students majoring arts and sciences in the anxiety sample (n = 557, p = 0.05). The results also showed that the mean SAS scores were not correlated with the regions they came from/lived in.

1736,b5b6d87f663fcc56cd7319ea49d6baaa653ecaae,Facial expression and emotion,"Zusammenfassung Die menschliche Mimik ist einzigartig in ihrer Fähigkeit unseren Emotionen Ausdruck zu verleihen und diese anderen Menschen zu übermitteln. Die mimische Expression grundlegender Emotionen ist über verschiedene Kulturen hinweg sehr ähnlich und du weist auch Gemeinsamkeiten zu anderen Säugetieren auf. Dies deutet auf einen gemeinsamen genetischen Ursprung des Zusammenhangs von Mimik und Emotion. Neuere Untersuchungen zeigen aber auch kulturelle Einflüsse und Unterschiede. Die Erkennung von Emotionen aus der Mimik und auch der Prozess des mimischen Ausdrucks der eigenen Emotionen erfolgt in einem äußerst komplexen zerebralen Netzwerk. Aufgrund der Komplexität des zerebralen Verarbeitungssystems gibt es eine Vielzahl von neurologischen und psychiatrischen Erkrankungen, welche die Kopplung von Mimik und Emotionen erheblich stören können. Auch durch das Tragen von Masken wird unsere Fähigkeit zur Übermittlung und zum Erkennen von Emotionen über die Mimik eingeschränkt. Durch die Mimik lassen sich aber nicht nur „echte“ Emotionen ausdrücken, sondern auch gespielte. Damit eröffnet die Mimik die Möglichkeit sozial erwünschten Ausdruck vorzuspielen und auch Emotionen bewusst vorzutäuschen. Diese Täuschungen sind jedoch zumeist nicht perfekt und können von kurzfristigen Gesichtsbewegungen begleitet sein, die auf die tatsächlich vorhandenen Emotionen hinweisen (Mikroexpressionen). Diese Mikroexpressionen sind von nur sehr kurzer Dauer und vom Menschen häufig kaum wahrnehmbar, jedoch das ideale Anwendungsgebiet für computergestützte Analysen. Diese automatische Identifikation von Mikroexpressionen hat in den letzten Jahren nicht nur wissenschaftliche Aufmerksamkeit erfahren, sondern ihr Einsatz wird auch in sicherheitsrelevanten Bereichen getestet. Der vorliegende Artikel fasst den aktuellen Wissensstand von Mimik und Emotionen zusammen. ABSTRACT Human facial expressions are unique in their ability to express our emotions and communicate them to others. The mimic expression of basic emotions is very similar across different cultures and has also many features in common with other mammals. This suggests a common genetic origin of the association between facial expressions and emotion. However, recent studies also show cultural influences and differences. The recognition of emotions from facial expressions, as well as the process of expressing one’s emotions facially, occurs within an extremely complex cerebral network. Due to the complexity of the cerebral processing system, there are a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders that can significantly disrupt the coupling of facial expressions and emotions. Wearing masks also limits our ability to convey and recognize emotions through facial expressions. Through facial expressions, however, not only “real” emotions can be expressed, but also acted ones. Thus, facial expressions open up the possibility of faking socially desired expressions and also of consciously faking emotions. However, these pretenses are mostly imperfect and can be accompanied by short-term facial movements that indicate the emotions that are actually present (microexpressions). These microexpressions are of very short duration and often barely perceptible by humans, but they are the ideal application area for computer-aided analysis. This automatic identification of microexpressions has not only received scientific attention in recent years, but its use is also being tested in security-related areas. This article summarizes the current state of knowledge of facial expressions and emotions.",2023.0,131.0,1374.0,"{'volume': '102', 'pages': 'S115 - S125', 'name': 'Laryngo- Rhino- Otologie'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Klingner2023FacialEA,\n author = {C.

Annotating stress for reliable PTSD profiling,"In this paper we profile the stress responses of patients diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to individual events in the game-based PTSD stress inoculation and exposure virtual environment StartleMart. Thirteen veterans suffering from PTSD play the game while we record their skin conductance. Game logs are used to identify individual events, and continuous decomposition analysis is applied to the skin conductance signals to derive event-related stress responses. The extracted skin conductance features from this analysis are used to profile each individual player in terms of stress response. We observe a large degree of variation across the 13 veterans which further validates the idiosyncratic nature of PTSD physiological manifestations. Further to game data and skin conductance signals we ask PTSD patients to indicate the most stressful event experienced (class-based annotation) and also compare the stress level of all events in a pairwise preference manner (rank-based annotation). We compare the two annotation stress schemes by correlating the self-reports to individual event-based stress manifestations. The self-reports collected through class-based annotation exhibit no correlation to physiological responses, whereas, the pairwise preferences yield significant correlations to all skin conductance features extracted via continuous decomposition analysis. The core findings of the paper suggest that reporting of stress preferences across events yields more reliable data that capture aspects of the stress experienced and that features extracted from skin conductance via continuous decomposition analysis offer appropriate predictors of stress manifestation across PTSD patients.",2015.0,28.0,21.0,"{'pages': '719-725', 'name': '2015 International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Holmgård2015ToRO,\n author = {Christoffer Holmgård and Georgios N.

1739,b5cb222136331144f47c4fbb8e2d7de8da612804,Emotional intelligence predicts academic performance: A meta-analysis.,"Schools and universities devote considerable time and resources to developing students' social and emotional skills, such as emotional intelligence (EI). The goals of such programs are partly for personal development but partly to increase academic performance. The current meta-analysis examines the degree to which student EI is associated with academic performance. We found an overall effect of ρ = .20 using robust variance estimation (N = 42,529, k = 1,246 from 158 citations). The association is significantly stronger for ability EI (ρ = .24, k = 50) compared with self-rated (ρ = .12, k = 33) or mixed EI (ρ = .19, k = 90). Ability, self-rated, and mixed EI explained an additional 1.7%, 0.7%, and 2.3% of the variance, respectively, after controlling for intelligence and big five personality. Understanding and management branches of ability EI explained an additional 3.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Relative importance analysis suggests that EI is the third most important predictor for all three streams, after intelligence and conscientiousness. Moderators of the effect differed across the three EI streams. Ability EI was a stronger predictor of performance in humanities than science. Self-rated EI was a stronger predictor of grades than standardized test scores. We propose that three mechanisms underlie the EI/academic performance link: (a) regulating academic emotions, (b) building social relationships at school, and (c) academic content overlap with EI. Different streams of EI may affect performance through different mechanisms. We note some limitations, including the lack of evidence for a causal direction.

The forthcoming mental health crisis has opened the debate about the need to broaden the therapeutic horizons with the implementation of digitally assisted mindfulness practices within psychotherapeutic interventions. Mindfulness training is developing into a promising intervention for a variety of health problems and a booster of well-being. At the same time, virtual reality (VR) and especially immersive technologies are increasingly being used as assistive tools in the training of people with special education needs and disabilities (SEND). Μeta-competences refer to a set of self-development skills that incorporate meta-cognitive and meta-emotional attributes, enabling individuals to be self-conscious, self-regulated, and flexible in every aspect of human life. The current review aims to investigate (i) the efficacy of mindfulness strategies in meta-competence training for SEND and (ii) the role of VR as an assistive technology in mindfulness training. The PRISMA 2020 methodology was utilized to respond to the objectives and research questions. The database search provided 1380 records, and 29 studies met the inclusion criteria. The results showed that mindfulness training has the potential to train meta-cognitive and meta-emotional competences among people with different mental disorders, including Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Intellectual Disability (ID), Depressive Disorder, Stress Disorder, and Specific Learning Disorder. VR was found to be an effective assistive technology, providing significant advantages compared to conventional mindfulness interventions.

Well-crafted questions lead to new insights, generate discussion, and promote the comprehensive exploration of subject matter. Poorly constructed questions can stifle learning by creating confusion, intimidating students, and limiting creative thinking. Teachers most often ask lower-order, convergent questions that rely on students’ factual recall of prior knowledge rather than asking higher-order, divergent questions that promote deep thinking, requiring students to analyze and evaluate concepts. This review summarizes the taxonomy of questions, provides strategies for formulating effective questions, and explores practical considerations to enhance student engagement and promote critical thinking.

For instance, little is known about the extent and processes through which mindfulness practice improves emotion regulation. This experience sampling study assessed the relationship between mindfulness, emotion differentiation, emotion lability, and emotional difficulties. Young adult participants reported their current emotional experiences 6 times per day during 1 week on a PalmPilot device. Based on these reports of emotions, indices of emotional differentiation and emotion lability were composed for negative and positive emotions. Mindfulness was associated with greater emotion differentiation and less emotional difficulties (i.e., emotion lability and self-reported emotion dysregulation). Mediational models indicated that the relationship between mindfulness and emotion lability was mediated by emotion differentiation. Furthermore, emotion regulation mediated the relationship between mindfulness and both negative emotion lability and positive emotion differentiation. This experience sampling study indicates that self-reported levels of mindfulness are related to higher levels of differentiation of one's discrete emotional experiences in a manner reflective of effective emotion regulation.",2012.0,67.0,487.0,"{'volume': '12 1', 'pages': '\n          81-90\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hill2012MindfulnessAI,\n author = {Christina L.

CBIs are based on constructive meditations where imagery abilities are essential. One of the major difficulties that participants report during the training is the difficulty related to imagery abilities. Virtual reality (VR) can be a useful tool to overcome this limitation because it can facilitate the construction and sustainment of mental images. The machine to be another (TMTBA) uses multi-sensory stimulation to induce a body swap illusion. This system allows participants to see themselves from a third perspective and have the illusion of touching themselves from outside. The main objective of the present study was to analyze the efficacy of a self-compassion meditation procedure based on the TMTBA system versus the usual meditation procedure (CAU) in increasing positive affect states, mindful self-care, and adherence to the practice, and explore the influence of imagery abilities as moderators of the effects of the condition on adherence. A sample of 16 participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: TMTBA-VR and CAU. All participants had to listen to an audio meditation about self-compassion and answer questionnaires before and after the training. The TMTBA-VR condition also had a body swap experience at the end of the meditation while listening to self-compassionate messages. Afterward, they were invited to practice this meditation for 2 weeks and then measured again. After the compassion practice, both conditions significantly increased positive qualities toward self/others, decreased negative qualities toward self, and increased awareness and attention to mental events and bodily sensations, with no differences between the conditions. After 2 weeks, both conditions showed a similar frequency of meditation practice and increases in specific types of self-care behaviors, with the frequency of clinical self-care behaviors being significantly higher in TMTBA. Finally, lower imagery ability in the visual and cutaneous modality were moderators of the efficacy of the TMTBA (vs. CAU) condition in increasing adherence to the practice. Embodied VR could be an interesting tool to facilitate and increase the efficacy of CBIs by facilitating the construction of positive and powerful mental images.",2019.0,52.0,29.0,"{'volume': '10', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cebolla2019PuttingOI,\n author = {A.

Research has also pointed to VR’s capacity to reduce children’s experience of aversive stimuli and reduce anxiety levels. Although there are a number of purported advantages of VR technologies, challenges have emerged. One challenge for this field of study is the lack of consensus on how to do trials.

Although comfortable interpersonal distance seems to be dependent on social factors such as the gender, age and activity of the confederates, it also seems to be modulated by the way we represent our peripersonal-action space. To test this hypothesis, the present study investigated the relation between the emotional responses registered through electrodermal activity (EDA) triggered by human-like point-light displays (PLDs) carrying different facial expressions (neutral, angry, happy) when located in the participants peripersonal or extrapersonal space, and the comfort distance with the same PLDs when approaching and crossing the participants fronto-parallel axis on the right or left side. The results show an increase of the phasic EDA for PLDs with angry facial expressions located in the peripersonal space (reachability judgment task), in comparison to the same PLDs located in the extrapersonal space, which was not observed for PLDs with neutral or happy facial expressions. The results also show an increase of the comfort distance for PLDs approaching the participants with an angry facial expression (interpersonal comfort distance judgment task), in comparison to PLDs with happy and neutral ones, which was related to the increase of the physiological response. Overall, the findings indicate that comfort social space can be predicted from the emotional reaction triggered by a confederate when located within the observer’s peripersonal space. This suggests that peripersonal-action space and interpersonal-social space are similarly sensitive to the emotional valence of the confederate, which could reflect a common adaptive mechanism in specifying theses spaces to subtend interactions with both the physical and social environment, but also to ensure body protection from potential threats.",2018.0,91.0,59.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cartaud2018PhysiologicalRT,\n author = {A.

Due to its relationship with psychosocial adjustment, a significant number of instruments have been developed to assess emotion regulation in a reliable and valid manner. Among these, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ; Gross and John, 2003) is one of the most widely used, having shown good psychometric properties with adult samples from different cultures. Studies of validation in children and adolescents are, however, scarce and have only been developed for the Australian and Portuguese populations. The aim of this study was to validate the Spanish version of the ERQ for use in adolescents and determine possible differences according to the gender and age of young people. The sample consisted of 2060 adolescents (52.1% boys). Exploratory and Confirmatory factor analysis (EFA and CFA), multi-group analysis and Two-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) were performed and the percentiles calculated. The results of the AFE and CFA corroborated the existence of two factors related to the emotion regulation strategies of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, showing acceptable internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Both factors also showed good criterion validity with personality traits, self-esteem, and social anxiety. Differences in cognitive reappraisal were found with regard to age, with younger students exhibiting the greatest mastery of this strategy. Gender differences were observed regarding the expressive suppression strategy, with boys being more likely to use this strategy than girls. A gender-age interaction effect was also observed, revealing that the use of the expressive suppression strategy did not vary by age in girls, and was more widely used by boys aged 12–14 years than those aged 15–16 years. However, we found evidence of measurement invariance across sex and age groups. The results suggest that the ERQ is a valid and reliable instrument that can be used to evaluate emotion regulation strategies in adolescents.",2016.0,65.0,48.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gómez-Ortiz2016AnalysisOE,\n author = {Olga Gómez-Ortiz and E.

Since it has been recognized that emotions have a pivotal role for the human mind, an ever increasing number of laboratories and research centers are interested in affective sciences, affective neuroscience, affective psychology and affective psychopathology. Therefore, this paper presents multidisciplinary research results of Laboratory for Interactive Simulation System at Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb in the stress resilience. Patient's distortion in emotional processing of multimodal input stimuli is predominantly consequence of his/her cognitive deficit which is result of their individual mental health disorders. These emotional distortions in patient's multimodal physiological, facial, acoustic, and linguistic features related to presented stimulation can be used as indicator of patient's mental illness. Real-time processing and analysis of patient's multimodal response related to annotated input stimuli is based on appropriate machine learning methods from computer science. Comprehensive longitudinal multimodal analysis of patient's emotion, mood, feelings, attention, motivation, decision-making, and working memory in synchronization with multimodal stimuli provides extremely valuable big database for data mining, machine learning and machine reasoning. Presented multimedia stimuli sequence includes personalized images, movies and sounds, as well as semantically congruent narratives. Simultaneously, with stimuli presentation patient provides subjective emotional ratings of presented stimuli in terms of subjective units of discomfort/distress, discrete emotions, or valence and arousal. These subjective emotional ratings of input stimuli and corresponding physiological, speech, and facial output features provides enough information for evaluation of patient's cognitive appraisal deficit.

Virtual Representations of the Self (VRS) are in our opinion a tool with a great potential for engaging teenagers in emotional regulation strategies learning and an excellent example of new technology application to the basic concept in psychology field such as Bandura's modeling [1]. VRSs have already demonstrated their potential on human behavior modification (e.g. modification of physical activity; eating habits) in general population [2]. Thus, the same technology can bring in our opinion a lot to the Mental Health field, especially in emotional regulation learning.

Rather than being a single method, current applications of content analysis show three distinct approaches: conventional, directed, or summative. All three approaches are used to interpret meaning from the content of text data and, hence, adhere to the naturalistic paradigm. The major differences among the approaches are coding schemes, origins of codes, and threats to trustworthiness. In conventional content analysis, coding categories are derived directly from the text data. With a directed approach, analysis starts with a theory or relevant research findings as guidance for initial codes. A summative content analysis involves counting and comparisons, usually of keywords or content, followed by the interpretation of the underlying context.

Methods: In July 2020, 15 subjects were selected to complete two groups of treadmill walking training experiments in virtual natural environment and daily environment respectively. At the same time, the subjects' skin electrical (EDA) , pulse frequency (Pf) , respiratory frequency (Rf) physiological data and Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) data before and after walking were collected; the mean value of three dimensions of SAM and the emotion difference before and after the experiment were calculated. The differences of physiological indexes and subjective mood changes of subjects were tested by paired sample t-test. Results: Compared with the daily environment, the ΔEDA, ΔPf and ΔRf of the subjects in the virtual natural environment were all decreased , and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). There were statistically significant differences in pleasure and arousal between subjects before and after using the virtual natural environment (P <0.05). Compared with the daily environment, the Δpleasure degree of subjects using the virtual natural environment increased, and the Δarousal degree and Δdominance degree decreased, and the differences were statistically significant (P <0.05).

The burden of dementia is borne not only by people with dementia, but by their carers, both informal and professional. The major direct financial costs are managed by the welfare sector, through the provision of community services and residential care, whereas indirect costs are largely attributed to informal carers. Advances in care practices would be of considerable benefit. The health sector has had its main impact in the area of dementia by providing skills and expertise necessary for comprehensive, holistic assessments. Kitwood challenges this medical model, which he labels as …

The group program content is informed by a two dimensional model of emotion (arousal, valence), along with music psychology theories about how music evokes emotional responses. The program has been evaluated in two samples of adolescents: 41 “at risk” adolescents (76% males; Mage = 14.8 years) attending an educational re-engagement program and 216 students (100% females; Mage = 13.6 years) attending a mainstream secondary school. Results showed significant pre- to post-program improvements in measures of emotion awareness, identification, and regulation (p < 0.01 to p = 0.06 in the smaller “at risk” sample and all p < 0.001 in the mainstream school sample). Participant ratings of engagement and likelihood of using the strategies learned in the program were high. Tuned In shows promise as a brief emotion regulation intervention for adolescents, and these findings extend an earlier study with young adults.

Unfortunately, resistance to end-user systems by managers and professionals is a widespread problem. To better predict, explain, and increase user acceptance, we need to better understand why people accept or reject computers. This research addresses the ability to predict peoples' computer acceptance from a measure of their intentions, and the ability to explain their intentions in terms of their attitudes, subjective norms, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and related variables. In a longitudinal study of 107 users, intentions to use a specific system, measured after a one-hour introduction to the system, were correlated 0.35 with system use 14 weeks later. The intention-usage correlation was 0.63 at the end of this time period. Perceived usefulness strongly influenced peoples' intentions, explaining more than half of the variance in intentions at the end of 14 weeks. Perceived ease of use had a small but significant effect on intentions as well, although this effect subsided over time. Attitudes only partially mediated the effects of these beliefs on intentions. Subjective norms had no effect on intentions. These results suggest the possibility of simple but powerful models of the determinants of user acceptance, with practical value for evaluating systems and guiding managerial interventions aimed at reducing the problem of underutilized computer technology.",1989.0,82.0,22929.0,"{'volume': '35', 'pages': '982-1003', 'name': 'Management Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Davis1989UserAO,\n author = {Fred D.

To determine the factors associated with the adoption or maintenance of consistent safer sexual behaviors among human immunodeficiency virus-positive adolescents and young adults with hemophilia. Methods. One hundred eleven adolescents at 10 hemophilia care sites participated in an intervention program designed to increase safer sexual behaviors (abstinence, condom use, or nonpenetrative behavior). The theory-based intervention spanned 1 year. Adolescents attended individual sessions, small group activities, and an intensive group retreat. Results. Patients who maintained or improved safer sexual behaviors were compared with those who relapsed or did not improve. Logistic regression analyses found that improvement and maintenance of safer sexual behavior were significantly associated with perceived peer support for outercourse (odds ratio [OR]: 5.47; confidence interval [CI]: 1.4–20.8), perceived peer support for abstinence (OR: 5.08; CI: 1.2–20.1), and decreased general emotional distress (OR: 4.65; CI: 1.04–20.6). Perceived health status and previous sexual behavior were unrelated to change in safer sexual behavior. Conclusions. These longitudinal data indicate that improvement and maintenance of safer sexual behavior among adolescents during an intervention is strongly associated with perceptions of peer support for safer sex and lesser degrees of emotional distress. Programs for human immunodeficiency virus-infected adolescents may require developmentally appropriate social and psychological approaches to impact peer norms and emotional well-being.",2000.0,40.0,26.0,"{'volume': '106', 'pages': 'e22 - e22', 'name': 'Pediatrics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Brown2000SexualBC,\n author = {L.

This review takes an evolutionary perspective and characterizes emotion in terms of response tendencies. Emotion regulation is defined and distinguished from coping, mood regulation, defense, and affect regulation. In the increasingly specialized discipline of psychology, the field of emotion regulation cuts across traditional boundaries and provides common ground. According to a process model of emotion regulation, emotion may be regulated at five points in the emotion generative process: (a) selection of the situation, (b) modification of the situation, (c) deployment of attention, (d) change of cognitions, and (e) modulation of responses. The field of emotion regulation promises new insights into age-old questions about how people manage their emotions.",1998.0,381.0,7115.0,"{'volume': '2', 'pages': '271 - 299', 'name': 'Review of General Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gross1998TheEF,\n author = {J.

A Meta-Analysis of the Effect of Immersive Technology on User Presence,"The concept of presence, or “being there” is a frequently emphasized factor in immersive mediated environments. It is often assumed that greater levels of immersive quality elicit higher levels of presence, in turn enhancing the effectiveness of a mediated experience. To investigate this assumption the current meta-analysis synthesizes decades of empirical research examining the effect of immersive system technology on user experiences of presence. Aggregating 115 effect sizes from 83 studies, it finds that technological immersion has a medium-sized effect on presence. Additionally, results show that increased levels of user-tracking, the use of stereoscopic visuals, and wider fields of view of visual displays are significantly more impactful than improvements to most other immersive system features, including quality of visual and auditory content. These findings are discussed in light of theoretical accounts of the presence construct as well as practical implications for design.",2016.0,154.0,879.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '272 - 309', 'name': 'Media Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cummings2016HowII,\n author = {James J.

This meta-analysis was undertaken to explore the impact of Internet-based learning on students/professionals’ knowledge of public health compared with no intervention and with traditional face-to-face (FTF) formats. Two reviewers independently searched Medline, Web of Science, ProQuest, Google scholar, ERIC and Elsevier databases for relevant studies between 1st January, 1990 and 30th December, 2016. Studies in English language providing information on educational outcomes after Internet-based training in public health courses compared with no-intervention or a pre-intervention assessment, or with FTF control group were retrieved, reviewed, and assessed according to the established inclusion/exclusion criteria in the current study. There were 16 eligible studies with 1183 participants in total. Heterogeneity in results was detected across studies. A random effects model was used to pool effect sizes for knowledge outcomes. The pooled effect size (standardized mean difference, SMD) in comparison to no intervention was 1.92 (95% CI: 1.05 to 2.78; P<0.0001), favoring Internet-based interventions. Compared with FTF formats, the pooled effect size was 0.39 (95% CI: -0.06 to 0.83; P=0.09). The study suggested that Internet-based learning was superior to no-intervention in improving students/professionals’ public health knowledge.

Most data showing implicit affective stimuli influence on evaluative judgments, come from experiments conducted in an affective priming paradigm. The paradigm was introduced by Murphy and Zajonc (1993) who presented evidence for the existence of unconscious primary affect (Zajonc, 1980) and its influence on cognition. In their original experiments they presented neutral target stimuli (for example Chinese ideographs), which were preceded by either 1-s or 4-ms exposures of photographs of faces expressing either positive or negative emotions. The results showed that suboptimal (4ms) affective primes induced affect that influenced evaluations of the neutral targets. Ideographs primed by negative facial expressions were judged more negatively than those primed by positive ones. Interestingly, neither the facial expression nor even the presence of any image was accessible to the participants’ awareness. In contrast to suboptimal affective primes, both optimal affective primes (exposed for 1 s) and affectively neutral suboptimal primes (e.g., geometric figures of different shapes) failed to influence the participants’ judgments about targets. This was the first effect observed in affective priming research. However, it turned out in later studies that the reverse effect is also possible (Glaser and Banaji, 1999; Ohme et al., 1999). The first effect, when judgments about neutral stimuli are consistent with the valance affective primes, is referred to as the assimilation effect. The reverse effect, when targets primed negatively are evaluated more positively than those primed positively (thus inconsistently with priming valance), is called the contrast effect. It turned out that which of the two effects is obtained is not a matter of chance but is related to important psychological and neurobiological processes occurring at the time when affect is elicited. Both effects are quite simple and both proof that judgmentsmay be influenced by stimuli presented outside conscious awareness. Accordingly, in this opinion article, we will explore the psychological mechanism underlying the effects of assimilation and contrast.",2014.0,47.0,8.0,"{'volume': '5', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kobylińska2014AssimilationAC,\n author = {D.

Background: Chronic low back pain is the most prevalent chronic pain condition worldwide and access to behavioral pain treatment is limited. Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive technology that may provide effective behavioral therapeutics for chronic pain.


OBJECTIVE
Objective: To conduct a double-blind, parallel arm, single cohort, remote, randomized placebo-controlled trial for a self-administered behavioral skills-based VR program in community-based individuals with self-reported chronic low back pain during the COVID-19 pandemic.


METHODS
Methods: A national online convenience sample of individuals with self-reported non-malignant low back pain > 6 months duration and with average pain intensity > 4/10 was enrolled and randomized 1:1 to one of two daily (56-day) VR programs: (1) EaseVRx (immersive pain relief skills VR program); or (2) Sham VR (2D nature content delivered in a VR headset). Objective device use data and self-reported data were collected. The primary outcomes were the between-group effect of EaseVRx versus Sham VR across time points, and the between-within interaction effect representing the change in average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, stress, mood, and sleep over time (baseline to end-of-treatment at day 56). Secondary outcomes were global impression of change and change in physical function, sleep disturbance, pain self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, pain acceptance, pain medication use, and user satisfaction. Analytic methods included intention-to-treat and a mixed-model framework.


RESULTS
The study sample was 179 adults (female: 77%; Caucasian: 91%; at least some college education: 92%; mean age: 51.5 years, SD=13.1; average pain intensity: 5/10, SD=1.2; back pain duration >5 years: 67%). No group differences were found for any baseline variable or treatment engagement. User satisfaction ratings were higher for EaseVRx vs. Sham VR (p<0.0001). For the between-groups factor, EaseVRx was superior to Sham VR for all primary outcomes (highest p-value = .0090), and between-groups Cohen's d effect sizes ranged from 0.40 to 0.49 indicating superiority was moderately clinically meaningful. For EaseVRx, large pre-post effect sizes ranged from 1.17-1.3 and met moderate to substantial clinical importance for reduced pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, mood, and stress. Between group comparisons for physical function and sleep disturbance showed superiority for the EaseVRx group vs. the Sham VR group (p=0.0224 and p=.0132, respectively). Pain catastrophizing, pain self-efficacy, pain acceptance, prescription opioid use (morphine milligram equivalent; MME) did not reach statistical significance for either group. Use of over-the-counter analgesic use was reduced for EaseVRx (p<0.01) but not for ShamVR.


CONCLUSIONS
EaseVRx had high user satisfaction and superior and clinically meaningful symptom reduction for average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, mood, and stress compared to sham VR. Additional research is needed to determine durability of treatment effects and to characterize mechanisms of treatment effects. Home-based VR may expand access to effective and on-demand non-pharmacologic treatment for chronic low back pain.

1801,bc2a95bb8be1dbeeef889e38c957bf45b5595b4d,Factors That Influence Perceived Organizational Support for Emotional Labor of Chinese Medical Personnel in Hubei,"At the outbreak of coronavirus disease in Wuhan, China, 42,322 medical personnel from other provinces and municipalities in China volunteered to rush to Hubei to assist their colleagues. Their all-out efforts contributed to Hubei finally winning the fight to prevent and control the pandemic. The aim of this study is to explore the influence of perceived organizational support on the emotional labor of medical personnel in Hubei Province. A group of 170 medical personnel from (tertiary) hospitals who participated in the pandemic aid operation in Hubei completed self-administered questionnaires, including the perceived organizational support scale, emotional labor scale, and professional identity scale. This study used Pearson's correlation in SPSS to analyze the three variables of organizational support, emotional labor, and professional identity. Organizational support and emotional labor (r = 0.443, P < 0.01), organizational support and professional identity (r = 0.631, P < 0.01), and emotional labor and occupational identity (r = 0.511, P < 0.01) showed a significant positive correlation. The bootstrapping mediating effect test was used to determine the overall mediating effect of occupational identity. Occupational identity was a complete mediating effect between organizational support and emotional labor. The results show that a strong sense of organizational support can promote higher emotional labor among medical workers in Hubei Province. A strong sense of organizational support will also promote a stronger professional identity; further, a strong professional identity completely mediates the effect of perceived organizational support on emotional labor. These results infer that in emergency medical and health services, medical personnel can realize a high sense of organizational support, which could enhance their professional identity; this enables them to combine their professional goals with organizational goals more actively and to finally pay higher emotional labor to achieve organizational goals.",2021.0,49.0,9.0,"{'volume': '12', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zeng2021FactorsTI,\n author = {Z.

During the last years a multidisciplinary research team comprised of engineers, psychologists, physiotherapists and paediatricians have been testing these technologies. Throughout the tests, physiological (cardiovascular and metabolic response with biomedical sensors (smart fabrics TIAS) and psychological responses have been collected. The results presented in this paper reflect two main aspects: 1) the feasibility of the monitoring techniques employed and 2) the validity of virtual reality and exergaming technologies as promoters of physical activity and their potential as tools in clinical intervention programs. In the first study (n=90) children, a commercial platform was tested as support tool to aerobic exercise in a treadmill. Results showed a more physiological effort by obese group and limitations to measure effort perception with Borg scale especially in obese group. In second study (n=126) a new VR platform was developed (VREP) and tested as support of aerobic activities, a difference of first study, all the boys completed both conditions (same Aerobic exercise with/without support VR). 59.5% felt that they had to exert more effort in the traditional condition. Regarding to acceptability in both studies the vast majority of the participants liked the idea of combining physical activity with the VR platform as a form of treatment to increase physical activity. The capacity of VR technology to create controllable, multisensory, interactive 3D stimulus environments within which children's performance can be motivated, recorded, and measured, has been tested in these studies, offering clinical assessment and intervention options which are not possible using traditional methods.",2013.0,72.0,11.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '1199-1218', 'name': 'J.

We analyzed the newly developed VR continuous performance test (VR-CPT) for Korean children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and typically developing children (TDC). To identify specific features of a virtual environment that influence the attention performance of children, we investigated whether the presence of a virtual teacher and social cues in the VR environment affects their attention performance. A total of 38 participants (18 TDC and 20 ADHD children and adolescents) were recruited for VR-CPT testing. Bivariate correlational analysis was conducted to examine the associations between the results of the VR-CPT and ADHD questionnaires to determine the capacity of VR-CPT to mirror real-life attention behaviors. Mixed-design analysis of variables was conducted to compare the effects of the social aspects of the VR-CPT on attention performance in groups. There were significant associations between ADHD rating scores and the omission error, commission error, reaction time (RT), reaction time variability (RTV), and total accuracy of the VR-CPT in the ADHD group. In addition, the ADHD group exhibited comparable performance with the TDC group for all measures of the VR-CPT. Also there seemed to be a trend of decreasing RTV when a virtual teacher with social cues was present compared with the equipment control condition in the ADHD group. Performance in the VR-CPT program was associated with behavioral measures of ADHD symptoms. Adding social aspects to a VR environment commonly encountered by children and adolescents has the potential to make a difference in the attention performance of youths with ADHD.",2019.0,31.0,18.0,"{'volume': '22 3', 'pages': '\n          198-204\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Eom2019DevelopmentOV,\n author = {Hyojung Eom and K.

The purpose of the present study was to compare therapeutic effects of an electromyography (EMG) biofeedback augmented by virtual reality (VR) and EMG biofeedback alone on the triceps and biceps (T:B) muscle activity imbalance and elbow joint movement coordination during a reaching motor taskOBJECTIVE: To compare therapeutic effects of an electromyography (EMG) biofeedback augmented by virtual reality (VR) and EMG biofeedback alone on the triceps and biceps muscle activity imbalance and elbow joint movement coordination during a reaching motor task in normal children and children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP).


METHODS
18 children with spastic CP (2 females; mean±standard deviation = 9.5 ± 1.96 years) and 8 normal children (3 females; mean ± standard deviation = 9.75 ± 2.55 years) were recruited from a local community center. All children with CP first underwent one intensive session of EMG feedback (30 minutes), followed by one session of the EMG-VR feedback (30 minutes) after a 1-week washout period. Clinical tests included elbow extension range of motion (ROM), biceps muscle strength, and box and block test. EMG triceps and biceps (T:B) muscle activity imbalance and reaching movement acceleration coordination were concurrently determined by EMG and 3-axis accelerometer measurements respectively. Independent t-test and one-way repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed at p < 0.05.


RESULTS
The one-way repeated ANOVA was revealed to be significantly effective in elbow extension ROM (p = 0.01), biceps muscle strength (p = 0.01), and box and block test (p = 0.03). The one-way repeated ANOVA also revealed to be significantly effective in the peak triceps muscle activity (p = 0.01). However, one-way repeated ANOVA produced no statistical significance in the composite 3-dimensional movement acceleration coordination data (p = 0.12).


CONCLUSIONS
The present study is a first clinical trial that demonstrated the superior benefits of the EMG biofeedback when augmented by virtual reality exercise games in children with spastic CP. The augmented EMG and VR feedback produced better neuromuscular balance control in the elbow joint than the EMG biofeedback alone.",2017.0,31.0,27.0,"{'volume': '40 2', 'pages': '\n          175-185\n        ', 'name': 'NeuroRehabilitation'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Yoo2017AugmentedEO,\n author = {J.

In this paper, an immersive VR rehabilitation training system endowed with wearable haptics is proposed for children with neuromotor impairments: it aims to enhance involvement and engagement of patients, to provide congruent multi-sensory afferent feedback during motor exercises and to benefit from the flexibility of VR in adapting exercises to the patient’s need. An experimental rehabilitation session conducted with children with cerebral palsy (CP) and developmental dyspraxia (DD) has been performed to evaluate the usability of the system and proof of concept trial of the proposed approach. We compared CP/DD performance with both typically developing children and adult control group. Results show the system was compliant with different levels of motor skills and allowed patients to complete the experimental rehabilitation session, with performance varying according to the expected motor abilities of different groups. Moreover, a kinematic assessmentbased on the presented system has been designed.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of culture on the creative and stylistic features children employ when producing narratives based on wordless picture books.


METHOD
Participants included 60 first- and second-grade African American, Latino American, and Caucasian children. A subset of narratives based on wordless picture books collected as part of a larger study was coded and analyzed for the following creative and stylistic conventions: organizational style (topic centered, linear, cyclical), dialogue (direct, indirect), reference to character relationships (nature, naming, conduct), embellishment (fantasy, suspense, conflict), and paralinguistic devices (expressive sounds, exclamatory utterances).


RESULTS
Many similarities and differences between ethnic groups were found. No significant differences were found between ethnic groups in organizational style or use of paralinguistic devices. African American children included more fantasy in their stories, Latino children named their characters more often, and Caucasian children made more references to the nature of character relationships.


CONCLUSION
Even within the context of a highly structured narrative task based on wordless picture books, culture influences children's production of narratives. Enhanced understanding of narrative structure, creativity, and style is necessary to provide ecologically valid narrative assessment and intervention for children from diverse cultural backgrounds.",2011.0,86.0,61.0,"{'volume': '42 2', 'pages': '\n          167-81\n        ', 'name': 'Language, speech, and hearing services in schools'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gorman2011CreativeAS,\n author = {Brenda K.

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to examine the complex relationships between common bond attachment, common identity attachment, self-esteem and virtual community citizenship behavior (VCCB). This study identifies two broad categories of VCCB: citizenship behaviors directed toward benefitting other individuals (VCCBI) and citizenship behaviors directed toward benefitting the virtual community (VCCBC).


Design/methodology/approach
The authors apply partial least squares structural equation modeling to test the hypotheses, using a sample of 388 valid responses.


Findings
The results indicate that common bond attachment and common identity attachment have a significant effect on self-esteem, which, in turn, has a significant effect on VCCBI and VCCBC. The results also indicate that common bond attachment has a significant effect on VCCBI, and that common identity attachment has a significant effect on VCCBC.


Originality/value
This study contributes to a better understanding of VCCBs through common identity and common-bond theory, social identity theory and the stimulus-organism-response framework.

1825,bed92e978f5bca851a79b16d8499b8ca21eeb3d6,A global measure of perceived stress.,"This paper presents evidence from three samples, two of college students and one of participants in a community smoking-cessation program, for the reliability and validity of a 14-item instrument, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), designed to measure the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. The PSS showed adequate reliability and, as predicted, was correlated with life-event scores, depressive and physical symptomatology, utilization of health services, social anxiety, and smoking-reduction maintenance. In all comparisons, the PSS was a better predictor of the outcome in question than were life-event scores. When compared to a depressive symptomatology scale, the PSS was found to measure a different and independently predictive construct.

These states--called core affect--influence reflexes, perception, cognition, and behavior and are influenced by many causes internal and external, but people have no direct access to these causal connections. Core affect can therefore be experienced as free-floating (mood) or can be attributed to some cause (and thereby begin an emotional episode). These basic processes spawn a broad framework that includes perception of the core-affect-altering properties of stimuli, motives, empathy, emotional meta-experience, and affect versus emotion regulation; it accounts for prototypical emotional episodes, such as fear and anger, as core affect attributed to something plus various nonemotional processes.",2003.0,272.0,4707.0,"{'volume': '110 1', 'pages': '\n          145-72\n        ', 'name': 'Psychological review'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Russell2003CoreAA,\n author = {J.

Physiological indicators, including EEG (electroencephalogram), blood pressure, skin conductance, and pulse, were monitored in 180 Chinese university students (mean age: 20.72 ± 2.56 years) while they were watching bamboo videos. Before and after watching the videos, their psychological indicators, including positive and negative moods, were measured using the Profile of Mood States questionnaire. After watching the bamboo videos of different durations, all of the physiological indicators responded to the stimulation after only 1 min. The indicators showed different trends at 1, 3 and 5 min. EEG decreased and then was maintained at a stable level after 1 min, and the high β, low β, and α waves had no significant differences between 1, 3 and 5 min. Blood pressure dropped to a stable state after 3 min, and the decline was significantly different greater after 3 min than after 1 min. Skin conductance increased for 1 to 5 min, and it did not stabilize after a long time (5 min). Pulse decreased after 1 min but increased after 5 min. After watching the videos with bamboo of varying structures, the physiological and psychological indicators showed significantly different changes. Skin conductance significantly increased (mean value: 6.78%), and the amount of sweat was more effectively reduced, thereby reducing tension, when the students viewed videos of sympodial bamboo forests compared with monopodial bamboo forests. Bamboo forests with a higher canopy density (0.83–0.85) could significantly decrease α waves (mean value: 1.50 Hz), relaxing the human body. High β and low β waves showed greater decreases, with tension reduced more effectively, when bamboo forests with a low tilt ratio (< 1.5%) were viewed. Bamboo forests with neat undergrowth could have more beneficial physiological and psychological effects on the human body.",2020.0,62.0,14.0,"{'volume': '17', 'name': 'International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wang2020PhysiologicalAP,\n author = {Yuqian Wang and Mingyan Jiang and Yinshu Huang and Zhiyi Sheng and Xiao Huang and Wei Lin and Qibing Chen and Xi Li and Zhenghua Luo and Bingyang Lv},\n journal = {International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health},\n title = {Physiological and Psychological Effects of Watching Videos of Different Durations Showing Urban Bamboo Forests with Varied Structures},\n volume = {17},\n year = {2020}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2108034919', 'name': 'Yuqian Wang'}, {'authorId': '46332956', 'name': 'Mingyan Jiang'}, {'authorId': '2118798532', 'name': 'Yinshu Huang'}, {'authorId': '1705432570', 'name': 'Zhiyi Sheng'}, {'authorId': '2107971005', 'name': 'Xiao Huang'}, {'authorId': '2108810892', 'name': 'Wei Lin'}, {'authorId': '6388016', 'name': 'Qibing Chen'}, {'authorId': '48568342', 'name': 'Xi Li'}, {'authorId': '2111854625', 'name': 'Zhenghua Luo'}, {'authorId': '40908491', 'name': 'Bingyang Lv'}]"

In this article, we apply theory from the field of social psychology to understand how online communities develop member attachment, an important dimension of community success. We implemented and empirically tested two sets of community features for building member attachment by strengthening either group identity or interpersonal bonds. To increase identity-based attachment, we gave members information about group activities and intergroup competition, and tools for group-level communication. To increase bond-based attachment, we gave members information about the activities of individual members and interpersonal similarity, and tools for interpersonal communication. Results from a six-month field experiment show that participants' visit frequency and self-reported attachment increased in both conditions. Community features intended to foster identity-based attachment had stronger effects than features intended to foster bond-based attachment. Participants in the identity condition with access to group profiles and repeated exposure to their group's activities visited their community twice as frequently as participants in other conditions. The new features also had stronger effects on newcomers than on old-timers. This research illustrates how theory from the social science literature can be applied to gain a more systematic understanding of online communities and how theory-inspired features can improve their success.",2012.0,112.0,522.0,"{'volume': '36', 'pages': '841-864', 'name': 'MIS Q.'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ren2012BuildingMA,\n author = {Yuqing Ren and Max Harper and Sara Drenner and S.

However, until recently, the impact of emotion regulation difficulties for adolescents and young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has received little attention. We investigated emotion regulation difficulties from the perspective of those who would experience the sequelae. This included parents, teachers, and psychologists. Method Seven focus groups with parents, teachers, and psychologists, and 7 interviews with adolescents and young adults with ASD were conducted. Results Across the groups, participants discussed their triggers of distressing emotions, difficulties with emotional awareness, emotion regulation strategies, and the consequences of their distressing emotions. Both depression and anxiety were perceived as the most experienced distressing issues with the greatest consequences. Conclusions The implications of the themes revealed in the interviews and focus groups are discussed in light in previous literature and may help to inform future interventions.",2017.0,59.0,15.0,"{'volume': '42', 'pages': '275 - 284', 'name': 'Journal of Intellectual & Developmental Disability'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Santomauro2017InvestigationsIE,\n author = {D.

Then, many methods of face recognition have been developed and are used for a lot of systems such as digital camera, bank ATM (Automated Teller Machine), home security and so on. These days, most of human faces are precisely recognized with Haar-like features and AdaBoost classifiers. On the other hand, many people have pets such as dogs and cats, and they are friends or even family members for human beings. Then, surveillance cameras have been developed and used for monitoring pets, who are in houses while the owners are away from home. However, the recognition of pet faces is very difficult since there are a variety of patterns on the face. It is not sure that pet faces can be recognized with the same methods as the faces of human beings. Therefore, we have investigated the methods to detect pet faces, especially for cats and dogs. We have used Haar-like and HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) features to construct the classifiers of pet faces. In addition, we have tried to investigate which is better for the pet face detection to use either whole face or parts of the face such as eyes and nose. Finally, we have applied our method to some pictures of cats and dogs, and confirmed that the classifiers have been able to detect the pet faces correctly.",2018.0,20.0,7.0,"{'pages': '52-57', 'name': '2018 Nicograph International (NicoInt)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mukai2018PetFD,\n author = {N.

We found that in most cases, these teachers’ efforts are motivated by an ethic of care (Noddings, 1988, 2005, 2013) in which they seek to construct positive relationships with students in order to help mitigate their students’ LA. Though desirable, such efforts often result in ‘emotional labour’ as teachers suppress their own negative emotions while attending to those of their students. Adopting a dialogical perspective to teacher engagement with anxious learners, we analyse the affective or emotional labour that language teachers often undertake in responding to their students’ displays of LA. Drawing on positioning theory, we explore these concepts through analysing these language teachers’ interview accounts, produced in response to questions related to their students’ LA.",2019.0,45.0,68.0,"{'volume': '23', 'pages': '372 - 387', 'name': 'Language Teaching Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gkonou2019CaringAE,\n author = {Christina Gkonou and E.

In the United States, the prevalence rate in Asian immigrants is high (26%-70%), with Southeast Asian men having the highest rate. Acculturation has been associated with smoking behavior in this ethnic group. Objective: The purposes of this meta-analysis are to describe the extent to which acculturation affects smoking behavior in Asian immigrants and to compare the direction and magnitude of the effect between subgroups by gender and age. Methods: Databases within PubMed, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO were searched. Twenty-one studies published in English or Korean from 1994 through 2005 met criteria, and 9 of these studies contained sufficient data. Among the 9 studies, 3 presented gender-specific data; thus, these studies were entered separately for men and women, making a total of 12 entries for final analysis. The odds ratio was used as an effect size statistic. The values of odds ratios were calculated from the data in the studies. Results: The average effect size for men was 0.53 (95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.99), indicating that acculturated men are 53% less likely to smoke than nonacculturated or ""traditional"" men. The average effect size for women was 5.26 (2.75-10.05), suggesting that acculturated women are 5 times more likely to smoke than traditional women. In adolescents, the average effect size was 1.92 (1.22-3.01), indicating that acculturated adolescents are almost 2 times more likely to smoke than traditional adolescents. Conclusions: Acculturation may have a protective effect on smoking behavior in Asian men and a harmful effect in Asian women and adolescents. The magnitude of effect is larger in women and adolescents than in men. Smoking cessation programs should target acculturated women, adolescents, and traditional men.",2008.0,29.0,86.0,"{'volume': '23', 'pages': '67-73', 'name': 'The Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Choi2008EffectsOA,\n author = {Sarah E.

Rural students (n = 147) were enrolled in a longitudinal study from kindergarten through first grade. Growth trajectories (initial level and slope) were modeled with hierarchical linear modeling for 3 areas of achievement: word reading, phonological awareness, and mathematics. Cross-classified analyses examined the extent to which quality of teacher-child interactions and children's starting level predicted achievement growth rates over 2 years, and they also accounted for the changing nesting structure of the data. Results indicated that achievement at kindergarten entry predicted children's growth for all 3 outcomes. Further, first-grade teachers' strong emotional support related to greater growth in students' phonological awareness. Emotional and instructional support in first grade moderated the relationship between initial achievement and growth in word reading. Kindergarten classroom organization moderated the relationship between initial achievement and growth in mathematics.

Various methods to study craving exist; however, suppressing craving to successfully promote abstinence remains an unmet clinical need in SUDs. One reason is that social and environmental contexts recalling drug and alcohol consumption in the everyday life of patients suffering from SUDs often initiate craving and provoke relapse. Current behavioral therapies for SUDs use the cue-exposure approach to suppress salience of social and environmental contexts that may induce craving. They facilitate learning and cognitive reinforcement of new behavior and entrain craving suppression in the presence of cues related to drug and alcohol consumption. Unfortunately, craving often overweighs behavioral training especially in real social and environmental contexts with peer pressure encouraging the use of substance, such as parties and bars. In this perspective, virtual reality (VR) is gaining interest in the development of cue-reactivity paradigms and practices new skills in treatment. VR enhances ecological validity of traditional craving-induction measurement. In this review, we discuss results from (1) studies using VR and alternative virtual agents in the induction of craving and (2) studies combining cue-exposure therapy with VR in the promotion of abstinence from drugs and alcohol use. They used virtual environments, displaying alcohol and drugs to SUD patients. Moreover, some environments included avatars. Hence, some studies have focused on the social interactions that are associated with drug-seeking behaviors and peer pressure. Findings indicate that VR can successfully increase craving.

Using a community sample of adolescents (N = 177, M = 13.6 years), groups based on five measures of ER (reappraisal, suppression, concealing, emotional engagement, and adjusting) were created through latent profile analysis. A six-group model was the best fit. As hypothesized, ER profiles with high scores on one or two indicators were associated with higher levels of internalizing problems, whereas profiles with average to high scores on several indicators and high scores on adjusting were associated with lower levels of internalizing problems (depression, general anxiety, and social anxiety). Results highlight the importance of having different ER strategies to use and that a limited ER repertoire in adolescence may be associated with internalizing problems.",2012.0,57.0,132.0,"{'volume': '21', 'pages': '704-721', 'name': 'Social Development'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lougheed2012ALR,\n author = {Jessica P.

Study 1 develops a multi-item measure of regret and distinguishes it from satisfaction. It also shows that, while satisfaction directly influences both repurchase and complaint intentions, regret directly influences only repurchase intentions, and its effect on complaint intentions is fully mediated via satisfaction. Study 2 examines the antecedents and moderators of regret. It shows that regret is experienced even in the absence of information on a better-forgone outcome. Furthermore, the moderating effect of three situation-specific characteristics (outcome valence, status quo preservation, and reversibility of the outcome) is examined. Studies 3 and 4 examine the cognitive process underlying the experiencing of regret in the absence of information on a better-forgone outcome. Generation of counterfactuals is identified as the cognitive mechanism that engenders regret.

1866,c301568b8a4bee400a33de26dcec234fcb6eb765,Effects of pride-tagged money and surprise-tagged money on online tipping,"PurposeWith the rise of social media, online tipping has developed markedly in recent years. Drawing on emotional accounting, this research examined the effects of pride-tagged money (PTM) and surprise-tagged money (STM) on online tipping. It examined the mediating role of self-inflation and the moderating role of the perceived importance of money in the proposed relationship.Design/methodology/approachFive experimental studies were conducted to test the hypotheses using ANOVA, SmartPLS3 and bootstrap analyses.FindingsThe results reveal that pride-tagged (vs surprise-tagged) money leads to higher self-inflation, which leads to an increased willingness to engage in online tipping. It illustrates that when the perceived importance of money is low, PTM results in a higher willingness to engage in online tipping than STM. However, when the perceived importance of money is high, the effect of PTM (vs STM) on the willingness to conduct online tipping is attenuated, and no significant difference exists in the willingness to engage in online tipping between people with PTM and those with STM. In addition, it shows that PTM (vs STM) leads to a higher amount of online tipping, and self-inflation mediates the proposed relationship.Practical implicationsPractically, web-based marketing managers should design programs (e.g. content that encourages users to feel pride in their achievements) that cause users to emotionally tag their money with pride as a means of increasing their willingness to engage in online tipping and to increase the amount of such tipping.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study provides the first evidence of how different sources of money influence online tipping.",2020.0,48.0,2.0,"{'volume': '31', 'pages': '1061-1082', 'name': 'Internet Res.'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Yang2020EffectsOP,\n author = {Pianpian Yang and Qingyu Zhang and Yuanyue Feng},\n journal = {Internet Res.},\n pages = {1061-1082},\n title = {Effects of pride-tagged money and surprise-tagged money on online tipping},\n volume = {31},\n year = {2020}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '1852954', 'name': 'Pianpian Yang'}, {'authorId': '49347136', 'name': 'Qingyu Zhang'}, {'authorId': '3282059', 'name': 'Yuanyue Feng'}]"

This effect was certainly evident in healthcare professional’s children that saw their parents being called to the battlefield front line against an invisible enemy and at the same time facing the media avalanche propelling fear and insecurity. Material and Methods: This state of restlessness and vulnerability promoted the development of therapeutic mindfulness groups for children or children and parents (healthcare professional related), from a Hospital Reference Center, over a period of eight weeks. Results: Throughout the sessions, high adherence to conscious attention techniques was observed, allowing the children to overcome physical distance obstacles in a virtual context used as a gateway to the living circumstances and the difficulties experienced at the time of the intervention. Discussion: In the end, improvements were reported in anxious and depressive symptoms with greater capacity for emotional regulation, interpersonal communication and impulse management.

Looking at Twitch specifically, I demonstrate through discourse analysis of platform policy documents as well as community discourse in relation to a 2018 update to the Twitch Community Guidelines as to how gender is understood, constructed, and ultimately reinforced through dominant ideological frames. I argue that the sexual politics of Twitch (and other streaming sites) resulting in marginalized and hegemonic patriarchal gender relations is a consequence of more than misogynistic culture but is in fact reinforced through the platform and the enacted policies associated with that platform. This results in cultural, social, and economic disadvantages for women online and is reflective of platform moderation’s impact on larger gendered divides across digital media spaces.",2020.0,33.0,21.0,"{'volume': '23', 'pages': '2999 - 3015', 'name': 'New Media & Society'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zolides2020GenderMA,\n author = {Andrew Zolides},\n journal = {New Media & Society},\n pages = {2999 - 3015},\n title = {Gender moderation and moderating gender: Sexual content policies in Twitch’s community guidelines},\n volume = {23},\n year = {2020}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '113701686', 'name': 'Andrew Zolides'}]"

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT®) is the most effective treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder, but demand for DBT® far exceeds existing clinical resources. Most patients with BPD never receive DBT®. Incorporating computer technology into the DBT® could help increase dissemination. Immersive Virtual Reality technology (VR) is becoming widely available to mainstream consumers. This case study explored the feasibility/clinical potential of using immersive virtual reality technology to enhance DBT® mindfulness skills training of a 32 year old female diagnosed with BPD. Prior to using VR, the patient experienced difficulty practicing DBT® mindfulness due to her emotional reactivity, and difficulty concentrating. To help the patient focus her attention, and to facilitate DBT® mindfulness skills learning, the patient looked into virtual reality goggles, and had the illusion of slowly “floating down” a 3D computer-generated river while listening to DBT® mindfulness training audios. Urges to commit suicide, urges to self harm, urges to quit therapy, urges to use substances, and negative emotions were all reduced after each VR mindfulness session and VR mindfulness was well accepted/liked by the patient. Although case studies are scientifically inconclusive by nature, results from this feasibility study were encouraging. Future controlled studies are needed to quantify whether VR-enhanced mindfulness training has long term benefits e.g., increasing patient acceptance and/or improving therapeutic outcome. Computerizing some of the DBT® skills treatment modules would reduce cost and increase dissemination.",2016.0,55.0,82.0,"{'volume': '7', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Nararro-Haro2016TheUO,\n author = {Maria V.

Participants included 204 early adolescents (52% African American; 54% female; M age = 12.85 years) who completed four assessments with measures of depressive symptoms, emotional clarity, and emotional abuse and neglect. Hierarchical linear regressions indicated that emotional neglect significantly predicted decreases in emotional clarity, whereas emotional abuse did not. Further, mediational analyses revealed that decreases in emotional clarity mediated the relationship between emotional neglect and increases in depressive symptoms. The current study suggests that emotional neglect (more so than emotional abuse) may hinder an individual’s ability to identify his or her own emotions, which may increase the risk of depressive symptoms during adolescence. These findings have significant implications for the development of intervention and prevention programs for depression.",2017.0,67.0,29.0,"{'volume': '37', 'pages': '414 - 432', 'name': 'The Journal of Early Adolescence'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Jessar2017EmotionalCA,\n author = {Allison J Jessar and J.

In this article, we consider the consequences of waiting on consumption enjoyment. We propose that the effect of a delay on consumption enjoyment depends on both the negative utility of the wait itself and on the positive utility of anticipating a pleasant consumption experience. These factors exert different degrees of influence, depending on characteristics of the decision task. The results of three studies suggest that a delay increases consumption enjoyment for pleasurable products when actual consumption occurs, but decreases enjoyment for imagined consumption.

1877,c4232f268a272f4c425f2abdf5891fde2cc2292a,The Future of Emotion Regulation Research,"Emotion regulation has been conceptualized as a process by which individuals modify their emotional experiences, expressions, and physiology and the situations eliciting such emotions in order to produce appropriate responses to the ever-changing demands posed by the environment. Thus, context plays a central role in emotion regulation. This is particularly relevant to the work on emotion regulation in psychopathology, because psychological disorders are characterized by rigid responses to the environment. However, this recognition of the importance of context has appeared primarily in the theoretical realm, with the empirical work lagging behind. In this review, the author proposes an approach to systematically evaluate the contextual factors shaping emotion regulation. Such an approach consists of specifying the components that characterize emotion regulation and then systematically evaluating deviations within each of these components and their underlying dimensions. Initial guidelines for how to combine such dimensions and components in order to capture substantial and meaningful contextual influences are presented. This approach is offered to inspire theoretical and empirical work that it is hoped will result in the development of a more nuanced and sophisticated understanding of the relationship between context and emotion regulation.",2013.0,160.0,713.0,"{'volume': '8', 'pages': '155 - 172', 'name': 'Perspectives on Psychological Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Aldao2013TheFO,\n author = {A.

This study reports the results of an experiment on the effects of the visual angle of the display (sensory saturation) and room illumination (sensory suppression) on the sensation of telepresence during normal television viewing. A self-report measure of presence yielded two factors. Using [Gerrig's (1993)] terminology for the sense of being transported to a mediated environments, we labeled the two factors “arrival,” for the feeling of being there in the virtual environment, and “departure,” for the feeling of not being there in the in physical environment. It appears that being in the virtual environment is not equivalent to not being in the physical environment. A path analysis found that these two factors have very different relationships to viewer memory for the experience and for attitude change (i.e., buying intention and confidence in product decision). We theorize that the departure factor may be measuring the feeling that the medium has disappeared and may constitute a deeper absorption into the virtual environment.

The pattern of corrected item-total correlation coefficients and of the factors was very similar for various subsamples, which indicates a high degree of stability of dimensions on the eating behavior scales.

In Canada, the military mental health system has received heavy investment to improve occupational outcomes. We investigated military occupational outcomes of diagnosed mental disorders in a cohort of 30,513 personnel who deployed on the Afghanistan mission. Methods: Cohort members were military personnel who deployed on the Afghanistan mission from 2001 to 2008. Mental disorder diagnoses and their attribution to the Afghanistan mission were ascertained via medical records in a stratified random sample (n = 2014). Career-limiting medical conditions (that is, condition-associated restrictions that reliably lead to medically related attrition) were determined using administrative data. Outcomes were assessed from first Afghanistan-related deployment return. Results: At 5 years of follow-up, the Kaplan-Meier estimated cumulative fraction with career-limiting medical conditions was 40.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 35.5 to 46.4) among individuals with Afghanistan service–related mental disorders (ARMD), 23.6% (CI 15.5 to 31.8) with other mental disorders, and 11.1% (CI 8.9 to 13.3) without mental disorders. The adjusted Cox regression hazard ratios for career-limiting medical condition risk were 4.89 (CI 3.85 to 6.23) among individuals with ARMD and 2.31 (CI 1.48 to 3.60) with other mental disorders, relative to those without mental disorders. Conclusions: Notwithstanding the Canadian military’s mental health system investments, mental disorders (particularly ARMD) still led to a high risk of adverse military occupational outcomes. Such investments have intrinsic value but may not translate into reduced medically related attrition without improvements in prevention and treatment effectiveness.",2016.0,30.0,21.0,"{'volume': '61', 'pages': '348 - 357', 'name': 'The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Boulos2016MilitaryOO,\n author = {D.

Although some evidence suggests that adopting positive strategies is beneficial for emotional well-being, the literature is inconsistent about the effects of positive emotions on subsequent regulatory processes. In the present study, we adopted a two-week ecological momentary assessment to explore the association between positive emotions and positive emotion regulation in daily life. According to our results, the less individuals felt positive emotions at one point, the more they tended to enhance their use of positive strategies from this time to the next, which in turn resulted in subsequent higher levels of positive emotions. This prototype of positive regulation can be seen as a highly adaptive mechanism that makes it possible to compensate for a lack of positive emotions by enhancing the deployment of positive strategies. The theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.",2021.0,83.0,9.0,"{'volume': '16', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Colombo2021SavoringTP,\n author = {D.

In fact, hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment is now included in the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. However, there are children with sensory processing differences who do not meet an ASD diagnosis but do show atypical sensory behaviors to the same or greater degree as ASD children. We previously demonstrated that children with Sensory Processing Disorders (SPD) have impaired white matter microstructure, and that this white matter microstructural pathology correlates with atypical sensory behavior. In this study, we use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fiber tractography to evaluate the structural connectivity of specific white matter tracts in boys with ASD (n = 15) and boys with SPD (n = 16), relative to typically developing children (n = 23). We define white matter tracts using probabilistic streamline tractography and assess the strength of tract connectivity using mean fractional anisotropy. Both the SPD and ASD cohorts demonstrate decreased connectivity relative to controls in parieto-occipital tracts involved in sensory perception and multisensory integration. However, the ASD group alone shows impaired connectivity, relative to controls, in temporal tracts thought to subserve social-emotional processing. In addition to these group difference analyses, we take a dimensional approach to assessing the relationship between white matter connectivity and participant function. These correlational analyses reveal significant associations of white matter connectivity with auditory processing, working memory, social skills, and inattention across our three study groups. These findings help elucidate the roles of specific neural circuits in neurodevelopmental disorders, and begin to explore the dimensional relationship between critical cognitive functions and structural connectivity across affected and unaffected children.",2014.0,49.0,111.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chang2014AutismAS,\n author = {Yishin Chang and J.

Clarifying the emotive functions of asymmetrical frontal cortical activity.,"Asymmetrical activity over the frontal cortex has been implicated in the experience and expression of emotions and motivations. Explanations of the research have suggested that relatively greater left frontal activity is associated with positive affect and/or approach motivation, and that relatively greater right frontal activity is associated with negative affect and/or withdrawal motivation. In past research, affective valence and motivational direction were confounded, as only positive (negative) affects that were associated with approach (withdrawal) motivation were examined. Consequently, this research is unable to address whether asymmetrical frontal activity is associated with affective valence, motivational direction, or some combination of valence and motivation. In this article, I review research on the emotion of anger, a negative emotion often associated with approach motivation, that suggests that asymmetrical frontal cortical activity is due to motivational direction and not affective valence. Methodological and theoretical implications for the study of the frontal asymmetry specifically, and for emotion and motivation more generally, are discussed.",2003.0,103.0,526.0,"{'volume': '40 6', 'pages': '\n          838-48\n        ', 'name': 'Psychophysiology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Harmon-Jones2003EarlyCA,\n author = {E.

This essay offers a perspective on these issues by considering how emotion regulation should be defined, the various components of the management of emotion, how emotion regulation strategies fit into the dynamics of social interaction, and how individual differences in emotion regulation should be conceptualized and measured. In the end, it seems clear that emotion regulation is a conceptual rubric for a remarkable range of developmental processes, each of which may have its own catalysts and control processes. Likewise, individual differences in emotion regulation skills likely have multifaceted origins and are also related in complex ways to the person's emotional goals and the immediate demands of the situation. Assessment approaches that focus on the dynamics of emotion are well suited to elucidating these complex developmental and individual differences.

The authors studied the intrasystem interactions between these parameters and the inter- and intrapersonal emotional competencies. The high level of cybercommunicative addiction appeared to be connected with poor volitional qualities, self-regulation, and life-sense orientations. Immature inter- and intrapersonal emotional competencies, e.g. empathy, expression control, etc., indicated cybercommunicative addiction in high school students.

One dimension of context that has significance for emotion regulation is the nature of the relationship between interactive partners. This review provides an organized account of existing empirical evidence assessing emotion regulation within close relationships across the life span. Specifically, the reviewed research includes studies examining parent-child relationships, sibling relationships, friendships, and romantic relationships in relation to emotion regulation. The review highlights evidence concerning how relationship processes influence emotion regulation. Based on the current state of the literature, future directions for research in this area are recommended. This review seeks to advance a more nuanced approach to the study of the social processes associated with emotion regulation. An argument is made for how building upon research concerning the relationship context as a basis for emotion regulation can further elucidate theorizing on the determinants of emotion regulation.

However, little is known about the specific neural mechanisms implicated in regulating the distance from conspecifics versus non-social stimuli. Here, we investigated the neural correlates of personal space intrusions by social versus non-social stimuli. Thirty volunteers underwent fMRI scanning while viewing approaching or withdrawing faces (Social) and insects/arachnids (Non-social). Preferred distance to the stimuli was assessed behaviourally in a computerized task, and in real life. Results showed that approaching social and non-social stimuli of varying threat levels elicited activation of frontoparietal regions previously linked to peripersonal space, as well as of the midbrain periaqueductal gray, suggesting the engagement of defensive mechanisms by personal space intrusions. However, functional connectivity patterns of the midbrain differed for social and non-social stimuli, with enhanced coupling with the premotor cortex to approaching social stimuli. Additionally, connectivity strength between the midbrain and the premotor cortex was associated with preferred interpersonal distance. These findings highlight a common defensive architecture implicated in personal space regulation to social and non-social stimuli, and the specific neural mechanisms involved in regulating the distance from conspecifics.",2020.0,57.0,21.0,"{'volume': '15', 'pages': '36 - 51', 'name': 'Social Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vieira2020NeuralCO,\n author = {Joana B.

The popular media portrayal of the human benefits of pet ownership is often biased and overstated, oftentimes creating unrealistic expectations for pet owners. There is evidence that pets can be beneficial to the health and well-being of their owners in certain circumstances; however, there is also evidence that negative or ambivalent relationships between owners and pets can be a detriment to owner well-being, as well as a risk for shelter relinquishment (i.e., surrender) of the pet. Relinquishment due to adverse scenarios like the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may increase rates of shelter euthanasia of adoptable pets. In this study we identify the unique difficulties related to caring for pets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pet owners reported concerns related to pets, humans, and the entire household or family, inclusive of people and pets. Data from this study indicate that strength of the owner’s attachment to their pet, as well as their economic resources, and the characteristics of their household are associated with the types of concerns expressed. We discuss implications for human well-being and pet welfare, and the need to address these issues in order to prevent shelter relinquishment. Abstract Pets may be a positive presence for their owners during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, it is pertinent to identify the hardships associated with pet ownership. We conducted a large-scale survey of U.S. pet owners (n = 2254) in spring and summer 2020 to assess the ways that relationships with pets impacted life during COVID-19. We used thematic analysis to analyze 3671 open-ended responses to three prompts. Reported concerns fell into three major categories: (1) pet-focused (meeting needs of pets; procuring supplies; accessing veterinary care; new and emerging behavioral issues; fate of the pet if owner becomes ill; general safety and well-being), (2) human-focused (issues with working from home; well-being and mental health; balancing responsibilities), and (3) household-focused (disease spread; economic issues). Quantitative analyses showed that the owner’s strength of attachment to their pet, economic resources, and relationship status were associated with the types of concerns expressed. Results from this study indicate that pet owners experienced unique hardships related to changes in everyday life from the COVID-19 pandemic. These hardships should be considered alongside the potential benefits found in other studies in order to manage pet owner expectations, prevent pet relinquishment, and more fully understand multifaceted human-companion animal relationships.",2020.0,68.0,119.0,"{'volume': '10', 'name': 'Animals : an Open Access Journal from MDPI'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Applebaum2020TheCD,\n author = {Jennifer W.

The context of the workplace became an important variable in the impact of the lockdown on individuals. In this study, we deepened the categories of healthcare workers (HWs), virtual workers (VWs), and the elderly, along with their emotional approach to this emergency. A sample of 257 participants (ElderlyN = 62; HWsN = 104; VWsN = 91) completed: a semi-structured interview on their experience during lockdown via telephone; an online survey with a sociodemographic questionnaire; the Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale (DERS); and the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI).

Employment provides an important avenue to social inclusion for most adults. A range of productivity options exist for persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) who wish to work, each offering unique challenges relative to inclusion.


METHODS
This qualitative study examined the productivity experiences of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities in Ontario, Canada. A purposive sample of 74 individuals with productivity experiences spanning the spectrum of no employment to community-based jobs was selected from a pool of volunteers recruited through a mailed survey. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with individuals and family members. Interview transcripts were subjected to a team-based analysis using grounded theory methods.


RESULTS
Varying needs and interests exist in regard to work. Participants revealed a multitude of factors contributing to inclusion and exclusion through productivity.


CONCLUSIONS
Productivity, whether paid or unpaid, can be an avenue to social inclusion.

Datasets were analyzed separately and merged at the point of integration where they are arrayed side-by-side and by using a joint display. A total of eighty-eight participants from PSOs participated the survey, and nine respondents participated in the phenomenological interviews. The chi-square analysis revealed non-significant association between the respondents’ designation and their perceptions to surviving the challenges of COVID-19 in relation to challenges encountered, learning continuity, health and safety protocols, and lessons learned. Qualitative findings revealed that mitigating the challenges, pursuing learning continuity, observing stricter health and safety protocols, and learning from experiences are the best approaches to survive the challenges.

Furthermore, the iterative, pixel-wise, and sequential operations of BP make it difficult to parallelize the computation. In this paper, we propose two techniques to address these issues. The first technique is a new message passing scheme named tile-based BP that reduces the memory and bandwidth to a fraction of the ordinary BP algorithms without performance degradation by splitting the MRF into many tiles and only storing the messages across the neighboring tiles. The tile-wise processing also enables data reuse and pipeline, resulting in efficient hardware implementation. The second technique is an O(L) fast message construction algorithm that exploits the properties of robust functions for parallelization. We apply these two techniques to a very large-scale integration circuit for stereo matching that generates high-resolution disparity maps in near real-time.

This study proposes mixed reality (MR)-based human–animal interaction content along with presenting the experimental verification of its effect on the reduction of mental stress. A mental arithmetic task was employed to induce acute mental stress, which was followed by either MR content, in which a participant interacted with virtual animals via gestures and voice commands, or a slide show of animal images. During the experiment, an electrocardiogram (ECG) was continuously recorded with a patch-type, wireless ECG sensor on the chest of the subject, and their psychological state was evaluated with the help of questionnaires after each task.

From neuroscientific evidence, this mechanism is the product of conscious or unconscious processes. In particular, the mechanism generated by a conscious process needs a priori components to be computed. The behaviors generated by previous experiences are among these components. These behaviors need to be adapted to fulfill the objectives in a specific situation. The problem we address is how to endow virtual creatures with emotion regulation in order to compute an appropriate behavior in a specific emotional situation. This problem is clearly important and we have not identified ways to solve this problem in the current literature. In our proposal, we show a way to generate the appropriate behavior in an emotional situation using a learning classifier system (LCS). We illustrate the function of our proposal in unknown and known situations by means of two case studies. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to converge to the appropriate behavior even in the first case; that is, when the system does not have previous experiences and in situations where some previous information is available our proposal proves to be a very powerful tool.",2017.0,46.0,2.0,"{'name': 'Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience', 'volume': '2017'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rosales2017SearchFA,\n author = {Jonathan-Hernando Rosales and Félix F.

Virtual reality exposure therapy is an emerging treatment for specific phobias. Most virtual reality studies have investigated high-end virtual reality devices, typically only available in research and limited clinical settings for a single phobia. This study evaluated the effectiveness of oVRcome, a mobile health application combining self-guided virtual reality exposure and cognitive behaviour therapy, for five specific phobias. Methods: This is a 2-arm 6-week randomised controlled trial, with a waitlist control group and follow-up at week 12. Participants were required to live in New Zealand; be aged 18–64 years; have a fear of flying, heights, spiders, dogs and needles; score above 4 on the Brief Standard Self-rating scale for phobic patients; and have access to a smartphone and Internet. oVRcome consists of six modules of psychoeducation, relaxation, mindfulness, cognitive techniques, exposure through virtual reality and relapse prevention over 6 weeks. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to week 6 on the Severity Measures for Specific Phobia – Adults. All analyses were performed on intention-to-treat set. Results: A total of 126 participants were randomised, and 109 completed the follow-up at week 6, for a retention rate of 86.5%. The mean change in Severity Measures for Specific Phobia – Adults score from baseline to week 6 was greater in the active group compared with the waitlist group (active group −20.53 [standard deviation = 8.24]; waitlist group: − 12.31 [standard deviation = 10.66]; p < 0.001). The effect size for this difference was 0.86.

1930,ca4c47dfdcdb1f5434da4a23dbaf3ba472f8146d,A grief that cannot be shared: continuing relationships with aborted foetuses in contemporary Vietnam,"1 For Vietnamese women who undergo an abortion, the deeply distressing experience can be extenuated by the stigmatisation of abortion and the disenfranchisement of grief relating to it. Abortion is a sensitive subject in Vietnam, embedded in moral ambiguities concerning youth sexual activities and the ancestral relationship the Vietnamese have with the dead. The aborted fetus is not easily reconciled with the act of ancestor worship and questions arise as to how women express their grief and if a continuing relationship should be sustained with the aborted fetus. Based on twelve months’ ethnographic research, this article contends that some Vietnamese women are continuing a relationship with their aborted fetus within the online memorial Nghia Trang Online as a way of performing ancestor worship and expressing their grief. Through the theory of durable biography and disenfranchised grief, it will be demonstrated that a continuing relationship is formed through communication and online offerings to express grief, ask for forgiveness, share past and present experiences, and through prayer and guidance for the fetus in the otherworld. Introduction ...abortion IS BAD. In our culture people who kill their babies or abort are not treated in fairways. But actually they don't care about what others think. And those people seem unsociable, I think. But they're not worth to be helped. They have to pay for what they did... I find it so messed up about those people who aborted or killed their own babies.

(Vinh2, an English student in the outer districts of Ho Chi Minh City.) Son, how are you? There are many thoughts which are piling on me and making me tired and in a terrible mood. I want to erase everything I am thinking about and start something new. I almost can't stand it anymore. I could not sleep well last night because of these thoughts. There is no one with whom I can share my feelings and it leaves me feeling uncomfortable and lonely. If I could cry I would, but these tears have run dry. I feel as I am at a standstill. Only one thing left, my little son. If only you and I could travel far away. (Communication between a member and fetus on the Vietnamese memorial website Nghia Trang Online; translation3.) The above quotations highlight differing perceptions of abortion in Vietnam. The first is by a young man on the outskirts of Ho Chi Minh City, who feels that those who undergo abortion are morally similar to prostitutes and deserve an obliteration of societal care; an endless round of scorn should await. The second quotation illuminates online communication between a mother and her fetus, in this case a son who would never be born. The tone is reflective and insightful about her recent feelings and powerfully interweaves the living and the dead into a conjoined moment in time: while the future for them cannot be, their online communication remains. At first glance, the words could perhaps be written by any mother, anywhere. There is a familiarity to the longings and sadness examined and yet this communication is intrinsically tied to Vietnamese cosmologies relating to the dead, abortion, technology, and fundamentally to the relationship between those who abort and their unborn offspring. While there is a large body of research concerned with Vietnamese women’s suffering after an abortion (Gammeltoft 2003, 2006, 2010; Nguyen and Liamputtong 2007; Whittaker 2010), how Vietnamese use online memorials to mitigate their grief has not been studied. This article argues that abortion brings about a profound disenfranchised grief for some Vietnamese women. In the online realm however, a durable biography can be created between a mother and her fetus through direct communications and online offerings, which can help to enfranchise her grief. This article will firstly explore research concerned with the continuation of a relationship with the dead through the concept of a durable biography (Walter 1996), which is where individuals make sense of their loss through their own recollections and by conversing with others about the dead, which in turn weaves the deceased meaningfully back into their own life. Conversations and the sharing of experiences and emotions are the key elements in the continued relationships. This article will then examine the concept of disenfranchised grief (Doka 2002) – grief difficult to express in society, and not socially sanctioned – contextualising it within literature on grief following perinatal death more widely. For those who experience pregnancy loss through abortion, miscarriage, stillbirth, or other pregnancy complications4, it FINNISH DEATH STUDIES ASSOCIATION SPRING 2014 www.thanatos-journal.com, ISSN 2242-6280 30(180) 2 To protect anonymity minor details concerning informants, members, and those memorialised on Nghia Trang Online have been changed. Pseudonyms have also been utilized. 3 Vietnamese translated to English has been noted at the end of quotes. All other quotes are verbatim. Translations in this work are the authors. 4 While I am aware that the experiences of abortion and other forms of pregnancy loss may be profoundly different, for the purposes of this article, abortion and other pregnancy loss constitute a broader context of loss around issues embedded in the memorialisation process, including: the disenfranchisement of grief, the lack of long-term support, and the ambiguity of the body and personhood of the fetus. I weave in these other forms of perinatal loss to help compliment the theory more thoroughly as there is limited research concerning abortion and online memorialisation. can be a devastating experience extenuated by disenfranchised grief. This section will demonstrate that in online memorials members can powerfully enfranchise their grief, remember their fetus and connect with others to discuss the deceased and find support. An overview of the project, the methodology utilised, the field site and the informant selection will then be presented. Moving on, attitudes towards abortion and youth sexual practices are analysed in relation to ancestor worship, which is the main relationship Vietnamese have with the dead, to demonstrate significant reasons it is difficult to continue a relationship with an aborted fetus in Vietnam. Many Vietnamese believe that an aborted fetus will “haunt” those responsible and lead to future fertility difficulties. In the face of such a powerful cosmology of the dead, the question becomes, how can Vietnamese women remember their fetus? One possible way, which is the final focus of this article, is through a continued relationship online, as Vietnamese women5 who have undergone an abortion visit the online memorial site Nghia Trang Online (NTO) to create a tomb for their fetus. It will be argued that members use online communication and offerings to engage in ancestor worship, express grief to the fetus, ask for forgiveness, and pray and guide the fetus in the otherworld. Through these interactions, a durable biography (Walter 1996) is created which reincorporates the fetuses back into the world of the living. Continuing Bonds, Durable Biography and Disenfranchised Grief While death ends a physical relationship, research has recognised the important bonds which can continue between the living and the dead (Francis et al. 2005; Howarth 2000; Klass et al. 1996; Valentine 2008; Walter 1996). This was not always so: previous influential psychological, psychoanalytical and psychiatric models of grief and bereavement argued that after death, survivors had to detach themselves from relations with the dead through the untangling of emotional ties (Parkes 1986; see Klass et al. 1996, 5–14 for discussion). Such a paradigm defined the process of grief as being something which needed “to be eventually ‘resolved’ by ‘detaching’, ‘letting go’ and ‘moving on’” to new relationships (Walter 1999, xi). Indeed, Dennis Klass, Phyllis Silverman and Steven Nikman note: The view of grief most accepted in this century holds that for successful mourning to take place the mourner must disengage from the deceased, and let go of the past...(T)o experience a continuing bond with the deceased in the present has been thought of as symptomatic of psychological problems. (Klass et al.1996, 4) Klass et al. (1996) coined the term continuing bonds to express the meaningful ways individuals could continue a relationship with the dead, and were in part responsible for the shift in bereavement literature which argued that the dead could be incorporated back into the life of the living. In the same year as this transformative research into continuing bonds, Tony Walter (1996) proposed the theory of durable biography that also interrogated previous grief and bereavement scholarship. Using personal experiences of loss through the deaths of his father and girlfriend, Walter demonstrated how we shape our understandings of the FINNISH DEATH STUDIES ASSOCIATION SPRING 2014 www.thanatos-journal.com, ISSN 2242-6280 31(180) 5 Vietnamese women were not alone in their online interactions (other informants included the father, friends and sometimes other family), but for the purpose of this article I concentrate on the experiences of women.

Results revealed larger amplitude late positive brain potentials during the evaluative categorization of (a) positive and negative stimuli as compared with neutral stimuli and (b) negative as compared with positive stimuli, even though both were equally probable, evaluatively extreme, and arousing.

Data from 523 participants were collected in a single night. The exploratory experiment was designed as a collective computer game where players manipulated mental states of relaxation and concentration with neurofeedback targeting modulation of relative spectral power in alpha and beta frequency ranges. Besides validating robust time-of-night effects, gender differences and distinct spectral power patterns for the two mental states, our results also show differences in neurofeedback learning outcome. The unusually large sample size allowed us to detect unprecedented speed of learning changes in the power spectrum (~ 1 min). Moreover, we found that participants' baseline brain activity predicted subsequent neurofeedback beta training, indicating state-dependent learning.

1942,cbade4dcdfd67decc7ed8f47eff669e478e2b0ae,Long-term health correlates of timing of sexual debut: results from a national US study.,"OBJECTIVES
We explored long-term health consequences of age at sexual initiation and of abstinence until marriage to evaluate empirical support for the claim that postponing sexual initiation has beneficial health effects.


METHODS
We analyzed data from the 1996 National Sexual Health Survey, a cross-sectional study of the US adult population. We compared sexual health outcomes among individuals who had initiated sexual activity at an early or late age versus a normative age. We also compared individuals whose first sexual intercourse had occurred before versus after marriage.


RESULTS
Early initiation of sexual intercourse was associated with various sexual risk factors, including increased numbers of sexual partners and recent sexual intercourse under the influence of alcohol, whereas late initiation was associated with fewer risk factors. However, both early and late initiation were associated with sexual problems such as problems with arousal and orgasm, primarily among men. Relationship solidity and sexual relationship satisfaction were not associated with early or late initiation.


CONCLUSIONS
Early sexual debut is associated with certain long-term negative sexual health outcomes, including increased sexual risk behaviors and problems in sexual functioning. Late initiation was also associated with sexual problems, especially among men. Further research is needed to understand how sexual initiation patterns affect later health outcomes.",2008.0,55.0,358.0,"{'volume': '98 1', 'pages': '\n          155-61\n        ', 'name': 'American journal of public health'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sandfort2008LongtermHC,\n author = {T.

Although psychotherapy can reduce symptoms, some military members may experience treatment-resistant PTSD. Multimodular motion-assisted memory desensitization and reconsolidation (3MDR) has been introduced as a virtual reality (VR) intervention for military members with PTSD related to military service. The 3MDR intervention incorporates exposure therapy, psychotherapy, eye movement desensitization and reconsolidation, VR, supportive counselling, and treadmill walking. Objective The objective of this study is to investigate whether 3MDR reduces PTSD symptoms among military members with combat-related treatment-resistant PTSD (TR-PTSD); examine the technology acceptance and usability of the Computer Assisted Rehabilitation ENvironment (CAREN) and 3MDR interventions by Canadian Armed Forces service members (CAF-SMs), veterans, 3MDR clinicians, and operators; and evaluate the impact on clinicians and operators of delivering 3MDR. Methods This is a mixed-methods waitlist controlled crossover design randomized controlled trial. Participants include both CAF-SMs and veterans (N=40) aged 18-60 years with combat-related TR-PTSD (unsuccessful experience of at least 2 evidence-based trauma treatments). Participants will also include clinicians and operators (N=12) who have been trained in 3MDR and subsequently utilized this intervention with patients. CAF-SMs and veterans will receive 6 weekly 90-minute 3MDR sessions. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months postintervention. Quantitative data collection will include multiomic biomarkers (ie, blood and salivary proteomic and genomic profiles of neuroendocrine, immune-inflammatory mediators, and microRNA), eye tracking, electroencephalography, and physiological data. Data from outcome measures will capture self-reported symptoms of PTSD, moral injury, resilience, and technology acceptance and usability. Qualitative data will be collected from audiovisual recordings of 3MDR sessions and semistructured interviews. Data analysis will include univariate and multivariate approaches, and thematic analysis of treatment sessions and interviews. Machine learning analysis will be included to develop models for the prediction of diagnosis, symptom severity, and treatment outcomes. Results This study commenced in April 2019 and is planned to conclude in April 2021. Study results will guide the further evolution and utilization of 3MDR for military members with TR-PTSD and will have utility in treating other trauma-affected populations. Conclusions The goal of this study is to utilize qualitative and quantitative primary and secondary outcomes to provide evidence for the effectiveness and feasibility of 3MDR for treating CAF-SMs and veterans with combat-related TR-PTSD. The results will inform a full-scale clinical trial and stimulate development and adaptation of the protocol to mobile VR apps in supervised clinical settings. This study will add to knowledge of the clinical effectiveness of 3MDR, and provide the first comprehensive analysis of biomarkers, technology acceptance and usability, moral injury, resilience, and the experience of clinicians and operators delivering 3MDR.

Subjects rated the happiness of either (a) schematic drawings of faces or (b) life events as expressed in short verbal descriptions. The relative frequency of these stimuli was manipulated experimentally, as was the number of rating categories. Consistent with psychophysical research, ratings became less sensitive to differences in the frequencies of contextual stimuli as the number of categories increased (the category effect). With more categories, ratings also showed less adjustment to the range of stimuli actually presented. The reduction in adjustment was greater when stimuli were presented successively and when the experimental set covered a limited range. These effects of varying the number of categories were interpreted as reflecting changes in the effective context for judgment: With more categories, the differences between the effective frequencies of contextual stimuli are reduced and new, more extreme comparison values are evoked. The implications of using coarse versus fine scales of judgment are discussed in terms of the dynamics of social judgment as well as choice of the appropriate number of categories in social research. We argue that selection of the number of rating categories should be guided by research objectives rather than by a search for ""true"" judgments.",1988.0,77.0,72.0,"{'volume': '55 3', 'pages': '\n          341-56\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wedell1988TheCE,\n author = {D.

In particular, the authors were interested in the role of personal support when completing a computerized treatment. Following a literature search and coding, the authors included 12 studies, with a total of 2446 participants. Ten of the 12 studies were delivered via the Internet. The mean effect size of the 15 comparisons between Internet-based and other computerized psychological treatments vs. control groups at posttest was d = 0.41 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.29–0.54).

Boredom is considered as a main unpleasant emotional state at the workplace, which could lead to stress, depression and decreased well-being. Boredom is related to the situation at hand and may lead to decreased performance. We frame the situation by connecting socio-emotional and cognitive conflict and individual differences to shed light onto the function of boredom. We look at the relation of boredom to theoretically connected emotions and their regulation. We conducted an online experiment in a virtual workplace setting (N = 57). We induced a socio-emotional and cognitive conflict situation by using a socially interactive agent which shames participants. Individual differences were operationalised through social identity and self-consciousness. We tested how social identity (predictor) and self-consciousness (moderator) influence cognitive appraisal of threat (mediator) and boredom (outcome). The results revealed that self-consciousness moderates the effect of social identity on cognitive appraisal of threat which then mediates the effect of social identity on boredom.",2021.0,0.0,0.0,"{'name': '2021 9th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction Workshops and Demos (ACIIW)', 'pages': '1-8'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chehayeb2021IndividualDA,\n author = {Lara Chehayeb and Dimitra Tsovaltzi and Rhythm Arora and Patrick Gebhard},\n booktitle = {2021 9th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction Workshops and Demos (ACIIW)},\n journal = {2021 9th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction Workshops and Demos (ACIIW)},\n pages = {1-8},\n title = {Individual Differences and the Function of Emotions in Socio-Emotional and Cognitive Conflict: If an Agent Shames you, will you still be Bored?},\n year = {2021}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2149701012', 'name': 'Lara Chehayeb'}, {'authorId': '1722662', 'name': 'Dimitra Tsovaltzi'}, {'authorId': '31428092', 'name': 'Rhythm Arora'}, {'authorId': '48785659', 'name': 'Patrick Gebhard'}]"

Classrooms with warm teacher-child relationships support deep learning and positive social and emotional development among students, writes Kimberly Schonert-Reichl. But when teachers poorly manage the social and emotional demands of teaching, students' academic achievement and behavior both suffer. If we don't accurately understand teachers' own social-emotional wellbeing and how teachers influence students' SEL, says Schonert-Reichl, we can never fully know how to promote SEL in the classroom.How can we boost teachers' social-emotional competence, and how can we help them create the kind of classroom environment that promotes students' SEL? Teachers are certainly at risk for poor social-emotional wellbeing. Research shows that teaching is one of the most stressful occupations; moreover, stress in the classroom is contagious—simply put, stressed-out teachers tend to have stressed-out students. In the past few years, several interventions have specifically sought to improve teachers' social-emotional competence and stress management in school, and Schonert-Reichly reviews the results, many of which are promising.She also shows how teachers' beliefs—about their own teaching efficacy, or about whether they receive adequate support, for example—influence the fidelity with which they implement SEL programs in the classroom. When fidelity is low, SEL programs are less successful. Finally, she examines the extent to which US teacher education programs prepare teacher candidates to promote their own and their students' social-emotional competence, and she argues that we can and should do much more.",2019.0,59.0,253.0,"{'volume': '27', 'pages': '137 - 155', 'name': 'The Future of Children'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Schonert-Reichl2019SocialAE,\n author = {K.

Besides face‐to‐face interaction, nowadays, relationships are also initiated and maintained in cyberspace. Some studies suggest that emotional content is present in cyber‐behavior. The objective of this study was to reveal whether emotions are expressed, perceived and managed online ‐ a concept called E‐motions, and to validate an instrument to measure this concept. Method: The E‐motions Questionnaire was designed and together with other instruments, completed by 612 university students. Then, the questionnaire was completed by a representative sample of 2139 students in compulsory secondary education in 22 schools in all Andalusian provinces. The first sample was used for exploratory factor analysis and the second sample for confirmatory factor analysis. Results: The E‐motions Questionnaire was validated with good psychometric properties. Four factors were found showing that emotions are perceived, expressed, used, understood and managed online. This behavior is related to some aspects of emotional intelligence and also to difficulties in identifying feelings. Conclusions: This new promising research field could be useful for further advancement of research into cyber‐behavior. Resumen Contenido emocional en el ciberespacio: desarrollo y validación del Cuestionario E‐mociones en adolescentes y jóvenes. Antecedentes: estudios sobre la inteligencia emocional muestran que algunas de sus dimensiones están relacionadas con el ajuste psicológico y la calidad de relaciones interpersonales. Además de las interacciones cara a cara, las relaciones se inician y mantienen también en el ciberespacio. Algunos estudios sugieren que el contenido emocional está presente en la ciberconducta. El objetivo del estudio fue descubrir si las emociones se expresan, perciben y gestionan online‐ concepto denominado E‐mociones y validar un instrumento para medirlo. Método: se diseñó un Cuestionario de E‐mociones que, con otros instrumentos, fue completado por 612 estudiantes universitarios. Posteriormente, dicho cuestionario fue respondido por una muestra representativa de 2.139 alumnos de la educación secundaria matriculados en 22 escuelas de todas las provincias andaluzas.

The aim of this study is to examine the effects of mindfulness training for adolescents with autism spectrum disorder, combined with Mindful Parenting training. Method: A total of 23 adolescents with autism spectrum disorder, referred to a mental health clinic, received nine weekly sessions of mindfulness training in group format. Their parents (18 mothers, 11 fathers) participated in parallel Mindful Parenting training. A pre-test, post-test, and 9-week follow-up design was used. Data were analyzed using multi-level analyses. Results: Attendance rate was 88% for adolescents and fathers and 86% for mothers. Adolescents reported an increase in quality of life and a decrease in rumination, but no changes in worry, autism spectrum disorder core symptoms, or mindful awareness. Although parents reported no change in adolescent’s autism spectrum disorder core symptoms, they reported improved social responsiveness, social communication, social cognition, preoccupations, and social motivation. About themselves, parents reported improvement in general as well as in parental mindfulness. They reported improved competence in parenting, overall parenting styles, more specifically a less lax, verbose parenting style, and an increased quality of life. Discussion: Mindfulness training for adolescents with autism spectrum disorder combined with Mindful Parenting is feasible. Although the sample size was small and no control group was included, the first outcomes of this innovative training are positive.",2015.0,54.0,121.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '906 - 914', 'name': 'Autism'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bruin2015MYmindMT,\n author = {E.

Distinguishing between treatment responders vs. non-responders in this population has become an important public health priority. This study was conducted to identify pre-treatment characteristics of U.S. veterans with combat-related PTSD that might contribute to favorable and unfavorable responses to high value treatments for this condition. Method This study focused on 805 patients who completed a VHA PTSD residential program between 2000 and 2007. These patients completed the PTSD Clinical Checklist at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and a four-month follow-up assessment. Latent growth curve analysis (LCGA) was incorporated to determine trajectories of changes in PTSD across these assessments and whether several key clinical concerns for this population were associated with their treatment responses. Study Findings LCGA indicated three distinct trajectories in PTSD outcomes and identified several clinical factors that were prospectively linked with changes in veterans' posttraumatic symptomatology. When compared to a group with high PTSD symptom severity that decreased over the program but relapsed at follow-up (41%), the near half (48.8%) of the sample with an improving trajectory had less combat exposure and superior physical/mental health. However, when compared to a minority (10.2%) with relatively low symptomatology that also remained somewhat stable, patients in the improving group were younger and also reported greater combat exposure, poorer physical/mental health status, and more problems with substance abuse before the start of treatment. Conclusions Findings suggest that veterans are most likely to benefit from residential treatment in an intermediate range of symptoms and risk factors, including PTSD symptom severity, history of combat exposure, and comorbid issues with physical/mental health. Addressing these factors in an integrative manner could help to optimize the effectiveness of treatments of combat-related PTSD in many cases.",2014.0,78.0,49.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Currier2014ResidentialTF,\n author = {J.

Platform cannot be managed in a goal-oriented fashion because the number of actors and relationships between them increases beyond the ability of what the platform owner can handle. However, a platform can be orchestrated by designing and facilitating processes taking place among participants. In this conceptual paper, we review the literature on platforms and participant roles.

In Study 1, participants viewed cartoons depicting a happy, sad, angry, or neutral person surrounded by other people expressing the same emotion as the central person or a different one. The surrounding people's emotions influenced Japanese but not Westerners' perceptions of the central person. These differences reflect differences in attention, as indicated by eye-tracking data (Study 2): Japanese looked at the surrounding people more than did Westerners.

Prior work in individual psychology, however, suggests that holistic experiences with technology as captured in constructs such as enjoyment and flow are potentially important explanatory variables in technology acceptance theories. In this paper, we describe a multi-dimensional construct labeled cognitive absorption and defined as a state of deep involvement with software. Cognitive absorption, theorized as being exhibited through the five dimensions of 
 
temporal dissociation, focused immersion, heightened enjoyment, control, and curiosity, is posited to be a proximal antecedent of two important beliefs about technology use: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. In addition, we propose that the individual traits of playfulness and personal innovativeness are important determinants of cognitive absorption. Based on the conceptual definition of this construct, operational measures for each dimension are developed. Using the World Wide Web as the target technology, scale validation indicates that the operational measures have acceptable psychometric properties and confirmatory factor analysis supports the proposed multi-dimensional structure. Structural equation analysis provides evidence for the theorized nomological net of cognitive absorption.

We describe a new rating scale to assess resilience. The Connor‐Davidson Resilience scale (CD‐RISC) comprises of 25 items, each rated on a 5‐point scale (0–4), with higher scores reflecting greater resilience. The scale was administered to subjects in the following groups: community sample, primary care outpatients, general psychiatric outpatients, clinical trial of generalized anxiety disorder, and two clinical trials of PTSD. The reliability, validity, and factor analytic structure of the scale were evaluated, and reference scores for study samples were calculated. Sensitivity to treatment effects was examined in subjects from the PTSD clinical trials. The scale demonstrated good psychometric properties and factor analysis yielded five factors. A repeated measures ANOVA showed that an increase in CD‐RISC score was associated with greater improvement during treatment. Improvement in CD‐RISC score was noted in proportion to overall clinical global improvement, with greatest increase noted in subjects with the highest global improvement and deterioration in CD‐RISC score in those with minimal or no global improvement. The CD‐RISC has sound psychometric properties and distinguishes between those with greater and lesser resilience. The scale demonstrates that resilience is modifiable and can improve with treatment, with greater improvement corresponding to higher levels of global improvement.

Further, teachers are much more confident that they can communicate their positive emotions than reduce their negative emotions, and they use a variety of emotion regulation strategies, including preventive and reactive methods.

Since its formal introduction in the DSM‐III in 1980, knowledge has grown significantly regarding its causes, maintaining mechanisms and treatments. Despite this increased understanding, however, the actual definition of the disorder remains controversial. The DSM‐5 and ICD‐11 define the disorder differently, reflecting disagreements in the field about whether the construct of PTSD should encompass a broad array of psychological manifestations that arise after trauma or should be focused more specifically on trauma memory phenomena. This controversy over clarifying the phenotype of PTSD has limited the capacity to identify biomarkers and specific mechanisms of traumatic stress. This review provides an up‐to‐date outline of the current definitions of PTSD, its known prevalence and risk factors, the main models to explain the disorder, and evidence‐supported treatments. A major conclusion is that, although trauma‐focused cognitive behavior therapy is the best‐validated treatment for PTSD, it has stagnated over recent decades, and only two‐thirds of PTSD patients respond adequately to this intervention. Moreover, most people with PTSD do not access evidence‐based treatment, and this situation is much worse in low‐ and middle‐income countries.

Organisations have had to make provision for staff to operate remotely following the implementation of lockdown regulations around the world, because the pandemic has led to restrictions on movement and the temporary closure of workplace premises. The purpose of this paper is to provide insights from remote workers' experiences in South Africa about immediate conversion from the normal workplace environment to working remotely from home. The structuration theory was adopted to understand the social structural challenges experienced by staff working from home.Design/methodology/approachData were collected using a Web-based survey, administered when the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in movement restrictions, using the judgemental sampling technique.FindingsThe results are presented using both external and internal features that are linked to the social structures experienced by remote workers who participated in the survey. The key findings indicate that despite the positive aspects of remote working using advances in technology, there are also negative aspects and risks attached to remote working such as work overload and pressures to perform timeously. This can pose severe threats to workers' routines and lifestyle, and the lack of interaction can impinge on their health and general well-being.Research limitations/implicationsThe online survey was carried out with first-time remote workers who were the target for the study. Some respondents may have had an affinity for remote working because of the novelty. The sample size may not be generalised, as the collected sample is moderately small, although the purpose of the paper was to report on a small sample size, given the rapidity of the study.Practical implicationsThe paper seeks to highlight social structures that exist in South Africa, which accentuate the resource divide for remote workers. Also, the paper aims to encourage organisations (employers) to better understand challenges that workers encountered while working from their homes during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown restrictions.Originality/valueThe relevance of this paper is in its contribution to the structuration theory and remote working literature, as well as to the study of these topics in the context of South Africa.",2020.0,55.0,49.0,{'name': 'International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Matli2020TheCW,\n author = {W.

There has additionally been an increase in depression due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Behavioral activation is considered an evidence-based treatment for MDD. However, there are many barriers that could hinder one’s ability to engage in behavioral activation, with COVID-19 “shelter-in-place” and social distancing orders being current and large impediments. Virtual reality (VR) has been successfully used to help treat a variety of mental health conditions, but it has not yet been used as a method of administering behavioral activation to a clinical population. Using VR to engage in behavioral activation could eliminate barriers that pandemic precautions place and help decrease symptoms of depression that are especially exacerbated in these times. Objective The following case report examines the feasibility, acceptability, and tolerability of VR behavioral activation for an adult with MDD during a global pandemic. This participant was part of a larger pilot study, and the case serves as a description of the VR intervention. Methods The participant engaged in a weekly 50-minute psychotherapy Zoom session for 4 weeks, in which a modified behavioral activation protocol was administered using a VR headset to simulate activities. Data on mood ratings, homework compliance, and headset use were obtained from the headset. Acceptability, tolerability, and depression symptoms were obtained using self-report rating scales. Results The intervention was feasible, acceptable, and tolerable, as reported by this participant. The participant’s depressive symptoms decreased by five-points on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 over a month, with a beginning score of 10 (moderate depression) and a final score of 5 (mild depression). Conclusions The implications of these findings for future research are discussed.

It is plausible that the stressors of having a child with ASD affect the couple relationship; however, few researchers have focused on this dynamic within these families. In this article, we seek to develop a model for how stress operates in families with children with ASD. In developing this new stress model, we describe the characteristics of ASD, discuss stressors that are pronounced in families of children with ASD as supported by the literature, and highlight the limitations of Perry's (2004) model in application to this population. Our expanded stress model includes the addition of parenting couple resources and parenting couple outcomes. Finally, we demonstrate how to apply the model using a mindfulness intervention to promote positive outcomes and strengthen the couple relationship.",2013.0,111.0,93.0,"{'volume': '5 3', 'pages': '\n          194-213\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of family theory & review'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bluth2013ASM,\n author = {K.

1984,cf85f8697463875964ccd34636f742f860505411,The dual process model of coping with bereavement: rationale and description.,"There are shortcomings in traditional theorizing about effective ways of coping with bereavement, most notably, with respect to the so-called ""grief work hypothesis."" Criticisms include imprecise definition, failure to represent dynamic processing that is characteristic of grieving, lack of empirical evidence and validation across cultures and historical periods, and a limited focus on intrapersonal processes and on health outcomes. Therefore, a revised model of coping with bereavement, the dual process model, is proposed. This model identifies two types of stressors, loss- and restoration-oriented, and a dynamic, regulatory coping process of oscillation, whereby the grieving individual at times confronts, at other times avoids, the different tasks of grieving. This model proposes that adaptive coping is composed of confrontation--avoidance of loss and restoration stressors. It also argues the need for dosage of grieving, that is, the need to take respite from dealing with either of these stressors, as an integral part of adaptive coping. Empirical research to support this conceptualization is discussed, and the model's relevance to the examination of complicated grief, analysis of subgroup phenomena, as well as interpersonal coping processes, is described.",1999.0,75.0,1885.0,"{'volume': '23 3', 'pages': '\n          197-224\n        ', 'name': 'Death studies'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Stroebe1999TheDP,\n author = {M.

A mixed-methods study was conducted with 13 residents of varying cognitive capacity in a residential aged care facility (RACF) operated by a not-for-profit organization in Brisbane, Australia. Residents participated in one facilitated VR session, either as a group or individual session. Residents' mood and apathy were measured by the Observed Emotion Rating Scale (OERS) and the Person-Environment Apathy Rating Scale. Residents also completed a structured interview to provide their feedback after the VR session. In addition, four RACF staff members were interviewed about their experience of using the VR in residents and the ongoing feasibility. The experience of VR administered by a researcher and leisure and lifestyle coordinator as a leisure activity, significantly reduced apathy in residents (Z = -2.818, p = 0.005) through observations of increased facial expression, eye contact, physical engagement, verbal tone, and expression. The study did not find a VR impact on the OERS measures; no significant increase in fear/anxiety was observed. Reminiscence was clearly observed in six of the nine residents with the ability to verbally communicate. VR was found not to be helpful in residents during episodes of acute neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms. This study suggested feasibility of using fully immersive VR delivered by mobile phone technologies. It provides preliminary data for a controlled trial presently underway examining the effectiveness of VR as a group activity in RAC to improve mood states, behavioral symptoms, and pro re nata psychotropic medication use.

It is fundamental to human experience and rational decision-making. There is a great interest for detecting emotions automatically. A number of techniques have been employed for this purpose using channels such as voice and facial expressions. However, these channels are not very accurate because they can be affected by users' intentions. Other techniques use physiological signals along with electroencephalography (EEG) for emotion detection. However, these approaches are not very practical for real time applications because they either ask the participants to reduce any motion and facial muscle movement or reject EEG data contaminated with artifacts. In this paper, we propose an approach that analyzes highly contaminated EEG data produced from a new emotion elicitation technique. We also use a feature selection mechanism to extract features that are relevant to the emotion detection task based on neuroscience findings.

Even “micro-doses” of natural scenery can provide beneficial effects in situations where more extensive interactions with nature are not feasible. In the current study, we evaluated the use of virtual reality (VR) for delivering interactive nature-based content with the goal of prompting active engagement and improving mood states in older adults. Research Design and Methods The researchers developed a novel VR environment that combined 360-degree videos of natural areas and botanical gardens with interactive digital features that allowed users to engage with aspects of the environment. We recruited 50 older adults to try out this VR environment and measured changes in mood states and attitudes toward VR from before versus after the sessions. We controlled for variables such as age, education level, and exposure to nature in everyday life, and we looked for differences in responses to the VR among participants with cognitive impairments (CIs) versus without, and participants with physical disabilities versus without. Results The findings indicated significant improvements in “good” mood and “calm” mood dimensions after exposure to the VR, as well as improvements in attitudes toward the technology. These positive outcomes were significantly greater for participants with physical disabilities compared to those without disabilities. No differences were found in the responses of participants with CIs versus those without. Exit interviews provided a variety of helpful suggestions about ways to improve the VR equipment design and content to meet the needs of an older adult population. Discussion and Implications The study demonstrates that VR can provide a cost-effective, noninvasive, and nonpharmaceutical approach for improving the lives of older adults in both clinical and recreational settings, particularly when real-world access to nature is limited.",2022.0,125.0,12.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'Innovation in Aging'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kalantari2022UsingAN,\n author = {S.

1997,d0d0ed82ff5f198edd2ceb26541996a0ff3653d6,Augmented control of an avatar using an SSVEP based BCI,"The demonstration shows the usage of an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) for the real-time control of an avatar in World of Warcraft. Visitors can test the installation during the conference after about 5 minutes of training time. World of Warcraft is a common Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) in which the player controls an avatar in a virtual environment.
 The user has to wear newly developed dry EEG electrodes which are connected to a biosignal amplifier. Then the data is transmitted to a computer to perform the real-time analysis of the EEG data. The BCI system is using steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) as control signal. Therefore the system shows different icons flickering with different frequencies. If the user focuses now on one of the icons the flickering frequency is visible in the EEG data and can be extracted with frequency analysis algorithms.
 In order to control an avatar in World of Warcraft it is necessary to have 4 control icons that are analyzed in real-time. Three icons are necessary to turn left or right or to move forward. Additionally a 4th icon is required to perform certain actions like grasping objects, attacking other objects....like shown in Figure 1. The visual stimulation took place via a 60Hz LCD-display with flickering frequencies of 15, 12, 10 and 8.57Hz in combination with an underlying video.
 To visualize the flickering controls a BCI-Overlay library based on OpenGL was implemented, which can be used by any graphics application. It provides the possibility to generate BCI controls within a virtual reality environment or as overlays in combination with video sequences
 Figure 2 shows the components of the complete system. The user is connected with 8 EEG electrodes to the BCI system that is running under Windows and MATLAB. The BCI system uses the minimum energy algorithm and a linear discriminant analysis to determine if the user is looking at one of the icons or if the user is not attending.
 Via a UDP communication channel the BCI system is controlling the BCI-Overlay module that generates the 4 flickering icons around the WoW User Interface. If the BCI system detects a certain command it is transmitted to the game controller which generates the corresponding WoW command. This is straight forward for the left, right and move forward commands, but more complicated for the action command. Action commands are context dependant and the controller has to select certain possible actions. Finally the command is transmitted to WoW and the avatar performs the action.
 This allows the user to play WoW with the BCI system only by thought.",2012.0,0.0,23.0,{'pages': '27'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Kapeller2012AugmentedCO,\n author = {C. Kapeller and C.

This disorder, in addition to its main symptoms, creates significant difficulties in education, social performance, and personal relationships. Given the importance of rehabilitation for these patients to combat the above issues, the use of virtual reality (VR) technology is helpful. The aim of this study was to highlight the opportunities for VR in the rehabilitation of children with ADHD. This narrative review was conducted by searching for articles in scientific databases and e-Journals, using keywords including VR, children, and ADHD. Various studies have shown that VR capabilities in the rehabilitation of children with ADHD include providing flexibility in accordance with the patients' requirements; removing distractions and creating an effective and safe environment away from real-life dangers; saving time and money; increasing patients' incentives based on their interests; providing suitable tools to perform different behavioral tests and increase ecological validity; facilitating better understanding of individuals' cognitive deficits and improving them; helping therapists with accurate diagnosis, assessment, and rehabilitation; and improving working memory, executive function, and cognitive processes such as attention in these children. Rehabilitation of children with ADHD is based on behavior and physical patterns and is thus suitable for VR interventions. This technology, by simulating and providing a virtual environment for diagnosis, training, monitoring, assessment and treatment, is effective in providing optimal rehabilitation of children with ADHD.",2017.0,67.0,82.0,"{'volume': '60', 'pages': '337 - 343', 'name': 'Korean Journal of Pediatrics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bashiri2017TheOO,\n author = {Azadeh Bashiri and M.

Study 1 uses a survey that is analyzed with structural equation modeling. Study 2 is qualitative and offers corroborating evidence for the proposed theoretical model. Study 3 extends the model with a more naturalistic sample and tests several alternative hypotheses using hierarchical regression. The results suggest that when a human brand enhances a person's feelings of autonomy and relatedness and does not suppress feelings of competence, the person is likely to become more strongly attached to it. This article documents that strong attachments are predictive of satisfied, trusting, and committed relationships and proposes that attachment strength may be a parsimonious proxy for consumer–brand relationship strength. The results imply that benefits would accrue to organizations such as entertainment firms and political parties that establish direct and routine interaction between human brands and consumers, that human brands to which consumers are attached offer significant potential as endorsers, and that organizations should address how to make the human brands they manage more authentic.",2006.0,68.0,901.0,"{'volume': '70', 'pages': '104 - 119', 'name': 'Journal of Marketing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Thomson2006HumanBI,\n author = {Matthew Thomson},\n journal = {Journal of Marketing},\n pages = {104 - 119},\n title = {Human Brands: Investigating Antecedents to Consumers’ Strong Attachments to Celebrities},\n volume = {70},\n year = {2006}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '49652901', 'name': 'Matthew Thomson'}]"

Method: In this within-group mixed-methods study, 96 young adults practiced both VR- and non-VR-guided meditations and reported on their experience of positive affect (PA), negative affect (NA), other meditative experiences and perceived satisfaction-credibility of each meditation. Results: Participants reported more PA and greater perceived satisfaction-credibility following the VR as compared to non-VR-guided meditations primarily when the VR meditation was practiced first, before the non-VR meditation, as opposed to vice versa. The experience of NA during meditation practice was infrequent, although persons with increased PTSD symptoms reported increased distress during both VR and non-VR meditation. Conclusions: Further study of therapeutic applications of VR as an aid to meditation practice among people with PTSD symptoms is warranted.

However, despite encouraging outcomes from early stage research, a consensus for the best way to develop and evaluate VR treatments within a scientific framework is needed. Objective We aimed to develop a methodological framework with input from an international working group in order to guide the design, implementation, analysis, interpretation, and communication of trials that develop and test VR treatments. Methods A group of 21 international experts was recruited based on their contributions to the VR literature. The resulting Virtual Reality Clinical Outcomes Research Experts held iterative meetings to seek consensus on best practices for the development and testing of VR treatments. Results The interactions were transcribed, and key themes were identified to develop a scientific framework in order to support best practices in methodology of clinical VR trials. Using the Food and Drug Administration Phase I-III pharmacotherapy model as guidance, a framework emerged to support three phases of VR clinical study designs—VR1, VR2, and VR3. VR1 studies focus on content development by working with patients and providers through the principles of human-centered design. VR2 trials conduct early testing with a focus on feasibility, acceptability, tolerability, and initial clinical efficacy. VR3 trials are randomized, controlled studies that evaluate efficacy against a control condition. Best practice recommendations for each trial were provided.

Over the last decade, there has been a rapid growth in the provision of counselling services associated with British primary care services. A study was designed involving qualitative methods of data collection (semi-structured interviews) and analysis (a grounded theory approach). Counsellors were recruited from two cities in Southern Britain (Plymouth and Southampton). Twenty nine (76% response rate) counsellors agreed to participate (Southampton n = 15, Plymouth, n = 14). Semi-structured face-to-face audio-taped interviews elicited information about their perceptions of the appropriateness of general practitioner referrals, counselling strategies and models of bereavement. Analysis indicated that counsellors saw bereavement counselling within a broader agenda of work concerned with loss and relationship management. Many drew on eclectic approaches to bereavement counselling and specific strategies included: facilitating telling of the 'story' of the loss; engaging in active listening and valuing allowing people to talk; establishing a supportive relationship; and enabling the bereaved person to deal with unfinished business and to say 'goodbye'. Counsellors drew on implicit stage/phase models of grief that assumed levels of distress reduced over time.

Para este propósito se definieron tres objetivos específicos: 1) identificar cuáles situaciones o condiciones del ambiente académico resultan más estresantes, 2) caracterizar las reacciones fisiológicas, psicológicas y comportamentales, y 3) conocer las estrategias de afrontamiento más frecuentes.
Método: se desarrolló una investigación con enfoque cuantitativo, transversal y de nivel descriptivo con una muestra de 450 estudiantes de tres universidades de Medellín y el Valle de Aburrá (dos instituciones privadas y una pública) utilizando el Inventario SISCO del Estrés Académico.
Resultados: para la categoría Situaciones y condiciones estresantes, el ítem con más porcentaje en la clasificación alto fue el de Sobrecarga de tareas y trabajos escolares. Para la categoría Reacciones físicas, el ítem con más porcentaje en la clasificación alto fue el de Inquietud (este ítem presentó diferencias según la edad). Para la categoría Reacciones psicológicas, el ítem con más porcentaje en la clasificación alto fue el de Somnolencia o mayor necesidad de dormir. Para la categoría Reacciones comportamentales, el ítem con más porcentaje en la clasificación alto fue el de Aumento o reducción del consumo de alimentos(este ítem presentó diferencias según el semestre). Para la categoría Estrategias de afrontamiento, el ítem con más porcentaje en la clasificación alto fue el de Habilidad asertiva.
Discusión: este conjunto de reacciones no hará más que menguar y perjudicar la capacidad intelectual y el desempeño académico de los estudiantes y, en muchos casos, el estrés académico (en conjunción con otras problemáticas) podría derivar en fracaso y deserción. Incluso podrían entretejer una trampa muy riesgosa para la salud y el proyecto de vida de personas jóvenes, en su mayoría menores de 25 años.

ODVIC is a multimodal Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) that empathically delivers an evidence-based behavior change intervention by adapting, in real-time, its verbal and nonverbal communication messages to those of the user’s during their interaction. We currently focus our work on excessive alcohol consumption as a target behavior, and our approach is adaptable to other target behaviors (e.g., overeating, lack of exercise, narcotic drug use, non-adherence to treatment). We based our current approach on a successful existing patient-centered brief motivational intervention for behavior change---the Drinker’s Check-Up (DCU)---whose computer-delivery with a text-only interface has been found effective in reducing alcohol consumption in problem drinkers. We discuss the results of users’ evaluation of the computer-based DCU intervention delivered with a text-only interface compared to the same intervention delivered with two different ECAs (a neutral one and one with some empathic abilities). Users rate the three systems in terms of acceptance, perceived enjoyment, and intention to use the system, among other dimensions.

VR provides an immersive experience into a simulated environment. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterised by social communication deficits and repetitive behaviours. Children with ASD often require social skills training while VR provides a safe, controllable environment to practice skills repeatedly. The Centre for Innovative Applications of Internet and Multimedia Technologies (AIMTech Centre) at City University of Hong Kong developed a VR-enabled training program to examine its efficacy on emotional and social skills with six VR scenarios depicting the daily lives of typical children in Hong Kong. 94 children from mainstream primary schools in Hong Kong completed the study and 72 children were included in the analysis. Children from training group scored higher on emotion expression and regulation (M = 20.2, SD = 3.00) than before the training (M = 18.9, SD = 3.57, t(35) = −2.174, p = .037) and higher on social interaction and adaptation after the training (M = 21.8, SD = 2.99) than before training (M = 20.2, SD = 3.43, t(35) = −3.987, p < .0005). There was a statistically significant interaction between group and time on affective expressions, F(1, 70) = 5.223, p = .025, partial η2 = .069, and on social reciprocity, F(1, 70) = 7.769, p = .007, partial η2 = .100. Children were able to engage in VR training despite initial challenges with viewing goggles. Some children declined to participate due to scheduling reasons which may be minimised through the adoption of head-mounted displays as a portable, cost-effective device. VR seems to be a promising asset to traditional training and therapy while the importance trainers’ or therapists’ support has yet to be further investigated.",2018.0,7.0,79.0,"{'name': 'London Journal of Primary Care', 'pages': '110 - 112', 'volume': '10'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Yuan2018UsingVR,\n author = {Sze Ngar Vanessa Yuan and H.

This provides an interesting case study to investigate how an emerging internet company adapts its products to better fit divergent expectations, cultures, and policy frameworks in China and abroad. Using the app walkthrough method informed by platformization of culture production theory, this study highlights the similarities and distinctions between these two platforms. We argue the co-evolution of Douyin and TikTok is a new paradigm of global platform expansion that differs from strategies of regionalization adopted by previous major social media platforms.

The purpose of the current pilot study was to evaluate the acceptability and preliminary impact of using immersive virtual reality environments (IVREs) paired with a brief emotion regulation and risk reduction intervention (ER + IVRE) relative to this same intervention content paired with role-plays (ER + RP).


METHODS
Eighty-five adolescents attending middle school (grades 6th-8th; ages 12-15 years) in an urban northeast city were recruited and randomized to ER + IVRE (n = 44) or ER + RP (n = 41) and had complete data. Data examining acceptability, feasibility, sexual knowledge and attitudes, and ER were collected at baseline and 3 months after intervention completion. Analyses of covariance controlling for baseline scores were used to evaluate study outcomes. Within and between intervention effect sizes were calculated with effect sizes ≥.20 considered meaningful.


RESULTS
At the 3-month follow-up assessment, several within intervention condition effect sizes were found to exceed d = 0.20 across the measured sexual attitudes and ER outcomes. Between intervention analyses found that adolescents randomized to ER + IVRE attended more intervention sessions, reported less difficulty accessing ER strategies (d = 0.46), and reported higher emotional self-efficacy (d = 0.20) at the 3-month follow-up relative to adolescents randomized to the ER + RP intervention.

This study provides preliminary evidence that using virtual reality environments to enhance ER skill building in risk situations was acceptable, feasible to deliver, and positively impacted ER abilities.",2018.0,55.0,36.0,"{'name': 'Journal of Pediatric Psychology', 'pages': '425–435', 'volume': '44'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hadley2018MovingBR,\n author = {Wendy S Hadley and Christopher Houck and L.

A central concern in designing innovation contests is how many competitors to admit. Using a unique data set of 9,661 software contests, we provide evidence of two coexisting and opposing forces that operate when the number of competitors increases. Greater rivalry reduces the incentives to expend effort by individual solvers across competitors of all skill levels, while at the same time, increases the likelihood that at least one competitor will find an extreme-value solution. We show that the effort-reducing effect of greater rivalry dominates for less uncertain problems whereas the effect on the extreme value prevails for more uncertain problems. Adding competitors thus systematically increases overall contest performance for high-uncertainty problems. We also find that higher uncertainty reduces the negative effect of added competitors on incentives. We explore the implications of our findings for the theory and practice of innovation contests.",2010.0,52.0,22.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Boudreau2010TheEO,\n author = {K.

Virtual reality (VR) is a promising method for pain management in a clinical setting due to the distracting properties of an immersive virtual environment. In this study, we demonstrated the potential use of mobile phones as a means of delivering an easily accessible, immersive experience. Thirty-one patients tested VR pain distraction. Objective measurements of heart rate correlated to decreased anxiety, while, subjectively, patients also reported reduced levels of discomfort. The positive results of this study indicate that mobile phones can provide an immersive experience sufficient to deliver pain management distraction. Because mobile devices are widely available, the potential for developing pain management programs that are accessible has become a realistic possibility.",2014.0,23.0,25.0,"{'volume': '17 6', 'pages': '\n          385-9\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wiederhold2014MobileDA,\n author = {B.

We developed an easy-to-use VR self-management relaxation tool (VRelax) with immersive 360° nature videos and interactive animated elements. Objective To investigate the immediate effects of VR relaxation on negative and positive affective states and short-term effects on perceived stress and symptoms in patients with a psychiatric disorder, compared to standard relaxation exercises. Methods A randomized crossover trial was conducted in 50 patients receiving ambulatory treatment for anxiety, psychotic, depressive, or bipolar disorder. Participants were randomly assigned to start with VRelax or standard relaxation and used both interventions for 10 days at home. They completed 8 visual analog scales of momentary negative and positive affective states before and after each session. Global perceived stress and psychiatric symptoms were measured before and after both intervention periods. Treatment effects were analyzed with multilevel mixed model regression analyses and 2-way analysis of variance. Results Both VRelax and standard relaxation exercises led to a statistically significant immediate improvement of all negative and positive affective states. Compared to standard relaxation, VRelax resulted in a significantly greater reduction of total negative affective state (change 16.2% versus 21.2%; t1684=−2.02, 95% CI −18.70 to −0.28; P=.04). Specifically, VRelax had a stronger beneficial effect on momentary anxiety (t1684=−3.24, 95% CI −6.86 to −1.69), sadness (t1684=−2.32, 95% CI −6.51 to −0.55), and cheerfulness (t1684=2.35, 95% CI 0.51 to 5.75). There were no significant differences between short-term effects of the two treatments on global perceived stress and symptoms. Conclusions If the results of this trial are replicated and extended, VRelax may provide a much-needed, effective, easy-to-use self-management relaxation intervention to enhance psychiatric treatments.

However, the identification of mechanisms linking breath control to its psychophysiological effects is still under debate. This systematic review is aimed at unveiling psychophysiological mechanisms underlying slow breathing techniques (<10 breaths/minute) and their effects on healthy subjects. Methods: A systematic search of MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases, using keywords related to both breathing techniques and to their psychophysiological outcomes, focusing on cardio-respiratory and central nervous system, has been conducted. From a pool of 2,461 abstracts only 15 articles met eligibility criteria and were included in the review. The present systematic review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: The main effects of slow breathing techniques cover autonomic and central nervous systems activities as well as the psychological status. Slow breathing techniques promote autonomic changes increasing Heart Rate Variability and Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia paralleled by Central Nervous System (CNS) activity modifications. EEG studies show an increase in alpha and a decrease in theta power. Anatomically, the only available fMRI study highlights increased activity in cortical (e.g., prefrontal, motor, and parietal cortices) and subcortical (e.g., pons, thalamus, sub-parabrachial nucleus, periaqueductal gray, and hypothalamus) structures. Psychological/behavioral outputs related to the abovementioned changes are increased comfort, relaxation, pleasantness, vigor and alertness, and reduced symptoms of arousal, anxiety, depression, anger, and confusion. Conclusions: Slow breathing techniques act enhancing autonomic, cerebral and psychological flexibility in a scenario of mutual interactions: we found evidence of links between parasympathetic activity (increased HRV and LF power), CNS activities (increased EEG alpha power and decreased EEG theta power) related to emotional control and psychological well-being in healthy subjects. Our hypothesis considers two different mechanisms for explaining psychophysiological changes induced by voluntary control of slow breathing: one is related to a voluntary regulation of internal bodily states (enteroception), the other is associated to the role of mechanoceptors within the nasal vault in translating slow breathing in a modulation of olfactory bulb activity, which in turn tunes the activity of the entire cortical mantle.",2018.0,123.0,265.0,"{'volume': '12', 'name': 'Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zaccaro2018HowBC,\n author = {A.

However, few studies compare its capacity to evoke the same emotional responses as in real scenarios. This study investigates psycho-physiological patterns evoked during the free exploration of an art museum and the museum virtualized through a 3D immersive virtual environment (IVE). An exploratory study involving 60 participants was performed, recording electroencephalographic and electrocardiographic signals using wearable devices. The real vs. virtual psychological comparison was performed using self-assessment emotional response tests, whereas the physiological comparison was performed through Support Vector Machine algorithms, endowed with an effective feature selection procedure for a set of state-of-the-art metrics quantifying cardiovascular and brain linear and nonlinear dynamics. We included an initial calibration phase, using standardized 2D and 360° emotional stimuli, to increase the accuracy of the model. The self-assessments of the physical and virtual museum support the use of IVEs in emotion research. The 2-class (high/low) system accuracy was 71.52% and 77.08% along the arousal and valence dimension, respectively, in the physical museum, and 75.00% and 71.08% in the virtual museum. The previously presented 360° stimuli contributed to increasing the accuracy in the virtual museum. Also, the real vs. virtual classifier accuracy was 95.27%, using only EEG mean phase coherency features, which demonstrates the high involvement of brain synchronization in emotional virtual reality processes. These findings provide an important contribution at a methodological level and to scientific knowledge, which will effectively guide future emotion elicitation and recognition systems using virtual reality.",2019.0,95.0,47.0,"{'volume': '14', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Marín-Morales2019RealVI,\n author = {J.

Typical autonomic signals that change with emotion are wrinkles, blushing, sweating, tearing, and respiration. This article explores whether these signals can also influence the perception of emotion in embodied agents. The article first reviews the literature on specific autonomic signal patterns associated with certain affective states. Next, it proceeds to describe a real-time model for wrinkles, blushing, sweating, tearing, and respiration that is capable of implementing those patterns. Two studies are then described. In the first, subjects compare surprise, sadness, anger, shame, pride, and fear expressed in an agent with or without blushing, wrinkles, sweating, or tears. In the second, subjects compare excitement, relaxation, focus, pain, relief, boredom, anger, fear, panic, disgust, surprise, startle, sadness, and joy expressed in an agent with or without typical respiration patterns. The first study shows a statistically significant positive effect on perception of surprise, sadness, anger, shame, and fear. The second study shows a statistically significant positive effect on perception of excitement, pain, relief, boredom, anger, fear, panic, disgust, and startle.

Moreover, children with ASD often suffer from other co-morbidities, such as anxiety and depression. Finding appropriate treatment can be difficult as symptoms of ASD and co-morbidities often overlap. Many applications for serious games in the health care sector already exist, but very little focus on stress and anxiety in children with ASD. This paper describes a preliminary study to assess whether a serious game can be used to reduce stress and anxiety in children with ASD.

Methods:  Twenty adolescents with ASD participated in a six-session virtual reality driving simulator-based experiment, during which their electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded alongside driving events and a therapist's rating of their affective states and mental workload. Five feature generation approaches including statistical features, fractal dimension features, higher order crossings (HOC)-based features, power features from frequency bands, and power features from bins ($\Delta \boldsymbol{f} = 2\;{\rm{Hz}}$ ) were applied to extract relevant features. Individual differences were removed with a two-step feature calibration method. Finally, binary classification results based on the k-nearest neighbors algorithm and univariate feature selection method were evaluated by leave-one-subject-out nested cross-validation to compare feature types and identify discriminative features. Results: The best classification results were achieved using power features from bins for engagement (0.95) and boredom (0.78), and HOC-based features for enjoyment (0.90), frustration (0.88), and workload (0.86). Conclusion: Offline EEG-based group-level classification models are feasible for recognizing binary low and high intensity of affect and workload of individuals with ASD in the context of driving. However, while promising the applicability of the models in an online adaptive driving task requires further development. Significance: The developed models provide a basis for an EEG-based passive brain computer interface system that has the potential to benefit individuals with ASD with an affect- and workload-based individualized driving skill training intervention.",2018.0,43.0,71.0,"{'volume': '65', 'pages': '43-51', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fan2018EEGBasedAA,\n author = {Jing Fan and Joshua W.

The focus of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on real-world data from novel digital sources, and the emergence of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes to reimburse for digital monitoring and neurobehavioral testing suggest an increasing acceptance of the role of technology in augmenting clinical care and research. Empowered Brain is an augmented reality and artificial intelligence-based social-emotional communication aid for students with ASD. In this study, student performance on Empowered Brain is correlated to validated clinical measures of ADHD. Seven high school students with a diagnosis of ASD were recruited from a public high school. All students were assessed for severity of ADHD-related symptoms via three clinical gold-standard assessments, namely the Aberrant Behavioral Checklist (ABC), Social Responsiveness Scale 2 (SRS-2), and Teacher Report Form (TRF). Students used Empowered Brain over a one-week period. We measured the correlation of student in-game performance (as measured by point- and star-based rewards) relative to the hyperactivity subscale of the ABC (ABC-H), and the ADHD-subscale of the TRF. All seven students completed the study and managed to successfully use Empowered Brain. Students received a culminative total of 32 sessions, an average of 4.6 sessions per student (range 2–8). Student in-game performance demonstrated highly significant correlation relative to ABC-H (points: p = 0.0013; stars: p = 0.0013), and significant correlation to TRF ADHD scores (points: p = 0.012; stars: p = 0.012). No adverse effects were noted among students who used Empowered Brain. New technologies may herald novel ways of identifying and characterizing symptoms of ADHD in student populations. This study provides evidence that Empowered Brain in-game performance correlates with ADHD symptom severity in students with ASD. Larger samples are required to validate these findings, with more diverse participants that can also widen the generalizability of these findings to a broader range of brain conditions that manifest with inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Through further research, we may find that such technologies can help us to identify and longitudinally monitor such symptoms, and potentially aid in severity stratification and digital phenotyping.",2019.0,51.0,11.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'Children'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Keshav2019DigitalAA,\n author = {Neha U.

However, in most cases, existed chatbots in the world are neither designed specifically for children, nor suitable for children, especially for children with ASD (autism spectrum disorder). In order to develop chatbots that are suitable for children with ASD, the present study firstly adopted an open source chatting corpus containing more than 1.7 million question-and-answer Chinese sentences of chatting histories involving children in many cases, and screened out more than 400,000 ideal chatting sentences for model training. Then a generative-based method combing Bi-LSTM and attention mechanism with word embedding based on deep neural network was adopted to build a general Chinese chatbot. The quality evaluation results indicated that our chatbot can successfully intrigue participants’ interest and made them understand it well.

Our approach is based on the work of Holland and Miller (1991), in which the authors propose that the system may be viewed as a complex dynamic adaptive system with a large number of different kinds of agents. In such environment, agents may take their decisions based on the anticipation of the future state of the world (Axelrod, 1997). In this paper, we explore how useful the concept of anticipation can be for real time simulation improving and facilitating decisions of the virtual entities. In this paper, we work with real time anticipative agents and where developed situations, actions, and changes in the world. This normal context in a virtual world is taken as a framework where an agent is able to compare previous learned situations, executed actions and obtained results; with current situations in order to decide which action could lead the agent to a situation with the best utility or satisfaction degree.",2005.0,15.0,2.0,"{'pages': '371-377', 'name': '10th IEEE International Workshop on Object-Oriented Real-Time Dependable Systems'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ramos2005AutonomousAA,\n author = {M.

Participants (n = 14) watched short videos intended to induce emotional states (pleasant/approach related, unpleasant/withdrawal related, or neutral). After each video, the participants were scanned while performing a 3-back working memory task having either words or faces as stimuli. Task-related neural activity in bilateral PFC showed a predicted pattern: an Emotion × Stimulus crossover interaction, with no main effects, with activity predicting task performance. This highly specific result indicates that emotion and higher cognition can be truly integrated, i.e., at some point of processing, functional specialization is lost, and emotion and cognition conjointly and equally contribute to the control of thought and behavior. Other regions in lateral PFC showed hemispheric specialization for emotion and for stimuli separately, consistent with a hierarchical and hemisphere-based mechanism of integration.",2002.0,64.0,733.0,"{'volume': '99', 'pages': '4115 - 4120', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gray2002IntegrationOE,\n author = {J.

At the same time, there is little empirical evidence underlying all this speculation. This article provides one such data set. It reports on factors that consumers found salient as they browsed through selected electronic malls on the World Wide Web. We gathered consumers' reactions via an open-ended survey using a sample of 220 shoppers. We related the reactions to the factors of product perceptions, shopping experience, customer service, and perceived consumer risk, which we had identified from the existing literature on retail patronage behavior. This study translated these factors to the World Wide Web context and explored their relative salience.With respect to product perceptions, consumers were impressed by the breadth of stores on the World Wide Web but disappointed with the depth of a merchant's offerings. The shopping experience was reported to be generally enjoyable, but at the same time frustrating. Consumers also reported that they could perceive the potential for time savings and reduced effort compared with traditional forms of shopping, but that, at present, goal-directed shopping was difficult. Nearly everyone in the sample had something negative to say about customer service on the World Wide Web, judging that the sites were not designed to be responsive to their needs and that the presentation of goods and services seemed intangible. Risk was cited as a barrier to shopping on the World Wide Web, but was not as salient to our sample as product perceptions, shopping experience, and customer service. Overall, the results suggest that World Wide Web merchants need to think more about how they perform on the factors known to affect consumer behavior; namely, product perceptions, shopping experience, and customer service. We offer advice for enhancing the design of World Wide Web retail sites.",1996.0,41.0,1710.0,"{'volume': '1', 'pages': '59-88', 'name': 'Int. J. Electron.

ChilesUniversity of WashingtonThe studies presented here describe the development of an instrument to measurea range of beliefs potentially important as reasons for not committing suicide.Sixty-five individuals generated 72 distinct reasons; these were reduced to 48 byfactor analyses performed on two additional samples, and the items were arrangedinto the Reasons for Living Inventory (RFL), which requires a rating of howimportant each reason would be for living if suicide was contemplated. In ad-dition, factor analyses indicated six primary reasons for living: Survival and Cop-ing Beliefs, Responsibility to Family, Child-Related Concerns, Fear of Suicide,Fear of Social Disapproval, and Moral Objections. The RFL was then given totwo additional samples, 197 Seattle shoppers and 175 psychiatric inpatients. Bothsamples were divided into several suicidal (ideators and parasuicides) and non-suicidal groups. Separate multivariate analyses of variance indicated that the RFLdifferentiated suicidal from nonsuicidal individuals in both samples. In the shop-ping-center sample, the Fear of Suicide scale further differentiated between pre-vious ideators and previous parasuicides. In the clinical sample, the Child-RelatedConcerns scales differentiated between current suicide ideators and current para-suicides. In both samples, the Survival and Coping, the Responsibility to Family,and the Child-Related Concerns scales were most useful in differentiating thegroups.

A literature search from 2008 to March 2010 was conducted. Studies were eligible for inclusion if: participants were adults with a body mass index ≤ 25, at least one study arm involved an internet-based intervention and the primary aims were weight loss or maintenance. Eight additional studies over the eighteen included in the previous review met the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted on sample characteristics, attrition, weight loss, duration of treatment and maintenance of weight loss. Effect sizes (Hedges g) and relative 95% confidence intervals were calculated for all two-way comparisons within each study. No attempt was made to pool the data in a meta-analysis because of the great heterogeneity of designs among studies. An examination of effect sizes show that the higher significant effects pertain studies that found a superiority of behavioral internet-based programs enhanced by features such as tailored feedback on self-monitoring of weight, eating and activity over education only internet-based interventions. However, control groups are very different among studies and this heterogeneity probably accounts for much of the variance in effect sizes. Hence, questions still remain as to the effectiveness of web-based interventions in achieving weight loss or maintenance. Implications for further research include using a “real” control group in order to make meta-analysis possible and developing multi-factorial design in order to separate components of interventions and identify which of them or patterns of them are keys to success.",2011.0,44.0,124.0,"{'volume': '7', 'pages': '19 - 28', 'name': 'Clinical Practice and Epidemiology in Mental Health : CP & EMH'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Manzoni2011InternetBasedBI,\n author = {G.

Virtual schools are different from traditional home schooling because children receive their instruction from teachers online with parental assistance as opposed to parents being responsible for teaching all material. Tony's mother comes to your practice requesting assistance with setting up an appropriate school environment for her son at home, where she can monitor and support his academic progress.Tony is a bright child, with an Intelligence Quotient in the superior range. He has advanced academic skills, but he becomes dysregulated if he is told he is wrong or that he has answered a question incorrectly. For example, if he answered a question incorrectly in class, he would become verbally abusive toward his teacher and often have temper tantrums. This challenging behavior occurred daily at school and was one of the factors leading to his expulsion. The behavior had predated the introduction of stimulant medication and had remained consistent after he began medication.Tony's parents are highly educated, and both parents hold professional jobs with steady income. His parents have good command of typical behavior management strategies such as the use of rewards, time out, and behavioral contingencies to target noncompliance and temper tantrums. However, Tony's difficulty identifying and regulating his emotions leads to emotional outbursts and shutdowns that have thus far been unresponsive to standard behavior management techniques. Tony continued to have outbursts even when the behavior was ignored. His mother is concerned not only about his learning during the coming year but also about his social relationships and the family dynamic. Tony's outbursts cause significant disruption in the home and are a source of tension among parents and siblings.His mother is asking for advice on how to support his behavior better at home now that he will be spending his entire day there. How might you assist this child and his mother by helping to integrate therapeutic goals into the academic environment?",2017.0,0.0,0.0,"{'name': 'Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP', 'pages': '\n          S41-S43\n        ', 'volume': '38 Suppl 1'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wallace2017AttentionDeficitHyperactivityDB,\n author = {Claire Wallace and C.

However, which of these “big three” health behaviors most strongly predicts mental health and well-being, and their higher-order relationships in predictive models, is less known. This study investigated the differential and higher-order associations between sleep, physical activity, and dietary factors as predictors of mental health and well-being in young adults. Method In a cross-sectional survey design, 1,111 young adults (28.4% men) ages 18–25 from New Zealand and the United States answered an online survey measuring typical sleep quantity and quality; physical activity; and consumption of raw and processed fruit and vegetables, fast food, sweets, and soda, along with extensive covariates (including demographics, socioeconomic status, body mass index, alcohol use, smoking, and health conditions) and the outcome measures of depressive symptoms [measured by the Center for Epidemiological Depression Scale (CES-D)] and well-being (measured by the Flourishing Scale). Results Controlling for covariates, sleep quality was the strongest predictor of depressive symptoms and well-being, followed by sleep quantity and physical activity. Only one dietary factor—raw fruit and vegetable consumption—predicted greater well-being but not depressive symptoms when controlling for covariates. There were some higher-order interactions among health behaviors in predicting the outcomes, but these did not survive cross-validation. Conclusion Sleep quality is an important predictor of mental health and well-being in young adults, whereas physical activity and diet are secondary but still significant factors. Although strictly correlational, these patterns suggest that future interventions could prioritize sleep quality to maximize mental health and well-being in young adults.",2020.0,70.0,51.0,"{'volume': '11', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wickham2020TheBT,\n author = {Shay-Ruby Wickham and Natasha A.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of a 6-week mindfulness intervention for 42 middle school students who were identified as Gifted and Talented. Participants’ levels of self-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism, as well as their use of mindfulness practices, were evaluated pre- and post- intervention, as well as at a 5-week follow-up to assess changes in perfectionism ratings and use of mindfulness. Three Bonferroni-adjusted, one-way, repeated measures analyses of variance were performed, and the results indicated a significant decrease in self-oriented perfectionism and an increase in mindfulness at both the end of the intervention and at follow-up. These findings support the use of mindfulness as an appropriate intervention to reduce self-imposed forms of perfectionism among gifted youth.",2020.0,82.0,12.0,"{'volume': '64', 'pages': '319 - 330', 'name': 'Gifted Child Quarterly'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Olton-Weber2020ReducingLO,\n author = {Sophia Olton-Weber and R.

Thus, there is a need for effective, short, and accessible forms of intervention. Externalizing Metaphor Therapy (EMT) is a post-modern brief treatment for mild to moderate anxiety. Its efficacy is herein analyzed by examining the process and outcomes of a four session online individual therapy with 4 young adults. Qualitative and quantitative data on individual change provides preliminary support for the efficacy of EMT at post-treatment and follow-up. Additionally, EMT therapist’s descriptions and participants’ perspectives on the process of change suggests putative mediators of EMT in the transformation process. Future randomized controlled trials using wider samples are needed to confirm these provisional results.

2080,d9789715a1088137e4ccce89d0a32f5699708dc3,Social and Emotional Learning Programs for Adolescents,"Summary:Adolescents may especially need social and emotional help. They're learning how to handle new demands in school and social life while dealing with new, intense emotions (both positive and negative), and they're increasingly feeling that they should do so without adult guidance. Social and emotional learning (SEL) programs are one way to help them navigate these difficulties.SEL programs try to help adolescents cope with their difficulties more successfully by improving skills and mindsets, and they try to create respectful school environments that young people want to be a part of by changing the school's climate. In this article, David Yeager defines those terms and explains the changes that adolescents experience with the onset of puberty. Then he reviews a variety of SEL programs to see what works best with this age group.On the positive side, Yeager finds that effective universal SEL can transform adolescents' lives for the better. Less encouragingly, typical SEL programs—which directly teach skills and invite participants to rehearse those skills over the course of many classroom lessons—have a poor track record with middle adolescents (roughly age 14 to 17), even though they work well with children.But some programs stand out for their effectiveness with adolescents. Rather than teaching them skills, Yeager finds, effective programs for adolescents focus on mindsets and climate. Harnessing adolescents' developmental motivations, such programs aim to make them feel respected by adults and peers and offer them the chance to gain status and admiration in the eyes of people whose opinions they value.",2017.0,74.0,118.0,"{'volume': '27', 'pages': '73 - 94', 'name': 'The Future of Children'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Yeager2017SocialAE,\n author = {D.

The purpose of this narrative review was to look at how these transformations affected teacher identity and the ways relationality shifted during this time. The intention was to bring relationality, care, collaboration, and excellent teaching possibilities, into the centre of our thinking. Whilst recognising the pandemic as a traumatic experience for many, it is a hopeful paper. Method An examination and thematic analysis of literature published from March 2020–November 2020 on ERT. Results The crisis and corresponding shift to teaching online demanded faculty to overcome their bias against online delivery, reimagine teaching, resulting in increased innovation and unexpected positive experiences which continue to rise. Conclusion Teachers already engaging with student-centred approaches, relational pedagogies, reflective practice, community networks, and/or digital technologies managed the transition to online teaching and learning more effectively. Future teacher training requires effective online education, how to design and deliver, how to collaborate, and how to make relational connections with others, and access to resources. KEY POINTS What is already known about this topic: Teacher identity is complex and always changing where fluctuating valence forces a re-evaluation of one’s identity. Teachers experience tension between their “core” ideal teacher identity such as the care and commitment to students and their occasional identity as adapters to external factors. Covid-19 has resulted in a rapid change emergency remote teaching with additional uncertainty and vulnerability. What this topic adds: Skills that enabled teachers to adapt to the rapid shift to remote teaching more effectively were student-centred approaches, relational pedagogies, reflective practice, community networks and/or digital technologies. Teacher identity was reimagined through emergency remote teaching as they worked remotely. Suggestions for further teacher development and support to enhance teacher effectiveness when responding to change and working remotely include strategies to strengthen and maintain digital competence to ensure teachers identity and their core values are recognised.",2023.0,63.0,6.0,"{'volume': '40', 'pages': '18 - 26', 'name': 'Educational and Developmental Psychologist'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Foreman-Brown2023ReimaginingTI,\n author = {Gabriella Foreman-Brown and E.

A survey of 491 diners in the United States assessed customer reaction to failures in the follow four service stages: (1) reception, (2) ordering, (3) meal consumption, and (4) checkout. The study found that in both casual dining and fine dining restaurants, service failure in stage 3 (consumption) most strongly diminishes overall customer satisfaction, followed by stage 4 (payment and exiting), stage 2 (order taking and delivery), and finally stage 1 (greeting and seating).

2087,d9e8c103a3b1d60210cd730d458269606bd78d45,Trait emotional intelligence influences on academic achievement and school behaviour.,"BACKGROUND. Trait emotional intelligence (trait EI or trait emotional self-efficacy) refers to individuals' emotion-related self-perceptions (Petrides, Furnham, & Mavroveli, 2007). The children's trait EI sampling domain provides comprehensive coverage of their affective personality. Preliminary evidence shows that the construct has important implications for children's psychological and behavioural adjustment. AIMS. This study investigates the associations between trait EI and school outcomes, such as performance in reading, writing, and maths, peer-rated behaviour and social competence, and self-reported bullying behaviours in a sample of primary school children. It also examines whether trait EI scores differentiate between children with and without special educational needs (SEN). SAMPLE. The sample comprised 565 children (274 boys and 286 girls) between the ages of 7 and 12 (M((age)) = 9.12 years, SD= 1.27 years) attending three English state primary schools. METHOD. Pupils completed the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Child Form (TEIQue-CF), the Guess Who peer assessment, the Peer-Victimization Scale, and the Bullying Behaviour Scale. Additional data on achievement and SEN were collected from the school archives. RESULTS. As predicted by trait EI theory, associations between trait EI and academic achievement were modest and limited to Year 3 children. Higher trait EI scores were related to more nominations from peers for prosocial behaviours and fewer nominations for antisocial behaviour as well as lower scores on self-reported bulling behaviours. Furthermore, SEN students scored lower on trait EI compared to students without SEN. CONCLUSIONS. Trait EI holds important and multifaceted implications for the socialization of primary schoolchildren.",2011.0,116.0,213.0,"{'volume': '81 Pt 1', 'pages': '\n          112-34\n        ', 'name': 'The British journal of educational psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mavroveli2011TraitEI,\n author = {S.

Although a large body of literature reports positive effects of NF training on behavior and cognitive functions, there are hardly any reports on how participants can successfully learn to gain control over their own brain activity. About one third of people fail to gain significant control over their brain signals even after repeated training sessions. The reasons for this failure are still largely unknown. In this context, we investigated the effects of spontaneous mental strategies on NF performance. Twenty healthy participants performed either a SMR (sensorimotor rhythm, 12–15 Hz) based or a Gamma (40–43 Hz) based NF training over ten sessions. After the first and the last training session, they were asked to write down which mental strategy they have used for self-regulating their EEG. After the first session, all participants reported the use of various types of mental strategies such as visual strategies, concentration, or relaxation. After the last NF training session, four participants of the SMR group reported to employ no specific strategy. These four participants showed linear improvements in NF performance over the ten training sessions. In contrast, participants still reporting the use of specific mental strategies in the last NF session showed no changes in SMR based NF performance over the ten sessions. This effect could not be observed in the Gamma group. The Gamma group showed no prominent changes in Gamma power over the NF training sessions, regardless of the mental strategies used. These results indicate that successful SMR based NF performance is associated with implicit learning mechanisms. Participants stating vivid reports on strategies to control their SMR probably overload cognitive resources, which might be counterproductive in terms of increasing SMR power.",2013.0,64.0,172.0,"{'volume': '7', 'name': 'Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Kober2013LearningTM,\n author = {S.

Methods 32 Adults in four LTC homes participated in a pilot implementation project where they viewed VR experiences of popular locations in Canada created especially for this project. Data in this paper are based on multiple viewing experiences (n = 102) over a two-week period. Results VR appeared to be an effective distraction from pain for the participants. Participants of this study found the VR experiences to be enjoyable and were relaxed and happy while viewing them. Most participants were attentive or focused while viewing the VR experiences, and the experiences were found to be a source of reminiscence for some of the participants. Participants related well to others around them during a majority of the experiences and the VR experiences were a point of conversation between the staff and the participants.

Brain activity was measured using func- tional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during free viewing of films, and inter-subject correlation analysis (ISC) was used to assess similarities in the spatiotemporal responses across viewers' brains during movie watching. Our results demonstrate that some films can exert considerable control over brain activity and eye movements. However, this was not the case for all types of motion picture sequences, and the level of control over viewers' brain activity differed as a function of movie content, editing, and directing style. We pro- pose that ISC may be useful to film studies by providing a quantitative neuro- scientific assessment of the impact of different styles of filmmaking on viewers' brains, and a valuable method for the film industry to better assess its prod- ucts. Finally, we suggest that this method brings together two separate and largely unrelated disciplines, cognitive neuroscience and film studies, and may open the way for a new interdisciplinary field of ""neurocinematic"" studies.",2008.0,47.0,397.0,"{'volume': '2', 'pages': '1-26', 'name': 'Projections'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hasson2008NeurocinematicsTN,\n author = {U.

In the past two years, live streams of video games, on sites such as Twitch.tv, have become very popular. Live streams serve as meeting grounds for player communities. The Twitch streaming medium combines broadcast video with open IRC chat channels. In conjunction with gameplay, viewer participation and community building gain emphasis. Twitch streams range in size and nature, from intimate communities with fifty viewers, to massive broadcasts with tens of thousands. In this paper, we present an ethnographic investigation of the live streaming of video games on Twitch. We find that Twitch streams act as virtual third places, in which informal communities emerge, socialize, and participate. Over time, stream communities form around shared identities drawn from streams? contents and participants? shared experiences. We describe processes through which stream communities form, the motivations of members, and emergent issues in the medium.

Mobile shopping platform features and user technological readiness configure consumers? expectations and demands as regards mobile retailing adoption, leading to acceptance of mobile shopping apps and payment services. 
Purpose of the article: In this research, prior findings have been cumulated indicating that mobile social apps extend throughout consumer attitudes and behaviors by the widespread adoption of smartphones. We contribute to the literature by showing that cutting-edge technological developments associated with customer behavior in relation to mobile commerce apps have resulted in the rise of data-driven systems. Consumer behavioral intention and adoption intention in relation to mobile shopping apps/websites are developed on perceived risk and trust consequences. 
Methods: Throughout February and March 2021, a quantitative literature review of the Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest databases was carried out, with search terms comprising ?mobile shopping app?, ?mobile commerce platform?, ?mobile payment service?, ?Internet-enabled consumer device?, ?consumer technological adoption?, and ?mobile shopping behavior?. As research published between 2018 and 2021 was analyzed, only 330 sources met the suitability criteria. By removing questionable or indeterminate findings (insubstantial/inconsequent data), results unconfirmed by replication, too imprecise content, or having quite similar titles, 66, chiefly empirical, sources were selected. A systematic review of recently published literature was carried out on technological adoption of mobile commerce apps by employing Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The Systematic Review Data Repository was used, a software program for the gathering, handling, and analysis of data for the systematic review. The quality of the academic articles was determined by harnessing the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool. 
Findings & value added: The consumer purchase decision?making process in mobile app-based marketing involves consumer engagement and willingness to adopt mobile commerce apps.

Research in the human neurosciences often involves the use of simple and static stimuli lacking many of the potentially important aspects of real world activities and interactions. While this research is valuable, there is a growing interest in the human neurosciences to use cues about target states in the real world via multimodal scenarios that involve visual, semantic, and prosodic information. These scenarios should include dynamic stimuli presented concurrently or serially in a manner that allows researchers to assess the integrative processes carried out by perceivers over time. Furthermore, there is growing interest in contextually embedded stimuli that can constrain participant interpretations of cues about a target’s internal states.

The research was conducted at New Mexico State University’s Clayton Livestock Research Centre. The functionality of LoRA WAN communication technology and performance of LoRa WAN motion and GPS sensors were tested using static sensors that were placed either, a) outdoors and at incremental distances from the LoRa WAN gateway antenna (Field, n=6), or b) housed indoors and close to the same LoRa WAN gateway antenna (Indoor, n=5). Accelerometer data, reported as motion intensity index, and GPS location were acquired, transmitted and logged at 1 and 15 minute intervals, respectively. We evaluated the tracker's GPS accuracy (GPSBias as the euclidean distance between the actual and projected tracker location) and variables associated with the tracker’s data transmission capabilities. The results indicate that field trackers had a greater accuracy for remote sensing of GPS locations compared to indoor trackers facing increasing communication interference to acquire satellite signals (GPSBias; 5.20 vs. 17.76 m; P<0.01). Overall, the trackers and deployments appeared to have a comparable GPS accuracy to other tracking devices and systems available in the market. The total data packets that were successfully transmitted were similar between the indoor and field trackers, but the number of data packets that were processed varied between the two deployments (P=0.02). Due to the static deployment of indoor and field trackers, activity data was almost nonexistent for most devices. However, same trackers embedded on collars that were mounted on mature cattle showed clear diurnal patterns consistent with time budgets exerted by grazing cattle. The pilot testing of GPS and accelerometer sensors using LoRa WAN technology revealed reasonable sensor sensitivity and reliability for integration in PLF platforms.",2022.0,12.0,2.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Cox2022PerformanceOL,\n author = {A.

Cannabis is related to variables that influence health and well-being. Emotional Intelligence is associated with adaptive coping styles, peer relationships, and social–emotional competencies. In adolescence, peer selection plays a unique role in the initiation of substance use. However, there are no studies during a confinement stage that analyse the relationships between networks, Emotional Intelligence, and cannabis use. The aim of this paper is to describe and analyse the consumption and friendship networks of an adolescent classroom and their relationship with Emotional Intelligence, cannabis use, and gender during COVID-19 confinement. Participants completed different questionnaires for Emotional Intelligence, cannabis use, and the consumption and friendship network. The sample consisted of 21 students from 10th grade, of which 47.6% were consumers. The friendship network correlates with the consumption network, and significant associations between emotional repair and being a cannabis user. The regression model points to the friendship network as a significant variable in predicting the classroom use network. This study highlights the role of the Social Network Analysis in predicting consumption networks during a COVID-19 confinement stage and serves as a tool for cannabis use prevention interventions in a specific population.",2021.0,39.0,3.0,{'name': 'Sustainability'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Martínez-Fernández2021CannabisUA,\n author = {María Cristina Martínez-Fernández and Isaías García-Rodríguez and Natalia Arias-Ramos and Rubén García-Fernández and Bibiana Trevissón-Redondo and Cristina Liébana-Presa},\n journal = {Sustainability},\n title = {Cannabis Use and Emotional Intelligence in Adolescents during COVID-19 Confinement: A Social Network Analysis Approach},\n year = {2021}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '1576562893', 'name': 'María Cristina Martínez-Fernández'}, {'authorId': '1412354676', 'name': 'Isaías García-Rodríguez'}, {'authorId': '2127321816', 'name': 'Natalia Arias-Ramos'}, {'authorId': '1411267652', 'name': 'Rubén García-Fernández'}, {'authorId': '2119007901', 'name': 'Bibiana Trevissón-Redondo'}, {'authorId': '1405190726', 'name': 'Cristina Liébana-Presa'}]"
2112,dbec9181a788379a0c9702ec58eb921e9b62bcad,Real‐time fMRI using brain‐state classification,"We have implemented a real‐time functional magnetic resonance imaging system based on multivariate classification. This approach is distinctly different from spatially localized real‐time implementations, since it does not require prior assumptions about functional localization and individual performance strategies, and has the ability to provide feedback based on intuitive translations of brain state rather than localized fluctuations. Thus this approach provides the capability for a new class of experimental designs in which real‐time feedback control of the stimulus is possible—rather than using a fixed paradigm, experiments can adaptively evolve as subjects receive brain‐state feedback. In this report, we describe our implementation and characterize its performance capabilities. We observed ∼80% classification accuracy using whole brain, block‐design, motor data. Within both left and right motor task conditions, important differences exist between the initial transient period produced by task switching (changing between rapid left or right index finger button presses) and the subsequent stable period during sustained activity. Further analysis revealed that very high accuracy is achievable during stable task periods, and that the responsiveness of the classifier to changes in task condition can be much faster than signal time‐to‐peak rates. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of this implementation with respect to behavioral task, suggesting that our results are applicable across a spectrum of cognitive domains. Beyond basic research, this technology can complement electroencephalography‐based brain computer interface research, and has potential applications in the areas of biofeedback rehabilitation, lie detection, learning studies, virtual reality‐based training, and enhanced conscious awareness.

Among the fundamental social impairments in the ASD population are challenges in appropriately recognizing and responding to facial expressions. Traditional intervention approaches often require intensive support and well-trained therapists to address core deficits, with many with ASD having tremendous difficulty accessing such care due to lack of available trained therapists as well as intervention costs. As a result, emerging technology such as virtual reality (VR) has the potential to offer useful technology-enabled intervention systems. In this paper, an innovative VR-based facial emotional expression presentation system was developed that allows monitoring of eye gaze and physiological signals related to emotion identification to explore new efficient therapeutic paradigms. A usability study of this new system involving ten adolescents with ASD and ten typically developing adolescents as a control group was performed. The eye tracking and physiological data were analyzed to determine intragroup and intergroup variations of gaze and physiological patterns. Performance data, eye tracking indices and physiological features indicated that there were differences in the way adolescents with ASD process and recognize emotional faces compared to their typically developing peers. These results will be used in the future for an online adaptive VR-based multimodal social interaction system to improve emotion recognition abilities of individuals with ASD.",2013.0,44.0,111.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '711-720', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bekele2013UnderstandingHA,\n author = {Esubalew Bekele and Zhi Zheng and A.

The aim of this study was to examine pre-service teachers’ (PST) perceptions about VR, inclusive of their beliefs about its capacity to be used as a teaching and learning tool. A case-study, conducted at an urban university in Australia involved a sample of n = 41. Participants’ positive perceptions of VR in their teaching relate to its potential to engage learners, the immersive potential of the platform and the scope of VR to offer students experiences they might otherwise not have with other learning tools. Concerns expressed by PSTs include their relatively low self-efficacy to use VR in their teaching, monitoring-related matters, financial cost and implementing the technology in a safe and supportive way. There was a significant difference in PSTs’ amount of self-efficacy to teach using VR when compared to their overall confidence to use digital technologies. PSTs typically had greater awareness of the immersive and engagement potential of VR and less awareness about its potential to foster and promote collaborative learning.

Several protective and risk factors have been identified in civilians and veterans to explain why some individuals develop PTSD and others do not. However, no research has confirmed the relationship between emotion regulation and PTSD in deployed German Armed Forces service members after a foreign assignment. Previous studies have identified some protective factors, such as social support, social acknowledgment, specific personal values, and posttraumatic growth, as well as risk factors, like moral injury and emotion regulation. Thus, the aim of the present study is to confirm the relationship between emotion regulation and PTSD and to test for factors that are associated with higher severity of PTSD symptoms in such a sample. Methods A post-hoc secondary analysis was conducted on data collected in a randomized controlled trial. Participants (N = 72) were male active and former military service members that have returned from deployment and were recruited from the German Armed Forces. These participants were separated into two groups according to PTSD diagnosis based on the results of a structured diagnostic interview. Data from evaluation questionnaires administered upon entry into the study were subjected to a cross-sectional analysis. The measures included the severity of PTSD symptoms, clusters of PTSD symptoms, clinical measures, and several measures assessing PTSD-related constructs. Analyses included the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, X2 tests for nominal data, Mann-Whitney U-tests for non-parametric data, and a mediation analysis. Results The results of the mediation analysis revealed that difficulties in emotion regulation were significantly associated with the severity of PTSD symptoms, which was mediated by social acknowledgment and experimental avoidance but not by moral injury. The analyses showed that the severity of PTSD symptoms and all clusters of PTSD symptoms were significantly associated with most of the measured constructs in expectable directions. Participants in the PTSD group showed significantly higher mean scores on questionnaires measuring constructs that have been associated with PTSD, like emotion regulation and moral injury. They also showed lower mean scores in questionnaires for social support and social acknowledgment as a victim or survivor than participants in the non-PTSD group. Conclusion The present results show that difficulties in emotion regulation are directly associated with the severity of PTSD symptoms in service members of the German Armed Forces. This association is mediated by social acknowledgment and experimental avoidance, but not by moral injury. Thus, future studies should investigate these potentially crucial factors for better understanding of the development and maintenance of PTSD in service members of the German Armed Forces after deployment to create possible treatment adaptions.

Here we present a study testing the feasibility of using highly realistic image-based rendered VR with patients with MCI and dementia. We designed an attentional task to train selective and sustained attention, and we tested a VR and a paper version of this task in a single-session within-subjects design. Results showed that participants with MCI and dementia reported to be highly satisfied and interested in the task, and they reported high feelings of security, low discomfort, anxiety and fatigue. In addition, participants reported a preference for the VR condition compared to the paper condition, even if the task was more difficult. Interestingly, apathetic participants showed a preference for the VR condition stronger than that of non-apathetic participants.

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to test the effects of two types of celebrities (Instagram celebrity vs traditional celebrity) on source trustworthiness, brand attitude, envy and social presence. The proposed theoretical model consists of the celebrity type as the independent variable, social presence as the mediator and self-discrepancy as the moderator.


Design/methodology/approach
A randomized two-group comparison (Instagram celebrity vs traditional celebrity) between-subjects experiment (n=104) was conducted.


Findings
The results indicate that consumers exposed to Instagram celebrity’s brand posts perceive the source to be more trustworthy, show more positive attitude toward the endorsed brand, feel stronger social presence and feel more envious of the source than those consumers exposed to traditional celebrity’s brand posts. Structural equation modeling (Mplus 8.0) and bootstrap confidence intervals indicate that social presence mediates the causal effects of celebrity type on trustworthiness, brand attitude and envy. Multiple regression analyses reveal the moderating effects of appearance-related actual–ideal self-discrepancy.


Practical implications
Ultimately, managerial implications for social media marketing and Instagram influencer-based branding are provided. From the perspective of marketing planning, the findings speak to the power of influencer marketing as an effective branding strategy.


Originality/value
The paper discusses theoretical implications for the marketing literature on celebrity endorsements.

The impact of this trauma made itself manifest in a myriad of ways, including through dreams. This study aimed to explore the Referential Process (RP, Bucci, 2021) of dreams reported during quarantine. Dream samples were collected through a social blog. Linguistic analysis and clinical evaluation were conducted to explore the group’s collective elaboration of a shared traumatic experience. Sixty-eight people (22 males; mean age 26.16 ds. 7.68) contributed to a social-blog, writing their dreams. 91 dreams were collected and transcribed using transcription rules for the Discourse Attributes Analysis Program (DAAP). Linguistic measures of RP were applied and a statistical cluster analysis was performed. In addition, each dream was evaluated by trained judges on three specific qualities of the RP (Arousal, Symbolizing, and Reflection/Reorganizing). Clinical judges in a double-blinded method reached reliable scoring (Arousal α.874 ICC 0.701; Symbolizing α.783 ICC 0.671; Reflection/reorganization α.884 ICC 0.758). Cluster Analysis yielded three dream clusters. 26 dreams fell under a cluster defined as a symbolizing process (Cluster A); 16 into a cluster defined as arousal of emotional activation (Cluster B); and 49 dreams fell into a cluster defined as Reflection/Reorganizing elaboration (Cluster C). Each cluster showed specific linguistic features. The dreams collected through a blog showed a Referential Process that is similar to that found in psychotherapy process.

Post-treatment outcomes of this study were previously published and details of its design can be found at clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: NCT02237300). This article focuses on the evolution of symptoms assessed after 6 months of followup in a subgroup of 58 patients from the original study. In this study 64 patients with eating disorders (EDs) (35 with BN and 29 with BED), who still showed active episodes of binge eating by the end of a structured CBT program (first-level treatment), were randomly assigned to one of two second-level treatments (A-CBT or VR-CET). Frequency of binge and purge episodes, and attitudinal features of binge-related EDs (bulimia, drive for thinness, and body dissatisfaction) were assessed before starting the second-level treatment (n = 64), at the end (n = 64), and at 6-month followup (n = 58). Mixed between-within subject analyses of variance were used to compare outcomes of both second-level treatments over time. Although both treatment conditions showed statistically significant improvements at the end and after 6-month followup, obtained reductions were greater after VR-CET, regarding binge and purge episodes, as well as the decrease of self-reported tendency to engage in overeating episodes. Accordingly, abstinence from binge episodes were higher in VR-CET than A-CBT at followup (70 percent vs. 26 percent, respectively; χ2 = 11.711, p = 0.001). These results provide further support for the use of VR-CET as an effective second-level intervention for BN and BED treatment-resistant patients.",2019.0,37.0,53.0,"{'volume': '22 1', 'pages': '\n          60-68\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ferrer-García2019ART,\n author = {M.

2142,dfbddc00146550167aba3861c93f64e095252a69,A Critical Outlook on Combat-Related PTSD: Review and Case Reports of Guilt and Shame as Drivers for Moral Injury,"ABSTRACT The model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that has been dominant for many years has focused on fear conditioning and anxiety-related symptoms as main drivers of the pathology. Yet, the fear based conceptualization fails to consider the rules of modern combat, the culture of combatants, operational stressors and the moral dimension. Recently there is renewed interest in moral distress and moral injury with a focus on guilt, shame, and anger. Accumulating evidence suggests a link between transgression of moral values and symptoms of guilt and shame, anger, suicidal ideation, and PTSD in military servicemen and veterans. Although proper assessment is still in its infancy, there is a need to better understand how moral decisions can affect the mental health of military personnel at any point during their careers, including postrelease. The authors illustrate this with three clinical case reports. They conclude with a call for attention to the relation between the incurrence of moral injurious distress, and the role of guilt and shame as drivers for chronicity of PTSD. Identifying and addressing these issues can contribute to therapy adherence, facilitate successful progression, and contribute to healing and moral repair and reduce overall symptoms of PTSD.",2018.0,55.0,21.0,"{'volume': '6', 'pages': '156 - 164', 'name': 'Military Behavioral Health'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vermetten2018ACO,\n author = {E.

Developing a valid measurement of visual fatigue caused by 3D display remains a big challenge and is beneficial for optimizing the system design. This paper assessed three electroencephalography (EEG) activities, θ, α and β, during a monotonous and repetitive random dot stereogram (RDS) based task in a conventional stereoscopic 3D display. Six types of ratio indices were computed based on EEG data and assessed as possible indicators for stereoscopic visual fatigue detection. The results of critical flicker frequency (CFF) and accommodative amplitude (ACC) showed that the proposed experiment setup can induce visual fatigue. According to the subjective ratings, the visual fatigue accumulated in this task was mostly related to the binocular vision stress of 3D display. Results of EEG data showed stable θ activity, a significant increase of α activity, and a significant decrease of β activity over time . In addition, the effectiveness of EEG indices was evaluated to measure stereoscopic visual fatigue by using grey relation analysis (GRA) and verified by correlating with CFF. The results of analysis suggest that among all nine types of EEG indices (θ, α, β, θ/β, α/β, α/θ, θ/(α+β), (α+θ)/β, (α+θ)/(α+β)), α is the most promising indicator for detecting stereoscopic visual fatigue.",2015.0,36.0,66.0,"{'volume': '11', 'pages': '1076-1083', 'name': 'Journal of Display Technology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zou2015EEGBasedAO,\n author = {Bochao Zou and Yue Liu and Mei Guo and Yongtian Wang},\n journal = {Journal of Display Technology},\n pages = {1076-1083},\n title = {EEG-Based Assessment of Stereoscopic 3D Visual Fatigue Caused by Vergence-Accommodation Conflict},\n volume = {11},\n year = {2015}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '20218361', 'name': 'Bochao Zou'}, {'authorId': '46399699', 'name': 'Yue Liu'}, {'authorId': '2089780674', 'name': 'Mei Guo'}, {'authorId': '1692621', 'name': 'Yongtian Wang'}]"

In the present study, we investigated personal space in children with persistent difficulties in the domain of social behavior, such as children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and in children with typical development (TD). The stop-distance paradigm was used to derive estimates of interpersonal distance, before and after a brief interaction with an unfamiliar adult confederate. The results showed that ASD children felt comfortable at a greater distance compared to TD children. Moreover, personal space shrunk after interaction with the confederate in TD children, but it failed to do so in ASD children. These findings reveal that autism deeply affects the regulation of personal space, influencing both its size and flexibility.",2013.0,59.0,83.0,"{'volume': '8', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gessaroli2013PersonalSR,\n author = {E.

2146,e00e7d6fabf43f75f1003574bb3121b66262e152,Autonomic control of the eye.,"The autonomic nervous system influences numerous ocular functions. It does this by way of parasympathetic innervation from postganglionic fibers that originate from neurons in the ciliary and pterygopalatine ganglia, and by way of sympathetic innervation from postganglionic fibers that originate from neurons in the superior cervical ganglion. Ciliary ganglion neurons project to the ciliary body and the sphincter pupillae muscle of the iris to control ocular accommodation and pupil constriction, respectively. Superior cervical ganglion neurons project to the dilator pupillae muscle of the iris to control pupil dilation. Ocular blood flow is controlled both via direct autonomic influences on the vasculature of the optic nerve, choroid, ciliary body, and iris, as well as via indirect influences on retinal blood flow. In mammals, this vasculature is innervated by vasodilatory fibers from the pterygopalatine ganglion, and by vasoconstrictive fibers from the superior cervical ganglion. Intraocular pressure is regulated primarily through the balance of aqueous humor formation and outflow. Autonomic regulation of ciliary body blood vessels and the ciliary epithelium is an important determinant of aqueous humor formation; autonomic regulation of the trabecular meshwork and episcleral blood vessels is an important determinant of aqueous humor outflow. These tissues are all innervated by fibers from the pterygopalatine and superior cervical ganglia. In addition to these classical autonomic pathways, trigeminal sensory fibers exert local, intrinsic influences on many of these regions of the eye, as well as on some neurons within the ciliary and pterygopalatine ganglia.",2015.0,420.0,371.0,"{'volume': '5 1', 'pages': '\n          439-73\n        ', 'name': 'Comprehensive Physiology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{McDougal2015AutonomicCO,\n author = {D.

The data were collected via behavior observation and analysis, questionnaires, and interviewing. The children participants demonstrated increased performance of responding, initiation, greeting, and positive conversation-ending during the intervention, and improved social competence measures after the intervention. The study also contributed salient themes on the adaptive design of a virtual-reality-based learning environment for learners with special needs.

The primary purpose of this article is to address a variety of potential mechanisms of change that may be associated with those aspects of DBT that are unique to the treatment and its theoretical underpinnings. Based on the biosocial theory of BPD, many of these mechanisms can be distilled down to the following process: the reduction of ineffective action tendencies linked with dysregulated emotions. Specifically we address the following interventions and associated mechanisms of change: mindfulness, validation, targeting and chain analysis, and dialectics. Patient change in BPD is conceptualized primarily as helping the patient to engage in functional, life-enhancing behavior, even when intense emotions are present. Ultimately, our goal was to provide guidance for theoretically and empirically grounded research on the mechanisms of change in DBT.",2006.0,92.0,533.0,"{'volume': '62 4', 'pages': '\n          459-80\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of clinical psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lynch2006MechanismsOC,\n author = {T.

This study links these two difficulties by examining parent—child joint picture-book reading to determine whether there were diagnostic group differences in parent and child storytelling. Method: Parents of 25 children with ADHD and 39 comparison children (mean age = 7.5 years) told their children a story based on a wordless picture-book, and children then retold the story to an examiner from memory. Results: Parents in both groups told stories of similar length and complexity and demonstrated similar affective and responsive quality. The length of the child's retell of the parent's story did not differ across groups but children with ADHD included fewer goal-based events. Conclusions: Results are discussed in terms of implications for enhancing the quality and frequency of parent—child storytelling among children with ADHD. (J. of Att.

A Systematic Review on Suggested Mechanisms of Action,"Background: Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing [EMDR] is an innovative, evidence-based and effective psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]. As with other psychotherapies, the effectiveness of EMDR contrasts with a limited knowledge of its underlying mechanism of action. In its relatively short life as a therapeutic option, EMDR has not been without controversy, in particular regarding the role of the bilateral stimulation as an active component of the therapy. The high prevalence of EMDR in clinical practice and the dramatic increase in EMDR research in recent years, with more than 26 randomized controlled trials published to date, highlight the need for a better understanding of its mechanism of action. Methods: We conducted a thorough systematic search of studies published until January 2018, using PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Knowledge and Scopus databases that examined the mechanism of action of EMDR or provided conclusions within the framework of current theoretical models of EMDR functioning. Results: Eighty-seven studies were selected for review and classified into three overarching models; (i) psychological models (ii) psychophysiological models and (iii) neurobiological models. The evidence available from each study was analyzed and discussed. Results demonstrated a reasonable empirical support for the working memory hypothesis and for the physiological changes associated with successful EMDR therapy. Recently, more sophisticated structural and functional neuroimaging studies using high resolution structural and temporal techniques are starting to provide preliminary evidence into the neuronal correlates before, during and after EMDR therapy. Discussion: Despite the increasing number of studies that published in recent years, the research into the mechanisms underlying EMDR therapy is still in its infancy. Studies in well-defined clinical and non-clinical populations, larger sample sizes and tighter methodological control are further needed in order to establish firm conclusions.",2018.0,160.0,84.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Landin-Romero2018HowDE,\n author = {R.

2153,e0f9362543791a3fe9c745dc95f725caff0ea9a9,Virtual reality,"Although the terms cyberspace and virtual reality have been around for years, virtual reality as an industry is in its infancy. The term virtual reality is credited to Jaron Lanier, founder of VPL Research; earlier experimenters, like Myron Krueger in the mid-1970s, used phrases like artificial reality. William Gibson coined cyberspace in his 1984 science fiction novel. Neuromancer. Few technologies in recent years have evoked such fiery discussions in the technical community, and fewer still have sparked such passionate involvement of the humanities and the cultural sector. Maybe the humanities community reacts because the VR interaction is so tightly coupled to the human senses. Perhaps the cultural sector clamours for a role in the evolution of VR because the technology is finally interfacing with the human, rather than the human interfacing with the technology. Whatever the reasons, VR is more a convergence of previously disparate disciplines than a whole new branch of technology. It simply takes a fresh look at human interaction. Evolving from user interface design, flight and visual simulation, and telepresence technologies, VR is unique in its emphasis on the experience of the human participant. VR focuses the user's attention on the experience while suspending disbelief about the method of creating it. We feel that neither the devices used nor the level of interactiveness or fidelity determine whether a system is VR. The quality of the experience is crucial. To stimulate creativity and productivity. the virtual experience must be credible. The reality must both react to the human participants in physically and perceptually appropriate ways, and conform to their personal cognitive representations of the microworld in which they are engrossed. The experience does not necessarily have to be realistic/spl minus/just consistent.<<ETX>>",1994.0,9.0,1722.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '15-16', 'name': 'IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Machover1994VirtualR,\n author = {C.

Emotion, it is argued, can be and ofter is subject to acts of management. The individual often works on inducing or inhibiting feelings so as to render them ""appropriate"" to a situation. The emotion-management perspective draws on an interactive account of emotion. It differs from the dramaturgical perspective on the one hand and the psychoanalytic perspective on the other. It allows us to inspect at closer range than either of those perspectives the relation among emotive experience, emotion management, feeling rules, and ideology. Feeling rules are seen as the side of ideology that deals with emotion and feeling. Emotion management is the type of work it takes to cope with feeling rules. Meaning-making jobs, more common in the middle class, put more premium on the individual's capacity to do emotion work. A reexamination of class differences in child rearing suggest that middle-class families prepare their children for emotion management more and working-class families prepare them less. In this way each prepares its children to psychologically reproduce the class structure.",1979.0,63.0,4382.0,"{'volume': '85', 'pages': '551 - 575', 'name': 'American Journal of Sociology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hochschild1979EmotionWF,\n author = {A.

The Brief Services psychotherapy paradigm has evolved to produce cost-effective and clinically significant outcomes in children's mental health. Though its clinical evaluation is still in its infancy, it has been utilized to a much lesser degree with autism spectrum disorders, which typically require a longer-term approach to psychotherapy treatment.


PURPOSE
The current paper introduces a novel, four-session intervention that aims to decrease anxiety experienced by clients presenting with high-functioning autism. Externalizing Metaphors Therapy is based upon the externalization of problems, transformation of metaphoric imagery, shifting of maladaptive emotional schemas, and the generalization of problems. A case study is utilized to visually aid in the understanding of this new treatment intervention.


SOURCE
A composite literature review was conducted with regards to significant works in Narrative Therapy, treatment interventions for anxiety and high functioning autism, evidence-based treatments for anxiety, and practice based approaches in psychotherapy. Works were selected based on their relevance to the research filed of anxiety and autism.


CONCLUSIONS
This clinical research challenges the children's mental health field in addressing anxiety and high-functioning autism from a brief framework. Further clinical research is needed to clinically evaluate the current model.",2018.0,59.0,3.0,"{'volume': '31 2-3', 'pages': '\n          87-96\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of child and adolescent psychiatric nursing : official publication of the Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Nurses, Inc'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{McGuinty2018NovelFT,\n author = {Everett McGuinty and Brian M.

We propose to compare the recognition of basic emotions on a real human and on an expressive virtual human. The virtual human was subject to two different factors: expressive wrinkles and/or pupil size. Our results indicate that emotion recognition rates on the virtual agent are high.

In particular, we describe the Empathic Companion, an animated interface agent that accompanies the user in the setting of a virtual job interview. This interface application takes physiological data (skin conductance and electromyography) of a user in realtime, interprets them as emotions, and addresses the user's affective states in the form of empathic feedback. The Empathic Companion is conceived as an educational agent that supports job seekers preparing for a job interview. We also present results from an exploratory study that aims to evaluate the impact of the Empathic Companion by measuring users' skin conductance and heart rate. While an overall positive effect of the Empathic Companion could not be shown, the outcome of the experiment suggests that empathic feedback has a positive effect on the interviewee's stress level while hearing the interviewer question.",2005.0,30.0,305.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '267 - 285', 'name': 'Applied Artificial Intelligence'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Prendinger2005THEEC,\n author = {H.

One group of ten subjects searched for a box in a real office environment. A second group of ten subjects carried out the same task in a virtual environment that simulated the same office. Immediately after their experience, subjects were given two different presence questionnaires in randomized order: the Witmer and Singer Presence (WS), and the questionnaire developed by Slater, Usoh, and Steed (SUS). The paper argues that questionnaires should be able to pass a reality test whereby under current conditions the presence scores should be higher for real experiences than for virtual ones. Nevertheless, only the SUS had a marginally higher mean score for the real compared to the virtual, and there was no significant difference at all between the WS mean scores.

One cannot be all things, which would require mastery of every realm of human life. People differ in the areas in which they cultivate their efficacy and in the levels to which they develop it even within their given pursuits. For example, a business executive may have a high sense of organizational efficacy but low parenting efficacy. Thus, the efficacy belief system is not a global trait but a differentiated set of self-beliefs linked to distinct realms of functioning. Multidomain measures reveal the patterning and degree of generality of people's sense of personal efficacy. There is no all-purpose measure of perceived self-efficacy. The "" one measure fits all "" approach usually has limited explanatory and predictive value because most of the items in an all-purpose test may have little or no relevance to the domain of functioning. Moreover, in an effort to serve all purposes, items in such a measure are usually cast in general terms divorced from the situational demands and circumstances. This leaves much ambiguity about exactly what is being measured or the level of task and situational demands that must be managed. Scales of perceived self-CHAPTER 14 Note that this date is incorrect. The book was published in 2006. 308 A. BANDURA efficacy must be tailored to the particular domain of functioning that is the object of interest. Although efficacy beliefs are multifaceted, social cognitive theory identifies several conditions under which they may co-vary even across distinct domains of functioning (Bandura, 1997). When different spheres of activity are governed by similar sub-skills there is some inter-domain relation in perceived efficacy. Proficient performance is partly guided by higher-order self-regulatory skills. These include generic skills for diagnosing task demands, constructing and evaluating alternative courses of action, setting proximal goals to guide one's efforts, and creating self-incentives to sustain engagement in taxing activities and to manage stress and debilitating intrusive thoughts. Generic self-management strategies developed in one realm of activity are serviceable in other activity domains with resulting co-variation in perceived efficacy among them. Co-development is still another correlative process. Even if different activity domains are not sub-served by common sub-skills, the same perceived efficacy can occur if development of competencies is socially structured so that skills in dissimilar domains are developed together. For example, students are likely to develop similarly high perceived self-efficacy …",2006.0,20.0,4592.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Bandura2006GUIDEFC,\n author = {A.

Eighteen children with spastic CP were randomly divided into the virtual reality treadmill training (VRTT) group (9 subjects, mean age, 10.2 years) and treadmill training (TT) group (9 subjects, mean age, 9.4 years). The groups performed their respective programs as well as conventional physical therapy 3 times/week for 8 weeks. Muscle strength was assessed using a digitalized manual muscle tester. Gross motor function was assessed using the Gross Motor Functional Measure (GMFM). Balance was assessed using the Pediatric Balance Scale (PBS). Gait speed was assessed using the 10-meter walk test (10MWT), and gait endurance was assessed using the 2-minute walk test (2MWT). After training, gait and balance was improved in the VRTT compared to the TT group (P < 0.05). Muscular strength was significantly greater in the VRTT group than the TT group, except for right hamstring strength. The improvements in GMFM (standing) and PBS scores were greater in the VRTT group than the TT group (P < 0.05).

Two common modes of use are scanning, or general browsing of data; and focused search, or seeking answers to specific questions or well-defined problems. The purpose of this study was to investigate the antecedents of these two different modes of EIS use and also to examine their implications for perceived performance changes.The results show that, whenexecutives focus their use of EIS to answer specific questions or solve well-defined problems, they help to fine-tune operations and verify assumptions -- in other words, they help to make the organization more efficient. However, an EIS may also lead an executive to challenge fundamental managerial assumptions and preconceptions when using it to scan through information without having specific questions in mind. In this mode, an EIS may be used to help formulate problems and foster creativity -- thereby improving organizational effectiveness.EISs were found to contribute to gains in efficiency much more frequently than to gains in effectiveness. Companies that want to achieve greater effectiveness should pay attention to the role of the EIS in the scanning behavior of their managers.

In veterans with PTSD, up to two-thirds retain their diagnosis after psychotherapy and often their disorder is treatment-resistant, which calls for improvement of therapeutic approaches for this population. One of the factors hypothesized to underlie low response in PTSD treatment is high behavioral and cognitive avoidance to traumatic reminders. In the current paper we explore if a combination of personalized virtual reality, multi-sensory input, and walking during exposure can enhance treatment engagement, overcome avoidance, and thereby optimize treatment effectiveness. Virtual reality holds potential to increase presence and in-session attention and to facilitate memory retrieval. Multi-sensory input such as pictures and music can personalize this experience. Evidence for the positive effect of physical activity on fear extinction and associative thinking, as well as embodied cognition theories, provide a rationale for decreased avoidance by literally approaching cues of the traumatic memories. A dual-attention task further facilitates new learning and reconsolidation. These strategies have been combined in an innovative framework for trauma-focused psychotherapy, named Multi-modular Motion-assisted Memory Desensitization and Reconsolidation (3MDR). In this innovative treatment the therapeutic setting is changed from the face-to-face sedentary position to a side-by-side activating context in which patients walk toward trauma-related images in a virtual environment. The framework of 3MDR has been designed as a boost for patients with treatment-resistant PTSD, which is illustrated by three case examples. The intervention is discussed in context of other advancements in treatment for treatment-resistant PTSD. Novel elements of this approach are activation, personalization and empowerment. While developed for veterans with PTSD who do not optimally respond to standardized treatments, this innovative framework holds potential to also be used for other patient populations and earlier stages of treatment for patients with PTSD.",2018.0,92.0,39.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gelderen2018AnIF,\n author = {M.

We assess the prevalence of mental health problems and examine their association with social media exposure. A cross-sectional study among Chinese citizens aged≥18 years old was conducted during Jan 31 to Feb 2, 2020. Online survey was used to do rapid assessment. Total of 4872 participants from 31 provinces and autonomous regions were involved in the current study. Besides demographics and social media exposure (SME), depression was assessed by The Chinese version of WHO-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and anxiety was assessed by Chinese version of generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7). multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify associations between social media exposure with mental health problems after controlling for covariates. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and combination of depression and anxiety (CDA) was 48.3% (95%CI: 46.9%-49.7%), 22.6% (95%CI: 21.4%-23.8%) and 19.4% (95%CI: 18.3%-20.6%) during COVID-19 outbroke in Wuhan, China. More than 80% (95%CI:80.9%-83.1%) of participants reported frequently exposed to social media. After controlling for covariates, frequently SME was positively associated with high odds of anxiety (OR = 1.72, 95%CI: 1.31–2.26) and CDA (OR = 1.91, 95%CI: 1.52–2.41) compared with less SME.

Research in alcohol, marijuana, and nicotine use disorders have linked coping motives (e.g. using substances to ameliorate negative emotional states) to problematic substance use. We evaluated the link between emotion regulation difficulties (as assessed via the difficulties in emotion regulation scale [DERS]) and motives for drug use (as assessed via the Drug Use Motives Questionnaire) among individuals (n = 68) with opioid use disorders who were in methadone maintenance treatment. We found that the DERS total score was significantly associated with coping motives for use. Nonacceptance of emotional responses was the only DERS domain that offered nonredundant prediction of coping motives. These findings highlight the relevance of specific emotion regulation deficits in motives for illicit drug use among individuals with opioid use disorders and may help inform targeted cognitive-behavioral treatments in this population.",2020.0,31.0,17.0,"{'volume': '49', 'pages': '74 - 80', 'name': 'Cognitive Behaviour Therapy'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gold2020EmotionRA,\n author = {Alexandra K.

Rather, based on five theoretical arguments, we propose that the social sharing of an emotional experience forms an integral part of the emotional processes. A series of six studies investigated different aspects of this hypothesis. Study 1 showed that an overwhelming majority of people reported sharing their emotional experiences and that the memories of these experiences tended to come back spontaneously to their consciousness. No difference was found among emotions. Using a different procedure, Studies 2 and 3 replicated these findings in two different populations. In addition, these studies provided indications that women share their experiences with a wider array of individuals than do men. The first three studies did not find any differences among emotions, but they did not include shame. It could be argued that people are less inclined to socially share shame experiences which are typically eli...",1991.0,35.0,514.0,"{'volume': '5', 'pages': '435-465', 'name': 'Cognition & Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rimé1991BeyondTE,\n author = {B.

In Experiment 1A (N = 58), we replicated previous results, showing that individuals prefer distraction in high- and reappraisal in low-intensity conditions, irrespective of depressive symptom levels. Experiment 1B (N = 50) assessed the efficacy of distraction and reappraisal strategies in aversive conditions with low and high intensity. Contrary to our prediction, reappraisal was more effective than distraction, independent of the intensity of the aversive conditions. In Experiment 2 (N = 113), we tested the interactive relationship between perceived intensity levels and depression on the relative effectiveness of reappraisal and distraction. We found that while in perceived low-intensity situations the advantage of distraction over reappraisal increased as depressive symptoms increased, no such relationship was found in high-intensity situations. The results suggest that while all individuals prefer to apply reappraisal in both low- and high-intensity conditions, for those with high level of depressive symptoms, such a preference acts against their own interests. The study highlights the need to distinguish between emotion regulation preferences and their actual efficacy, while illuminating possible implications for individuals with depressive symptoms.",2021.0,83.0,2.0,"{'volume': '16', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vered2021ActingAY,\n author = {Rotem Vered and S.

The authors describe a model of forgiveness based on the hypothesis that people forgive others to the extent that they experience empathy for them. Two studies investigated the empathy model of forgiveness. In Study 1, the authors developed measures of empathy and forgiveness. The authors found evidence consistent with the hypotheses that (a) the relationship between receiving an apology from and forgiving one's offender is a function of increased empathy for the offender and (b) that forgiving is uniquely related to conciliatory behavior and avoidance behavior toward the offending partner. In Study 2, the authors conducted an intervention in which empathy was manipulated to examine the empathy-forgiving relationship more closely. Results generally supported the conceptualization of forgiving as a motivational phenomenon and the empathy-forgiving link.",1997.0,115.0,1519.0,"{'volume': '73 2', 'pages': '\n          321-36\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{McCullough1997InterpersonalFI,\n author = {M.

2206,e81409111f008efac68bf89e86004a985dea1047,Application of Sustainable Development of Teaching in Engineering Education: A Case Study of Undergraduate Course Design of Raman Spectroscopy Based on Virtual Reality (VR) Technology,"One of the core objectives of the Washington Agreement, the most influential international agreement on the mutual recognition of degrees in engineering education, is to ensure the continuous improvement of professional teaching. Education for sustainable development is a vital direction of teaching reform and development of higher engineering education. Taking a Raman spectroscopy course as an example, this paper discusses VR-based course design and the strengths and limitations of a VR-based course. The idea of computational thinking and immersive learning is realized by introducing VR technology. Based on the research status in the field of Raman spectroscopy, the contents of 10 Raman spectroscopy courses are redesigned. Through a questionnaire survey, peer review, and interview, the rationality of the course design is evaluated, and based on this, a feedback mechanism is established to ensure the continuous improvement of the course. Eventually, the advantages and disadvantages of the new curriculum are evaluated, and the development direction and limitations of the corresponding teaching model are put forward. According to the research, although 85% of the students said that it is difficult to accept the VR-based course at short notice, 90% and more of the students recognize this new teaching model. They believe that the VR-based course changes their traditional learning habits and helps cultivate self-learning ability.

To address the problem, there has been a growing interest in conducting a single component of MBSR such as body scan. However, the impact of a sole mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of body scan meditation. A search of databases, including PubMed, Embase, EBSCO, Cochrance, Proquest Dissertations, and Theses, was conducted for randomized controlled trials with no population restriction. Fourteen independent articles were identified and outcomes were divided into seven categories. A meta-analysis with robust variance estimation was conducted separately for different outcome categories. Body scan only had small effect on mindfulness when compared with passive control (Hedge's g = .268, 95% CI = [0.032, 0.504], p < .05). The attrition rate of long-term interventions was low. The quality of these studies was low. There was high heterogeneity across studies.

Methods: The authors conducted a prospective cohort study of 3,718 participants, aged 65 years and older of the Chicago Health and Aging Project. Participants completed a food frequency questionnaire and were administered at least two of three cognitive assessments at baseline, 3-year, and 6-year follow-ups. Cognitive function was measured using the average z-score of four tests: the East Boston Tests of immediate memory and delayed recall, the Mini-Mental State Examination, and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test. Results: The mean cognitive score at baseline for the analyzed cohort was 0.18 (range: –3.5 to 1.6), and the overall mean change in score per year was a decline of 0.04 standardized units. In mixed effects models adjusted for age, sex, race, and education, compared with the rate of cognitive decline among persons in the lowest quintile of vegetable intake (median of 0.9 servings/day), the rate for persons in the fourth quintile (median, 2.8 servings/day) was slower by 0.019 standardized units per year (p = 0.01), a 40% decrease, and by 0.018 standardized units per year (p = 0.02) for the fifth quintile (median, 4.1 servings/day), or a 38% decrease in rates. The association remained significant (p for linear trend = 0.02) with further control of cardiovascular-related conditions and risk factors.

VR-based testing and training scenarios that would be difficult, if not impossible, to deliver using conventional neuropsychological methods are now being developed that take advantage of the assets available with VR technology. If empirical studies continue to demonstrate effectiveness, virtual environment applications could provide new options for targeting cognitive and functional impairments due to traumatic brain injury, neurological disorders, and learning disabilities. This article focuses on specifying the assets that are available with VR for neuropsychological applications along with discussion of current VR-based research that serves to illustrate each asset. VR allows for the precise presentation and control of dynamic multi-sensory 3D stimulus environments, as well as providing advanced methods for recording behavioural responses. This serves as the basis for a diverse set of VR assets for neuropsychological approaches that are detailed in this article. We take the position that when combining these assets within the context of functionally relevant, ecologically valid virtual environments, fundamental advancements can emerge in how human cognition and functional behaviour is assessed and rehabilitated.",2004.0,83.0,426.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '207 - 239', 'name': 'Neuropsychological Rehabilitation'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rizzo2004AnalysisOA,\n author = {A.

Across all 6 studies, the strongest predictors of later achievement are school-entry math, reading, and attention skills. A meta-analysis of the results shows that early math skills have the greatest predictive power, followed by reading and then attention skills. By contrast, measures of socioemotional behaviors, including internalizing and externalizing problems and social skills, were generally insignificant predictors of later academic performance, even among children with relatively high levels of problem behavior.

The results confirmed that the subjects used a variety of coping strategies including diversion, suppression, problem solving, minimization, and retaliation and that certain coping strategies influenced the dysphoria experienced as a result of peer stress. High acculturated children used retaliation significantly more often than their low acculturated counterparts and retaliation was found to be associated with less dysphoria for the high acculturated group. In contrast, low acculturated children who utilized suppression tended to report less dysphoria. Contrary to the hypothesis that general self worth would reduce the relationship between peer stressors and dysphoria, it had no bearing on the association for either acculturated group.

2222,e9ed4438e3b386b164cf01451544e1607f5c5b2d,Smoking cessation interventions for smokers with current or past depression.,"BACKGROUND
Individuals with current or past depression are often smokers who are more nicotine dependent, more likely to suffer from negative mood changes after nicotine withdrawal, and more likely to relapse to smoking after quitting than the general population, which contributes to their higher morbidity and mortality from smoking-related illnesses. It remains unclear what interventions can help them to quit smoking.


OBJECTIVES
To evaluate the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions, with and without specific mood management components, in smokers with current or past depression.


SEARCH METHODS
In April 2013, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, other reviews, and asked experts for information on trials.


SELECTION CRITERIA
Criteria for including studies in this review were that they had to be randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing smoking cessation interventions in adult smokers with current or past depression. Depression was defined as major depression or depressive symptoms. We included studies where subgroups of participants with depression were identified, either pre-stated or post hoc. The outcome was abstinence from smoking after six months or longer follow-up. We preferred prolonged or continuous abstinence and biochemically validated abstinence where available.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
When possible, we estimated pooled risk ratios (RRs) with the Mantel-Haenszel method (fixed-effect model). We also performed subgroup analyses, by length of follow-up, depression measurement, depression group in study, antidepressant use, published or unpublished data, format of intervention, level of behavioural support, additional pharmacotherapy, type of antidepressant medication, and additional nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).


MAIN RESULTS
Forty-nine RCTs were included of which 33 trials investigated smoking cessation interventions with specific mood management components for depression. In smokers with current depression, meta-analysis showed a significant positive effect for adding psychosocial mood management to a standard smoking cessation intervention when compared with standard smoking cessation intervention alone (11 trials, N = 1844, RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.92). In smokers with past depression we found a similar effect (13 trials, N = 1496, RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.77). Meta-analysis resulted in a positive effect, although not significant, for adding bupropion compared with placebo in smokers with current depression (5 trials, N = 410, RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.27). There were not enough trial data to evaluate the effectiveness of fluoxetine and paroxetine for smokers with current depression. Bupropion (4 trials, N = 404, RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.31 to 3.18) might significantly increase long-term cessation among smokers with past depression when compared with placebo, but the evidence for bupropion is relatively weak due to the small number of studies and the post hoc subgroups for all the studies. There were not enough trial data to evaluate the effectiveness of fluoxetine, nortriptyline, paroxetine, selegiline, and sertraline in smokers with past depression.Twenty-three of the 49 trials investigated smoking cessation interventions without specific components for depression. There was heterogeneity between the trials which compared psychosocial interventions with standard smoking cessation counselling for both smokers with current and past depression. Therefore, we did not estimate a pooled effect. One trial compared nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) versus placebo in smokers with current depression and found a positive, although not significant, effect (N = 196, RR 2.64, 95% CI 0.93 to 7.45). Meta-analysis also found a positive, although not significant, effect for NRT versus placebo in smokers with past depression (3 trials, N = 432, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.60). Three trials compared other pharmacotherapy versus placebo and six trials compared other interventions in smokers with current or past depression. Due to heterogeneity between the interventions of the included trials we did not estimate pooled effects.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
Evidence suggests that adding a psychosocial mood management component to a standard smoking cessation intervention increases long-term cessation rates in smokers with both current and past depression when compared with the standard intervention alone. Pooled results from four trials suggest that use of bupropion may increase long-term cessation in smokers with past depression.

The effects of sweat, tears, and colors are integrated into a single animation model to create realistic facial expressions of 3D avatar. The physical properties of muscles, emotions, or the fluid properties with sweating and tears initiators are incorporated. The action units (AUs) of facial action coding system are merged with autonomous AUs to create expressions including sadness, anger with blushing, happiness with blushing, and fear. Fluid effects such as sweat and tears are simulated using the particle system and smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) methods which are combined with facial animation technique to produce complex facial expressions. The effects of oxygenation of the facial skin color appearance are measured using the pulse oximeter system and the 3D skin analyzer. The result shows that virtual human facial expression is enhanced by mimicking actual sweating and tears simulations for all extreme expressions.

Recently, films such as Tron: Legacy and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button have produced highly realistic characters. In the real-time domain, there is also a need to deliver realistic virtual characters, with the increase in popularity of interactive drama video games (such as L.A. Noire™ or Heavy Rain™). There have been mixed reactions from audiences to lifelike characters used in movies and games, with some saying that the increased realism highlights subtle imperfections, which can be disturbing. Some developers opt for a stylized rendering (such as cartoon-shading) to avoid a negative reaction [Thompson 2004]. In this paper, we investigate some of the consequences of choosing realistic or stylized rendering in order to provide guidelines for developers for creating appealing virtual characters. We conducted a series of psychophysical experiments to determine whether render style affects how virtual humans are perceived.

A paradigm that examines whether someone can perceive and benefit from regulatory efforts by another person, represented here by a virtual agent, would be highly relevant for experimental studies investigating social emotion regulation, as well as for interventions in the clinical and sub-clinical context. Virtual reality (VR) provides perhaps the ideal opportunity to test social interactions and difficulties with them, as it counters typical methodological problems of behavioral experiments, such as the trade-off between ecological validity and experimental control, as well as the difficulty of replicating social situations. The goal of the present methods paper is twofold: to provide a detailed description of the development of a novel paradigm consisting of two scenarios in VR designed to test the efficacy of social emotion regulation, and to present the anticipated results for the target populations of typically developing and autistic youth. Participants are presented with a virtual school environment and take part in two activities with a class of students and a teacher, all of whom are virtual agents. In both scenarios, participants experience a potentially stressful situation and are subsequently offered emotional support by a friendly student. Throughout the experiment, self-reports in the form of virtual smiley scales and psychophysiological measurements are collected as markers of the participants’ emotional states. Pilot results will be discussed in line with anticipated outcomes, to indicate that the experiment will be able to show the efficacy of social support by a virtual agent and provide insight into social emotion regulation for different populations. The school environment and the character of the friendly student also have the potential to be adapted for follow-up experiments on additional aspects of social emotion regulation for a variety of contexts.",2022.0,53.0,0.0,{'volume': '3'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Stallmann2022SociallySB,\n author = {Lina Stallmann and Daniel Dukes and Michel Tran and Valentin Durand de Gevigney and D.

The framework consists of a coupled Bayesian network (BN) to unify the facial expression analysis and synthesis into one coherent structure. At the analysis end, we cast the FAPs and facial action coding system (FACS) into a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to account for uncertainties in FAP extraction and to model the dynamic evolution of facial expressions. At the synthesizer, a static BN reconstructs the FAPs and their intensity. The two BNs are connected statically through a data stream link. Using the coupled BN to analyze and synthesize the dynamic facial expressions is the major novelty of this work. The novelty brings about several benefits. First, very low bitrate (9 bytes per frame) in data transmission can be achieved. Second, a facial expression is inferred through both spatial and temporal inference so that the perceptual quality of animation is less affected by the misdetected FAPs. Third, more realistic looking facial expressions can be reproduced by modelling the dynamics of human expressions.",2008.0,46.0,75.0,"{'volume': '18', 'pages': '1383-1396', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zhang2008DynamicFE,\n author = {Yongmian Zhang and Q.

Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short- and long-term positive outcomes. Objective This study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression. Methods In the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations. Results The average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre- and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging. Conclusions The real-world data evaluation findings on the effectiveness and engagement levels of Wysa app on users with self-reported symptoms of depression show promise. However, further work is required to validate these initial findings in much larger samples and across longer periods.",2018.0,55.0,332.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'JMIR mHealth and uHealth'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Inkster2018AnEC,\n author = {B.

However, an effect size associated with the difference between the trajectories of the intervention and control groups that captures the treatment effect is rarely reported. This article first reviews 2 classes of formulas for effect sizes associated with classical repeated-measures designs that use the standard deviation of either change scores or raw scores for the denominator. It then broadens the scope to subsume GMA and demonstrates that the independent groups, within-subjects, pretest-posttest control-group, and GMA designs all estimate the same effect size when the standard deviation of raw scores is uniformly used. Finally, the article shows that the correct effect size for treatment efficacy in GMA--the difference between the estimated means of the 2 groups at end of study (determined from the coefficient for the slope difference and length of study) divided by the baseline standard deviation--is not reported in clinical trials.",2009.0,67.0,662.0,"{'volume': '14 1', 'pages': '\n          43-53\n        ', 'name': 'Psychological methods'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Feingold2009EffectSF,\n author = {A.

2242,ebc6254db28c04ee9882764eaa284eba7f184fc0,Multi-class sentiment analysis on twitter: Classification performance and challenges,"Sentiment analysis refers to the automatic collection, aggregation, and classification of data collected online into different emotion classes. While most of the work related to sentiment analysis of texts focuses on the binary and ternary classification of these data, the task of multi-class classification has received less attention. Multi-class classification has always been a challenging task given the complexity of natural languages and the difficulty of understanding and mathematically ""quantifying"" how humans express their feelings. In this paper, we study the task of multi-class classification of online posts of Twitter users, and show how far it is possible to go with the classification, and the limitations and difficulties of this task. The proposed approach of multi-class classification achieves an accuracy of 60.2% for 7 different sentiment classes which, compared to an accuracy of 81.3% for binary classification, emphasizes the effect of having multiple classes on the classification performance. Nonetheless, we propose a novel model to represent the different sentiments and show how this model helps to understand how sentiments are related. The model is then used to analyze the challenges that multi-class classification presents and to highlight possible future enhancements to multi-class classification accuracy.",2019.0,18.0,61.0,"{'volume': '2', 'pages': '181-194', 'name': 'Big Data Min.

Various types of dyslexia exist, characterized by different error types. We examined a question that has not been tested so far: which types of errors (and dyslexias) are affected by MBSR training. To do so, we tested, using an extensive battery of reading tests, whether each participant had dyslexia, and which errors types s/he makes, and then compared the rate of each error type before and after the MBSR workshop. We used a similar approach to attention disorders: we evaluated the participants’ sustained, selective, executive, and orienting of attention to assess whether they had attention-disorders, and if so, which functions were impaired. We then evaluated the effect of MBSR on each of the attention functions. Psychological measures including mindfulness, stress, reflection and rumination, lifesatisfaction, depression, anxiety, and sleep-disturbances were also evaluated. Nineteen Hebrew-readers completed a 2-month mindfulness workshop. The results showed that whereas reading errors of letter-migrations within and between words and vowelletter errors did not decrease following the workshop, most participants made fewer reading errors in general following the workshop, with a significant reduction of 19% from their original number of errors. This decrease mainly resulted from a decrease in errors that occur due to reading via the sublexical rather than the lexical route. It seems, therefore, that mindfulness helped reading by keeping the readers on the lexical route. This improvement in reading probably resulted from improved sustained attention: the reduction in sublexical reading was significant for the dyslexic participants who also had attention deficits, and there were significant correlations between reduced reading errors and decreases in impulsivity. Following the meditation workshop, the rate of commission errors decreased, indicating decreased impulsivity, and the variation in RTs in the CPT task decreased, indicating improved sustained attention. Significant improvements were obtained in participants’ mindfulness, perceived-stress, rumination, depression, state-anxiety, and sleep-disturbances. Correlations were also obtained between reading improvement and increased mindfulness following the workshop. Thus, whereas mindfulness training did not affect specific types of errors and did not improve dyslexia, it did affect the reading of adults with developmental dyslexia and ADHD, by helping them to stay on the straight path of the lexical route while reading. Thus, the reading improvement induced by mindfulness sheds light on the intricate relation between attention and reading. Mindfulness reduced impulsivity and improved sustained attention, and this, in turn, improved reading of adults with developmental dyslexia and ADHD, by helping them to read via the straight path of the lexical route.",2016.0,121.0,17.0,"{'volume': '7', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tarrasch2016MindfulRM,\n author = {R.

Americans: The Moderating Role of Acculturation","Two widely studied strategies of emotion regulation are suppression (inhibiting emotional response) and reappraisal (reframing an emotional experience). Suppression has been associated with greater instances of internalizing (i.e., depression) and externalizing (i.e., gambling) problems. However, among Asian individuals where suppression is encouraged in their collectivistic culture, the opposite effect has been observed. This, however, does not consider Asian Americans, who may be exposed to both collectivistic and western, individualistic cultural norms. One way to account for this cultural discrepancy is through examining acculturation, the extent to which an individual is assimilated into their host or heritage culture. The present study aimed to examine whether acculturation influences the strength of the association between emotion regulation strategies (suppression and reappraisal) and internalizing/externalizing problems in a sample of Filipino Americans. Participants completed a virtual gambling task assessing their externalizing problems, as well as a series of questionnaires assessing their acculturation, emotion regulation strategy frequencies, and internalizing problems.

In recent years, affective computing systems using physiological signals, such as ECG, GSR and EEG has shown very promising results. However, like many other machine learning studies involving physiological signals, the bottle neck is always around the database acquisition and the annotation process. To investigate potential ways to address this small sample problem, this paper introduces a Deep Belief Networks (DBN) based learning system for the EEG-based affective processing system. Through the greedy-layer pretraining using unlabeled data as well as a supervised fine-tuning process, the DBN-based approaches significantly reduced the number of labeled samples required. The DBN methods also acted as an application specific feature selector, by examining the weight vector between the input feature vector and the first invisible layer, we can gain much needed insights on the spatial or spectral locations of the most discriminating features. In this study, DBNs are trained on the narrow-band spectral features extracted from multichannel EEG recordings. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed DBN-based learning system, we carried out an subject-independent affective states classification experiments on the DEAP database to classify 2-dimensional affect states. As a baseline to the proposed DBN approach, the same classification problem was also carried out using support vector machines (SVMs) and one-way ANOVA based feature selection process. The classification results shown that the proposed framework using Deep Belief Networks not only provided better classification performance, but also significantly lower the number of labeled data required to train such machine learning systems.",2016.0,21.0,24.0,"{'pages': '148-153', 'name': '2016 Digital Media Industry & Academic Forum (DMIAF)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Xu2016EEGbasedAS,\n author = {Haiyan Xu and K.

The older subjects studied for a while, said they were ready, and usually were, that is, they showed perfect recall. The younger children studied for a while, said they were ready, and usually were not. In another study, elementary school children were asked to help the experimenter evaluate the communicative adequacy of verbal instructions, indicating any omissions and obscurities (Markman, 1977). Although the instructions were riddled with blatant omissions and obscurities, the younger subjects were surprisingly poor at detecting them. They incorrectly thought they had understood and could follow the instructions, much as their counterparts in the study by Flavell et al. (1970) incorrectly thought they had memorized and could recall the items. Results such as these have suggested that young children are quite limited in their knowledge and cognition about cognitive phenomena, or in their metacognition, and do relatively little monitoring of their own memory, comprehension, and other cognitive enterprises (see, e.g., Brown, 1978; Flavell, 1978; Flavell & Wellman, 1977; Kreutzer, Leonard, & Flavell, 1975; Flavell, Note 1, Note 2, Note 3; Markman, Note 4).

By using functional MRI in humans exposed to bistable viewing conditions, subjective visual perception was related to covariation of activity in multiple extrastriate ventral, parietal, and prefrontal cortical areas. The coordination of activity among these regions was not linked to external sensory or motor events; rather, it reflected internal changes in perception and varied in strength with the frequency of perceptual events, suggesting that functional interactions between visual and prefrontal cortex may contribute to conscious vision.

Children with neurodevelopmental disorders may show difficulties in self-regulation. The main objective of this study is to improve self-regulation skills in children between 6 and 11 years of age with neurodevelopmental disorders. Methodology: A randomized controlled trial will be conducted with the use of “SR-MRehab: Un colegio emocionante”, based on a non-immersive virtual reality system where virtual objects can be managed by children in a natural way using their hands. Children will be recruited from several schools of Granada (Spain) and they will be randomly allocated to two groups. An assessment will be conducted before and after the intervention and 24 weeks after the end of the intervention process. The experimental group will receive the intervention using virtual reality. The control group will receive a standard self-regulation program. Both interventions will be performed once a week for a total of 10 sessions. Changes in self-regulation, as well as the acceptability of technology with the use of SR-MRehab, will be evaluated.

A phenomenological hermeneutic interpretation (Ricouer, 1976) of the data reveal that family members struggle with their own suffering while showing compassion for the injured person. Their willingness to assume care for the injured person is derived from their feeling of natural love and the ethical demand to be responsible for the other.

Using ethnographic and netnographic data from the collaborative network of geocaching, this study explains the emergence of hybrid economies. Performativity theory is mobilized to demonstrate that the hybrid status of these economies is constantly under threat of destabilization by the struggle between competing performativities of market and nonmarket modes of exchange. Despite latent tension between competing performativities, the hybrid economy is sustained through consumer–producer engagements in collaborative consumption and production, the creation of zones of indeterminacy, and the enactment of tournaments of value that dissipate controversies around hybrid transactions.

VR is argued to offer particular benefits for children on the autism spectrum, chiefly because it can offer simulations of authentic real-world situations in a carefully controlled and safe environment. Given the real world social difficulties experienced by children on the spectrum, this technology has therefore been argued to offer distinct advantages and benefits for social and life skills training compared to other approaches. Whilst there has been some progress in testing the relevance and applicability of VR for children on the autism spectrum in educational contexts, there remains a significant challenge in developing robust and usable technologies that can really make a difference in real world classrooms.

Due to this unprecedented situation, school education hassince shifted to a heavy reliance on various forms of remote learning, and teachers and students have been forced to practice completely new ways of teaching and learning.Virtual learning requires students to draw from a different skill set than what is used in face-to-face settings, such as self-regulation for navigating online learning, or balancinglearning and life at home. These new and challenging experiences coincide with limited opportunities for social engagement and an increased potential for isolation. These factors are continuing to contribute to children experiencing high levels of stress as the sense of normalcy is lost from their lives and they are bombarded with new expectations and responsibilities. Children need social and emotional support now more than ever.

Emotions can have good effects, as when a scientist gets excited about a line of research and pursues it successfully despite criticism. But emotions can also distort reasoning, as when a juror ignores evidence of guilt just because the accused seems like a nice guy. In Hot Thought, Paul Thagard describes the mental mechanisms -- cognitive, neural, molecular, and social -- that interact to produce different kinds of human thinking, from everyday decision making to legal reasoning, scientific discovery, and religious belief, and he discusses when and how thinking and reasoning should be emotional. Thagard argues that an understanding of emotional thinking needs to integrate the cognitive, neural, molecular, and social levels. Many of the chapters employ computational models of various levels of thinking, including HOTCO (hot cognition) models and the more neurologically realistic GAGE model. Thagard uses these models to illuminate thinking in the domains of law, science, and religion, discussing such topics as the role of doubt and reasonable doubt in legal and other contexts, valuable emotional habits for successful scientists, and the emotional content of religious beliefs. Identifying and assessing the impact of emotion, Thagard argues, can suggest ways to improve the process of reasoning.",2006.0,0.0,267.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Thagard2006HotTM,\n author = {Paul Thagard},\n title = {Hot Thought: Mechanisms and Applications of Emotional Cognition},\n year = {2006}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '1756123', 'name': 'Paul Thagard'}]"

Some people who find it hard to manage their emotions can be helped by a therapy called Dialectic Behaviour Therapy (DBT). Some studies show that DBT might help people with an intellectual disability. 
We ran a group to see if DBT helped people coming to the group to feel better and manage their difficult feelings more easily. Group members brought their support staff to the group. 
We asked people what they thought about the group and asked them to fill in some questionnaires to see whether they felt better. 
The group seemed to help people, even after the group ended. 
We think DBT might be a useful treatment for people with intellectual disabilities. 
 
 
AbstractBackground 
A growing body of evidence supports the use of Dialectic Behaviour Therapy with people with an intellectual disability. Various adaptation have been used in studies exploring the efficacy of this intervention. 
 
Method 
A Dialectic Behaviour Therapy DBT skills training group was attended by people with an intellectual disability and their support staff. Standardised measures of psychological well-being, overall functioning and psychological distress were taken before and after the group and at 4 months follow-up. Qualitative interviews were conducted and analysed using thematic analysis. 
 
Results 
Results suggested an improvement in all areas for three of the four participants, which were largely maintained at follow-up. 
 
Conclusions 
This study adds to the growing literature supporting the use of DBT with people with an intellectual disability. The role of support workers in supporting generalisation of skills is considered. Ideas for improving the quality of future studies are considered.",2017.0,19.0,21.0,"{'volume': '45', 'pages': '208–216', 'name': 'British Journal of Learning Disabilities'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Crossland2017OutcomesAE,\n author = {Tom Crossland and O.

This uncharted role is the focus of this study, which surveyed 405 undergraduates in Hong Kong, China. Results demonstrated the pivotal role of emotional intelligence. Essentially, emotional intelligence appeared to be a strong determinant of self-esteem and explain away the positive effect of social competence on self-esteem.

Satisfaction with the waits and satisfaction with the core service product, employees' behavior and the physical setting were examined in relation to customers' perceptions of service quality. Four measures of customers' perceptions of service quality were used in this study. These included overall customer satisfaction, willingness to recommend the service to friends, willingness to bring friends to the service and repatronage intentions.

This includes services for verticals that demand Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC). Scheduling strongly impacts the communication latency, and 5G NR introduces grant-free scheduling to reduce the latency at the radio level. Grant-free scheduling can use shared resources and the transmission of K replicas per packet to increase the packet delivery ratio and efficiently utilize the spectrum. Previous studies have shown that existing 5G NR grant-free scheduling has limitations to sustain URLLC requirements for aperiodic (or uncertain) and deterministic traffic that is characteristic of verticals such as Industry 4.0 or manufacturing. In this context, this paper proposes and evaluates a novel grant-free scheduling scheme that can efficiently support deterministic and aperiodic uplink traffic. The scheme avoids packet collisions among UEs sharing resources using a priority-based contention resolution process that relies on the transmission of announcement messages in minislots and a local channel sensing process. This study demonstrates that the proposed sensing-based grant-free scheduling scheme outperforms current 5G NR grant-free scheduling implementations, and can support a higher number of UEs with URLLC and deterministic requirements with a considerably lower number of radio resources.",2022.0,23.0,8.0,"{'volume': '71', 'pages': '4171-4183', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lucas-Estañ2022SensingBasedGS,\n author = {M.

Business is not getting any easier to do and major corporate collapses based on poor decisions, poor conduct, and poor judgement continue to occur. In public administration too, basic institutions and services (education, health, transport) seem to be continually undergoing “crises” of inadequate delivery and excessive pressure. Wisdom and Management in the Knowledge Economy explains why unwise managerial practice can happen in a world characterized by an excess of information and knowledge. Drawing on Aristotle’s idea of practical wisdom, the book develops a theory of social practice wisdom that addresses important social psychological and sociological dynamics that underpin wise management and organizations. As well as providing a detailed theory of social practice wisdom, this book considers practical issues in organizational communication, behavior, culture, change and knowledge as well as in HRM, leadership, ethics, strategy, international business, business education, and wisdom research. By introducing the notion of social practice wisdom, aspects of social structure, organizational culture, and organizational communication needed for wisdom to flourish are for the first time rendered visible in a way that opens new possibilities for wiser management, wiser organizations, and wisdom research.",2010.0,0.0,85.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Rooney2010WisdomAM,\n author = {D.

As a Latin proverb states: ‘The face is the portrait of the mind; the eyes, its informers’. This presents a significant challenge for Computer Graphics researchers who generate artificial entities that aim to replicate the movement and appearance of the human eye, which is so important in human–human interactions. This review article provides an overview of the efforts made on tackling this demanding task. As with many topics in computer graphics, a cross‐disciplinary approach is required to fully understand the workings of the eye in the transmission of information to the user. We begin with a discussion of the movement of the eyeballs, eyelids and the head from a physiological perspective and how these movements can be modelled, rendered and animated in computer graphics applications. Furthermore, we present recent research from psychology and sociology that seeks to understand higher level behaviours, such as attention and eye gaze, during the expression of emotion or during conversation. We discuss how these findings are synthesized in computer graphics and can be utilized in the domains of Human–Robot Interaction and Human–Computer Interaction for allowing humans to interact with virtual agents and other artificial entities.

Italy's hospitals have been among the most severely overwhelmed, and as a result, Italian healthcare workers' (HCWs) well-being has been at risk. The aim of this study is to explore the relationships between dimensions of burnout and various psychological features among Italian healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 emergency. A group of 267 HCWs from a hospital in the Lazio Region completed self-administered questionnaires online through Google Forms, including the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), Resilience Scale, and Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale Short Form (IU). Cluster analysis highlighted two opposite burnout risk profiles: low burnout and high-risk burnout. The high-risk group had lower resilience and greater difficulties in tolerating the uncertainty than the low-burnout group. A set of general linear models confirmed that both IU subscales, prospective and inhibition, moderated the relationship between resilience and burnout (specifically in the depersonalization dimension). In conclusion, the results showed that individual levels of resilience and one's ability to tolerate uncertainty have been significant factors in determining the impact of the COVID-19 emergency on HCWs. The use of emotional strategies that allow individuals to stay in a critical situation without the need to control it appears to protect against burnout in these circumstances.",2021.0,66.0,83.0,"{'volume': '12', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Trani2021FromRT,\n author = {M.

This study aimed to verify the efficacy and safety of the training program. Forty-eight volunteers completed the four-session self-training program over 2 weeks. They were allocated into either low- or high-fear group by the Acrophobia Questionnaire (AQ)-anxiety scores, and then the changes of the built-in variables and AQ-anxiety scores were analyzed between the groups. The safety was assessed using the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ). The AQ-anxiety scores were significantly decreased after self-training in both groups, and the degree of decrease was significantly greater in the high-fear group than in the low-fear group. Gaze-down percentage and subjective fear rating showed a significant group difference, but HR did not. The SSQ scores were within the acceptable level.

Knowing about print, however, is only one aspect of reading and may neglect how successful early readers also develop capacities to enter the text world and make sense of it through a personal, relational experience. To explore this other aspect of early literacy I examined the wordless picture book readings of 18 children aged 5 and 6 prior to their ability to decode print. Analyses imply that the development of ‘self that reads’ might be described as a process of movement along a continuum over which a complex, flexible, dialogic self-system develops and which then influences the kind and amount of transactional relationship a reader has with a text. Acknowledging the importance of the developing ‘self that reads’ during childhood may deepen definitions of emergent literacy and broaden our approaches to young readers.",2006.0,44.0,43.0,"{'volume': '6', 'pages': '33 - 55', 'name': 'Journal of Early Childhood Literacy'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lysaker2006YoungCR,\n author = {J.

When implemented effectively, virtual reality technologies may enable highly engaging learning activities and interactive simulations. However, implementation processes present challenges, and the key to successful implementation is identifying barriers and facilitators as well as finding strategies to address them. Objective This scoping review aimed to identify the literature on virtual reality implementation in health professions education, identify barriers to and facilitators of implementation, and highlight gaps in the literature in this area. Methods The scoping review was conducted based on the Joanna Briggs Institute Evidence Synthesis methodologies. Electronic searches were conducted in the Academic Search Elite, Education Source, and CINAHL databases on January 5, 2022, in Google Scholar on February 2 and November 18, 2022, and in PubMed database on November 18, 2022. We conducted hand searches of key items, reference tracking, and citation tracking and searches on government webpages on February 2, 2022. At least 2 reviewers screened the identified literature. Eligible studies were considered based on predefined inclusion criteria. The results of the identified items were analyzed and synthesized using qualitative content analysis. Results We included 7 papers and identified 7 categories related to facilitators of and barriers to implementation—collaborative participation, availability, expenses, guidelines, technology, careful design and evaluation, and training—and developed a model that links the categories to the 4 constructs from Carl May’s general theory of implementation. All the included reports provided recommendations for implementation, including recommendations for careful design and evaluation, training of faculty and students, and faculty presence during use. Conclusions Virtual reality implementation in health professions education appears to be a new and underexplored research field. This scoping review has several limitations, including definitions and search words, language, and that we did not assess the included papers’ quality. Important implications from our findings are that ensuring faculty’s and students’ competence in using virtual reality technology is necessary for the implementation processes. Collaborative participation by including end users in the development process is another factor that may ensure successful implementation in higher education contexts. To ensure stakeholders’ motivation and potential to use virtual reality, faculty and students could be invited to participate in the development process to ensure that the educational content is valued. Moreover, technological challenges and usability issues should be resolved before implementation to ensure that pedagogical content is the focus. This accentuates the importance of piloting, sufficient time resources, basic testing, and sharing of experiences before implementation.

This paper describes the results of principal-components analyses of Presence Questionnaire (PQ) data from 325 participants following exposure to immersive virtual environments. The analyses suggest that a 4-factor model provides the best fit to our data. The factors are Involvement, Adaptation/Immersion, Sensory Fidelity, and Interface Quality. Except for the Adaptation/Immersion factor, these factors corresponded to those identified in a cluster analysis of data from an earlier version of the questionnaire. The existence of an Adaptation/Immersion factor leads us to postulate that immersion is greater for those individuals who rapidly and easily adapt to the virtual environment. The magnitudes of the correlations among the factors indicate moderately strong relationships among the 4 factors. Within these relationships, Sensory Fidelity items seem to be more closely related to Involvement, whereas Interface Quality items appear to be more closely related to Adaptation/Immersion, even though there is a moderately strong relationship between the Involvement and Adaptation/Immersion factors.",2005.0,32.0,562.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '298-312', 'name': 'Presence: Teleoperators & Virtual Environments'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Witmer2005TheFS,\n author = {B.

This study seeks to investigate the relationship between past online purchases and purchasing intentions, representing the social context by the notions of social presence and trust.Design/methodology/approach – A sample of 115 working MBA students purchased an item online (but were stopped at the stage of paying), and then completed a questionnaire on social presence and trust.Findings – The results show that past purchasing predicts intentions to purchase and that trust and social presence act as partial mediators.Practical implications – Social context is important for understanding how past behavior affects future purchasing. Designs should therefore enhance social presence and trust. Moreover, it may be beneficial to monitor these mediators to detect potential problems.Originality/value – The study demonstrates the important role of soc...",2011.0,49.0,333.0,"{'volume': '21', 'pages': '82-96', 'name': 'Internet Res.'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Weisberg2011PastPA,\n author = {J.

Study 1 employed video recall procedures and the Immediate Anxiety Measurement Scale (IAMS) to assist an elite and non-elite rugby union performer recall their anxiety symptoms prior to lineout throw-ins at different levels of situation criticality. Examination of the relationship between anxiety intensity, interpretation, and performance as a function of skill level and situation criticality revealed that anxiety interpretation was a stronger predictor of performance than anxiety intensity. In addition, anxiety intensity increased, interpretations became more debilitative, and performance decreased as the situation became more critical, and anxiety intensity was lower and interpreted as more facilitative toward upcoming performance by the elite rugby union player, which coincided with better lineout performance. Study 2 measured the free-throw performance of competitive basketball players during simulated basketball matches, with anxiety responses assessed in relation to these free-throws at half time and full time. Anxiety, measured through the IAMS, was interpreted as more facilitative prior to successful free-throws with players suggesting that these interpretations were due to high levels of self-confidence that was associated with an increase in focus. Implications of the findings of both of these studies for future research and practice are provided.",2012.0,36.0,40.0,"{'volume': '10', 'pages': '111 - 96', 'name': 'International Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Neil2012CompetitiveAI,\n author = {Rich Neil and K.

This research examines the effect of multistage waiting on consumers’ emotional responses and emotion regulation strategies. The study is conducted at a virtual restaurant in Second Life, an online simulation website. The results show that there is a significant interaction effect between consumption stage and the type of emotional responses. Although both anxiety and anger are the most intense emotions felt during preprocess waiting, anxiety is the strongest emotion felt during in-process waiting, and anger is the most salient emotional reaction during postprocess waiting. Results also indicate that there is a significant interaction effect between consumption stage and the type of emotion regulation strategies used by consumers. Attentional deployment and reappraisal are dominant emotion regulation strategies used by consumers during preprocess waiting; in addition, reappraisal and attentional deployment are the predominant strategies used during in-process waiting and postprocess waiting, respectively.

They argued that the so-called basic emotions were neither psychologically or biologically ""primitive"" nor ""irreducible building blocks"" for generating the ""great variety of emotional experiences."" In the biosocial theory tradition, researchers have identified multiple noncognitive activators of emotion and demonstrated the usefulness of defining the essential components of emotion as phenomena that do not require cognitive mediators or constituents. In this framework, emotions are seen as basic because their biological and social functions are essential in evolution and adaptation. Particular emotions are called basic because they are assumed to have innate neural substrates, innate and universal expressions, and unique feeling-motivational states. The great variety of emotional experiences is explained as a function of emotion-cognition interactions that result in affective-cognitive structures.",1992.0,35.0,825.0,"{'volume': '99 3', 'pages': '\n          561-5\n        ', 'name': 'Psychological review'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Izard1992BasicER,\n author = {C.

Among clinicians, current methods of diagnosis of problem aggressive behaviour rely heavily on the use of self-report measures as described by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition (DSM-5) and International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10). This approach does not place adequate emphasis on objective measures that are potentially sensitive to processes not feeding into subjective self-report. Numerous studies provide evidence that attitudes and affective content can be processed without leading to verbalised output. This exploratory study aimed to determine whether individuals in the normal population, grouped by self-reported aggression, differed in subjective versus objective affective processing. Participants (N = 52) were grouped based on their responses to the Buss–Durkee Hostility Inventory. They were then presented with affect-inducing images while brain event-related potentials (ERPs) and startle reflex modulation (SRM) were recorded to determine non-language-based processes. Explicit valence and arousal ratings for each image were taken to determine subjective affective effects. Results indicated no significant group differences for explicit ratings and SRM. However, ERP results demonstrated significant group differences between the ‘pleasant’ and ‘violent’ emotion condition in the frontal, central and parietal areas across both hemispheres. These findings suggest that parts of the brain process affective stimuli different to what conscious appraisal comes up with in participants varying in self-reported aggression.",2019.0,56.0,3.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'Brain Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kunaharan2019DoEA,\n author = {Sajeev Kunaharan and S.

Restrictions imposed by governments to counteract this situation have represented risk factors for developing psychopathological symptoms. This study aims to explore the relationship between psychological symptoms and the referential process (RP). Forty-eight healthy participants (25 males, mean age = 39.3; SD = 16.6) completed a demographic questionnaire and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) through an online platform and wrote about their experience 3 weeks after the imposition of the lockdown. Different linguistic measures of the RP were applied to the narratives. The logical functions expressed through written narratives (The Italian Reflection Dictionary score, IREF) showed significant positive correlations with the SCL-90-R General Score Index (GSI) and different SCL-90-R subscales (depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsiveness, interpersonal sensitivity, hostility, and paranoid ideation). On the contrary, the reorganization and reflection function related to emotional events (The Italian Weighted Reflection and Reorganization List score, IWRRL) showed significant negative correlations with the SCL-90-R’s GSI and different subscales (obsessive-compulsiveness, depression, anxiety). The results highlight the relationship between psychological symptoms and complex defense mechanisms based on the intellectualization of negative emotions and a positive strategy of reorganization based on emotional elaboration.

Here we manipulated the emotional context with which affectively neutral stimuli were associated during encoding, allowing us to examine neural activity associated with retrieval of emotional memories without confounding the emotional attributes of cue items and the retrieved context. Using a source memory procedure we were also able to compare how retrieval processing was modulated when the emotional encoding context was recollected or not. An interaction between emotional encoding context and accuracy of source memory revealed that successful retrieval of emotional context was associated with activity in left amygdala, and a left frontotemporal network including anterior insula, prefrontal cortex and cingulate. In contrast, when contextual retrieval was unsuccessful, items encoded in emotional contexts elicited enhanced activity in right amygdala and a right-lateralized network that included extrastriate visual areas. These findings indicate distinct effects of emotion on successful and unsuccessful retrieval of source information, including lateralization of amygdala responses.",2005.0,39.0,78.0,"{'volume': '12 5', 'pages': '\n          472-9\n        ', 'name': 'Learning & memory'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Smith2005ModulationOR,\n author = {A.

The purpose of this study was threefold: (1) explore the caregiver's hope for recovery of his or her family member who has experienced an ABI, (2) compare the nurse's hopes for the patient with ABI to those of the caregiver, and (3) identify what caregivers and nurses do to maintain hope for recovery during the rehabilitation process. This qualitative study validated that in some cases there was a disconnect between caregivers' and nurses' hopes for recovery. Four themes related to the caregiver's maintenance of hope were identified: ""the importance of family,"" ""taking one day at a time,"" ""knowing the patient better,"" and ""spiritual strength brings me through."" Enhancing the perceptual congruence between nurse and caregiver hope during rehabilitation will ultimately improve patient outcomes.",2011.0,13.0,14.0,"{'volume': '36 1', 'pages': '\n          3-12\n        ', 'name': 'Rehabilitation nursing : the official journal of the Association of Rehabilitation Nurses'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gebhardt2011CaregiverAN,\n author = {M.

2321,f5e61ef588ad90ec1d6349d23c8af8d00eaf457a,Integrating Empathy and Interpersonal Emotion Regulation.,"When individuals experience empathy, they often seek to bolster others' well-being. But what do empathizers want others to feel? Though psychologists have studied empathy and prosociality for decades, this question has yet to be clearly addressed. This is because virtually all existing research focuses on a model under which improving others' well-being also comprises heightening their positive affect or decreasing their negative affect and helping them reach their own emotional goals. In this review, I argue that real-life empathic goals encompass a broader range-including sometimes worsening targets' affect or contravening their wishes in order to improve their well-being-that can be productively integrated into the framework of interpersonal emotion regulation (IER). I review the empathic IER spectrum in a number of contexts, including close relationships, professional caregiving, and group-based emotions. Integrating empathy and IER provides a synthetic and generative way to ask new questions about how social emotions produce prosocial actions. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Psychology, Volume 71 is January 4, 2020.

Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is considered an efficacious treatment for anxiety in children with ASD. Additional research is needed to examine the efficacy of a transdiagnostic treatment approach, whereby the same treatment can be applied to multiple emotional problems, beyond solely anxiety. The purpose of the present study was to examine the efficacy of a manualized and individually delivered 10‐session, transdiagnostic CBT intervention, aimed at improving emotion regulation and mental health difficulties in children with ASD. Methods Sixty‐eight children (M age = 9.75, SD = 1.27) and their parents participated in the study, randomly allocated to either a treatment immediate (n = 35) or waitlist control condition (n = 33) (ISRCTN #67079741). Parent‐, child‐, and clinician‐reported measures of emotion regulation and mental health were administered at baseline, postintervention/postwaitlist, and at 10‐week follow‐up. Results Children in the treatment immediate condition demonstrated significant improvements on measures of emotion regulation (i.e., emotionality, emotion regulation abilities with social skills) and aspects of psychopathology (i.e., a composite measure of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, adaptive behaviors) compared to those in the waitlist control condition. Treatment gains were maintained at follow‐up. Conclusions This study is the first transdiagnostic CBT efficacy trial for children with ASD. Additional investigations are needed to further establish its relative efficacy compared to more traditional models of CBT for children with ASD and other neurodevelopmental conditions.",2018.0,80.0,95.0,"{'volume': '59', 'pages': '1180 - 1191', 'name': 'Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Weiss2018ARW,\n author = {J.

This paper outlines a novel approach that builds on a cognitive-motor interaction in a virtual interactive environment. It is based on the theory of memory reconsolidation and the embodiment of cognition. The framework we envision allows the patient to 'step into the past' by using forward motion as an essential ingredient to augment the impact of exposure to traumatic events. The behavioural response of approaching that is the exact opposite from the avoidance usually applied by patients and the enhancement of divergent thinking are the most prominent hypothesized mechanisms of action. This can contribute to strengthening of personal efficacy and self-reflection that is generated by high emotional engagement, as well as a sense of accomplishment and enhanced recovery as illustrated by a clinical case example. We argue that innovations with personalized virtual reality and motion need to be further investigated and implemented in current therapy settings.",2018.0,18.0,18.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'European Journal of Psychotraumatology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Nijdam2018MovingFI,\n author = {M.

In this paper, we explored the correlation between autonomically-mediated changes in multimodal bodily signals and discrete emotional states. In order to fully exploit the information in each modality, week learners based on individual signal modalities are built and then fused to formed a robust inference model. To validate our model, three specific physiological signals including Electromyogram (EMG), Blood Volume Pressure (BVP) and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) recorded during eight emotional states were analyzed. Our approach showed 88.1% emotion recognition accuracy, which outperformed the conventional Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with 17% accuracy improvement. Furthermore, in order to avoid information redundancy and the resultant over-fitting, a feature reduction method is proposed based on a correlation analysis to optimize the number of features required for training and validating each weak learner.

According to the self-determination theory, the psychological need for relatedness is positively associated with happiness and flourishing. In turn, emotional intelligence, i.e., understanding and managing one’s own emotions and recognizing others’ emotions, may play a key role in this association. Therefore, the present study investigates the mediating role of emotional intelligence in the relationship between need for relatedness and both happiness and flourishing. Basic Psychological Needs scales (BPNs), Emotional Intelligence Scale (EIS), Flourishing Scale, and Happiness Scale were administered to 216 Italian participants (age range 15–66 years old). A mediation model via a structural equation model for path analysis was tested. The results showed that the psychological need for relatedness positively associated with both happiness and flourishing and that emotional intelligence mediated these associations.

A number of mood scales have been created to measure these factors; however, many existing measures are inadequate, showing low reliability or poor convergent or discriminant validity. To fill the need for reliable and valid Positive Affect and Negative Affect scales that are also brief and easy to administer, we developed two 10-item mood scales that comprise the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). The scales are shown to be highly internally consistent, largely uncorrelated, and stable at appropriate levels over a 2-month time period. Normative data and factorial and external evidence of convergent and discriminant validity for the scales are also presented.",1988.0,50.0,35335.0,"{'volume': '54 6', 'pages': '\n          1063-70\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Watson1988DevelopmentAV,\n author = {D.

Protective factors, such as resiliency, can support children in managing their behavior, yet little research has addressed the contribution of sensory processing to protective factors. Therefore, in this cross‐sectional study we aimed to determine the contribution of sensory processing (using the Sensory Profile‐2) to challenging behavior and protective factors (using the Behavior Assessment System for Children, 2nd ed., Parent Rating Scales) in a sample of 51 children ages 6–11 yr from the general U.S. population.

By demonstrating how rating scales are ordinal-level data, we argue the necessity of converting these to equal-interval units to develop a measure that is both qualitatively and quantitatively defensible. This requires that the empirical results and theoretical explanation are questioned and adjusted at each step of the process. In our response to the reviewers, we describe how this approach was used to develop the Game Engagement Questionnaire (GEQ), including its emphasis on examining a continuum of involvement in violent video games.

While mobile technology–based therapy can alleviate wait-lists and scale for increasing demand, few clinical trials exist to support its use for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) care. Objective To evaluate the efficacy of Superpower Glass, an artificial intelligence–driven wearable behavioral intervention for improving social outcomes of children with ASD. Design, Setting, and Participants A randomized clinical trial in which participants received the Superpower Glass intervention plus standard of care applied behavioral analysis therapy and control participants received only applied behavioral analysis therapy. Assessments were completed at the Stanford University Medical School, and enrolled participants used the Superpower Glass intervention in their homes. Children aged 6 to 12 years with a formal ASD diagnosis who were currently receiving applied behavioral analysis therapy were included. Families were recruited between June 2016 and December 2017. The first participant was enrolled on November 1, 2016, and the last appointment was completed on April 11, 2018. Data analysis was conducted between April and October 2018. Interventions The Superpower Glass intervention, deployed via Google Glass (worn by the child) and a smartphone app, promotes facial engagement and emotion recognition by detecting facial expressions and providing reinforcing social cues. Families were asked to conduct 20-minute sessions at home 4 times per week for 6 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures Four socialization measures were assessed using an intention-to-treat analysis with a Bonferroni test correction. Results Overall, 71 children (63 boys [89%]; mean [SD] age, 8.38 [2.46] years) diagnosed with ASD were enrolled (40 [56.3%] were randomized to treatment, and 31 (43.7%) were randomized to control). Children receiving the intervention showed significant improvements on the Vineland Adaptive Behaviors Scale socialization subscale compared with treatment as usual controls (mean [SD] treatment impact, 4.58 [1.62]; P = .005). Positive mean treatment effects were also found for the other 3 primary measures but not to a significance threshold of P = .0125. Conclusions and Relevance The observed 4.58-point average gain on the Vineland Adaptive Behaviors Scale socialization subscale is comparable with gains observed with standard of care therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized clinical trial to demonstrate efficacy of a wearable digital intervention to improve social behavior of children with ASD. The intervention reinforces facial engagement and emotion recognition, suggesting either or both could be a mechanism of action driving the observed improvement. This study underscores the potential of digital home therapy to augment the standard of care.

The aim of the present study was to determine the mechanisms underlying the impact of self-stigma on depression and anxiety in a collectivistic culture such as the Philippines. Specifically, this study sought to examine: (1) the mediating role of self-criticism on the impact of self-stigma on depression and anxiety, and (2) the moderating role of interdependent self-construal on the impact of self-criticism on depression and anxiety in Filipinos. Surveys measuring self-stigma, self-criticism, interdependent self-construal, depression, and anxiety symptoms were administered to 312 adolescents in rural communities in the Philippines. Using structural equation modeling, findings revealed indirect effects of self-stigma on both depression and anxiety via self-criticism. Findings confirmed that interdependent self-construal attenuate the detrimental impact of self-criticism on depression and anxiety in collectivistic contexts. This study offers novel insights about the underlying mechanisms that operate in the impact of self-stigma on depression and anxiety symptoms among individuals in collectivist contexts. We highlight that self-criticism may have both adaptive and maladaptive functions in collectivist cultures. The study provides implications on the importance of culturally sensitive clinical interventions in preventing depression and anxiety by combating self-stigma and the negative aspect of self-criticism in collectivist cultures.

Mindfulness meditation has proved to be effective in increasing the wellbeing of those who practice it, leading to better mental health, self-care and job satisfaction. This paper aims to identify the recent evidence on the relationship between mindfulness and emotional intelligence among healthcare professionals and students. A systematic review was conducted including the databases PubMed, Cinhal, PsycINFO and Web of Science. The main variables were emotional intelligence skills and mindfulness practice. Data were extracted according to the following outcomes: authors, year of publication, country, study design, participants, mindfulness training intervention, tools used in data collection and main results. The following inclusion criteria were applied: peer-reviewed articles; published in English or Spanish; published between 2010 and 2020; quantitative methodology; a study population of healthcare professionals or students; the relationship with the aim of the study. The Joanna Briggs Institute criteria were followed for assessing the methodological quality of the selected studies. Three researchers were involved in the review. After the selection process, 10 studies were selected out of the 197 references initially identified. These studies revealed a positive relationship between mindfulness and emotional intelligence, particularly the capacity to regulate emotions. Furthermore, mindfulness is negatively related to emotional exhaustion. Training interventions based on mindfulness have proved to be useful in promoting emotional balance, emotional awareness, emotional acceptance, emotion recognition, expressive suppression and a reduction in emotional exhaustion. This study could serve as a basis for further research on the benefits of emotional intelligence and practicing mindfulness for the bio-psycho-social welfare of healthcare professionals.",2021.0,85.0,22.0,"{'volume': '18', 'name': 'International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Jiménez-Picón2021TheRB,\n author = {N.

It does so by reviewing war victims and military psychiatry after WWII in the Netherlands, and describes Dutch deployments from the late 1970s to the present. ‘Who is the Dutch soldier’ is asked to articulate the mental load on the individual soldier before, during, and after deployment. The narrative review of this paper allows one to review how the armed forces personnel is challenged in relation to their specific assignment and in what respect the psychological dimensions are addressed and met in the face of risk and adversity. Finally, some critical considerations for future veterans care programmes are raised.",2019.0,40.0,5.0,"{'volume': '31', 'pages': '49 - 59', 'name': 'International Review of Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vermetten2019ExposureTC,\n author = {E.

These emotions tend to emerge as teachers’ goals, standards, and beliefs transact with other classroom stakeholders during everyday school activities. As such, for teachers, the classroom context involves both the extreme happiness and joy from a lesson that goes as planned to the intense frustration of working with a challenging student. These academic emotions have garnered the attention of a growing number of researchers, and will be the focus of this article.

The Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF) is one of the most widely used instruments for measuring parenting stress in families of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, no research to date has examined the psychometric properties of the PSI-SF in a sample of parents of young children with ASD. In this regard, item response theory (IRT) can be used to estimate how much information or discrimination each item of a scale offers across the entire range of the latent variable being measured, by creating individual item information curves or profiles. The purpose of this study was to use IRT to examine the discriminability of PSI-SF items in a sample of parents of young children with ASD who experience varying levels of parental stress.


METHODS
The study involved the parents of 141 children with autism spectrum disorders (91.4% mothers; mean age 36.2 years) who completed the PSI-SF following diagnosis. Item characteristic curves were constructed for each of the PSI-SF items and examined with regard to item functioning.


RESULTS
Results indicated that, for the most part, changes in parental distress severity were reflected in changes on item scores. However, several items on the subscales measuring parent-child dysfunctional interactions and child behavior difficulty functioned poorly to discriminate parents across a range of total stress severity.


CONCLUSIONS
The parent-child dysfunctional interaction and difficult child subscales of the PSI-SF scale should be used with caution with parents of young children with ASD. More research is required to examine PSI-SF content validity, at least among parents of children with ASD and perhaps parents of children with other disabilities as well.",2010.0,22.0,121.0,"{'volume': '51 11', 'pages': '\n          1269-77\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zaidman-Zait2010AnIR,\n author = {A.

However, what the added value is of client feedback specifically within cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), is not known. Therefore, the extent to which the outcome of CBT can be improved is investigated by providing feedback from clients to therapists using the Outcome Rating Scale (ORS) and Session Rating Scale (SRS). Method: Outpatients (n = 1006) of a Dutch mental health organization either participated in the “treatment as usual” (TAU) condition, or in Feedback condition of the study. Clients were invited to fill in the ORS and SRS and in the Feedback condition therapists were asked to frequently discuss client feedback. Results: Outcome on the SCL-90 was only improved specifically with mood disorders in the Feedback condition. Also, in the Feedback condition, in terms of process, the total number of required treatment sessions was on average two sessions fewer. Conclusion: Frequently asking feedback from clients using the ORS/SRS does not necessarily result in a better treatment outcome in CBT. However, for an equal treatment outcome significantly fewer sessions are needed within the Feedback condition, thus improving efficiency of CBT.",2017.0,62.0,58.0,"{'volume': '27', 'pages': '525 - 538', 'name': 'Psychotherapy Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Janse2017ImprovingTE,\n author = {P.

This article focuses on two components of the event-related potential (ERP)—the P300 and the late positive potential (LPP)—and how they can be used to understand the interaction between the more automatic and controlled processing of emotional stimuli. Research is reviewed exploring: the dynamics of emotional response as indexed at early and late latencies; neurobiological correlates of emotional response; individual and developmental differences; ways in which the LPP can be utilized as a measure of emotion regulation.

Research documents inconsistent findings regarding direction of differences. Differences have implications for family support and are germane to clinicians’ treatment planning during rehabilitation. We compared two analytic approaches to patient–family differences in ratings of 30 functional tasks: (a) comparing patients’ and families’ mean scores in domains derived from factor analysis versus (b) examining differences on a task-by-task basis. Method: In-home interviews were conducted with 83 outpatients with TBI at a Veteran Affairs polytrauma clinic and for each a family member, using the Patient Competency Rating Scale with both. Results: Principal components analysis identified three functional domains – cognitive, interpersonal/emotional and physical – with significant patient–family differences in the cognitive domain only (family competency ratings were higher). By contrast, task-by-task examination showed significant veteran–family differences in 12 items, mostly in interpersonal/emotional functioning, with mixed directions of differences. The task-by-task approach thus revealed a different picture of patient–family differences than examination by functional domains. Conclusions: Grouping tasks by domains may obscure important differences in functional ratings. Examination of patient–family differences by task has clinical applications for helping patients and families to manage TBI symptoms and for treatment planning. Implications for Rehabilitation Differences in functional capacity ratings by patients with TBI and their family members are not well understood, with past research demonstrating inconsistencies in direction of difference. Differences in ratings may affect family relationships and may inform clinicians’ treatment plans. The study showed that different approaches to analyzing the same data yield two distinct pictures of patient–family differences. Examining patient–family differences by specific tasks is clinically meaningful. The Competency Rating Scale could be used as a clinical tool with patients and families. Its use may improve family understanding of the patient’s strengths and struggles and also guide treatment planning.",2016.0,53.0,14.0,"{'volume': '38', 'pages': '1280 - 1290', 'name': 'Disability and Rehabilitation'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Winter2016RatingCI,\n author = {L.

2367,fbfac5243e0d98f654eea143afa7003a02bb38dc,Neurobiology of emotional trauma.,"An emotional trauma may induce a cascade of neurobiological events that have long-lasting consequences even altered gene expression. Early abuse and neglect can deregulate the child's developing neurobiological system by reducing its resistance to stressful events, leading to later problems of emotional regulation. Children who have been subjected to physical or emotional abuse tend to pay more attention to signs that contain anger and are hypersensitive to threat. Scar hypothesis and the theories of behavioural sensitization or electrophysiological kindling suggest that emotional traumas may leave traces that persist even after remission of depression, and render individuals vulnerable to the onset of new episodes, even under the influence of only moderate psychosocial stress. Unfavorable early social experiences, such as emotional abuse or institutionalization can affect the structure and function of the prefrontal cortex. Exposure to repeated emotional stressors, even in the absence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnoses, has been shown to produce increased synapse formation and dendritic growth in basolateral amygdala, dendritic retraction in the hippocampus, and anxiety-like behavior against specific triggers, such as phobia of open spaces. During the narration of an emotionally traumatic event, there is activation of the limbic system, the right amygdale, the orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate gyrus. In addition, there is an activation of the anterior insula, which records the physical impact of negative emotions, and the anterior and medial temporal cortex, which are involved in negative emotions. Neuroimaging studies in PTSD patients have found hypoactivity in the frontal lobe, anterior cingulate and thalamic areas, indicating the effects of PTSD on executive function, attention and cognitive, memorial, and affective and somatosensory integration. One of the most replicated findings in studies involving PTSD patients is the decreased activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Studies have also found a negative correlation between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and amygdala activation. A recent meta-analysis revealed structural brain abnormalities associated with PTSD and emotional trauma and suggested that global brain volume reductions can distinguish PTSD from major depression. Neuroimaging studies of successful eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) treatment have consistently shown that patients exhibited increased frontal lobe activation. Moving beyond diagnostic boundaries, focusing on the causal interplay between specific traumatic processes and using standardized measures, are useful directions for future research in memory, emotion and emotional trauma.",2020.0,83.0,28.0,"{'volume': '31 2', 'pages': '\n          162-171\n        ', 'name': 'Psychiatrike = Psychiatriki'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Giotakos2020NeurobiologyOE,\n author = {O.

With innovations ranging from ‘virtual psychotherapists’ to social robots in dementia care and autism disorder, to robots for sexual disorders, artificially intelligent virtual and robotic agents are increasingly taking on high-level therapeutic interventions that used to be offered exclusively by highly trained, skilled health professionals. In order to enable responsible clinical implementation, ethical and social implications of the increasing use of embodied AI in mental health need to be identified and addressed. Objective This paper assesses the ethical and social implications of translating embodied AI applications into mental health care across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology and Psychotherapy. Building on this analysis, it develops a set of preliminary recommendations on how to address ethical and social challenges in current and future applications of embodied AI. Methods Based on a thematic literature search and established principles of medical ethics, an analysis of the ethical and social aspects of currently embodied AI applications was conducted across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, the analysis was structured around the following three steps: assessment of potential benefits; analysis of overarching ethical issues and concerns; discussion of specific ethical and social issues of the interventions. Results From an ethical perspective, important benefits of embodied AI applications in mental health include new modes of treatment, opportunities to engage hard-to-reach populations, better patient response, and freeing up time for physicians. Overarching ethical issues and concerns include: harm prevention and various questions of data ethics; a lack of guidance on development of AI applications, their clinical integration and training of health professionals; ‘gaps’ in ethical and regulatory frameworks; the potential for misuse including using the technologies to replace established services, thereby potentially exacerbating existing health inequalities. Specific challenges identified and discussed in the application of embodied AI include: matters of risk-assessment, referrals, and supervision; the need to respect and protect patient autonomy; the role of non-human therapy; transparency in the use of algorithms; and specific concerns regarding long-term effects of these applications on understandings of illness and the human condition. Conclusions We argue that embodied AI is a promising approach across the field of mental health; however, further research is needed to address the broader ethical and societal concerns of these technologies to negotiate best research and medical practices in innovative mental health care.

This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.",1995.0,14.0,85128.0,"{'volume': '57', 'pages': '289-300', 'name': 'Journal of the royal statistical society series b-methodological'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Benjamini1995ControllingTF,\n author = {Y.

It is important to differentiate between the automatic versus reflective origins of emotional processes, and sensory versus conceptual bases of diverse negative and positive emotions. A taxonomy of emotions based on different origins is presented. This taxonomy distinguishes between negative and positive automatic versus reflective emotions. The automatic emotions are connected with the (a) homeostatic and (b) hedonistic regulatory mechanisms.

Theoretically we propose a possible integration of cognitive behavioural theory, neuroscience, embodied cognition and important processes of client change outcomes such as the therapeutic alliance to enhance client outcomes. We draw from evidence of bidirectional effects between embodiment modes of bottom-up (sensory-motor simulations giving rise to important basis of knowledge) and top-down (abstract mental representations of knowledge) processes such as CBT in psychotherapy. The paper first describes the dominance and success of CBT for the treatment of a wide range of clinical disorders. Some limitations of CBT, particularly for depression are also outlined. There is a growing body of evidence for the added value of experiential affect-focused interventions combined with CBT. Evidence for the embodied model of cognition and emotion is reviewed. Advantages of embodiment is highlighted as a complimentary process model to deepen the intensity and valence of affective experience. It is suggested that an integrated embodiment approach with CBT enhances outcomes across a wide range of emotional disorders. A description of our embodiment method integrated with CBT for inducing affective experience, emotional regulation, acceptance of unwanted emotions and emotional mastery is given. Finally, the paper highlights the importance of the therapeutic alliance as a critical component of the change process. The paper ends with a case study highlighting some clinical strategies that may aid the therapist to integrate embodiment techniques in CBT that can further explore in future research on affective experience in CBT for a wider range of clinical disorders.",2018.0,157.0,13.0,"{'volume': '8', 'name': 'Behavioral Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Pietrzak2018EmbodiedCA,\n author = {Tania Pietrzak and C.

Participants of this study were 47 teachers in the school systems that currently work with an occupational therapist in a public or private school. Data were collected via an anonymous online survey and analyzed using descriptive statistics and qualitative coding. The majority of the participants view occupational therapists as valuable team members. They report limitations to the system that challenge collaborative teaming. The participant’s desire increased communication and collaboration with the occupational therapist. Occupational therapy is perceived as a valuable contribution to the educational team that is underutilized. An increase in collaboration and communication is indicated to support the educational process but will require system change.,2016.0,17.0,28.0,"{'volume': '9', 'pages': '290 - 301', 'name': 'Journal of Occupational Therapy, Schools, & Early Intervention'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Benson2016TeachersPO,\n author = {Jeryl D Benson and Kimberly Szucs and J.

Little is known, however, about how the brain makes rapid evaluations with real and immediate social consequences. To address this question, we scanned participants with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while they viewed photos of individuals that they subsequently met at real-life “speed-dating” events. Neural activity in two areas of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), paracingulate cortex, and rostromedial prefrontal cortex (RMPFC) was predictive of whether each individual would be ultimately pursued for a romantic relationship or rejected. Activity in these areas was attributable to two distinct components of romantic evaluation: either consensus judgments about physical beauty (paracingulate cortex) or individualized preferences based on a partner's perceived personality (RMPFC). These data identify novel computational roles for these regions of the DMPFC in even very rapid social evaluations. Even a first glance, then, can accurately predict romantic desire, but that glance involves a mix of physical and psychological judgments that depend on specific regions of DMPFC.",2012.0,51.0,36.0,"{'volume': '32', 'pages': '15647 - 15656', 'name': 'The Journal of Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cooper2012DorsomedialPC,\n author = {Jeffrey C.

Previous research has suggested that missing out on emotional experiences may affect mental health and impact cognitive abilities. In recent years, there has been growing research interest in designing non-pharmacological interventions to improve the health-related quality of life of older adults. With virtual reality offering endless opportunities for health support, we must consider how virtual reality can be sensitively designed to provide comfortable, enriching out-world experiences to older adults to enhance their emotional regulation. Thirty older adults living with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia participated in the study. Affect and emotional behavior were measured. The usability and the sense of presence were also assessed. Finally, we assessed the virtual reality experiences based on physiological responses and eye-tracking data. The results indicated that virtual reality can positively enhance the mental health of this population by eliciting a positive affective state and enhancing their emotional regulation. Overall, this paper raises awareness of the role of virtual reality in emotion elicitation, regulation, and expression and enhances our understanding of the use of virtual reality by older adults living with mild cognitive impairments or mild dementia.",2023.0,61.0,2.0,"{'name': 'International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health', 'volume': '20'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Matsangidou2023AffectiveOE,\n author = {M.

These deficits have been previously linked to problems with social cognition. However, we reasoned that AS/HFA individuals' Theory of Mind deficits also might lead to problems with emotion regulation. To assess emotional functioning in AS/HFA, 27 AS/HFA adults (16 women) and 27 age-, gender-, and education-matched typically developing (TD) participants completed a battery of measures of emotion experience, labeling, and regulation. With respect to emotion experience, individuals with AS/HFA reported higher levels of negative emotions, but similar levels of positive emotions, compared with TD individuals. With respect to emotion labeling, individuals with AS/HFA had greater difficulties identifying and describing their emotions, with approximately two-thirds exceeding the cutoff for alexithymia. With respect to emotion regulation, individuals with AS/HFA used reappraisal less frequently than TD individuals and reported lower levels of reappraisal self-efficacy. Although AS/HFA individuals used suppression more frequently than TD individuals, no difference in suppression self-efficacy was found. It is important to note that these differences in emotion regulation were evident even when controlling for emotion experience and labeling.

 The development of virtual enterprise is inseparable from the support of partners. Due to information asymmetry, the choice of virtual enterprise partners is blind, and simple matching formula is difficult to meet. At the same time, the psychology of the matching subject is based on the maximization of its own interests rather than the maximization of collective interests. There are interest contradictions and conflicts between subjects, and they may eventually fall into a “prisoner's dilemma”. Therefore, how to carry out the research on emotion regulation based on multi-agent heterogeneous game preference and bilateral partner preference is very important.
 
 
 
 Aiming at the contradictions and interest conflicts between subjects in the process of virtual enterprise partner matching, combined with the basic characteristics of subject language preference evaluation, the game idea is introduced into the process of virtual enterprise partner bilateral matching analysis, a bilateral matching game model of heterogeneous multi-attribute preference and subjects' psychological behavior is proposed, and the influence of the changes of subjects' psychological behavior on the evolution law of bilateral matching game system is analyzed, The Nash equilibrium strategy of bilateral matching is discussed. In order to verify the impact of the algorithm on emotion, this study uses relevant scales to investigate. (1) Positive emotion scale. The Panas emotion scale developed by Watson et al. Is widely used to measure emotion. The scale includes two dimensions: positive emotion and negative emotion. There are 6 questions in this dimension, and Likert scores 5 points (1 means “very inconsistent”, 5 means “very consistent”, the same below). The Cronbach coefficient of this questionnaire is 0.90. (2) Motivation. The problem of measuring motivation is mainly the motivation scale compiled by Phan, which has 8 questions and is scored with Likert 5 points. (3) Social support scale. The scale is adapted from the social support scale compiled by Ye Yuemei et al. It has eight questions, using Likert's five points scoring method. Clonbach α the coefficient of the scale is 0.87. (4) Behavioral propensity scale. Propensity dimension in intention measurement. The scale has 6 questions, and Likert scores 5 points. The clonbach coefficient of the scale is 0.95.
 
 
 
 The results of case analysis show that the model can make full use of the multi-attribute preference information of heterogeneous subjects, describe the mechanism of psychological behavior affecting the evolution of game system, and help virtual enterprises match business partners; This has important value and significance for the establishment of virtual enterprises and their industrial agglomeration effect. In the influence process of cooperative anxiety, emotional response plays an intermediary role, psychological elasticity plays a regulatory role, and emotional response to life events plays an intermediary role. That is, the higher the psychological elasticity, the higher the excessive coping style of the game, and vice versa.
 
 
 
 Various stable matching solutions can be obtained by solving the model, and the conclusion is more suitable for the matching decision-making process of both parties in the actual process, which makes the model can be applied to various scenarios, such as the selection of battery suppliers of new energy vehicles and smart phone screen suppliers, which has greater practical value and significance. It should be pointed out that there are some deficiencies in the setting conditions of the model method, mainly because some individuals in the group cooperate to form an alliance, so as to form a community of interests. In the process of game, the individual experience in the group is constrained by more conditions, which makes the results of the model deviate.

Then, we developed some cognitive training tasks using VR technology. Thirty subjects who had little behavioral problems and social problems were randomly assigned into three groups: VR group, non-VR group, and control group. Only the VR group used the head-mounted display (HMD) and position sensor. While the VR group and non-VR group performed cognitive training, the control group received no special treatment. All participants took their eight session tasks over 2 weeks. Participants executed a continuous performance task (CPT) before and after training sessions. We found that immersive VR with cognitive training is effective for attention enhancement. Also, we confirmed that our cognitive training can improve the attention span of children and adolescents with behavioral problems and help them learn to focus on some tasks.",2002.0,17.0,115.0,"{'volume': '5 2', 'pages': '\n          129-37\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology & behavior : the impact of the Internet, multimedia and virtual reality on behavior and society'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cho2002TheEO,\n author = {B.

2396,ff3ac9352702bdf355511edaa1e633273d448dba,The impact of perception and presence on emotional reactions: a review of research in virtual reality,"Virtual reality (VR) has made its way into mainstream psychological research in the last two decades. This technology, with its unique ability to simulate complex, real situations and contexts, offers researchers unprecedented opportunities to investigate human behavior in well controlled designs in the laboratory. One important application of VR is the investigation of pathological processes in mental disorders, especially anxiety disorders. Research on the processes underlying threat perception, fear, and exposure therapy has shed light on more general aspects of the relation between perception and emotion. Being by its nature virtual, i.e., simulation of reality, VR strongly relies on the adequate selection of specific perceptual cues to activate emotions. Emotional experiences in turn are related to presence, another important concept in VR, which describes the user’s sense of being in a VR environment. This paper summarizes current research into perception of fear cues, emotion, and presence, aiming at the identification of the most relevant aspects of emotional experience in VR and their mutual relations. A special focus lies on a series of recent experiments designed to test the relative contribution of perception and conceptual information on fear in VR. This strand of research capitalizes on the dissociation between perception (bottom–up input) and conceptual information (top-down input) that is possible in VR. Further, we review the factors that have so far been recognized to influence presence, with emotions (e.g., fear) being the most relevant in the context of clinical psychology. Recent research has highlighted the mutual influence of presence and fear in VR, but has also traced the limits of our current understanding of this relationship. In this paper, the crucial role of perception on eliciting emotional reactions is highlighted, and the role of arousal as a basic dimension of emotional experience is discussed. An interoceptive attribution model of presence is suggested as a first step toward an integrative framework for emotion research in VR. Gaps in the current literature and future directions are outlined.",2015.0,65.0,586.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Diemer2015TheIO,\n author = {J.

In this paper, a method is proposed to approximately standardize the reference of scalp EEG recordings to a point at infinity. This method is based on the fact that the use of scalp potentials to determine the neural electrical activities or their equivalent sources does not depend on the reference, so we may approximately reconstruct the equivalent sources from scalp EEG recordings with a scalp point or average reference. Then the potentials referenced at infinity are approximately reconstructed from the equivalent sources. As a point at infinity is far from all the possible neural sources, this method may be considered as a reference electrode standardization technique (REST). The simulation studies performed with assumed neural sources included effects of electrode number, volume conductor model and noise on the performance of REST, and the significance of REST in EEG temporal analysis. The results showed that REST is potentially very effective for the most important superficial cortical region and the standardization could be especially important in recovering the temporal information of EEG recordings.",2001.0,25.0,412.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '693 - 711', 'name': 'Physiological Measurement'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Yao2001AMT,\n author = {D.

Emotional distracters can be particularly disruptive to goal-oriented behavior, but the neural systems through which these detrimental effects are mediated are not known. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the effect of emotional and nonemotional distracters on a delayed-response working memory (WM) task. As expected, this task evoked robust activity during the delay period in typical WM regions (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and lateral parietal cortex). Presentation of emotional distracters during the delay interval evoked strong activity in typical emotional processing regions (amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) while simultaneously evoking relative deactivation of the WM regions and impairing WM performance. These results provide the first direct evidence that the detrimental effect of emotional distracters on ongoing cognitive processes entails the interaction between a dorsal neural system associated with “cold” executive processing and a ventral system associated with “hot” emotional processing.",2006.0,61.0,606.0,"{'volume': '26', 'pages': '2072 - 2079', 'name': 'The Journal of Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Dolcos2006BrainSM,\n author = {F.

Thus, this paper fills the gap by examining the mediating role of identification trust and affective commitment on members' continuous knowledge sharing intention within business online communities. 220 experienced online community members participated in the web survey. Structural equation modelling technique is used to analyze the data together with Baron and Kenny's (1986) mediating analysis procedure. The research findings reveal that, besides user's level of satisfaction, continuous knowledge sharing intention is partially mediated by affective commitment and identification trust. This paper ends by providing some insights on how to encourage continuous knowledge sharing intention within business online communities from the perspective of commitment-trust theory. Understanding the determinants of this behaviour is important as it helps to build an active community and also provides the opportunities for consumers to channel their ideas and suggestions in co-creating the products in which they are interested in.",,51.0,216.0,,"{'bibtex': ""@Misc{None,\n author = {Kamarul Faizal Hashim and Felix B.
