0033b0fc8cda29e530df0a19ac331403440bac61,"It is well known that emotions participate in the regulation of social behaviors and that the emotion displayed by a conspecific influences the behavior of other animals. In its simplest form, empathy can be characterized as the capacity to be affected by and/or share the emotional state of another. However, to date, relatively little is known about the mechanisms by which animals that are not in direct danger share emotions. In the present study, we used a model of between-subject transfer of fear to characterize the social interaction during which fear is transmitted, as well as the behavioral effects of socially transmitted fear. We found that (1) during social interaction with a recently fear-conditioned partner, observers and demonstrators exhibit social exploratory behaviors rather than aggressive behaviors; (2) learning and memory in a shock-motivated shuttle avoidance task are facilitated in rats that underwent a social interaction with a partner that had been fear conditioned; and (3) a brief social interaction with a recently fear-conditioned partner immediately before fear conditioning increases conditioned freezing measured on the next day. The observed effects were not due to a stress-induced increase in pain sensitivity or analgesia. Collectively, these data suggest that a brief social interaction with a cage mate that has undergone an aversive learning experience promotes aversive learning in an otherwise naïve animal. We argue that socially transferred fear is an adaptation that promotes defensive behavior to potentially dangerous situations in the environment.","[{'authorId': '3765282', 'name': 'E.

003a980fce16a9cce8dbf9e0ff4254fb7bfcb8ec,"This research investigated the possible impacts of computers on Turkish fourth-grade students’ geometry scores and further geometric learning. The study used a pretest–intervention–posttest experimental design. Results showed that students who did not have computers at home initially had lower geometry scores. However, these differences were minimised with an appropriate intervention containing computer-based Tangram puzzles. This suggests that at schools, it seems more effective to integrate mathematical content and technology in a manner that enables students to do playful mathematical discoveries. Introduction Social disadvantage may be an educational handicap, which may lead to further social disadvantages. Students living in poor socio-economic areas usually have limited access to some educational resources such as computers (Olkun & Altun, 2003; Webster & Fisher, 2000). The visual nature of computers can help students develop skills useful in learning subjects with visual content such as geometry. Therefore, the current study aimed at investigating the differences a computer made on students’ geometry scores and their further learning of two-dimensional (2D) geometry. Background literature Mathematics, computers, and future success In many countries, achievement in mathematics is an important factor for students’ career development. For example, mathematics is one of the subject areas with a high proportion of items on the University Entrance Examination in Turkey. Furthermore, geometry questions occupy nearly 40% of the mathematics section in this exam. Therefore, students need a good score in math to be admitted to colleges. Similarly, Fetto (2002) reports that in the USA, half of the students who scored in the upper quartile of their class in eight-grade mathematics went on to earn bachelor’s degrees, and 9% received master’s degrees. By comparison, only 23% of those who had average eightgrade mathematics scores now have a bachelor’s degree, and just 2% have a master’s degree. Literacy and numeracy have long been recognised as a qualification in both schools and workplaces (FitzSimons, 2001). Recently, however, equally strong emphasis has been placed on visual literacy, especially with the prominence of computer technologies. An important dimension in visual literacy is spatial thinking, which supports numerical reasoning and visual judgments (Battista et al, 1998). For example, Wheatley and Reynolds (1996) found close parallels between student tiling and numerical activity. Similarly, Battista and Clements (1998) claimed that there was a synergistic effect between numerical and spatial thinking. Given the importance of mathematics, geometry, and spatial thinking on educational success, it is important to find better ways to teach them. There is ample evidence that real and virtual manipulatives can help elementary school children learn mathematics better (Clements, 1999). Yet computers are still rarely used in the classroom to teach mathematics even in so-called developed countries, such as the USA (Flores et al, 2002). On the other hand, many students in the USA have at least one computer at home. Although we do not know the exact percentages in the wider population, in one study whilst 98% of the US 10-year-olds had computers at home, only 25% of the Turkish students had them (Authors, unpublished manuscript). In another survey, Facer et al (forthcoming) found that 70% of the children in the UK reported ownership of a home computer. These cross-cultural differences of computer ownership further widen the gap amongst countries as well as amongst social classes. Certain household materials are important socio-economic status (SES) indicators for exploring both individual and school-level educational effects (Yang, 2003). Olkun and Altun (2003) found striking differences amongst schools located in different socioeconomic areas within a province in Turkey in terms of student computer ownership. In one school located in a poor socio-economic rural area, only 4% of the students had computers at home. Seventeen per cent of the students in the other school, located in middle-low socio-economic area, had computers at home. In still another school located in a middle socio-economic area, 27% of the students had computers at home. As the difference in computer ownership is apparent, it seems necessary to investigate the impact of computers on students’ geometry learning. The positive relationship between the SES and student achievement is very well known (see, Yang, 2003). For example, Webster and Fisher (2000) found a strong negative effect of rurality on student mathematics and science achievement. However, they found that in Australia, contrary to common belief, rural schools had more resources than urban schools. They concluded that availability of school resources alone did not significantly effect student achievement in mathematics and science. Similarly, Wenglinsky (1998) claimed that the greatest inequities in computer use were not in how often they were used, but in the ways in which they were used. He further reports that poor, urban, and rural students are less likely to be exposed to higher order uses of computers than nonpoor and suburban students because teachers of urban and rural students are less likely to have had professional development in technology than suburban teachers. Still, one might argue about the other reasons for the relationship between SES and achievement. Breznitz and Norman (1998), for instance, found differences in concentration and academic achievement between low and high SES first grade students. The difference persisted in part to the fourth grade. They attributed the differences in comprehension and arithmetic scores, between the low SES and high SES children, to their concentration abilities. They reported that aggressive–impulsive behaviours, often seen in low SES children, hindered concentration, accentuating learning problems (Breznitz & Norman, 1998). However, using certain educational or otherwise recreational tools such as computers may increase students’ level of engagement in learning because the computer is a key item that provides students with many educational (Clements, 1999; Flores et al, 2002) and interactive recreational opportunities. Attewell and Battle (1998), for example, found a high correlation between home computers and eighth graders’ mathematical achievement. Similarly, the recent Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS, 1999) reports that on average internationally, students from homes with a high level of educational resources such as computers, had higher mathematics achievement than students from homes with fewer resources. However, it remains to be investigated how having a computer at home and certain computer experiences affect students’ mathematics learning. As Wenglinsky (1998) argued, technology may matter, but it depends on how it was used. Therefore, it is particularly important what purposes computers, whether at home or school, are used for. Computers and geometry learning One of the most cited uses of computers at home is game playing (ie, Selwyn, 1998). A recent research by Facer et al (2003) investigated the ways both elementary and secondary school children use home computers. According to the findings, about 75% students, especially younger ones, use computers for playing games (at least once a week). Rapid developments in hardware technology, increasing capacity of affordable hardware, and increasingly realistic computer graphics also make game playing more attractive. Computer games can improve spatial skills important for geometry learning (Battista, 1990) and other academic areas (Humphreys, Lubinski & Yao, 1993; Mcgee, 1978; Pallrand & Seeber, 1984; Pearson & Ferguson, 1989; Pribyl & Bodner, 1987; Smith, 1964). Computer games can improve mental rotation and spatial visualisation (Gagnon, 1985; Greenfield, 1994; Okagaki & Frensch, 1994), but intermittent results indicate that prior experience and other factors mediate such improvements. Computers can facilitate improvements in spatial skills that may in turn bring more success in geometry. Therefore, the complex relationships between computer ownership, computer treatment, and student geometry learning as part of mathematical achievement bear more investigation.","[{'authorId': '1897169', 'name': 'S.

00cdc02320aa6d2b33c2ba0eac1f0003939e6d44,"Emotional contagion is a phenomenon by which an individual’s emotions directly trigger similar emotions in others. We explored the possibility that perceiving others’ emotional facial expressions affect mood in people with subthreshold depression (sD). Around 49 participants were divided into the following four groups: participants with no depression (ND) presented with happy faces; ND participants presented with sad faces; sD participants presented with happy faces; and sD participants presented with sad faces. Participants were asked to answer an inventory about their emotional states before and after viewing the emotional faces to investigate the influence of emotional contagion on their mood. Regardless of depressive tendency, the groups presented with happy faces exhibited a slight increase in the happy mood score and a decrease in the sad mood score. The groups presented with sad faces exhibited an increased sad mood score and a decreased happy mood score. These results demonstrate that emotional contagion affects the mood in people with sD, as well as in individuals with ND. These results indicate that emotional contagion could relieve depressive moods in people with sD. It demonstrates the importance of the emotional facial expressions of those around people with sD such as family and friends from the viewpoint of emotional contagion.","[{'authorId': '49883572', 'name': 'Y.

00f888c373957824244c366e71a33f4a9b517d57,"Recently there has been a growing trend to recognise the damaging nature of workplace bullying in organisations' Dignity at Work policies. In this article the author explores the negative behaviours experienced by police officers and how the managerial factors that are known to influence OC alter the extent of these bullying behaviours. Using structural equation modelling the findings indicate that negative behaviour is common but the nature of bullying experienced is predominantly indirect and discreet. Senior ranks experience a different mix of behaviours but overall experience higher levels of bullying than junior ranks. The supervision environment was found to be a substantial predictor of the degree of bullying experienced as well as a dominant influence on organisational commitment levels. The findings suggest that bullying research may be advanced when it is considered in a broader frame, where the managerial and organisational factors that create an environment in which bullying is possible and is precipitated are considered. The author suggests that the consequences of poor interpersonal management and communication skills go beyond the expected negative consequences for weak commitment and low involvement because they create an environment in which bullying is more likely. The study is believed to be the first academic study that shows that bullying and commitment behaviours are influenced by the same organisational and managerial factors. The research highlights the importance of the supervision environment and how it might act as a gateway that enables or discourages bullying behaviours. 1 The author wishes to acknowledge the invaluable work of Constable C. Williams in arranging the survey’s administration and data collection.","[{'authorId': '83258396', 'name': 'Gavin P. M.

The concept of the virtual plane is introduced and used to create reactive kinematic-based navigation laws. A virtual plane is an invertible transformation equivalent to the workspace, which is constructed by using a local observer. This results in important simplifications of the collision detection process. Based on the virtual plane, it is possible to determine the intervals of the linear velocity and the paths that lead to collisions with moving obstacles and then derive a dynamic window for the velocity and the orientation to navigate the robot safely. The speed of the robot and the orientation angle are controlled independently using simple collision cones and collision windows constructed from the virtual plane. The robot's path is controlled using kinematic-based navigation laws that depend on navigation parameters. These parameters are tuned in real time to adjust the path of the robot. Simulation is used to illustrate collision detection and path planning.","[{'authorId': '3294024', 'name': 'F. Belkhouche'}]",109.0,,41.0,Reactive Path Planning in a Dynamic Environment,2009.0

To help identify employees at high risk, it is important to know what individual differences contribute to stress and burnout. Two longitudinal studies were conducted to examine whether individual differences in socially prescribed perfectionism (individuals' perceptions that others have perfectionistic expectations of them) contribute to employees' role stress and predict increases in burnout symptoms (exhaustion, cynicism and inefficacy). Study 1 investigated 69 healthcare service provision employees in the UK over a six-month interval, and Study 2 investigated 195 school teachers in the UK over a three-month interval. In both studies, socially prescribed perfectionism predicted increases in role stress and inefficacy over time. Moreover, in Study 2, socially prescribed perfectionism also predicted increases in exhaustion and cynicism over time. The findings indicate that individual differences in socially prescribed perfectionism may be a contributing factor to stress and burnout in the workplace.","[{'authorId': '144627806', 'name': 'Julian Childs'}, {'authorId': '4115774', 'name': 'Joachim Stoeber'}]",92.0,,92.0,"Do you want me to be perfect?

Design Longitudinal social network analysis. Setting Framingham Heart Study social network. Participants 4739 individuals followed from 1983 to 2003. Main outcome measures Happiness measured with validated four item scale; broad array of attributes of social networks and diverse social ties. Results Clusters of happy and unhappy people are visible in the network, and the relationship between people’s happiness extends up to three degrees of separation (for example, to the friends of one’s friends’ friends). People who are surrounded by many happy people and those who are central in the network are more likely to become happy in the future. Longitudinal statistical models suggest that clusters of happiness result from the spread of happiness and not just a tendency for people to associate with similar individuals. A friend who lives within a mile (about 1.6 km) and who becomes happy increases the probability that a person is happy by 25% (95% confidence interval 1% to 57%). Similar effects are seen in coresident spouses (8%, 0.2% to 16%), siblings who live within a mile (14%, 1% to 28%), and next door neighbours (34%, 7% to 70%). Effects are not seen between coworkers.

However, it exhibits significant security and efficiency problems that must be solved. Internal attacks account for a large fraction of the associated security problems, however, traditional security strategies are not capable of addressing these attacks effectively. Moreover, as repeated/similar service requirements become greater in number, the efficiency of IoT-Cloud services is seriously affected. In this paper, a novel architecture that integrates a trust evaluation mechanism and service template with a balance dynamics based on cloud and edge computing is proposed to overcome these problems. In this architecture, the edge network and the edge platform are designed in such a way as to reduce resource consumption and ensure the extensibility of trust evaluation mechanism, respectively. To improve the efficiency of IoT-Cloud services, the service parameter template is established in the cloud and the service parsing template is established in the edge platform. Moreover, the edge network can assist the edge platform in establishing service parsing templates based on the trust evaluation mechanism and meet special service requirements. The experimental results illustrate that this edge-based architecture can improve both the security and efficiency of IoT-Cloud systems.","[{'authorId': '50819719', 'name': 'Tian Wang'}, {'authorId': '49288407', 'name': 'Guangxue Zhang'}, {'authorId': '34389367', 'name': 'Anfeng Liu'}, {'authorId': '134362880', 'name': 'Md Zakirul Alam Bhuiyan'}, {'authorId': '46876083', 'name': 'Qun Jin'}]",198.0,,33.0,A Secure IoT Service Architecture With an Efficient Balance Dynamics Based on Cloud and Edge Computing,2019.0

The present review uses a functional-evolutionary analysis to elucidate the evolutionary advantage in the expression and perception of angry-male and happy-female faces over angry-female and happy-male faces. For the expressors, it is more advantageous for men to show angry facial expression as it signals dominance, averts aggression and deters mate poaching; it is more advantageous for women to display happy facial expression as it signals their willingness for childcare, tending and befriending. For the perceivers, those sensitive to angry men avoid being physically harmed while those sensitive to happy women gain social support.

We find that the divergence of the (joint) distribution of kinemes yields consistent and significant correlation with target behavior characteristics. The divergence of the conditional distribution of kinemes is shown to predict the polarity of the behavioral characteristics. We partly explain the strong correlations via associating the conditional distributions with the prominent behavioral implications of their respective associated kinemes.

033289edd0ee7d54cd8b6206c242921a2fc2bef9,"Purpose 
 
 
 
 
This paper aims to examine the connection between restaurant tipping propensity and customers’ susceptibility to emotional contagion (EC) in an effort to shed more light on consumers’ inclination to pay more for a service than they are legally obligated to (that is to pay more than the price by tipping). 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
In this study, two different instruments (Tipping Motivations Scale and Emotional Contagion Scale) were simultaneously administered online to restaurant patrons. The simultaneous administration of the instruments allows the researchers to capture not only tipping propensity but also the linkage between tipping propensity and customers’ susceptibility to EC. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The results show that customers’ susceptibility to EC, social compliance and server actions has the most effect on intention to tip in restaurants in Turkey. These findings support the notion that universal human characteristics such as the tendency to reciprocate (Hatfield et al., 1993) influence consumers’ propensity to tip regardless of the culture. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
 
While the results of this study offer some insight into why restaurant patrons tip, the fact that the study was carried out only in Turkey which has a collectivist culture limits the generalizability of the results to other societies that may be individualistic in orientation. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
 
The findings of this study can be used by restaurant managers in training their employees and improving their customer patronage, particularly patronage from repeat customers. Similarly, the results could be used by restaurant servers to improve their income. 
 
 
 
 
Social implications 
 
 
 
 
The results of the study have potential to enhance the mutually beneficial relationship that should exist between restaurants and restaurant patrons. Indirectly, the results of the study could improve collective societal good. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
This study, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, is one of the first to use the Tipping Motivations Scale (Whaley et al., 2014) in a different culture (Eurasia) and explain consumers’ tipping propensity explicitly using the concept of EC.","[{'authorId': '94510586', 'name': 'P.

Although popular wisdom suggests that “any publicity is good publicity,” prior research has demonstrated only downsides to negative press. Negative reviews or word of mouth, for example, have been found to hurt product evaluation and sales. Using a combination of econometric analysis and experimental methods, we unify these perspectives to delineate contexts under which negative publicity about a product will have positive versus negative effects. Specifically, we argue that negative publicity can increase purchase likelihood and sales by increasing product awareness. Consequently, negative publicity should have differential effects on established versus unknown products. Three studies support this perspective. Whereas a negative review in the New York Times hurt sales of books by well-known authors, for example, it increased sales of books that had lower prior awareness. The studies further underscore the importance of a gap between publicity and purchase occasion and the mediating role of increased awareness in these effects.","[{'authorId': '40066064', 'name': 'Jonah A.

03c38eca4322b0aabc1e2af46fc46fb824de73b0,"Background The significance of behavioral neuroscience and the validity of its animal models of human pathology largely depend on the possibility to replicate a given finding across different laboratories. Under the present test and housing conditions, this axiom fails to resist the challenge of experimental validation. When several mouse strains are tested on highly standardized behavioral test batteries in different laboratories, significant strain×lab interactions are often detected. This limitation, predominantly due to elevated within-group variability observed in control subjects, increases the number of animals needed to address fine experimental questions. Laboratory rodents display abnormal stress and fear reactions to experimental testing, which might depend on the discrepancy between the stability of the neonatal environment and the challenging nature of the adult test and housing conditions. Methodology/Principal Findings Stimulating neonatal environments (e.g. brief maternal separations, increased foraging demands or maternal corticosterone supplementation) reduce stress and fear responses in adulthood. Here we tested whether reduced fearfulness associated with experimental testing would also reduce inter-individual variation. In line with our predictions, we show that a moderate elevation in neonatal corticosterone through maternal milk significantly reduces fear responses and inter-individual variability (average 44%) in adult mouse offspring. Conclusions/Significance We observed reduced variation in pain perception, novelty preference, hormonal stress response and resistance to pathogen infection. This suggests that the results of this study may apply to a relatively broad spectrum of neuro-behavioral domains. Present findings encourage a reconsideration of the basic principles of neonatal housing systems to improve the validity of experimental models and reduce the number of animals used.","[{'authorId': '145838336', 'name': 'S.

03ece34140f53b2ad42bc4ff95b06633baa5a829,"Local collision avoidance algorithms in crowd simulation often ignore agents beyond a neighborhood of a certain size. This cutoff can result in sharp changes in trajectory when large groups of agents enter or exit these neighborhoods. In this work, we exploit the insight that exact collision avoidance is not necessary between agents at such large distances, and propose a novel algorithm for extending existing collision avoidance algorithms to perform approximate, long-range collision avoidance. Our formulation performs long-range collision avoidance for distant agent groups to efficiently compute trajectories that are smoother than those obtained with state-of-the-art techniques and at faster rates. Comparison to real-world data demonstrates that crowds simulated with our algorithm exhibit an improved speed sensitivity to density similar to human crowds. Another issue often sidestepped in existing work is that discrete and continuum collision avoidance algorithms have different regions of applicability. For example, low-density crowds cannot be modeled as a continuum, while high-density crowds can be expensive to model using discrete methods. We formulate a hybrid technique for crowd simulation which can accurately and efficiently simulate crowds at any density with seamless transitions between continuum and discrete representations. Our approach blends results from continuum and discrete algorithms, based on local density and velocity variance. In addition to being robust across a variety of group scenarios, it is also highly efficient, running at interactive rates for thousands of agents on portable systems.","[{'authorId': '10153422', 'name': 'Abhinav Golas'}, {'authorId': '40319117', 'name': 'Rahul Narain'}, {'authorId': '144247566', 'name': 'M.

Ken Prepin (ken.prepin@telecom-paristech.fr) LTCI-CNRS/Telecom-ParisTech, 37-39 rue Dareau 75014 Paris, France Magalie Ochs (magalie.ochs@telecom-paristech.fr) LTCI-CNRS/Telecom-ParisTech, 37-39 rue Dareau 75014 Paris, France Catherine Pelachaud (catherine.pelachaud@telecom-paristech.fr) LTCI-CNRS/Telecom-ParisTech, 37-39 rue Dareau 75014 Paris, France Abstract dyadic stances can be inferred (Prepin, Ochs, & Pelachaud, 2012) from diachronic alignment between interactants. The effort of interlocutors to linguistically and non-verbally align through time is a marker of stance: it convey stance of mu- tual understanding, attention, agreement, interest and pleas- antness (Louwerse, Dale, Bard, & Jeuniaux, 2012). When two persons participate in a discussion, they not only exchange the concepts and ideas they are discussing, they also express attitudes, feelings and commitments regarding their partner: they express interpersonal stances. Endowed with backchannel model, several virtual agents are able to react to their partners’ behaviour through their non-verbal behaviour. In this paper, we go beyond this approach, proposing and test- ing a model that enables agents to express a dyadic stance, marker of effective communication: agents will naturally co- construct a shared dyadic stance if and only if their interper- sonal stance is reciprocally positive. We focus on smile, which conveys interpersonal stance and is a particularly efficient sig- nal for co-regulation of communication. With this model, a virtual agent, only capable to control its own individual pa- rameters, can, in fact, modulate and control the dyadic stance appearing when it interacts with its partner. The evaluation of the model through a user perceptive study has enabled us to validate that the dyadic stance is significantly perceived as more positive (mutual understanding, attention, agreement, in- terest, pleasantness) when reinforcement of smile is reciprocal. Keywords: dyadic interaction; interactive behaviours; dynam- ical systems; dyadic stance; smile; virtual agent; The description of stance has not only evolved toward a distinction between individual and co-constructed stance. It has also evolved from a uniquely linguistic description (DuBois, 2007; Kielsing, 2009) to a description implying in- teractants’ Non-Verbal Behaviours (NVBs) (Scherer, 2005; Prepin et al., 2012). The non-verbal behaviours participate in maintaining contact between interactants and facilitate ver- bal exchange: they are an integral part of the communication process (Paradowski, 2011). NVBs actively convey stances through paralinguistic features (such as tone of voice, dura- tion, loudness or prosody), facial expressions, and postures (Chindamo et al., 2012). Introduction When we consider verbal communication, interlocutors not only exchange the concepts and ideas which constitute the subject of their discussion, they also express feelings, judge- ments or commitments regarding this subject. This “atti- tude which, for some time, is expressed and sustained in- teractively in communication, in a unimodal or multi-modal manner” corresponds to the stance: Chindamo, Allwood, and Ahls´en (2012) review the existing definitions and descriptions of stance; they show how these definitions have evolved from a focus on individual expression of stance to a more interac- tive and social description. Individual stance refers to two types of stance: epistemic and interpersonal stance (Kielsing, 2009). The epistemic stance is the expression of the rela- tionship of a person to his/her own talk (for instance “cer- tain”). The interpersonal stances convey the relationship of a person to the interlocutor (for example “warm” or “polite”). Moreover, during an interaction, “stances are constructed across turns rather than being the product of a single turn” (Chindamo et al., 2012). When interactants with individ- ual epistemic and interpersonal stances are put in presence, Models of interactive agents have mainly explored the au- tomatic generation of virtual agent’s behaviour aligned on the interlocutor’s behaviour. Buschmeier, S., and Kopp (2010) combine a model of lexical alignment with a model gener- ating behaviours based on linguistic information. Bailenson and Yee (2005) model the NVBs alignment of a speaking virtual agent to a listening human. They propose a Digital Chameleon (in reference to the Chameleon effect described by Chartrand and Bargh (1999)). Bevacqua, Hyniewska, and Pelachaud (2010) model the NVBs alignment of a listen- ing agent to a speaking human: they propose a model of backchannels, i.e. NVBs aligned in time and nature, to fa- cilitate human users to tell a story. All these models focus on the adaptation of the virtual agent to its interlocutor, but do not take into account the recip- rocal adaptation of this interlocutor: behaviours are computed in reaction to partner’s behaviour, but not in interaction with partner’s behaviour; the dynamical coupling associated to the mutual engagement of interactants is not modelled, and crit- ical parameters of interaction such as synchrony and align- ment which appear as side effects of this coupling (Paolo,","[{'authorId': '2181003', 'name': 'K.

042dbe730282db7647ae46d6fd745dc9d777b441,"ABSTRACT This paper explores the phenomenon of depersonalisation at post-disaster sites, a process of particular relevance to types of prosocial and group behaviour that are a desirable outcome from what might otherwise be a negative or distressing experience. To better understand the depersonalisation process, this study applies Self-Categorisation Theory to a post-disaster tourism site. Using personal pronouns and specific identities as markers, we explore the cognitive processing of visitors’ experience by analysing online comments posted after visiting one of two disaster sites: the Beichuan earthquake relics and the Yingxiu earthquake relics in China. The analysis revealed that three levels of self-categorisation were evident in visitors’ experience of disaster sites; particularly depersonalisation was uncovered through (i) ‘human being’, ‘China and/or Chinese’ statements, (ii) ‘we’, ‘they’ and ‘you’ statements, and (iii) individualisation through ‘I’ statements. As the theory predicted, depersonalising statements tended to be other-focused and co-occurred with the awareness of group prototype, collective action, positive in-group attitude and cohesion, ethnocentrism, and shared norms. This is the first paper to examine the depersonalising tourist experience in a dark tourism context and to explore its process and effects. Findings have implications for tourist experience design and the interpretation of post-disaster dark tourism sites.","[{'authorId': '2117968736', 'name': 'Yachen Zhang'}, {'authorId': '32517933', 'name': 'A.

Measuring such subjective data as reactions to color, heat, light, and sound would seem to be an almost impossible task; indeed, until now there has been no theory around which the research in this field could be organized. This volume represents a preliminary effort to identify the relevant variables involved and fit them into a systematic framework. Furthermore, it presents extensive sets of measures for investigating the theory and implementing it in a variety of everyday environments.Basically, the framework outlined here proposes that environmental stimuli are linked to behavioral responses by the primary emotional responses of arousal, pleasure, and dominance. By considering the impact of the environment on these basic emotional responses, the effects of diverse stimulus components within or across sense modalities can be readily compared. An additional concept, information rate, is used to compare the effects of different environments, each with stimulation in many sense modalities. In the final chapters the authors present a series of hypotheses which relate the emotional response variables to a diversity of behaviors such as physical approach, performance, affiliation, and verbally or nonverbally expressed preference.","[{'authorId': '144102217', 'name': 'A.

We addressed whether such activations may give rise to peripheral motor activity, termed subvocalization or covert singing, using surface electromyography. Sensors placed on extrinsic laryngeal muscles, facial muscles, and a control site on the bicep measured muscle activity during auditory imagery that preceded singing, as well as during the completion of a visual imagery task. Greater activation was found in laryngeal and lip muscles for auditory than for visual imagery tasks, whereas no differences across tasks were found for other sensors. Furthermore, less accurate singers exhibited greater laryngeal activity during auditory imagery than did more accurate singers. This suggests that subvocalization may be used as a strategy to facilitate auditory imagery, which appears to be degraded in inaccurate singers. Taken together, these results suggest that subvocalization may play a role in anticipatory auditory imagery, and possibly as a way of supplementing motor associations with auditory imagery.","[{'authorId': '34657726', 'name': 'Tim A.

The results show statistical presence of patterns relevant for both approaches. However, synergetic aspects of dialog provide the best statistical predictors of collective performance and adding aspects of the alignment approach does not improve the model.

Actions taken to reduce duration may be experienced by customers as an increase in the pace of the service encounter. While achieving a reduction in duration may be appealing from a revenue perspective, will customers' perceptions of the resulting pace of the service encounter negatively impact their satisfaction? The aim of this paper is to propose that, in the context of restaurant experiences that are hedonic and extended in nature, the overall relationship between perceived service encounter pace and satisfaction follows an inverted U‐shape., – Respondents were asked to recall a recent (i.e. within the last three weeks) restaurant experience, write a description of that experience, and then complete scales that measured their perceptions of pace and satisfaction with the experience., – The relationship between perceived pace and satisfaction has an inverted U‐shape. This holds both at the level of the overall service encounter and by service stage within the encounter. The effect of perceived pace on satisfaction is moderated by service stage, with a greater tolerance of a faster pace during the post‐process stage than during the pre‐process or in‐process stages., – The results of this study have implications for the application of revenue management strategies for duration control. Management need to consider the negative effect that service encounter pace can have on consumer satisfaction. Service stage should also be factored into strategy development for duration control., – This paper extends the wait time literature, demonstrating that as the perceived pace of the service encounter increases, satisfaction increases, but only up to a point, beyond which it decreases as perceived pace continues to increase.","[{'authorId': '74240134', 'name': 'B.

05b8329dff2c4809077c8064d7e04bed5c39dcc3,"It is argued that emotions are lawful phe- nomena and thus can be described in terms of a set of laws of emotion. These laws result from the operation of emotion mechanisms that are accessible to intentional control to only a limited extent. The law of situational meaning, the law of concern, the law of reality, the laws of change, habituation and comparative feeling, and the law of hedonic asymmetry are proposed to describe emo- tion elicitation; the law of conservation of emotional mo- mentum formulates emotion persistence,"" the law of closure expresses the modularity of emotion; and the laws of care for consequence, of lightest load, and of greatest gain per- tain to emotion regulation. For a long time, emotion was an underprivileged area in psychology. It was not regarded as a major area of sci- entific psychological endeavor that seemed to deserve concerted research efforts or receive them. Things have changed over the last 10 or so years. Emotion has become an important domain with a co- herent body of theory and data. It has developed to such an extent that its phenomena can be described in terms of a set of laws, the laws of emotion, that I venture to describe here. Formulating a set of laws of emotion implies not only that the study of emotion has developed sufficiently to do so but also that emotional phenomena are indeed lawful. It implies that emotions emerge, wax, and wane according to rules in strictly determined fashion. To argue this is a secondary objective of this article. Emotions are lawful. When experiencing emotions, people are subject to laws. When filled by emotions, they are manifesting the workings of laws. There is a place for obvious a priori reservations here. Emotions and feelings are often considered the most idiosyncratic of psychological phenomena, and they sug- gest human freedom at its clearest. The mysticism of ineffability and freedom that surrounds emotions may be one reason why the psychology of emotion and feeling has advanced so slowly over the last 100 years. This mys- ticism is largely unfounded, and the freedom of feeling is an illusion. For one thing, the notion of freedom of feeling runs counter to the traditional wisdom that human beings are enslaved by their passions. For another, the laws of emotion may help us to discern that simple, universal, moving forces operate behind the complex, idiosyncratic movements of feeling, in the same way that the erratic path of an ant, to borrow Simon's (1973) well-known parable, manifests the simple structure of a simple ani- mal's mind. The word law may give rise to misunderstanding. When formulating ""'laws"" in this article, I am discussing what are primarily empirical regularities. These regular- ities--or putative regularities--are, however, assumed to rest on underlying Causal mechanisms that generate them. I am suggesting that the laws of emotion are grounded in mechanisms that are not of a voluntary nature and that are only partially under voluntary control. Not only emotions obey the laws; we obey them. We are subject to our emotions, and we cannot engender emotions at will. The laws of emotion that I will discuss are not all equally well established. Not all of them originate in solid evidence, nor are all equally supported by it. To a large extent, in fact, to list the laws of emotion is to list a pro- gram of research. However, the laws provide a coherent picture of emotional responding, which suggests that such a research program might be worthwhile.","[{'authorId': '49584958', 'name': 'N.

The method is especially useful for scenes involving swirling steam, rolling or billowing smoke, and gusting wind. It can also model gas motion due to fans and heat convection. The method combines specialized forms of the equations of motion of a hot gas with an efficient method for solving volumetric differential equations at low resolutions. Particular emphasis is given to issues of computational efficiency and ease-of-use of the method by an animator. We present the details of our model, together with examples illustrating its use.","[{'authorId': '2052709705', 'name': 'N. Foster'}, {'authorId': '1711560', 'name': 'Dimitris N.

06101a1b51f4b069520826ebc032031d5279ce7b,"Background Despite calls to study how healthcare providers’ emotions may impact patient safety, little research has addressed this topic. The current study aimed to develop a comprehensive understanding of emergency department (ED) providers’ emotional experiences, including what triggers their emotions, the perceived effects of emotions on clinical decision making and patient care, and strategies providers use to manage their emotions to reduce patient safety risks. Methods Employing grounded theory, we conducted 86 semi-structured qualitative interviews with experienced ED providers (45 physicians and 41 nurses) from four academic medical centres and four community hospitals in the Northeastern USA. Constant comparative analysis was used to develop a grounded model of provider emotions and patient safety in the ED. Results ED providers reported experiencing a wide range of emotions in response to patient, hospital, and system-level factors. Patients triggered both positive and negative emotions; hospital and system-level factors largely triggered negative emotions. Providers expressed awareness of possible adverse effects of negative emotions on clinical decision making, highlighting concerns about patient safety. Providers described strategies they employ to regulate their emotions, including emotional suppression, distraction, and cognitive reappraisal. Many providers believed that these strategies effectively guarded against the risk of emotions negatively influencing their clinical decision making. Conclusion The role of emotions in patient safety is in its early stages and many opportunities exist for researchers, educators, and clinicians to further address this important issue. Our findings highlight the need for future work to (1) determine whether providers’ emotion regulation strategies are effective at mitigating patient safety risk, (2) incorporate emotional intelligence training into healthcare education, and (3) shift the cultural norms in medicine to support meaningful discourse around emotions.","[{'authorId': '40370313', 'name': 'L.

Community mask wearing, hand washing and social distancing are thought to be effective but there is little evidence to inform or support community members on COVID-19 risk reduction within families. Methods A retrospective cohort study of 335 people in 124 families and with at least one laboratory confirmed COVID-19 case was conducted from 28 February to 27 March 2020, in Beijing, China. The outcome of interest was secondary transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within the family. Characteristics and practices of primary cases, of well family contacts and household hygiene practices were analysed as predictors of secondary transmission. Results The secondary attack rate in families was 23.0% (77/335). Face mask use by the primary case and family contacts before the primary case developed symptoms was 79% effective in reducing transmission (OR=0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.79). Daily use of chlorine or ethanol based disinfectant in households was 77% effective (OR=0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.84). Wearing a mask after illness onset of the primary case was not significantly protective. The risk of household transmission was 18 times higher with frequent daily close contact with the primary case (OR=18.26, 95% CI 3.93 to 84.79), and four times higher if the primary case had diarrhoea (OR=4.10, 95% CI 1.08 to 15.60). Household crowding was not significant. Conclusion The study confirms the highest risk of transmission prior to symptom onset, and provides the first evidence of the effectiveness of mask use, disinfection and social distancing in preventing COVID-19. We also found evidence of faecal transmission. This can inform guidelines for community prevention in settings of intense COVID-19 epidemics.","[{'authorId': '2153605585', 'name': 'Yu Wang'}, {'authorId': '2401412', 'name': 'H.

Specifically, we draw from Conservation of Resources theory to integrate competing theoretical perspectives with regard to employees’ behavioral responses to economic stress. As employees’ behaviors influence those with whom they interact, we propose that behavioral responses to economic stress have implications for group-level well-being (e.g., interpersonal climate, cohesion) and group-level economic stress. In turn, group-level and individual-level behavioral outcomes influence well-being and economic stress in a multilevel resource loss cycle.

In this paper, we focus on the rapid and systematic evacuation of large-scale densities of people after disasters to reduce loss in an effective manner. The optimal evacuation planning is a key challenge and becomes a hotspot of research and development. We design our system based on an Internet of Things (IoT) scenario that utilizes a mobile cloud computing platform in order to develop the crowd lives oriented track and help optimization system (CLOTHO). CLOTHO is an evacuation planning system for large-scale densities of people in disasters. It includes the mobile terminal (IoT side) for data collection and the cloud backend system for storage and analytics. We build our solution upon a typical IoT/fog disaster management scenario and we propose an IoT application based on an evacuation planning algorithm that uses the artificial potential field (APF), which is the core of CLOTHO. APF is conceptualized as an IoT service, and can determine the direction of evacuation automatically according to the gradient direction of the potential field, suitable for rapid evacuation of large population. Based on APF, we propose an evacuation planning algorithm names as APF with relationship attraction (APF-RA). APF-RA guides the evacuees with relationship to move to the same shelter as much as possible, to calm evacuees and realize a more humanitarian evacuation. The experimental results show that CLOTHO (using APF and APF-RA) can effectively improve convergence rate, shorten the evacuation route length and evacuation time, and make the remaining capacity of the surrounding shelters well balanced.","[{'authorId': '2118509531', 'name': 'Xiaolong Xu'}, {'authorId': '2152827812', 'name': 'Lei Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2091612', 'name': 'Stelios Sotiriadis'}, {'authorId': '1733002', 'name': 'E.

Taking into consideration the mortality rate of COVID-19, about 5–7%, and the percentage of positive patients admitted to intensive care units being 9–11%, it should be mandatory to consider and take all necessary measures to contain the COVID-19 infection. Moreover, given the recent evidence in different hospitals suggesting IL-6 and TNF-α inhibitor drugs as a possible therapy for COVID-19, we aimed to highlight that a dietary intervention could be useful to prevent the infection and/or to ameliorate the outcomes during therapy. Considering that the COVID-19 infection can generate a mild or highly acute respiratory syndrome with a consequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-α, a dietary regimen modification in order to improve the levels of adiponectin could be very useful both to prevent the infection and to take care of patients, improving their outcomes.","[{'authorId': '145188467', 'name': 'G.

The most common forms of workplace violence were verbal abuse (53.4%), physical assault (16.1%), bullying/harassment (14.2%), sexual harassment (4.6%), and racial harassment (2.6%). Most violence was perpetrated by patients and their relatives, colleagues, and supervisors. Conclusions: WPV remains a significant concern in healthcare settings in Macau. Macau’s local health authority should consider putting in place a raft of zero-tolerance policies designed to prevent it.","[{'authorId': '5244668', 'name': 'T.

This exposure can lead their own emotion expressions becoming more similar to those of others, a process we refer to as 'digital emotion contagion'. This article reviews the growing literature on digital emotion contagion. After defining emotion contagion, we suggest that one unique feature of digital emotion contagion is that it is mediated by digital media platforms that are motivated to upregulate user emotions. We then turn to measurement, and consider the challenges of demonstrating that digital emotion contagion has occurred, and how these challenges have been addressed. Finally, we call for a greater focus on understanding when emotion contagion effects are likely to be strong versus weak or nonexistent.","[{'authorId': '40484649', 'name': 'Amit Goldenberg'}, {'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

Conditions characterized by reduced spontaneous mimicry (e.g., autism) also display deficits in sensitivity to social rewards. We tested if spontaneous mimicry of socially rewarding stimuli (happy faces) depends on the reward value of stimuli in 32 typical participants. An evaluative conditioning paradigm was used to associate different reward values with neutral target faces. Subsequently, electromyographic activity over the Zygomaticus Major was measured whilst participants watched video clips of the faces making happy expressions. Higher Zygomaticus Major activity was found in response to happy faces conditioned with high reward versus low reward. Moreover, autistic traits in the general population modulated the extent of spontaneous mimicry of happy faces. This suggests a link between reward and spontaneous mimicry and provides a possible underlying mechanism for the reduced response to social rewards seen in autism.","[{'authorId': '2786578', 'name': 'Thomas B.

We first devise a lazy dynamic rebalance model, which specifies the dynamic balance conditions, defines the rebalance effort, and selects the suitable rebalance strategy automatically using the laziness law after an unexpected perturbation. Based on the model, L4RW searches over a motion capture (mocap) database for an appropriate motion segment to follow, and the transition‐to motions is generated by interpolating the active response dynamic motion. A support vector machine (SVM) based training, classification, and predication algorithm is applied to reduce the search space, and it is trained offline only once. Our algorithm classifies the mocap database into many rebalance strategy‐specified subsets and then online predicts responsive motions in the subset according to the selected strategy. The rebalance effort, the ‘extrapolated center of mass’ (XCoM) and environment constraints are selected as feature attributes for the SVM feature vector. Furthermore, the subset's segments are sorted through the rebalance effort, then our algorithm searches for an acceptable segment starting from the least‐effort segment. Compared with previous methods, our search increases speed by over two orders of magnitude, and our algorithm creates more realistic and smooth 4RW animation.","[{'authorId': '2285442', 'name': 'Mingliang Xu'}, {'authorId': '2049982', 'name': 'Huansen Li'}, {'authorId': '144470801', 'name': 'Pei Lv'}, {'authorId': '2530697', 'name': 'Wenzhi Chen'}, {'authorId': '3137857', 'name': 'Gengdai Liu'}, {'authorId': '2055690440', 'name': 'Pengyu Zhu'}, {'authorId': '145086315', 'name': 'Zhigeng Pan'}]",6.0,,56.0,L4RW: Laziness‐based Realistic Real‐time Responsive Rebalance in Walking,2010.0

However, this type of analysis often seems incomplete. In many of the cases in which people experience emotions together, there appear to be emergent macrolevel affective processes that cannot be readily captured at the individual level. In this article, we examine these macrolevel affective phenomena, which are termed collective emotions. We open with a general review of research on collective psychological processes. We then define collective emotions and discuss their key features. Next, we focus our attention on the emergent properties of collective emotions and map them using three dimensions: quality, magnitude, and time course.

We argue that this is an “open-loop” spiral because the negative service encounter spills over to the experience of subsequent customers and nearby employees.

Because resources are also used to prevent resource loss, at each stage of the stress process people are increasingly vulnerable to negative stress sequelae, that if ongoing result in rapid and impactful loss spirals. COR theory is seen as an alternative to appraisal-based stress theories because it relies more centrally on the objective and culturally construed nature of the environment in determining the stress process, rather than the individual’s personal construel. COR theory has been successfully employed in predicting a range of stress outcomes in organisational settings, health contexts, following traumatic stress, and in the face of everyday stressors. Recent advances in understanding the biological, cognitive, and social bases of stress responding are seen as consistent with the original formulation of COR theory, but call for envisioning of COR theory and the stress process within a more collectivist backdrop than was first posited. The role of both resource losses and gains in predicting positive stress outcomes is also considered.

Streams of behavioral information, from eye movements to linguistic elements, unfold over time. When two people interact, such as in conversation, they often adapt to each other, leading these behavioral levels to exhibit recurrent states. In dialog, for example, interlocutors adapt to each other by exchanging interactive cues: smiles, nods, gestures, choice of words, and so on. In order for us to capture closely the goings-on of dynamic interaction, and uncover the extent of coupling between two individuals, we need to quantify how much recurrence is taking place at these levels. Methods available in crqa would allow researchers in cognitive science to pose such questions as how much are two people recurrent at some level of analysis, what is the characteristic lag time for one person to maximally match another, or whether one person is leading another. First, we set the theoretical ground to understand the difference between “correlation” and “co-visitation” when comparing two time series, using an aggregative or cross-recurrence approach. Then, we describe more formally the principles of cross-recurrence, and show with the current package how to carry out analyses applying them. We end the paper by comparing computational efficiency, and results’ consistency, of crqa R package, with the benchmark MATLAB toolbox crptoolbox (Marwan, 2013).

By using a proactive replica checking approach, while the running overhead for PRCR is negligible, PRCR ensures reliability of the massive Cloud data with the minimum replication, which can also serve as a cost effectiveness benchmark for replication based approaches. Our simulation indicates that, compared with the conventional three-replica strategy, PRCR can reduce from one-third to two-thirds of the Cloud storage space consumption, hence significantly lowering the storage cost in a Cloud.","[{'authorId': '2108769535', 'name': 'Wenhao Li'}, {'authorId': '46285618', 'name': 'Yun Yang'}, {'authorId': '104607473', 'name': 'Dong Yuan'}]",53.0,,24.0,Ensuring Cloud Data Reliability with Minimum Replication by Proactive Replica Checking,2016.0

Observers’ facial muscles were recorded with electromyography while they saw and heard recordings of a vocalist’s performance sung with different emotional intentions (happy, neutral, and sad). Audio-visual presentations successfully elicited facial mimicry in observers that were congruent with the performer’s intended emotions. Happy singing performances elicited increased activity in the zygomaticus major muscle region of observers, while sad performances evoked increased activity in the corrugator supercilii muscle region.

In a number of studies it was found that facial reactions: first, are spontaneously elicited and differ according to the kind of emotional stimuli to which subjects are exposed; second, are sensitive to learning; third, are consistent with how the subjects perceive the stimuli and their own specific emotions; fourth, are congruent with autonomic responses; fifth, are more pronounced for females than for males; and finally, differ among subjects with specific fears. These data converge to indicate that facial muscle activity is a general component of the emotional reaction and demonstrate that the facial EMG technique is a sensitive tool for measuring emotional reactions.","[{'authorId': '4583182', 'name': 'U.

Despite existing numerous research efforts on mocap motion processing and understanding, to the best of our knowledge, to date few works have been dedicated to the investigation into whether the mocap human behavior data can be further enhanced to improve its perception. In this work, we investigate whether and how it is feasible to consistently manipulate mocap emotional head motion to enhance its perceived expressiveness. Our study relies on a mocap audiovisual dataset acquired in a laboratory setting. Participants are invited to view the animation clips of a virtual talking character displaying the original mocap head motion or manipulated head motion, and then to rate their perceived expressiveness. Statistical analysis of the rated perceptions shows that humans are sensitive to the mean of head pitch rotation (called up-down rotation) in an utterance and that the expressiveness of emotion could be improved by adjusting the mean of head pitch rotation in an utterance.","[{'authorId': '143749175', 'name': 'Yu Ding'}, {'authorId': '152932130', 'name': 'Lei Shi'}, {'authorId': '145140508', 'name': 'Z.

In this paper we document that these biases have considerable generality, appearing in all or almost all of 20 natural languages. The greater differentiation of negative states is illustrated here by the demonstration that five common nouns describing negative states in English (disgust, risk, sympathy, accident, murderer) have equivalents in most or all of the 20 languages surveyed, but the opposite of these nouns is not lexicalised in most of the 20 languages.","[{'authorId': '145983028', 'name': 'P.

However, corvids and parrots, which have forebrains relatively the same size as apes, live in complex social groups and have a long developmental period before becoming independent, have demonstrated ape-like intelligence. Although, ornithologists have documented thousands of hours observing birds in their natural habitat, they have focused their attention on avian behaviour and ecology, rather than intelligence. This review discusses recent studies of avian cognition contrasting two different approaches; the anthropocentric approach and the adaptive specialization approach. It is argued that the most productive method is to combine the two approaches. This is discussed with respects to recent investigations of two supposedly unique aspects of human cognition; episodic memory and theory of mind. In reviewing the evidence for avian intelligence, corvids and parrots appear to be cognitively superior to other birds and in many cases even apes. This suggests that complex cognition has evolved in species with very different brains through a process of convergent evolution rather than shared ancestry, although the notion that birds and mammals may share common neural connectivity patterns is discussed.","[{'authorId': '144754234', 'name': 'N.

Participant perceivers were induced to hold positive or negative expectancies regarding a target partner's general personal attributes and specific communication behavior prior to a problem-solving discussion. They then interacted with a confederate target who communicated in a pleasant, involved fashion or its opposite, after which perceivers evaluated target personal attributes and communication behavior. All three hypotheses received at least partial support. Preinteractional expectancies, especially personal attribute ones, caused perceivers to evaluate targets and their communication behavior differently, with negatively valenced expectancies serving as negative violations. Relative to a pleasant, involved communication style, unpleasant, uninvolved communication was less expected and evaluated negatively, thus functioning as a negative violation; it also reduced credibility, attraction, and perceived rewardingness of the target. Finally, disconfirmatory communication altered target evaluations relative to confirmatory communication, especially for high-valence targets. These results lend support to the premises and predictions of expectancy violations theory.","[{'authorId': '2896960', 'name': 'J. Burgoon'}, {'authorId': '87281182', 'name': 'B. L.

Due to the scientific community’s efforts, there is an increasing body of published studies describing the virus’ biology, its transmission and diagnosis, its clinical features, its radiological findings, and the development of candidate therapeutics and vaccines. Despite the decline in postmortem examination rate, autopsy remains the gold standard to determine why and how death happens. Defining the pathophysiology of death is not only limited to forensic considerations; it may also provide useful clinical and epidemiologic insights. Selective approaches to postmortem diagnosis, such as limited postmortem sampling over full autopsy, can also be useful in the control of disease outbreaks and provide valuable knowledge for managing appropriate control measures. In this scenario, we strongly recommend performing full autopsies on patients who died with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, particularly in the presence of several comorbidities. Only by working with a complete set of histological samples obtained through autopsy can one ascertain the exact cause(s) of death, optimize clinical management, and assist clinicians in pointing out a timely and effective treatment to reduce mortality.

Also, composite reliability and convergent validity were typically higher using PLS-SEM, but other metrics such as discriminant validity and beta coefficients are comparable.

Some demands are just not feasible, whereas others are constricted by restrictions relating to publication. A new classification scheme based on a functional approach that distinguishes between different types of replication is proposed. Next, it will be argued that replication addresses the important connection between existing and new knowledge. To do so it has to be applied explicitly and systematically.

It is shown that the state space of this Markov chain is the set of all minimal (s, t) cuts in the network and that its generator matrix is upper triangular. Algorithms are described for computing the distribution and moments of the length of the shortest path based on this Markov chain representation.

We hypothesized that exposure to a similar sender would foster concordant affective reactions, whereas exposure to a dissimilar sender would foster discordant ones. To induce affect, we used short videos presenting a sender displaying happy versus sad emotional expressions. To manipulate personality similarity, we used a software program to generate brief bogus descriptions of the sender based on the receivers’ prior responses to personality items.

Participants were shown a series of Japanese faces (from Matsumoto and Ekman, 1988) on a computer screen expressing ""happiness"", ""sadness"", ""anger"", or ""disgust"". While viewing the facial expressions, electoromyograms (EMG) of the participants' faces were recorded to see whether their own facial muscles corresponding to the stimulus faces were activated. Consistent with the previous studies using Caucasian samples, all four facial expressions were mimicked. The peak time of mimicry of angry or happy faces was later, while that of disgusted faces was relatively sooner.

Results from 66 samples show that supervisor aggression has the strongest adverse effects across the attitudinal and behavioral outcomes. Co-worker aggression had stronger effects than outsider aggression on the attitudinal and behavioral outcomes, whereas there was no significant difference between supervisor, co-worker, and outsider aggression for the majority of the health-related outcomes.

We discuss theoretical principles, practical issues, and pragmatic decisions to help developers maximize the construct validity of scales and subscales. First, it is essential to begin with a clear conceptualization of the target construct. Moreover, the content of the initial item pool should be overinclusive and item wording needs careful attention. Next, the item pool should be tested, along with variables that assess closely related constructs, on a heterogeneous sample representing the entire range of the target population. Finally, in selecting scale items, the goal is unidimensionality rather than internal consistency; this means that virtually all interitem correlations should be moderate in magnitude. Factor analysis can play a crucial role in ensuring the unidimensionality and discriminant validity of scales.

While there is evidence to suggest that synchronized movements lead to increased affiliative behavior (Hove & Risen, 2009; Valdesolo & DeSteno, 2011; Wiltermuth & Heath, 2009), the influence of other interpersonal cues has yet to be fully controlled. The current study controls for these features by using computer algorithms to replace human partners.

To examine the specificity of brain regions responsive to biological motion, brain activations obtained during a “walker vs. non-walker” discrimination task were compared with those elicited by two other tasks: (i) non-rigid motion (NRM), involving the discrimination of overall motion direction in the same “point-lights” display, and (ii) face-gender discrimination, involving the discrimination of gender in briefly presented photographs of men and women. Brain activity specific to “biological motion” recognition arose in the lateral cerebellum and in a region in the lateral occipital cortex presumably corresponding to the area KO previously shown to be particularly sensitive to kinetic contours. Additional areas significantly activated during the biological motion recognition task involved both, dorsal and ventral extrastriate cortical regions. In the ventral regions both face-gender discrimination and biological motion recognition elicited activation in the lingual and fusiform gyri and in the Brodmann areas 22 and 38 in superior temporal sulcus (STS). Along the dorsal pathway, both biological motion recognition and non-rigid direction discrimination gave rise to strong responses in several known motion sensitive areas. These included Brodmann areas 19/37, the inferior (Brodmann Area 39), and superior parietal lobule (Brodmann Area 7). Thus, we conjecture that, whereas face (and form) stimuli activate primarily the ventral system and motion stimuli primarily the dorsal system, recognition of biological motion stimuli may activate both systems as well as their confluence in STS. This hypothesis is consistent with our findings in stroke patients, with unilateral brain lesions involving at least one of these areas, who, although correctly reporting the direction of the point-light walker, fail on the biological motion task.","[{'authorId': '1697005', 'name': 'L.

Conditioning theory provides a straightforward explanation for the development of sympathetic responses (Allport, 1924). According to the theory a particular unconditioned stimulus elicits the emotional response; for example, electric shock elicits a pain or fear response. Now if 5 experiences the pain reactions of another S to a shock and is himself shocked, on subsequent trials he should show fear at the pain reactions of the other S.

However, it is unclear how these shared representations can be controlled and distinguished. Brain imaging suggests that controlling shared representations, indexed by the ability to control automatic imitative responses, activates anterior fronto‐median cortex (aFMC), and temporo‐parietal junction (TPJ). Crucially, these regions are also consistently implicated in mental state attribution and have provided an alternative account for higher‐level social cognition. Here, we directly tested whether social‐cognitive processes involve similar key computational mechanisms as the control of shared representations by using functional brain imaging to reveal overlapping brain circuits. We show in a within‐subject design that commonly activated regions occurred selectively in aFMC and TPJ. Mentalizing and self‐referential thoughts recruited a region in aFMC, which was also activated when controlling imitation. In the TPJ, an area overlapped between mentalizing, agency processing, and imitative control. Behavioral and neural correlates of mentalizing were further related to the individual ability for controlling imitation. Our findings support the assumption of shared key processes and suggest a novel link between embodied and social cognition.

Purpose
Global adoption of the internet and mobile usage results in a huge variation in the cultural backgrounds of consumers who generate and consume electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM). Unsurprisingly, a research trend on cross-cultural eWOM has emerged. However, there has not been an attempt to synthesize this research topic. This paper aims to bridge this gap.


Methodology
This research paper conducts a systematic literature review of the current research findings on cross-cultural eWOM. Journal articles published from 2006 to 2021 are included. This study then presents the key issues in the extant literature and suggests potential future research.


Findings
The findings show that there has been an upward trend in the number of publications on cross-cultural eWOM since the early 2010s, with a relatively steeper increase toward 2020. The findings also synthesize cross-cultural eWOM research into four elements and suggest potential future research avenues.


Value
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is currently no exhaustive/integrated review of cross-cultural eWOM research. This research fills the need to summarize the current state of cross-cultural eWOM literature and identifies research questions to be addressed in the future.

The present study extends previous research by investigating the association between empathy and loneliness across the adult lifespan and examining the role of relevant demographic and personality factors. 110 community-dwelling adults (18 to 81 years old) completed the UCLA Loneliness Scale and the Empathy Quotient. Empathy scores were inversely associated with rated loneliness and predicted 8.7% of variance in loneliness scores after accounting for sex, age, relationship status, education, and neuroticism. The Social Skills factor of the Empathy Quotient was the strongest predictor of the association between perceived empathy and loneliness. Previous research is extended by the finding that rated loneliness was inversely associated with empathy scores across the adult lifespan. Underlying this relationship may be negative perceptions of personal social proclivity as a function of difficulty in understanding the mental states of others and high trait neuroticism.","[{'authorId': '145508017', 'name': 'J.

Past approaches have suggested situational emotion transfers (i.e., contagion) and the phenomenon that emotionally similar users flock together (i.e., homophily). We analyze these mechanisms in unison by exploiting the hierarchical structure of YouTube through multilevel analyses, disaggregating the video- and channel-level effects of YouTuber emotions on audience comments. Dictionary analyses using the National Research Council emotion lexica were used to measure the emotions expressed in videos and user comments from 2,083 YouTube vlogs selected from 110 vloggers. We find that video- and channel-level emotions independently influence audience emotions, providing evidence for both contagion and homophily effects. Random slope models suggest that contagion strength varies between YouTube channels for some emotions. However, neither average channel-level emotions nor number of subscribers significantly moderate the strength of contagion effects. The present study highlights that multiple, independent mechanisms shape emotions in online social networks.","[{'authorId': '116421788', 'name': 'Hannes Rosenbusch'}, {'authorId': '87374285', 'name': 'A.

However, the existing solution is still not satisfactory due to the problem in the mutual influence of agents. Therefore, an improved multi-agent reinforcement learning method (IMARL algorithm) is introduced. In this method, the intersection of the pedestrian trajectory extracted from the real video is first used as the state space for reinforcement learning. The crowd is grouped and the leader is selected. A bulletin board is added to the reinforcement learning algorithm of multi-agent to store the empirical knowledge of the learning process, and the navigation agent passes information between the leader and the bulletin board. The original social force model was improved, and the cohesive force of visual factors was added to the force formula. The IMARL algorithm is combined with the improved social force model for crowd evacuation simulation. Using a two-layer control mechanism, the leader in the upper layer uses the decision process based on the IMARL algorithm to select the path, and the individuals in the bottom group use the improved social force model to evacuate. The method of this paper not only solves the dimensionality disaster problem of reinforcement learning but also improves the convergence speed. The evacuation efficiency is effectively improved in crowd evacuation simulation experiments. In addition, it can also provide specific guidance scheme for crowd evacuation improvement and assistant decision support for the prevention and management of large-scale group trampling incidents.","[{'authorId': '2109062228', 'name': 'Qingqing Wang'}, {'authorId': '2118903809', 'name': 'Hong Liu'}, {'authorId': '2143929400', 'name': 'Kaizhou Gao'}, {'authorId': '2108006217', 'name': 'Le Zhang'}]",34.0,,43.0,Improved Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Path Planning-Based Crowd Simulation,2019.0

""Sender"" subjects were videotaped while they watched and rated the pleasantness of 25 slides. These videotapes were then shown to ""receiver"" subjects who made judgments about the sender subjects' reactions to each slide. The results indicated that the situationally lonely subjects were more successful as communication senders than were the chronically lonely or nonlonely subjects. This finding was interpreted within a cognitive framework as reflecting the increased motivation created by attributing one's situational loneliness to unstable causes. Beck depression scores were also obtained. In general, highly depressed subjects were less successful as communication senders, but this relation did not hold for the situationally lonely group. Loneliness reflects a deficiency in one's social relationships that is almost always accompanied by a gnawing sense of discomfort. As a phenomenon, it is widespread.

Participants completed the App Recommendation Task—a task that captures neural processes associated with making recommendations to others, with and without information about peer recommendations of the type commonly available online. The results demonstrate that increased activity in the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex in response to peer recommendations is significantly correlated with participants changing their recommendations to be consistent with this feedback within subjects. Furthermore, individual differences in activation of the temporoparietal junction during feedback that peer recommendations varied from those of the participant correlated with individual differences in susceptibility to influence on recommendation decisions between subjects. These brain regions have previously been implicated in social influence and the concept of being a “successful idea salesperson,” respectively. Together, they highlight a potential combination of internal preference shifts and consideration of the mental states of others in recommendation environments that include peer opinions.","[{'authorId': '2761530', 'name': 'Christopher N.

0eafd45acd02d77841fed10e33302884fffb1809,"In online communities, such as Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit, millions of pieces of contents are generated by users every day, and these user-generated contents (UGCs) show a great variety of topics discussed that make the online community vivid and attractive. However, the reasons why UGCs show great variety and how a firm can influence this variety was unknown, which had been an obstacle to understanding and managing UGCs’ variety. This study fills these two gaps based on variety-seeking theory and topic modeling, which is a technique in machine learning. We extract, quantitatively, the topic of the UGCs using topic modeling and divide UGCs into two types: single topic and multiple topics. The user’s tendency to choose the type of UGC is used to measure variety-seeking behavior. We found that users have an intrinsic preference for variety when producing UGCs; the more single topic UGCs were produced in the past, the higher the probability of producing multiple topics UGC and the lower the probability of producing single topic UGC would be in the next, and vice versa. Furthermore, we discussed the effect of language/linguistic style matching (LSM) between firm feedbacks and UGCs on users’ variety-seeking tendencies in UGCs’ production. This study makes three contributions: (1) broadening variety-seeking theory to new behavior, that is content production behavior, and the results demonstrated that people would show a variety-seeking behavior in producing UGCs. (2) a new feasible method to measure the variety of UGCs by using topic modeling to extract the topics of UGCs and then measure the variety-seeking behavior in producing UGCs by analyzing the choice between single topic and multiple topics. (3) guidance for the firm to alter LSM of feedbacks to influence the variety of UGCs.","[{'authorId': '2158196491', 'name': 'Weilin Xiang'}, {'authorId': '2115772336', 'name': 'Yongbin Ma'}, {'authorId': '117203921', 'name': 'Dewen Liu'}, {'authorId': '2158335160', 'name': 'Sikang Zhang'}]",3.0,,39.0,Why Are User-Generated Contents So Varied?

0ec7bb085e42cb5d83087ced500df19188b3c8af,"We examined the hypothesis that muscle contractions in the face influence subjective emotional experience. Previously, researchers have been critical of experiments designed to test this facial feedback hypothesis, particularly in terms of methodological problems that may lead to demand characteristics. In an effort to surmount these methodological problems Strack, Martin, and Stepper (1988) developed an experimental procedure whereby subjects were induced to contract facial muscles involved in the production of an emotional pattern, without being asked to actually simulate an emotion. Specifically, subjects were required to hold a pen in their teeth, which unobtrusively creates a contraction of the zygomaticus major muscles, the muscles involved in the production of a human smile. This manipulation minimises the likelihood that subjects are able to interpret their zygomaticus contractions as representing a particular emotion, thereby preventing subjects from determining the purpose of the experiment. Strack et al. (1988) found support for the facial feedback hypothesis applied to pleasant affect, in that subjects in the pen-in-teeth condition rated humorous cartoons as being funnier than subjects in the control condition (in which zygomaticus contractions were inhibited). The present study represents an extension of this nonobtrusive methodology to an investigation of the facial feedback of unpleasant affect. Consistent with the Strack et al. procedure, we wanted to have subjects furrow their brow without actually instructing them to do so and without asking them to produce any emotional facial pattern at all. This was achieved by attaching two golf tees to the subject's brow region (just above the inside comer of each eye) and then instructing them to touch the tips of the golf tees together as part of a ""divided-attention"" experiment. Touching the tips of the golf tees together could only be achieved by a contraction of the corrugator supercilii muscles, the muscles involved in the production of a sad emotional facial pattern. Subjects reported significantly more sadness in response to aversive photographs while touching the tips of the golf tees together than under conditions which inhibited corrugator contractions. These results provide evidence, using a new and unobtrusive manipulation, that facial feedback operates for unpleasant affect to a degree similar to that previously found for pleasant affect.","[{'authorId': '47223561', 'name': 'R.

In addition to cognitive impairment, patients may exhibit hyperactivity, attention deficits, social difficulties and anxiety, and autistic‐like behaviors. The degree to which patients display these behaviors varies considerably and is influenced by family history, suggesting that genetic modifiers play a role in the expression of behaviors in FXS. Several studies have examined behavior in a mouse model of FXS in which the Fmr1 gene has been ablated. Most of those studies were done in Fmr1 knockout mice on a pure C57BL/6 or FVB strain background. To gain a better understanding of the effects of genetic background on behaviors resulting from the loss of Fmr1 gene expression, we generated F1 hybrid lines from female Fmr1 heterozygous mice on a pure C57BL/6J background bred with male Fmr1 wild‐type (WT) mice of various background strains (A/J, DBA/2J, FVB/NJ, 129S1/SvImJ and CD‐1). Male Fmr1 knockout and WT littermates from each line were examined in an extensive behavioral test battery.

Our mechanism continually updates the safe boundaries at each moment based on the latest location of individuals who are present inside the environment. Guiding people toward exit doors depends on the momentary situations in the environment, which in turn rely on the specifications of each exit door.

The model basically proposes that in an interaction, sufficient changes in one person's intimacy behaviors (e.g., interpersonal distance, eye contact, touch) precipitate arousal change in the other person. Depending upon the type of relationship, the setting, and other factors, this arousal change may be labeled either a positive or negative emotional state. The model predicts that positively labeled states facilitate reciprocal or enhancing reactions to the other person's intimacy changes, while negatively labeled states facilitate compensatory reactions. Applications and limitations of the model are discussed. Research into the role of nonverbal communication in social interaction has increased rapidly over the last several years. Although there is considerable disagreement regarding the use of the label communication to describe these behaviors (see Ekman & Friesen, 1969; Wiener, Devoe, Rubinow, & Geller, 1972), there is little doubt that a wide variety of nonverbal behaviors is important in the interaction process. Argyle and Dean (196S) have suggested that one set of these behaviors, primarily nonverbal and including interpersonal distance, eye contact, leaning, smiling, and intimacy of topic, is critical in indicating interpersonal intimacy. Mehrabian (1969) has discussed many of the same behaviors in a review and has used the label immediacy to refer to a limited number of dimensions including touch, distance, eye contact, body lean, and body orientation. Mehrabian cited considerable evidence indicating that increased immediacy in one or more of these dimensions is related to a more positive attitude toward another.

Recently, Business Week (Hammonds, 1997) rated firms not on the basis of their economic standing, but on the basis of how they dealt with issues involving the intersection of work and family-life domains. Likewise, academic research has examined this issue in a variety of settings including education (Netemeyer et al., 1996), accounting (Bedeian et al., 1988), and police work (Burke, 1994). This conflict between work and family domains has been given two labels: work-family conflict and family-work conflict (Netemeyer et al., 1996). Work-family conflict can be defined as a type of inter-role conflict wherein some responsibilities from the work and family domains are not compatible and have a negative influence on an employee's work situation (Greenhaus and Beutell, 1985). Results from previous research indicate that work-family conflict is related to a number of negative job attitudes and consequences including lower overall job satisfaction (Boles and Babin, 1996) and greater propensity to leave a position (Good et al., 1988). Family-work conflict also is a type of inter-role conflict in which family and work responsibilities are not compatible (Greenhaus and Beutell, 1985). Previous research suggests that family-work conflict is more likely to exert its negative influences in the home domain, resulting in lower life satisfaction and greater internal conflict within the family unit. However, family-work conflict also is related to attitudes about the job and/or workplace (Netemeyer et al., 1996). Both work-family conflict and family-work conflict basically result from an individual trying to meet an overabundance of conflicting demands from the different domains in which he! she is operating. While some previous research indicates that work-family conflict is related to overall job satisfaction (Boles and Babin, 1996), not all studies have reported a significant link between work-family conflict and job satisfaction (Bedeian et al, 1988). Furthermore, research has focused on general job satisfaction (Kossek and Ozeki, 1998). Because there are a number of facets of a job which can cause satisfaction/dissatisfaction, measuring each of these as well as overall job satisfaction is important. Summing individual scores of subscales is not sufficient to assess overall satisfaction since one aspect of the job may not be of equal importance as another to the employee and each employee may have different priorities. Thus, even though two employees have equal overall scores, they may not be equally satisfied. To our knowledge, there is no previous research that has examined the effects of family-work conflict and work-family conflict on multiple facets of job satisfaction. One reason for this lack of attention is that, unlike research examining role conflict and role ambiguity, research concerning inter-relations between work-family conflict, family-work conflict and job related constructs is relatively limited. The research is still in the process of investigating more general relationships among work-related attitudes, rather than focusing exclusively on job satisfaction issues (e.g., Bedeian et al., 1988; Netmeyer et al., 1996). This study seeks to extend the literature on the work-family interface. It will do this by examining the relationship of family-work conflict and work-family conflict and different facets of job satisfaction. These include: 1) satisfaction with pay, 2) satisfaction with the work itself, 3) satisfaction with co-workers, and 4) satisfaction with supervision, as well as re-examining the linkage of work-family conflict and family-work conflict with 5) general job satisfaction. A sample of probation and parole personnel was used in this study. These employees were selected for several reasons. It appears individuals filling boundary-spanning positions, wherein an employee's work places him/her in frequent, direct contact with the public or with customers/clients, may be more susceptible to negative effects from stress (Burke, 1994; Sager, 1994) which is associated with work-family conflict (Boles et al. …","[{'authorId': '48132094', 'name': 'James S.

Furthermore, emotions are inherently interpersonal. We learn what to feel from others, especially when we are children. We “catch” other people’s emotions just by being around them. We get caught in escalating response–counterresponse emotional sequences. This all takes place in time, generating complex patterns of interpersonal emotional dynamics. This review summarizes theory, empirical findings, and key challenges for future research regarding three processes that contribute to interpersonal affective dynamics: (a) Convergence of social partners’ emotional responses to the external world, (b) emotional reactivity of social partners to each other, and (c) interpersonal emotion regulation.","[{'authorId': '34687440', 'name': 'Emily Butler'}]",138.0,,46.0,Interpersonal Affect Dynamics: It Takes Two (and Time) to Tango,2015.0

Independent groups of seven- and eight-year-old children (a total of 45 boys and 45 girls) listened to humorous material with nine-year-old confederate-companions who were trained to respond to prerecorded on-line directions. The humorous material was presented through headphones, as were the directions which were varied systematically and related to laughter and smiling behavior. Subjects and companions were of the same sex. Amount of companions' laughter, amount of smiling, and sex of subject/companion pairs were varied in a 3 × 3 × 2 design. Increases in the companions' laughter led to enhanced laughter, smiling, and ratings of funniness in subjects, who also expected companions to rate the material as more funny.

Studies 1, 2, and 3 supported this reasoning by showing that similarity fostered, whereas dissimilarity blocked concordant reactions to a happy sender (but not to a sad sender). We also examined the mechanism behind these effects and found that similarity influenced liking of the happy sender but did not affect liking of the sad sender. Study 4 provided causal evidence for this idea by showing that similarity influenced the induction of positive affect through liking.","[{'authorId': '3416420', 'name': 'Monika Wróbel'}, {'authorId': '5720116', 'name': 'Klara Królewiak'}]",10.0,,62.0,Do We Feel the Same Way If We Think the Same Way?

0f6ebc5742da8967568106c0c1508a93a16e4ed9,"Basic Emotion theory has had a tremendous influence on the affective sciences, including music psychology, where most researchers have assumed that music expressivity is constrained to a limited set of basic emotions. Several scholars suggested that these constrains to musical expressivity are explained by the existence of a shared acoustic code to the expression of emotions in music and speech prosody. In this article we advocate for a shift from this focus on basic emotions to a constructionist account. This approach proposes that the phenomenon of perception of emotions in music arises from the interaction of music’s ability to express core affects and the influence of top-down and contextual information in the listener’s mind. We start by reviewing the problems with the concept of Basic Emotions, and the inconsistent evidence that supports it. We also demonstrate how decades of developmental and cross-cultural research on music and emotional speech have failed to produce convincing findings to conclude that music expressivity is built upon a set of biologically pre-determined basic emotions. We then examine the cue-emotion consistencies between music and speech, and show how they support a parsimonious explanation, where musical expressivity is grounded on two dimensions of core affect (arousal and valence). Next, we explain how the fact that listeners reliably identify basic emotions in music does not arise from the existence of categorical boundaries in the stimuli, but from processes that facilitate categorical perception, such as using stereotyped stimuli and close-ended response formats, psychological processes of construction of mental prototypes, and contextual information. Finally, we outline our proposal of a constructionist account of perception of emotions in music, and spell out the ways in which this approach is able to make solve past conflicting findings. We conclude by providing explicit pointers about the methodological choices that will be vital to move beyond the popular Basic Emotion paradigm and start untangling the emergence of emotional experiences with music in the actual contexts in which they occur.","[{'authorId': '1422864382', 'name': 'J.

Combining the social identity perspective with resources theories, we hypothesized that leader–member exchange (LMX) and personal resources (meaning-making and organization-based self-esteem) are positively related over time. In addition, we hypothesized that resources captured before change implementation, show a positive relationship with adaptivity captured during change. Structural equation modelling analyses showed that LMX and personal resources were positively related. Further, all T1 resources were positively related to T2 adaptivity.

We asked if a comparable phenomenon exists in zebrafish (Danio rerio) that live in shoals in the wild. In the first experiment, we observed that most quantifiable parameters of swimming behavior were similar when zerbafish swam alone or with companions. However, after exposure to an alarm substance (Schreckstoff), individuals recovering alone continued to display behaviors associated with fear after removal of the stimulus, while those recovering with companions did not. In the next two experiments, we examined the role of familiarity of companions. Subjects spent more time in the vicinity of familiar companions in a two-choice assay. While both familiar and unfamiliar companions reduced behavioral signs of distress, familiar companions additionally modulated cortisol and endogenous isotocin in subjects. Shortly after being united with familiar companions, isotocin spiked followed by a dampening of circulating cortisol levels. These results suggest that zebrafish experience fear attenuation in the presence of others and familiar companions are more effective at buffering the stress associated with escaping predation. Changes in behavior, circulating cortisol and isotocin levels due to social partners are reminiscent of changes due to amelioration of fear in some mammalian species in the presence of companions. The two phenomena may be related.","[{'authorId': '6386982', 'name': 'A. Mathuru'}, {'authorId': '1759817', 'name': 'A.

Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), an endogenous neuropeptide, is the primary physiological regulator of the mammalian stress response. Grown nonhuman primates who were exposed as infants to adverse early rearing conditions were studied to determine if long-term alterations of CRF neuronal systems had occurred following the early stressor. In comparison to monkeys reared by mothers foraging under predictable conditions, infant monkeys raised by mothers foraging under unpredictable conditions exhibited persistently elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of CRF. Because hyperactivity of CRF-releasing neurons has been implicated in the pathophysiology of certain human affective and anxiety disorders, the present finding provides a potential neurobiological mechanism by which early-life stressors may contribute to adult psychopathology.","[{'authorId': '40242540', 'name': 'J.

However, little systematic evidence exists about the extent or type of in-vehicle listening practices in real-world contexts, and their effect on driving performance. A survey was carried out to discover the extent to which people listen to music while driving, what they are listening to and why, and whether there is any association with driving safety, measured by possession of four or more years' no-claims on motor insurance. The survey of 1780 British drivers reveals that approximately two-thirds listen to recorded music and music radio while driving, with music reported to be less distracting than conversation. The most commonly cited reasons for listening to music while driving were its benefits for relaxation and concentration. The survey indicates associations between possession of `no claims' on motor insurance and a preference for silence. However, the genre of music playing also appears to influence driving performance: there is an association between possession of no-claims, genre of music, and a difference in the frequency with which certain genres were playing at the time of the last accident, relative to the expected norm for that genre. These findings support evidence for music as a source of in-vehicle distraction, which can have both positive and negative effects on driving performance.","[{'authorId': '2335627', 'name': 'Nicola Dibben'}, {'authorId': '51268554', 'name': 'V.

It is rather puzzling that given the massive interest in affective neuroscience in the last decade, it still seems to make sense to raise the question ‘Why bodies’ and to try to provide an answer to it, as is the goal of this article. There are now hundreds of articles on human emotion perception ranging from behavioural studies to brain imaging experiments. These experimental studies complement decades of reports on affective disorders in neurological patients and clinical studies of psychiatric populations. The most cursory glance at the literature on emotion in humans, now referred to by the umbrella term of social and affective neuroscience, shows that over 95 per cent of them have used faces as stimuli. Of the remaining 5 per cent, a few have used scenes or auditory information including human voices, music or environmental sounds. But by far the smallest number has looked into whole-body expressions. As a rough estimate, a search on PubMed today, 1 May 2009, yields 3521 hits for emotion × faces, 1003 hits for emotion × music and 339 hits for emotion × bodies. When looking in more detail, the body × emotion category in fact yields a majority of papers on well-being, nursing, sexual violence or organ donation. But the number of cognitive and affective neuroscience studies of emotional body perception as of today is lower than 20. Why then have whole bodies and bodily expressions not attracted the attention of researchers so far? The goal of this article is to contribute some elements for an answer to this question. I believe that there is something to learn from the historical neglect of bodies and bodily expressions. I will next address some historical misconceptions about whole-body perception, and in the process I intend not only to provide an impetus for this kind of work but also to contribute to a better understanding of the significance of the affective dimension of behaviour, mind and brain as seen from the vantage point of bodily communication.

In human and non-human primates, emotional contagion can be linked to facial mimicry, an automatic and fast response (less than 1 s) in which individuals involuntary mimic others’ expressions. Here, we tested whether body (play bow, PBOW) and facial (relaxed open-mouth, ROM) rapid mimicry is present in domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) during dyadic intraspecific play. During their free playful interactions, dogs showed a stronger and rapid mimicry response (less than 1 s) after perceiving PBOW and ROM (two signals typical of play in dogs) than after perceiving JUMP and BITE (two play patterns resembling PBOW and ROM in motor performance). Playful sessions punctuated by rapid mimicry lasted longer that those sessions punctuated only by signals. Moreover, the distribution of rapid mimicry was strongly affected by the familiarity linking the subjects involved: the stronger the social bonding, the higher the level of rapid mimicry. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the presence of rapid mimicry in dogs, the involvement of mimicry in sharing playful motivation and the social modulation of the phenomenon. All these findings concur in supporting the idea that a possible linkage between rapid mimicry and emotional contagion (a building-block of empathy) exists in dogs.","[{'authorId': '2481399', 'name': 'E.

Data from self-report surveys from 99 army personnel and 193 police officers were analysed using SEM. The results indicate that significant paths between most variables and perceived organisational support explained 6% of bullying (comprising intimidation and personal attacks). Together, (a) perceived organisational support and bullying explained almost a third (28%) of psychological wellbeing, (b) perceived organisational support, bullying and psychological wellbeing explained over two-thirds (68%) of affective commitment, and (c) bullying and affective commitment explained over half (53%) of turnover intentions. Also, bullying partially mediated the relationship between perceived organisational support and affective commitment. There were no significant differences between the two cohorts, except for perceived organisational support from management. Implications include that soldiers and police officers are likely to experience better workplace performance if management support is improved. Both soldiers and police undertake emotionally difficult tasks at times, and without adequate support, the stress of their jobs is likely to negatively impact their wellbeing and commitment. Poor perceived management support is not sustainable in the long-term without negative employee consequences.","[{'authorId': '9155680', 'name': 'Y.

However, people do not always express emotions that are similar to other group members, and the factors that determine when similarity occurs are not yet clear. In the current project, we examined whether certain situations activate specific emotional motives that influence the tendency to show emotional similarity. To test this possibility, we considered emotional responses to political situations that either called for weak (Studies 1 and 3) or strong (Study 2 and 4) negative emotions. Findings revealed that the motivation to feel weak emotions led people to be more influenced by weaker emotions than their own, whereas the motivation to feel strong emotions led people to be more influenced by stronger emotions than their own. Intriguingly, these motivations led people to change their emotions even after discovering that others' emotions were similar to their initial emotional response. These findings are observed both in a lab task (Studies 1-3) and in real-life online interactions on Twitter (Study 4). Our findings enhance our ability to understand and predict emotional influence processes in different contexts and may therefore help explain how these processes unfold in group behavior.

Sixteen studies on attachment in children with autism were reviewed, and ten studies with data on observed attachment security (N = 287) were included in a quantitative meta-analysis.


RESULTS
Despite the impairments of children with autism in reciprocal social interaction, the majority of the studies found evidence for attachment behaviours in these children. In four samples using the Strange Situation procedure the average percentage of secure attachments amounted to 53% (n = 72). Meta-analytic results showed that children with autism were significantly less securely attached to their parents than comparison children, and the combined effect size for this difference was moderate (r =.24). Children with autism displayed less attachment security than comparisons without autism, but this difference disappeared in samples with children with higher mental development, and in samples in which autism was mixed with less severe symptoms of autistic spectrum disorders.


CONCLUSIONS
It is concluded that attachment security is compatible with autism, and can be assessed with Strange Situation type of procedures. The co-morbidity of autism and mental retardation appears to be associated with attachment insecurity.","[{'authorId': '34080263', 'name': 'A. H. Rutgers'}, {'authorId': '1384075557', 'name': 'M.

A convenient, although not comprehensive, presentation of required sample sizes is provided here. Effect-size indexes and conventional values for these are given for operationally defined small, medium, and large effects. The sample sizes necessary for .80 power to detect effects at these levels are tabled for eight standard statistical tests: (a) the difference between independent means, (b) the significance of a product-moment correlation, (c) the difference between independent rs, (d) the sign test, (e) the difference between independent proportions, (f) chi-square tests for goodness of fit and contingency tables, (g) one-way analysis of variance, and (h) the significance o f a multiple or multiple partial correlation. The preface to the first edition of my power handbook (Cohen, 1969) begins: During my first dozen years o f teaching and consulting o n applied statistics with behavioral scientists, 1 became increasingly impressed with the importance of statistical power analysis, an importance which was increased an order of magnitude by its neglect in our textbooks and curricula. The case for its importance is easily made: What behavioral scientist would view with equanimity the question of the probability that his investigation would lead to statistically significant results, i.e., its power? (p. vii) This neglect was obvious through casual observation and had been confirmed by a power review of the 1960 volume of the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, which found the mean power to detect medium effect sizes to be .48 (Cohen, 1962). Thus, the chance of obtaining a significant result was about that of tossing a head with a fair coin. I attributed this disregard of power to the inaccessibility of a meager and mathematically difficult literature, beginning with its origin in the work of Neyman and Pearson (1928,1933). The power handbook was supposed to solve the problem. It required no more background than an introductory psychological statistics course that included significance testing. The exposition was verbal-intuitive and carried largely by many worked examples drawn from across the spectrum of behavioral science. In the ensuing two decades, the book has been through revised (1977) and second (1988) editions and has inspired dozens of power and effect-size surveys i n many areas of the social and life sciences (Cohen, 1988, pp. xi-xii).

This is despite claims that commitment is multidimensional and that certain organizational and individual variables are related to different forms of commitment. It is possible that organizations seeking to promote commitment might need to tailor HR practices to suit employees' needs, thus challenging the best practice perspective at the employee level. This article extends on the literature by examining whether the relationship between attitudes towards HR practices and commitment is moderated by career stage. The empirical research is based on an employee attitude survey within three financial service organizations in Ireland (N = 288).

The guiding scheme can provide the fastest path for people to reach an exit according to the evacuation time estimated using the analytical model. Based on thorough research, this is the first distributed solution in which corridor capacity and length, exit capacity, and the concurrent movement and distribution of people are considered in estimating the evacuation time and planning escape paths. Using the proposed framework, congestion in corridors and at exits can be eased to substantially reduce the total evacuation time. Analytical and simulation results show that this approach outperforms existing schemes and can prevent people from following localoptimal guiding directions that increase the evacuation time. A prototype called the Load-balancing Emergency Guiding System (LEGS) is implemented; this system can be used to compare the evacuation times and guiding directions provided by existing schemes and the proposed scheme for various distributions of people.","[{'authorId': '2263800', 'name': 'Lien-Wu Chen'}, {'authorId': '2398037', 'name': 'Jen-Hsiang Cheng'}, {'authorId': '1683948', 'name': 'Y.

CT-BERT is specifically designed to be used on COVID-19 content, particularly from social media, and can be utilized for various natural language processing tasks such as classification, question-answering, and chatbots. This paper aims to evaluate the performance of CT-BERT on different classification datasets and compare it with BERT-LARGE, its base model. Methods The study utilizes CT-BERT, which is pre-trained on a large corpus of COVID-19 related Twitter messages. The authors evaluated the performance of CT-BERT on five different classification datasets, including one in the target domain. The model's performance is compared to its base model, BERT-LARGE, to measure the marginal improvement. The authors also provide detailed information on the training process and the technical specifications of the model. Results The results indicate that CT-BERT outperforms BERT-LARGE with a marginal improvement of 10-30% on all five classification datasets. The largest improvements are observed in the target domain. The authors provide detailed performance metrics and discuss the significance of these results. Discussion The study demonstrates the potential of pre-trained transformer models, such as CT-BERT, for COVID-19 related natural language processing tasks. The results indicate that CT-BERT can improve the classification performance on COVID-19 related content, especially on social media. These findings have important implications for various applications, such as monitoring public sentiment and developing chatbots to provide COVID-19 related information. The study also highlights the importance of using domain-specific pre-trained models for specific natural language processing tasks. Overall, this work provides a valuable contribution to the development of COVID-19 related NLP models.","[{'authorId': '144053995', 'name': 'Martin Müller'}, {'authorId': '3046313', 'name': 'M.

However, there has not been a direct examination into how complying with a privacy notice is related to meeting privacy expectations online. This article reports the findings of two factorial vignette studies describing online consumer tracking, whereby respondents rated the degree to which online scenarios met their privacy expectations or complied with a privacy notice. The results suggest that respondents perceived the privacy notice as offering greater protections than it actually did. Perhaps most problematically, respondents projected the important factors of their privacy expectations onto the privacy notice. In other words, privacy notices became a tabula rasa for users' privacy expectations. The findings provide guidance for policy makers and firms to avoid unnecessary privacy violations caused by an overreliance on privacy notices. Considering the importance of privacy notices in managing privacy online, more work should extend this study to shed light on how consumers understand notices and how their perceptions of privacy notices map to their privacy expectations, if at all.","[{'authorId': '49683525', 'name': 'Kirsten E.

Understanding how decisions are reached, including who has influence and the mechanisms by which information and preferences are integrated, has posed a fundamental challenge. Here, we provide a methodological framework for studying influence and leadership in groups. We propose that individuals have influence if their actions result in some behavioural change among their group-mates, and are leaders if they consistently influence others. We highlight three components of influence (influence instances, total influence and consistency of influence), which can be assessed at two levels (individual-to-individual and individual-to-group). We then review different methods, ranging from individual positioning within groups to information-theoretic approaches, by which influence has been operationally defined in empirical studies, as well as how such observations can be aggregated to give insight into the underlying decision-making process. We focus on the domain of collective movement, with a particular emphasis on methods that have recently been, or are being, developed to take advantage of simultaneous tracking data. We aim to provide a resource bringing together methodological tools currently available for studying leadership in moving animal groups, as well as to discuss the limitations of current methodologies and suggest productive avenues for future research.

Early influential treatments focused on primitive mimicry. Later accounts emphasized (a) social comparison, whereby people compare their feelings with compatriots’, (b) emotional interpretation, where others’ expressive displays serve as information, and (c) empathy, or imagining another person’s feelings. This paper introduces affective process theory (APT), which unifies these mechanisms and identifies others. Using a rule-governed theoretical process, APT reveals 10 distinct mechanisms that connect people’s affective states, which fall into three types. Convergent linkage occurs when individuals share the same vantage point and interpretations of emotionally evocative stimuli. Divergent linkage occurs with a shared vantage point but different interpretations. Complementary linkage occurs when the other person is itself the stimulus. APT integrates past findings on moderating factors such as social closeness and cooperation.

Yet customer and employee emotions could be mutually influential. To understand emotional exchanges in service encounters and their influences on customer outcomes, the current study models the interplay of emotional contagion and emotional labor, as well as their influence on customer satisfaction. Employees might catch customers’ emotions and transmit those emotions back to customers through emotional contagion, and employee emotional labor likely influences this cycle by modifying the extent to which emotional contagion occurs. Data from 268 customer-employee dyads, gathered from a large chain of foot massage parlors, confirm the existence of an emotion cycle. Deep acting, as one type of emotional labor used by employees, hinders the transmission of negative emotions to customers, whereas surface acting facilitates it. Both customer emotions and employee emotional labor thus have critical influences on service encounters. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the potential influence of customer preservice emotions and the presence of an emotion cycle during service delivery.","[{'authorId': '46521898', 'name': 'Xiao‐Yu Liu'}, {'authorId': '47047482', 'name': 'Nai‐Wen Chi'}, {'authorId': '51980483', 'name': 'Dwayne D.

Given high levels of turnover and absenteeism in the industry this article examines the emotional demands (emotional labour) of call centre work and their relationship to the job satisfaction and emotional exhaustion in a sample of South Australian call centre workers (N = 98) within the theoretical frameworks of the job demand – control model, the effort – reward imbalance model, and the job demands – resources model. Qualitatively the research confirmed the central role of emotional labour variables in the experience of emotional exhaustion and satisfaction at work. Specifically the research confirmed the pre-eminence of emotional dissonance compared to a range of emotional demand variables in its potency to account for variance in emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction. Specifically, emotional dissonance mediated the effect of emotional labour (positive emotions) on emotional exhaustion. Furthermore emotional dissonance was found to be equal in its capacity to explain variance in the outcomes compared to the most frequently researched demand measure in the work stress literature (psychosocial demands). Finally, emotional dissonance was found to exacerbate the level of emotional exhaustion at high levels of psychosocial demands, indicating jobs combining high levels of both kinds of demands are much more risky. Future theorizing about work stress needs to account for emotional demands, dissonance in particular. Potential ways to alleviate emotional exhaustion due to emotional dissonance is to reduce other psychosocial demands, increase rewards, support and control as conceptualized in the JDR model. Ways to boost job satisfaction are to increase control, support, and rewards.","[{'authorId': '4440323', 'name': 'Kerry A. Lewig'}, {'authorId': '3245175', 'name': 'M.

Broadly speaking, four related factors contribute to this variability: (1) genetic processes, (2) environmental events, (3) gene × environment interactions, and (4) developmental factors. Given the complexity of the relevant processes, it appears unlikely that autism spectrum atypicalities can be attributed to any one causal mechanism. Rather, the development of neural atypicality reflects an interaction of genetic and environmental risk factors. As the individual grows, changes in neural atypicality, consequent variation in behavior, and environmental response to that behavior may become linked in a positive feedback loop that amplifies deviations from the typical developmental pattern.

Recently, motivated by the design of viral marketing strategies, Domingos and Richardson posed a fundamental algorithmic problem for such social network processes: if we can try to convince a subset of individuals to adopt a new product or innovation, and the goal is to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions, which set of individuals should we target?We consider this problem in several of the most widely studied models in social network analysis. The optimization problem of selecting the most influential nodes is NP-hard here, and we provide the first provable approximation guarantees for efficient algorithms. Using an analysis framework based on submodular functions, we show that a natural greedy strategy obtains a solution that is provably within 63% of optimal for several classes of models; our framework suggests a general approach for reasoning about the performance guarantees of algorithms for these types of influence problems in social networks.We also provide computational experiments on large collaboration networks, showing that in addition to their provable guarantees, our approximation algorithms significantly out-perform node-selection heuristics based on the well-studied notions of degree centrality and distance centrality from the field of social networks.","[{'authorId': '1765196', 'name': 'D.

Prevalence estimates are presented for the age groups proposed by DSM‐5 workgroups as the most useful to consider for policy planning purposes. The LMR/12‐month prevalence estimates ranked by frequency are as follows: major depressive episode: 29.9%/8.6%; specific phobia: 18.4/12.1%; social phobia: 13.0/7.4%; post‐traumatic stress disorder: 10.1/3.7%; generalized anxiety disorder: 9.0/2.0%; separation anxiety disorder: 8.7/1.2%; panic disorder: 6.8%/2.4%; bipolar disorder: 4.1/1.8%; agoraphobia: 3.7/1.7%; obsessive‐compulsive disorder: 2.7/1.2. Four broad patterns of results are most noteworthy: first, that the most common (lifetime prevalence/morbid risk) lifetime anxiety‐mood disorders in the United States are major depression (16.6/29.9%), specific phobia (15.6/18.4%), and social phobia (10.7/13.0%) and the least common are agoraphobia (2.5/3.7%) and obsessive‐compulsive disorder (2.3/2.7%); second, that the anxiety‐mood disorders with the earlier median ages‐of‐onset are phobias and separation anxiety disorder (ages 15–17) and those with the latest are panic disorder, major depression, and generalized anxiety disorder (ages 23–30); third, that LMR is considerably higher than lifetime prevalence for most anxiety‐mood disorders, although the magnitude of this difference is much higher for disorders with later than earlier ages‐of‐onset; and fourth, that the ratio of 12‐month to lifetime prevalence, roughly characterizing persistence, varies meaningfully in ways consistent with independent evidence about differential persistence of these disorders.

However, little is known about the content, prevalence, and function of visual imagery during music listening. To that end, an online survey was constructed to explore music-related visual imagery. This included 24 statements about visual imagery based on previous research and an open question regarding the content of their inner images. Several standardized questionnaires (Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire and Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index) were included as well to investigate the link to visual imagery in non-musical contexts and across individuals with various levels of musical training. In total, 669 participants provided responses to an online survey. A factorial structure of music and visual imagery statements provided a three-factor structure consisting of vivid, soothing, and disruptive visual imagery, although the actual factor structure was nonidentical between the musically trained and untrained respondents. Separate analyses of factors for musically trained and untrained participants yielded a more parsimonious structure of visual imagery, which consisted of vivid and soothing visual imagery. These two factors consistently exhibited different weights across the items; for musically trained participants, vivid imagery was more related to modulating arousal than for untrained participants. The ability to conjure up vivid visual imagery was only weakly related to the presence of music-related visual imagery. A content analysis of the open question revealed common themes that related to a mixture of concrete visual imagery (landscapes, images of people, and scenes from past events) and abstract visual imagery (shapes, objects, and colors). Implications of these findings for further studies on music-induced emotions are discussed with a focus on a recent constructionist account of emotional meanings in music.","[{'authorId': '2066743', 'name': 'M.

To this end, a behaviour‐based modelling framework is first introduced to model the process of how humans select and execute a proactive steering strategy in crowded situations and execute the corresponding behaviour accordingly. We then propose behaviour models for two inter‐related proactive steering behaviours, namely gap seeking and following. These behaviours can be frequently observed in real‐life scenarios, and they can easily affect overall crowd dynamics. We validate our work by evaluating the simulation results of our model with the real‐world data and comparing the performance of our model with that of two state‐of‐the‐art crowd models.

148791e301d437919292cb842542d55d17828f35,"BACKGROUND PERSPECTIVES A variety of literature relates to instructor effectiveness (Clarke et al. 2001; Conant et al. 1988, Hill and Herche 2001; Kelley et al. 1991; Smart et al. 1999; and Weaver 1985). Much of it focuses on the opinions of both parties to the learning exchange-students and instructors. While there is considerable agreement between these parties as to what constitutes a good instructor, Gruenwald and Ackerman (1986) note that there are also important areas of disagreement. For example, they observed that while instructors rated ""knowledge of the subject"" as the most important factor in education, students considered ""communication skills"" to be most relevant. In an interesting study, Faranda and Clarke (2004) used in-depth interviews to allow students to express in their own words the attributes they considered to be most critical to a good instructor. Five themes became apparent: rapport, delivery, fairness, knowledge and credibility, and organization. Of these themes, rapport and delivery were considered to be of particular interest. Rapport was described as the ability to build relationships based on mutual trust and harmony. Students expressed a desire to build such relationships with their instructors. They were interested in the personal experiences of instructors and wanted to know who instructors were so that they might feel more comfortable opening up to them. Delivery was described as the manner in which instructors present and convey class-content materials. Students were especially concerned with things like enthusiasm, high-energy levels, positive attitudes, and passions for the subject matter. Interestingly, students accepted the lecture format as long as it was supplemented by some variation. Powerpoint was an acceptable delivery method but not if instructors only read from slides. Also, students valued communication that was not simply student-instructor oriented but also included student-to-student communication. EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTORS COMMUNICATE Delivery is a critical consideration and effective instructors can be expected to have at least one thing in common: They are good communicators with students. What is necessary to communicate well with others? For communication to occur between two individuals, a sharing of meaning must exist between the sender and the receiver. However, some instructors have a misguided understanding about what constitutes communication. They view it as a process with certain steps that need to be completed. Usually, the steps include having an idea, putting the idea into the form of a message, sending the message, and having the message received. Unfortunately, going through these steps does not guarantee that communication has occurred. When instructors view communication simply as a process, they are lulled into thinking that they have automatically achieved high levels of communication with students as a result of presenting in-class lectures. However, for effective communication to have occurred, there needs to be sharing of meaning. It is incorrect to conclude that sharing of meaning has occurred just because the communication process of sending and receiving has been completed. This concept can be demonstrated by asking students to think of an example of miscommunication that they have experienced with another person. If a student feels embarrassed or uncomfortable using an example from his or her personal life, the student can identify an example he or she has heard about or observed in others. Although the request could be in the form of a written assignment, it is best to ask for volunteers from class who are willing to speak up and share their examples of miscommunication with others. This approach quickly gets students involved and captures their attention. Furthermore, it helps students appreciate the fact that, although a message has been sent and received, there can be inadequate sharing of meaning. …","[{'authorId': '98435612', 'name': 'Stephen E.

The greatest difficulty is then to select LODs to progressively simplify simulation in an imperceptible but efficient manner. The main objective of this work is to experimentally evaluate spectators' ability to detect the presence of collisions in simulations. Factors related to the conditions of observation and simulation are studied, such as the camera angles, distance to camera, level of interpenetration or crowd density. Our main contribution is to provide a LOD selection function resulting from two perceptual studies allowing crowd system designers to scale a simulation by relaxing the collision avoidance constraint in a least perceptible manner. The relaxation of this constraint is an important source for computational resources savings.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to model heterogeneous traffic behaviors by adapting a well‐established personality trait model (i.e., Eysenck's PEN (psychoticism, extraversion and neuroticism) model) into widely used traffic simulation approaches. First, we collected a large amount of user feedback while users watch a variety of computer‐generated traffic simulation video clips. Then, we trained regression models to bridge low‐level traffic simulation parameters and high‐level perceived traffic behaviors (i.e., adjectives according to the PEN model and the three PEN traits). We also conducted an additional user study to validate the effectiveness and usefulness of our approach, in particular, high correlation coefficients and the Pearson values between users’ feedback and our model predictions prove the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, our approach can also produce interesting emergent traffic patterns including faster‐is‐slower effect and sticking‐in‐a‐pin‐wherever‐there‐is‐room effect.

But is this true of other high-level image features as well? We here investigate the extent to which natural scenes containing faces, text elements, and cell phones-as a suitable control-attract attention by tracking the eye movements of subjects in two types of tasks-free viewing and search. We observed that subjects in free-viewing conditions look at faces and text 16.6 and 11.1 times more than similar regions normalized for size and position of the face and text. In terms of attracting gaze, text is almost as effective as faces. Furthermore, it is difficult to avoid looking at faces and text even when doing so imposes a cost. We also found that subjects took longer in making their initial saccade when they were told to avoid faces/text and their saccades landed on a non-face/non-text object. We refine a well-known bottom-up computer model of saliency-driven attention that includes conspicuity maps for color, orientation, and intensity by adding high-level semantic information (i.e., the location of faces or text) and demonstrate that this significantly improves the ability to predict eye fixations in natural images. Our enhanced model's predictions yield an area under the ROC curve over 84% for images that contain faces or text when compared against the actual fixation pattern of subjects. This suggests that the primate visual system allocates attention using such an enhanced saliency map.","[{'authorId': '38497468', 'name': 'Moran Cerf'}, {'authorId': '2356306', 'name': 'E. P.

This study directly tested this proposal by asking participants to recognize dynamic facial expressions of emotion (fear, happiness, or anger in Experiment 1; fear, happiness, anger, or neutral in Experiment 2) in a target face presented at the center of a screen while a contextual face, which appeared simultaneously in the periphery of the screen, expressed an emotion (fear, happiness, anger) or not (neutral) and either looked at the target face or not. We manipulated gaze direction to be able to distinguish between a mere contextual effect (gaze away from both the target face and the participant) and a specific social appraisal effect (gaze toward the target face). Results of both experiments provided evidence for a social appraisal effect in emotion recognition, which differed from the mere effect of contextual information: Whereas facial expressions were identical in both conditions, the direction of the gaze of the contextual face influenced emotion recognition. Social appraisal facilitated the recognition of anger, happiness, and fear when the contextual face expressed the same emotion. This facilitation was stronger than the mere contextual effect. Social appraisal also allowed better recognition of fear when the contextual face expressed anger and better recognition of anger when the contextual face expressed fear.","[{'authorId': '7464625', 'name': 'C.

Here, we systematically explore this compelling phenomenon in a population of young adults. We utilize multiple levels of analysis, comprising phenomenological, behavioral, and computational techniques. Specifically, we show (a) that the concept of the groove is widely appreciated and understood in terms of a pleasurable drive toward action, (b) that a broad range of musical excerpts can be appraised reliably for the degree of perceived groove, (c) that the degree of experienced groove is inversely related to experienced difficulty of bimanual sensorimotor coupling under tapping regimes with varying levels of expressive constraint, (d) that high-groove stimuli elicit spontaneous rhythmic movements, and (e) that quantifiable measures of the quality of sensorimotor coupling predict the degree of experienced groove. Our results complement traditional discourse regarding the groove, which has tended to take the psychological phenomenon for granted and has focused instead on the musical and especially the rhythmic qualities of particular genres of music that lead to the perception of groove. We conclude that groove can be treated as a psychological construct and model system that allows for experimental exploration of the relationship between sensorimotor coupling with music and emotion.","[{'authorId': '7471315', 'name': 'P.

Using the Mullen Scale of Early Learning, cognitive function in each subgroup was assessed. The authors then analyzed the subscores of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule in children with autism. Children with autism showed significantly more global cognitive impairment than those without autism.

For the first time at such a large scale, we study individual node arrival and edge creation processes that collectively lead to macroscopic properties of networks. Using a methodology based on the maximum-likelihood principle, we investigate a wide variety of network formation strategies, and show that edge locality plays a critical role in evolution of networks. Our findings supplement earlier network models based on the inherently non-local preferential attachment.
 Based on our observations, we develop a complete model of network evolution, where nodes arrive at a prespecified rate and select their lifetimes. Each node then independently initiates edges according to a ""gap"" process, selecting a destination for each edge according to a simple triangle-closing model free of any parameters. We show analytically that the combination of the gap distribution with the node lifetime leads to a power law out-degree distribution that accurately reflects the true network in all four cases. Finally, we give model parameter settings that allow automatic evolution and generation of realistic synthetic networks of arbitrary scale.","[{'authorId': '1702139', 'name': 'J.

In primates, yawning occurs within a group in a variety of social contexts, suggesting that it has a communicative role, a hypothesis examined in this study. Yawning has rarely been studied. Quantitative studies have been concerned only with age, sex and social-status differences in yawning f!-equency. The causation and function of yawning were examined in a quantitative, 796-h ethological analysis of observations of two groups of Cercocebus albigena and one group of Macaca fascicularis. In both species, yawns occurred in two main contexts: during transitions from rest to activity (the 'rest yawn') and following social interactions (the 'emotion yawn'). The rest yawn represents 90 % of yawns and is common to every age-sex group. By contrast, the emotion yawn (10 %) is more frequent in adult males. Regardless of context, yawning was more frequent in males than females. Within males yawning frequency increased with age. Thus, sex hormones may modulate the physiologie al processes involved. Yawns were usually performed by individuals in seated, lying or standing positions. Yawns were frequently followed by short periods of rest, so that, when triggered by a social interaction, they occurred at its end. The morphology of the yawning act did not vary in regard to context age and / or sex of the yawner.","[{'authorId': '6139423', 'name': 'B.

This was tested by requiring subjects to choose either a positive or negative trait, matched for polarity, as being more neutral. Contrary to the hypothesis, both sexes consistently chose positive traits. The results supported the concept of a “negativity bias”: viz., that negative traits have more impact than positive traits that are matched for extremeness. This negativity bias was further supported by a second study in which subjects reported greater differences in evaluation between negative traits than between positive ones. The amount of difference increased with greater degrees of polarization of the traits being judged. The results were interpreted as indicating that the negative half of bipolar scales covers a greater range of differences in evaluation than does the positive half of such scales.","[{'authorId': '1696781', 'name': 'J.

Simulating others' actions implies a mirroring of their activities, based on one's own sensorimotor competencies. Here, we discuss theoretical and experimental approaches to action simulation and the study of its representational underpinnings. One focus of our discussion is on the timing of internal simulation and its relation to the timing of external action, and a paradigm that requires participants to predict the future course of actions that are temporarily occluded from view. We address transitions between perceptual mechanisms (referring to action representation before and after occlusion) and simulation mechanisms (referring to action representation during occlusion). Findings suggest that action simulation runs in real-time; acting on newly created action representations rather than relying on continuous visual extrapolations. A further focus of our discussion pertains to the functional characteristics of the mechanisms involved in predicting other people's actions. We propose that two processes are engaged, dynamic updating and static matching, which may draw on both semantic and motor information. In a concluding section, we discuss these findings in the context of broader theoretical issues related to action and event representation, arguing that a detailed functional analysis of action simulation in cognitive, neural, and computational terms may help to further advance our understanding of action cognition and motor control.","[{'authorId': '33600638', 'name': 'A.

Consistent with aspects of imitation theory and deterrence theory, users imitated examples of behavior that they saw, and more so for behaviors from high status users.

Low doses of opiates were capable of profoundly reducing crying as well as the motor agitation they exhibit during brief periods of social isolation.

Researchers are interested in looking for protective factors within the GAM to diminish aggression. Previous studies have found two relevant variables acting independently as risk and protective factors: emotional intelligence (EI) and negative affect (NA). The aim of the present study is to analyze a moderated mediation model including these variables as an explanation of aggressive behavior and integrate it within the GAM. Four hundred and six participants were assessed on EI, NA, and aggression. The moderated mediation analysis showed a significant negative indirect effect of the perceiving EI branch on total aggression mediated through NA levels, which, in turn, was moderated by the managing EI branch. Moreover, this relationship was also observed for the physical, anger, and hostility sub-scales of aggression. Our study demonstrates the importance of having a high ability to perceive emotions as a protective factor in the first stage of the GAM. These individuals will present lower NA in the second stage of the model, resulting in a reduction in aggression. Moreover, having a high ability to perceive emotions is particularly relevant for individuals that are less able to manage emotions, given that those participants with higher scores on the managing EI branch can reduce their aggressive behavior by mitigating the effect of NA on aggression in the third stage of the GAM.","[{'authorId': '1404542133', 'name': 'M.

Drawing on the framework of activation-inhibition regulatory systems and regulatory fit, we propose (a) that deep acting represents an activation-oriented regulation strategy and surface acting, an inhibition-oriented regulation strategy; (b) that these strategies have separate pathways to desirable performance (i.e., affective delivery) and counterproductive performance (i.e., service sabotage), respectively; and (c) that performance is optimized when momentary regulation strategies are aligned with activation- and inhibition-oriented traits. Empirically, across two studies, we employ a multilevel approach (i.e., within- and between-person), a multisource approach (i.e., self, coworker, customer), and a multicontext approach (i.e., banks and restaurants) to test regulatory fit as applied to emotional labor. In two studies, we support separate activation and inhibition pathways, plus regulatory fit, in that deep acting is beneficial to affective delivery for those higher in two activation traits—namely, extraversion and openness—and that surface acting predicts service sabotage for those lower in an inhibition trait: conscientiousness. We empirically rule out mood as the explanation for these effects, propose future research to apply regulatory fit to other outcomes and contexts, and suggest practical implications for services.","[{'authorId': '47047482', 'name': 'Nai‐Wen Chi'}, {'authorId': '5248218', 'name': 'Alicia A.

The authors argue for the existence of the negativity bias in early development and that it is evident especially in research on infant social referencing but also in other developmental domains. They discuss ontogenetic mechanisms underlying the emergence of this bias and explore not only its evolutionary but also its developmental functions and consequences.

To address this question, shock-experienced Observer rats repeatedly witnessed familiar Demonstrators receive painful footshocks (six sessions). Results confirm that Observers freeze during the first testing session. The occurrence of this behaviour however gradually diminished as the experimental sessions progressed, reaching minimal freezing levels by the end of the experiments. In contrast, the appearance and continuous increase in the frequency of yawning, a behavior that was inhibited by metyrapone (i.e,. a glucocorticoid synthesis blocker), might represent an alternative coping strategy, suggesting that the observer’s reduced freezing does not necessarily indicate a disappearance in the affective response to the Demonstrator’s distress.","[{'authorId': '2059797316', 'name': 'M.

If multiple null hypotheses are tested simultaneously, the probability of rejecting erroneously at least one of them increases beyond the pre‐specified significance level. Simultaneous inference procedures have to be used which adjust for multiplicity and thus control the overall type I error rate. In this paper we describe simultaneous inference procedures in general parametric models, where the experimental questions are specified through a linear combination of elemental model parameters. The framework described here is quite general and extends the canonical theory of multiple comparison procedures in ANOVA models to linear regression problems, generalized linear models, linear mixed effects models, the Cox model, robust linear models, etc. Several examples using a variety of different statistical models illustrate the breadth of the results.

The current study introduces a novel simulation approach termed memory-based motion simulation (MBMS), and presents its key element ""motion modification"" (MoM) algorithm. The proposed approach implements a computational model inspired by the generalized motor program (GMP) theory. Operationally, when a novel motion scenario is submitted to the MBMS system, its motion database is searched to find relevant existing motions. The selected motions, referred to as ""root motions"", most likely do not meet exactly the novel motion scenario, and therefore, they need to be modified by the MoM algorithm. This algorithm derives a parametric representation of possible variants of a root motion in a GMP-like manner, and adjusts the parameter values such that the new modified motion satisfies the novel motion scenario, while retaining the root motion's overall angular movement pattern and inter-joint coordination. An evaluation of the prediction capability of the algorithm, using both seated upper body reaching and whole-body load-transfer motions, indicated that the algorithm can accurately predict various human motions with errors comparable to the inherent variability in human motions when repeated under identical task conditions.","[{'authorId': '8034229', 'name': 'W.

The aim of the present study was to establish the convergent and discriminant validity of these 4 subscales. Hypothesized relationships among the IRI subscales between the subscales and measures of other psychological constructs (social functioning self-esteem emotionality and sensitivity to others) and between the subscales and extant empathy measures were examined. Study subjects included 677 male and 667 female students enrolled in undergraduate psychology classes at the University of Texas. The IRI scales not only exhibited the predicted relationships among themselves but also were related in the expected manner to other measures. Higher PT scores were consistently associated with better social functioning and higher self-esteem; in contrast Fantasy scores were unrelated to these 2 characteristics. High EC scores were positively associated with shyness and anxiety but negatively linked to egotism. The most substantial relationships in the study involved the PD scale. PD scores were strongly linked with low self-esteem and poor interpersonal functioning as well as a constellation of vulnerability uncertainty and fearfulness. These findings support a multidimensional approach to empathy by providing evidence that the 4 qualities tapped by the IRI are indeed separate constructs each related in specific ways to other psychological measures.,"[{'authorId': '47994338', 'name': 'Mark H.

17e68a57f12a3e2db6b67aa3b48ecfcaf82d276b,"BACKGROUND
In most individuals, injury results in activation of peripheral nociceptors (pain-sensing neurons of the peripheral nervous system) and amplification of central nervous system (CNS) pain pathways that serve as a disincentive to continue harmful behaviour; however, this may not be the case in some developmental disorders that cause intellectual disability (ID). Moreover, individuals affected by ID disorders may initiate self-injurious behaviour to address irritating or painful sensations. In normal individuals, a negative feedback loop decreases sensation of pain, which involves descending inhibitory neurons in the CNS that attenuate spinal nociceptive processing. If spinal nociceptive signalling is impaired in these developmental disorders, an exaggerated painful stimulus may be required in order to engage descending anti-nociceptive signals.


METHODS
Using electronic databases, we conducted a review of publications regarding the incidence of chronic pain or altered pain sensation in ID patients or corresponding preclinical models.


RESULTS
There is a body of evidence indicating that individuals with fragile X mental retardation and/or Rett syndrome have altered pain sensation. These findings in humans are supported by mechanistic studies using genetically modified mice harbouring mutations consistent with the human disease. Thus, once self-injurious behaviour is initiated, the signal to stop may be missing. Several developmental disorders that cause ID are associated with increased incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can cause severe visceral pain. Individuals affected by these disorders who also have GERD may self-injure as a mechanism to engage descending inhibitory circuits to quell visceral pain. In keeping with this hypothesis, pharmacological treatment of GERD has been shown to be effective for reducing self-injurious behaviour in some patients. Hence, multiple lines of evidence suggest aberrant nociceptive processing in developmental disorders that cause ID.


CONCLUSIONS
There is evidence that pain pathways and pain amplification mechanisms are altered in several preclinical models of developmental disorders that cause ID. We present hypotheses regarding how impaired pain pathways or chronic pain might contribute to self-injurious behaviour. Studies evaluating the relationship between pain and self-injurious behaviour will provide better understanding of the mechanisms underlying self-injurious behaviour in the ID population and may lead to more effective treatments.","[{'authorId': '40380308', 'name': 'K.

Information about intentions, however, may be conveyed also by the grasping action itself: for instance, people typically drink by grasping the handle of a cup with a precision grip. In this fMRI experiment, subjects watched precision grips and whole-hand prehensions embedded in a drinking or an eating context. Indeed, in the right inferior frontal mirror neuron area there was higher activity for observed precision grips in the drinking context. Signal changes in the right inferior frontal mirror neuron area were also significantly correlated with scores on Empathic Concern subscale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, a measure of emotional empathy. These data suggest that human mirror neuron areas use both contextual and grasping type information to predict the intentions of others. They also suggest that mirror neuron activity is strongly linked to social competence.","[{'authorId': '2253951', 'name': 'J. Kaplan'}, {'authorId': '1770382', 'name': 'M.

Knowing that completing his or her set would earn 15 MSdrls was an effective incentive in promoting set completion, which each S eventually achieved. Every group individually received only 1 of 4 background sound treatments, with 5 groups ultimately receiving the same treatment. These treatment conditions were: ( a ) art music, characterized by sudden changes in density, volume, timbre, and tempo; ( b ) mood music, in which sonorious variation was at a minimum; ( c ) a recorded, spontaneous reading by 3 adults from different psychology textbooks (n-music control); ( d ) no background sound (no-sound control). All Ss were run under neatly identical conditions of lighting, apparatus arrangement, and extraneous stimuli input. Half the Ss participated after school at a psychology clinic; the other half, at school during the school day. Cooperative behaviors, i.e., S's verbal and physical actions directed toward completing the group task while giving and/or receiving assistance from other Ss, and noncooperative behaviors, i.e., lack of cooperative behavior, were independently assessed by three trained raters. Using time-sampling observation, raters carefully observed S's actions for 5 sec., and for che succeeding 5 sec., checked cooperative and/or noncooperative subcategories into which S's behavior fell, at the time of observation, on prepared rating forms. Using an exact tally matching criterion of subcategory recordings of the rater per observation produced an interrater reliability coefficient of .72, while .87 was obtained for agreement on cooperative and noncooperative assessment per observation. Results were in line with predicted group differences, though not statistically significant ( p z .20). Noncooperative behaviors tended to be greater under conditions of no recorded sound and adults' reading aloud (5-group totals of 39.58 and 35.39 noncooperative responses per minute, respectively), and reduced under art and mood music (5-group totals of 33.71 and 31.38 noncooperative responses per minute, respectively). Also, more noncooperative and fewer cooperative behaviors were noted when playing art than mood music. Participation after school at the clinic and during school hours at school did not influence children's behavior. Suggestions for future studies include revision of the raring form, allowing Ss to choose from alternative reinforcements before beginning the cooperative task, and increasing the task's complexiry to focus on concentration as a function of sound input. Research could investigate music's effect on cooperative responding as a function of S's current level of intellectual functioning, combined social reinforcement and introversion-extroversion tendencies, and gross and fine visual-motor coordination.","[{'authorId': '113131872', 'name': 'S.

The first examined (1) students' feelings of confirmation or disconfirmation as a function of perceived teacher behaviors, and (2) whether teacher confirmation behaviors occur in hierarchically arranged clusters. Sixty-one percent of the variance in students' feelings of confirmation was attributable to perceived teacher confirmation behavior. A discernible hierarchy of confirmation behaviors failed to emerge. The second study focused on how teacher confirmation operates in instruction to influence students' receiver apprehension and, ultimately, their motivation, affective learning, and cognitive learning. Half of the variance in students' receiver apprehension was attributable to teacher confirmation. A learning model comprised of teacher confirmation, receiver apprehension, motivation, affective learning, and cognitive learning was tested. Structural equation modeling revealed that teacher confirmation directly influenced receiver apprehension. The influence of teacher confirmation on motivation, affective learning, and cognitive learning was indirect, mediated through receiver apprehension.","[{'authorId': '115121704', 'name': 'Kathleen Ellis'}]",160.0,,65.0,"The impact of perceived teacher confirmation on receiver apprehension, motivation, and learning",2004.0

18ccd16aab5df5cad41f7f5e5a136d3cbde5b768,"Prosocial behavior covers the broad range of actions intended to benefit one or more people other than oneself—actions such as helping, comforting, sharing, and cooperation. Altruism is motivation to increase another person's welfare; it is contrasted to egoism, the motivation to increase one's own welfare. There is no one-to-one correspondence between prosocial behavior and altruism. Prosocial behavior need not be motivated by altruism; altruistic motivation need not produce prosocial behavior. Over the past 30 years, the practical concern to promote prosocial behavior has led to both a variance-accounted-for empirical approach, which focuses on identifying situational and dispositional determinants of helping, and the application of existing psychological theories. Theories invoked to explain prosocial behavior include social learning, tension reduction, norm, exchange or equity, attribution, esteem-enhancement, and moral reasoning theories. In addition, new theoretical perspectives have been developed by researchers focused on anomalous aspects of why people do—and don't—act prosocially. Their research has raised the possibility of a multiplicity of social motives—altruism, collectivism, and principlism, as well as egoism. It has also raised questions—as yet unanswered—about how these motives might be most effectively orchestrated to increase prosocial behavior.

Computer simulations allow one to understand interactions of physical particles and make sense of astronomical observations, to describe many chemical properties ab initio, and to design energy-efficient aircrafts and safer cars. Today, the use of computational devices is pervasive. Offices, administrations, financial trading, economic exchange, the control of infrastructure networks, and a large share of our communication would not be conceivable without the use of computers anymore. Hence, it would be very surprising, if computers could not make a contribution to a better understanding of social and economic systems. While relevant also for the statistical analysis of data and data-driven efforts to reveal patterns of human interaction, we will focus here on the prospects of computer simulation of social and economic systems. More specifically, we will discuss the techniques of agent-based modeling (ABM) and multi-agent simulation (MAS), including the challenges, perspectives and limitations of the approach. In doing so, we will discuss a number of issues, which have not been covered by the excellent books and review papers available so far . In particular, we will describe the different steps belonging to a thorough agent-based simulation study, and try to explain, how to do them right from a scientific perspective. To some extent, computer simulation can be seen as experimental technique for hypothesis testing and scenario analysis, which can be used complementary and in combination with experiments in real-life, the lab or the Web.","[{'authorId': '1768825', 'name': 'D.

A particularly critical question in understanding the mechanisms behind such interactions is to detect and classify leader-follower relationships within the group. In the technical literature of coupled dynamical systems, several methods have been proposed to reconstruct interaction networks, including linear correlation analysis, transfer entropy, and event synchronization. While these analyses have been helpful in reconstructing network models from neuroscience to public health, rules on the most appropriate method to use for a specific dataset are lacking. Here, we demonstrate the possibility of detecting leaders in a group from raw positional data in a model-free approach that combines multiple methods in a maximum likelihood sense. We test our framework on synthetic data of groups of self-propelled Vicsek particles, where a single agent acts as a leader and both the size of the interaction region and the level of inherent noise are systematically varied. To assess the feasibility of detecting leaders in real-world applications, we study a synthetic dataset of fish shoaling, generated by using a recent data-driven model for social behavior, and an experimental dataset of pharmacologically-treated zebrafish. Not only does our approach offer a robust strategy to detect leaders in synthetic data, but it also allows for exploring the role of psychoactive compounds on leader-follower relationships.","[{'authorId': '2726694', 'name': 'Violet Mwaffo'}, {'authorId': '3245894', 'name': 'S.

This assay is able to identify deficits in social behavior of known “autistic-like” mouse strains. Using the test, we revealed a major difference in social behavior between inbred and outbred strains, with only the latter behaving similar to wild mice. Existing assays of social interaction are suboptimal, and none measures propinquity, the tendency of rodents to maintain close physical proximity. These assays are ubiquitously performed using inbred mouse strains and mutations placed on inbred genetic backgrounds. We developed the automatable tube cooccupancy test (TCOT) based on propinquity, the tendency of freely mobile rodents to maintain close physical proximity, and assessed TCOT behavior on a variety of genotypes and social and environmental conditions. In outbred mice and rats, familiarity determined willingness to cooccupy the tube, with siblings and/or cagemates of both sexes exhibiting higher cooccupancy behavior than strangers. Subsequent testing using multiple genotypes revealed that inbred strain siblings do not cooccupy at higher rates than strangers, in marked contrast to both outbred and rederived wild mice. Mutant mouse strains with “autistic-like” phenotypes (Fmr1−/y and Eif4e Ser209Ala) displayed significantly decreased cooccupancy.","[{'authorId': '10144871', 'name': 'A. H.

This commitment, in turn, prompts more OCBs and higher job performance.

For more realistic multi-agent systems in simulations of emergency evacuations, it is important to incorporate emotions and their effects on the agents. In few words, emotional contagion is a process in which a person or group influences the emotions or behavior of another person or group through the conscious or unconscious induction of emotion states and behavioral attitudes. In this study, we simulate an emergency situation in an open square area with three exits considering Adults and Children agents with different behavior. Also, Security agents are considered in order to guide Adults and Children for finding the exits and be calm. Six levels of emotion levels are considered for each agent in different scenarios and situations. The agent-based simulated model initialize with the random scattering of agent populations and then when an alarm occurs, each agent react to the situation based on its and neighbors current circumstances. The main goal of each agent is firstly to find the exit, and then help other agents to find their ways. Numbers of exited agents along with their emotion levels and damaged agents are compared in different scenarios with different initialization in order to evaluate the achieved results of the simulated model.

1a1163bebf1b6f5feb30bd973b86684617b2f670,"How emotions are represented in the nervous system is a crucial unsolved problem in the affective neuroscience. Many studies are striving to find the localization of basic emotions in the brain but failed. Thus, many psychologists suspect the specific neural loci for basic emotions, but instead, some proposed that there are specific neural structures for the core affects, such as arousal and hedonic value. The reason for this widespread difference might be that basic emotions used previously can be further divided into more “basic” emotions. Here we review brain imaging data and neuropsychological data, and try to address this question with an integrative model. In this model, we argue that basic emotions are not contrary to the dimensional studies of emotions (core affects). We propose that basic emotion should locate on the axis in the dimensions of emotion, and only represent one typical core affect (arousal or valence). Therefore, we propose four basic emotions: joy-on positive axis of hedonic dimension, sadness-on negative axis of hedonic dimension, fear, and anger-on the top of vertical dimensions. This new model about basic emotions and construction model of emotions is promising to improve and reformulate neurobiological models of basic emotions.","[{'authorId': '5628909', 'name': 'Simeng Gu'}, {'authorId': '2629633', 'name': 'Fushun Wang'}, {'authorId': '2064669278', 'name': 'Caiyun Cao'}, {'authorId': '1920475', 'name': 'E.

The calls were recorded from familiar birds with either low (non–partners) or high levels of affiliation (partners). The subjects’ response was scored using four behavioural parameters: the time spent near the loudspeaker, the amount of movements, the number of calls emitted, and the position of the crest. Across all variables, birds were more attentive and active when confronted to distress calls compared to control sounds, particularly when the distress call was emitted from a partner rather than a non-partner. These results raise the possibility that distress calls do not only function as a stimulus-triggering automatic reaction in cockatiels but also transmit emotions. Moreover, affiliation enhanced emotional reactions to conspecific distress calls. Our data provides first insights into the mechanisms of emotional contagion in parrots.","[{'authorId': '1399181736', 'name': 'Agatha Liévin-Bazin'}, {'authorId': '79376951', 'name': 'Maxime Pineaux'}, {'authorId': '145335781', 'name': 'O.

Results show that WIF and FIW are consistently related to all 3 types of outcomes. Both types of interrole conflict showed stronger relationships to same-domain outcomes than to cross-domain outcomes. Thus, WIF was more strongly associated with work-related than with family-related outcomes, and FIW was more strongly associated with family-related than with work-related outcomes.

This metric uses a two-step process to quantify a simulator's ability to reproduce the collective behaviors of the whole system, as observed in the recorded real-world data. First, Bayesian inference is used to estimate the simulation states which best correspond to the observed data, then a maximum likelihood estimator is used to approximate the prediction errors. This process is iterated using the EM-algorithm to produce a robust, statistical estimate of the magnitude of the prediction error as measured by its entropy (smaller is better). This metric serves as a simulator-to-data similarity measurement. We evaluated the metric in terms of robustness to sensor noise, consistency across different datasets and simulation methods, and correlation to perceptual metrics.","[{'authorId': '35170565', 'name': 'S.

In this paper, we examine these areas and suggest that affect in groups, as well as specific mechanisms to regulate and maintain certain affective states in groups, have had important roles in promoting group survival over evolutionary history. Specifically, we suggest that affect in groups serves a coordination function, which can take one of two forms. First, affect in groups quickly provides information about the environment and group structure to other group members, thus coordinating group activity via a communication function. Second, shared affect in groups coordinates group activity through fostering group bonds and group loyalty. These two functions of affect in groups are closely related and mutually reinforcing.

Starting from a three-way classification of construals of the world––events, the attribution of responsibility for events, and objects––the authors propose a systematic account of emotion differentiation. Rejecting the oft-favored features of bodily feelings, emotion-related behaviors, and facial expressions as too intensity-dependent and insufficiently diagnostic, they provide a detailed analysis of emotion differentiation in terms of the cognitive underpinnings of emotion types. Using numerous examples, they explain how different variables influence emotion intensity, and show how emotions can be formalized for computational purposes. Now with a contributed chapter describing the OCC model's influence, this book will interest a wide audience in cognitive, clinical, and social psychology, as well as in artificial intelligence and affective computing, and other cognitive science disciplines.","[{'authorId': '1802934', 'name': 'A.

In humans, small numbers of VENs appear the 36 th week post conception, with numbers increasing during the first eight months after birth. There are significantly more VENs in the right hemisphere in postnatal brains; this may be related to asymmetries in the autonomic nervous system. VENs are also present in elephants and whales and may be a specialization related to very large brain size. The large size and simple dendritic structure of these projection neurons suggest that they rapidly send basic information from FI and LA to other parts of the brain, while slower neighboring pyramids send more detailed information. Selective destruction of VENs in early stages of fronto-temporal dementia implies that they are involved in empathy, social awareness, and self-control, consistent with evidence from functional imaging.","[{'authorId': '2100520', 'name': 'J.

Based on a series of hypothetical responses to a negative review, this study finds that inserting an empathy statement in response to the negative review improved the ratings of the response among a sample of university students. Likewise, this group of 176 potential customers rated the response more favorably when the response included a paraphrase of the complaint, thus making the response more personal and less generic. Interestingly, contrary to popular belief, our results indicate that the speed with which the hotel responds to an online complaint did not influence the survey participants’ rating of the response. The theoretical implications of these findings are that the online response should include same theoretical anchorings based on interactional justice and active listening that apply to face-to-face customer complaints. The major difference between an in-person complaint and an online review is that, in the review, the guest is not on premises waiting for a response, which changes the importance of the timing of a response and alters the perception of procedural justice, which supports the idea of a prompt response. This study further implies that hotel managers should include empathy or paraphrasing statements in their responses to online reviews.","[{'authorId': '116282730', 'name': 'H.

An important difference between social contagion and traditional infectious diseases, however, is that behavioral phenomena can be acquired by non-social mechanisms as well as through social transmission. We introduce a novel theoretical framework for studying these phenomena (the SISa model) by adapting a classic disease model to include the possibility for ‘automatic’ (or ‘spontaneous’) non-social infection. We provide an example of the use of this framework by examining the spread of obesity in the Framingham Heart Study Network. The interaction assumptions of the model are validated using longitudinal network transmission data. We find that the current rate of becoming obese is 2 per year and increases by 0.5 percentage points for each obese social contact. The rate of recovering from obesity is 4 per year, and does not depend on the number of non-obese contacts. The model predicts a long-term obesity prevalence of approximately 42, and can be used to evaluate the effect of different interventions on steady-state obesity. Model predictions quantitatively reproduce the actual historical time course for the prevalence of obesity. We find that since the 1970s, the rate of recovery from obesity has remained relatively constant, while the rates of both spontaneous infection and transmission have steadily increased over time. This suggests that the obesity epidemic may be driven by increasing rates of becoming obese, both spontaneously and transmissively, rather than by decreasing rates of losing weight. A key feature of the SISa model is its ability to characterize the relative importance of social transmission by quantitatively comparing rates of spontaneous versus contagious infection. It provides a theoretical framework for studying the interpersonal spread of any state that may also arise spontaneously, such as emotions, behaviors, health states, ideas or diseases with reservoirs.","[{'authorId': '3209818', 'name': 'A.

In addition, experimentally elicited suppression resulted in reduced interpersonal responsiveness during face-to-face interaction, along with negative partner-perceptions and hostile behavior. These deleterious effects were reduced when individuals with more Asian values suppressed, and these reductions were mediated by cultural differences in the responsiveness of the suppressors.

Bertozzi, J. Rosado, M. Short and L. Wang, Contagion shocks in one dimension, J. Stat. Phys. 158 (2014) 647–664]. In the continuum limit, the mesoscopic kinetic equation produces a natural Eulerian limit with nonlocal interactions. However, such limit ceases to be valid when the underlying microscopic particle characteristics cross, corresponding to the blow up of the solution in the Eulerian system. One method is to couple these two situations — using Eulerian dynamics for regions without characteristic crossing and kinetic evolution for regions with characteristic crossing. For such a hybrid setting, we provide a regime indicator based on the macroscopic density and fear level, and propose an interface condition via continuity to connect these two regimes. The other method is based on a level set formulation for the continuum system. The level set equation shares similar forms as the kinetic equation, and it successfully captures the multi-valued solution in velocity, which implies that the multi-valued solution other than the viscosity solution should be the physically relevant ones for the continuum system. Numerical examples are presented to show the efficiency of these new methods.","[{'authorId': '2152717287', 'name': 'Li Wang'}, {'authorId': '3261371', 'name': 'M.

This body of research reveals that automatic imitation is a covert form of imitation, distinct from spatial compatibility. It also indicates that, although automatic imitation is subject to input modulation by attentional processes, and output modulation by inhibitory processes, it is mediated by learned, long-term sensorimotor associations that cannot be altered directly by intentional processes. Automatic imitation provides an important tool for the investigation of the mirror neuron system, motor mimicry, and complex forms of imitation.

This trend has highlighted the need for a greater understanding of the impact of online reviews on consumer attitudes and behaviors. In view of this need, we investigate the influence of online hotel reviews on consumers' attributions of service quality and firms' ability to control service delivery. An experimental design was used to examine the effects of four independent variables: framing; valence; ratings; and target. The results suggest that in reviews evaluating a hotel, remarks related to core services are more likely to induce positive service quality attributions. Recent reviews affect customers' attributions of controllability for service delivery, with negative reviews exerting an unfavorable influence on consumers' perceptions. The findings highlight the importance of managing the core service and the need for managers to act promptly in addressing customer service problems.","[{'authorId': '47753287', 'name': 'Victoria Browning'}, {'authorId': '144630639', 'name': 'Kevin Kam Fung So'}, {'authorId': '103989372', 'name': 'B.

1de856d76e73660ab4637d6cd5cd8de444d0ff5c,"Pain can be socially transferred between familiar rats due to empathic responses. To validate rat model of empathy for pain, effects of pain expressions in a cagemate demonstrator (CD) in pain on empathic pain responses in a naïve cagemate observer (CO) after 30 min priming dyadic social interactions (PDSI) were evaluated. The CD rats were prepared with four pain models: bee venom (BV), formalin, complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), and spared nerve injury (SNI). Both BV and formalin tests are characterized by displayable and eye-identifiable spontaneous pain-related behaviors (SPRB) immediately after treatment, while CFA and SNI models are characterized by delayed occurrence of evoked pain hypersensitivity but with less eye-identifiable SPRB. After 30 min PDSI with a CD immediately after BV and formalin, respectively, the empathic mechanical pain hypersensitivity (EMPH) could be identified at both hind paws in CO rats. The BV—or formalin-induced EMPH in CO rats lasted for 4–5 h until full recovery. However, EMPH failed to develop in CO after socially interacting with a CD immediately after CFA, or 2 h after BV when SPRB completely disappeared. The CO's EMPH was partially relieved when socially interacting with an analgecized CD whose SPRB had been significantly suppressed. Moreover, repeated exposures to a CD in pain could enhance EMPH in CO. Finally, social transfer of pain hypersensitivity was also identified in CO who was being co-housed in pairs with a conspecific treated with CFA or SNI. The results suggest that development of EMPH in CO rats would be determined not only by extent of familiarity but also by visually identifiable pain expressions in the social partners during short period of PDSI. However, the visually unidentifiable pain can also be transferred to naïve cagemate when being co-housed in pairs with a distressed conspecific. In summary, the vicariously social contagion of pain between familiar rats is dependent upon not only expressions of pain in social partners but also the time that dyads spent in social communications. The rat model of empathy for pain is a highly stable, reproducible and valid model for studying the neural mechanisms of empathy in lower animals.","[{'authorId': '2109497113', 'name': 'Chun-Li Li'}, {'authorId': '2152845139', 'name': 'Yang Yu'}, {'authorId': '2055131048', 'name': 'Ting He'}, {'authorId': '48397638', 'name': 'Ruirui Wang'}, {'authorId': '6465216', 'name': 'Kai-Wen Geng'}, {'authorId': '2061601948', 'name': 'Rui Du'}, {'authorId': '49756256', 'name': 'Wen-Jun Luo'}, {'authorId': '2106936379', 'name': 'Na Wei'}, {'authorId': '2145746745', 'name': 'Xiao-Liang Wang'}, {'authorId': '2155655530', 'name': 'Yang Wang'}, {'authorId': '2108850218', 'name': 'Yan Yang'}, {'authorId': '7877296', 'name': 'Yao-Qing Yu'}, {'authorId': '81677355', 'name': 'Jun Chen'}]",32.0,,81.0,Validating Rat Model of Empathy for Pain: Effects of Pain Expressions in Social Partners,2018.0

Burkett et al. observed that within a pair of monogamous prairie voles, an unstressed partner increased its grooming of a stressed partner. Furthermore, the unstressed partner matched the stressed partner in its stress hormone response. Thus, consolation may be more common than assumed in animals, and prairie voles may prove a useful model for understanding the physical and neural mechanisms underlying consolation behavior. Science, this issue p. 375 Prairie voles console their family members after stressful events. Consolation behavior toward distressed others is common in humans and great apes, yet our ability to explore the biological mechanisms underlying this behavior is limited by its apparent absence in laboratory animals. Here, we provide empirical evidence that a rodent species, the highly social and monogamous prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster), greatly increases partner-directed grooming toward familiar conspecifics (but not strangers) that have experienced an unobserved stressor, providing social buffering. Prairie voles also match the fear response, anxiety-related behaviors, and corticosterone increase of the stressed cagemate, suggesting an empathy mechanism. Exposure to the stressed cagemate increases activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, and oxytocin receptor antagonist infused into this region abolishes the partner-directed response, showing conserved neural mechanisms between prairie vole and human.","[{'authorId': '40504396', 'name': 'James P.

Specifically, the emotional contagion hypothesis explains how the emotions of two people (e.g., salesperson and customer) during a conversation are transmitted from one to the other via facial cues, and that these emotions affect the outcome of that interaction. The emotional contagion hypothesis implies that there are definitive individual differences concerning whether someone is either sensitive to emotions from others or able to transmit his or her emotions onto others. This study explores whether these individual differences are assets or liabilities over the long term for salespersons in a sales organization. The data in this study show that a salesperson's ability to infect others with his or her emotions is an asset (because it can lead to higher performance). In addition, being sensitive to the emotions of others is an asset (it can also lead to better performance); at the same time it is a liability (because of the higher risk of burnout).

As the proportion increases, the emotional peak of pessimists increases. The cure probability θo has the least influence on the P(t), and at the same time, under the action of θp, the P(t) reaches the stable state first. The increase of the risk coefficient can promote the pessimist infection. When the degree of risk is low, the rate of emotional infection is increased. When the degree of risk is high, the rate of infection is slowed. Therefore, system customizers and related managers can improve the efficiency of stable groups, adjust the proportion of initial negative emotions, control the infection of the spontaneous infection process, and directly deal with negative emotions. They can carry out treatment and other means to stabilize group emotions and maintain social stability.","[{'authorId': '2421814', 'name': 'Xiaoyang Ni'}, {'authorId': '48054063', 'name': 'Haojie Zhou'}, {'authorId': '2108952893', 'name': 'Weiming Chen'}]",12.0,"{'name': 'International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health', 'volume': '17'}",39.0,Addition of an Emotionally Stable Node in the SOSa-SPSa Model for Group Emotional Contagion of Panic in Public Health Emergency: Implications for Epidemic Emergency Responses,2020.0

This study examined the relationship between pain and sleep problems in a sample of youth with parent-reported autism spectrum disorder (N = 62). Mothers reported on standardized measures of pain and sleep problems. Youth demonstrated atypically high levels of both observed pain and sleep problems. Pain predicted overall sleep disturbance and three specific sleep problems: sleep duration, parasomnias, and sleep-disordered breathing. These specific sleep problems were predicted by specific modalities of nonverbal pain communication (e.g. sleep duration problems were predicted by social communication of pain). Effects were consistent across probing of relevant moderators. These findings suggest that comprehensive assessment of both pain and sleep problems may provide important information for medical and behavioral treatment planning for youth with autism spectrum disorder.","[{'authorId': '4632618', 'name': 'Megan E.

First, I consider two social norms explanations—reciprocity and letdown (guilt) aversion—of why consumers tip in restaurants. Second, I examine three aspects of the tipping situation that influence how much consumers tip in restaurants: table size, sex, and method of bill payment. I address these issues using two data sources: a field survey and laboratory experiments. Customers were surveyed individually as they left a set of restaurants in Richmond, Virginia. The laboratory experiments vary service quality, table size, and information about others' tips in a controlled setting. Results from both data sets show support for reciprocity and letdown aversion, and that tip size decreases with table size. Sex differences, which exist only in the experimental data, show that men tip more than women.

Because mobs are characterized by emotionality, we describe a framework that associates psychological components with individual agents comprising a crowd and yields emergent behaviors in the crowd as a whole.

To test the study hypotheses, 223 consumers participated in a simulated service encounter in which actors played the roles of service employees. In a 2 × 2 factorial design, the employees varied both the extent of their smiling behavior and their emotional labor display by engaging in surface or deep acting. The results show that the authenticity of employees’ emotional labor display directly affects customers’ emotional states. However, contrary to expectations, the extent of employee smiling does not influence customer emotions, providing no support for the existence of primitive emotional contagion in service interactions.

1f637162a0492efa44c4330a96a4a125c11c7327,"Part I: Introduction[1] This essay describes a hypothesis of how music becomes internalized into the bodies and minds of listeners. The hypothesis underlies a larger theory of musical meaning, concerning affect, metaphoric reasoning, gender, and other areas of inquiry related to bodily experience, but the implications for these larger areas of meaning must wait until the details of the hypothesis have been made plain. Accordingly, this essay focuses on these details and is only suggestive of some of the implications.[2] The attention to embodiment situates this essay amid other writings, within and beyond music, that are concerned with the role of the body in the construction of meaning. Within music this includes work by Suzanne Cusick on gender (Cusick 1994), Naomi Cumming on subjectivity (Cumming 1997, 2000), and several scholars who have applied ideas from cognitive philosopher Mark Johnson (1987) on metaphor (Saslaw 1996, 1997-98; Zbikowski 1997, 1997-98, 1998; Brower 1997-98; Larson 1997-98). These and other scholars are exploring a lacuna left by the largely disembodied objectivity of our discipline (at least as practiced in the USA), which helps perpetuate, as Cusick puts it, the ""mind-body problem.""(1) The mimetic hypothesis addresses the matter of embodiment by showing how musical imagery-recalling, planning, or otherwise thinking about music-is partly motor imagery. Motor imagery is imagery related to the exertions and movements of our skeletal-motor system, and in the case of music this involves the various exertions enacted in musical performance. The mimetic hypothesis details how this might play out and suggests how it might underlie conceptualization and meaning.(2)[3] The initial premise of the hypothesis is that part of how we comprehend music is by way of a kind of physical empathy that involves imagining making the sounds we are listening to. This is a special case of the general human proclivity to understand one another via imitation, which we can refer to as mimetic cognition or mimetic comprehension, where ""mimetic"" is used in the manner specified below; hence, the ""mimetic hypothesis.""[4] The role of imitation in human cognition has received a good deal of interest recently, and, as demonstrated by the references below, this has now begun to make its way into the field of music theory. For this vein of inquiry to produce good results, however, we need to be precise about how imitation actually plays out in music perception and cognition, and this is the purpose of the mimetic hypothesis.Relevance of the Mimetic Hypothesis[5] The hypothesis is relevant to any area of musical inquiry related to embodiment. This includes basic music perception and cognition as well as higher-level areas of meaning mentioned above. It is also relevant to pedagogy because it concerns the nature of the mental representation of pitches and rhythms, which bears not only on auditory imagery and aural skills instruction but also on the relationship between sound and musical meaning in the music theory classroom. I will consider briefly some of the implications of this claim, but the primary purpose at this stage is to establish and clarify the essential role of the skeletal-motor system and its neurological representation in everyday music perception and conceptualization.Some Preliminaries[6] I want to note that my use of ""mimetic"" in this context is not the same as classical mimesis, which, roughly speaking, is more about art imitating life. The mimetic hypothesis is much more concerned with the perceptual and cognitive processes whereby music gets into the flesh, blood, and minds of listeners.(3)[7] Understanding through overt imitation is plainly evident in children, but one of the principles here is that this continues throughout our lives and becomes more subtle and covert as we mature. The covert form is imagery, and since it involves imagined actions it is motor imagery, and since these actions are imitative it is mimetic motor imagery (MMI). …","[{'authorId': '40621494', 'name': 'Arnie Cox'}]",106.0,,81.0,Embodying Music: Principles of the Mimetic Hypothesis,2011.0

Recent imaging studies have shown that imitation of facial expressions is associated with activation in limbic regions such as the amygdala. Yet, the physiological interaction between this limbic activation and facial feedback remains unclear. To study if facial feedback effects on limbic brain responses during intentional imitation of facial expressions, we applied botulinum toxin (BTX)-induced denervation of frown muscles in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging as a reversible lesion model to minimize the occurrence of afferent muscular and cutaneous input. We show that, during imitation of angry facial expressions, reduced feedback due to BTX treatment attenuates activation of the left amygdala and its functional coupling with brain stem regions implicated in autonomic manifestations of emotional states. These findings demonstrate that facial feedback modulates neural activity within central circuitries of emotion during intentional imitation of facial expressions.

However, as this research has usually relied on self-reported performance, it is imperative to examine whether this association is also confirmed when using “objective” performance data (e.g., supervisor reports). This study reviewed previous research on the associations between burnout (exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment) and various types of objective performance. A systematic literature search identified 16 studies dealing with the burnout–performance relationship. These studies showed the wide variety of approaches that are used to study burnout and objective performance. Using data from these 16 studies, a meta-analysis was conducted to obtain mean correlations. The meta-analytical correlations between exhaustion and in-role behaviour (based on five studies), organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB; five studies), and customer satisfaction (two studies) were −.22, −.19, and −.55, respectively, underlining the practical relevance of burnout research for organizational performance. The evidence for the relationships between depersonalization, personal accomplishment, and performance was inconclusive. Future research should focus on valid indicators of job performance, should more often employ longitudinal designs and large samples, and should consider the theoretical basis for the study expectations more extensively.","[{'authorId': '37210050', 'name': 'T.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences between DSM-III-R Axis I and II psychiatric diagnoses in hospitalized adolescents with and without conduct disorder. The spectrum of psychopathology associated with conduct disorder, especially personality disorder symptoms and diagnoses, remains largely unexplored.


METHOD
Twenty-five inpatients were evaluated using the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents, Adolescent Version (DICA-R-A); the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children, Epidemiologic Version (K-SADS-E) (panic disorder and agoraphobia only); and the Structured Interview for DSM-III-R Personality Disorders (SIDP-R).


RESULTS
Fifty-two percent met criteria for conduct disorder, and the majority of these had comorbid substance abuse, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and major depression. The diagnosis of conduct disorder was also associated with fulfilling criteria for multiple Axis II personality disorders, particularly passive aggressive and histrionic. Nearly three personality disorders per subject were found in those with conduct disorder, while those without conduct disorder averaged just over one personality disorder. There was a trend for female subjects with conduct disorders to have more frequent and varied personality disorder diagnoses. For the entire sample, males were significantly more likely to have conduct disorder, and females were significantly more likely to have borderline personality disorder.


CONCLUSION
These findings support conduct disorder as a multifaceted illness composed of diverse Axis I and II characteristics. Long-term follow-up studies are needed to determine the outcome of personality disorder diagnoses made in adolescents with and without conduct disorder.","[{'authorId': '1399125342', 'name': 'W.

The use of physics-based models for fluid flow can greatly assist in creating such tools. Physical models, unlike key frame or procedural based techniques, permit an animator to almost effortlessly create interesting, swirling fluid-like behaviors. Also, the interaction of flows with objects and virtual forces is handled elegantly. Until recently, it was believed that physical fluid models were too expensive to allow real-time interaction. This was largely due to the fact that previous models used unstable schemes to solve the physical equations governing a fluid. In this paper, for the first time, we propose an unconditionally stable model which still produces complex fluid-like flows. As well, our method is very easy to implement. The stability of our model allows us to take larger time steps and therefore achieve faster simulations. We have used our model in conjuction with advecting solid textures to create many fluid-like animations interactively in two- and three-dimensions.","[{'authorId': '144815648', 'name': 'J.

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.","[{'authorId': '40348417', 'name': 'Ashish Vaswani'}, {'authorId': '1846258', 'name': 'Noam M.

Here, we experimentally addressed whether emotional homogeneity within a crowd might result from a cascade of local emotional transmissions where the perception of another’s emotional expression produces, in the observer's face and body, sufficient information to allow for the transmission of the emotion to a third party. We reproduced a minimal element of a crowd situation and recorded the facial electromyographic activity and the skin conductance response of an individual C observing the face of an individual B watching an individual A displaying either joy or fear full body expressions. Critically, individual B did not know that she was being watched. We show that emotions of joy and fear displayed by A were spontaneously transmitted to C through B, even when the emotional information available in B’s faces could not be explicitly recognized. These findings demonstrate that one is tuned to react to others’ emotional signals and to unintentionally produce subtle but sufficient emotional cues to induce emotional states in others. This phenomenon could be the mark of a spontaneous cooperative behavior whose function is to communicate survival-value information to conspecifics.","[{'authorId': '6669560', 'name': 'G.

Purpose
This study examines the relationships among workplace incivility, job satisfaction and turnover intention for tourist hotel chefs. Furthermore, emotional intelligence is taken as the moderating variable on the relationships between workplace incivility and job satisfaction and workplace incivility and turnover intention.


Design/methodology/approach
Tourist hotel chefs were invited to participate in this study using purposive sampling, and a structured questionnaire was administered to carry out the investigation on tourist hotel chefs.


Findings
The results show that workplace incivility has negative effects on job satisfaction and casts positive effects on turnover intention through job satisfaction. Emotional intelligence has a significant moderating effect on the relationship between workplace incivility and job satisfaction.


Originality/value
This study firstly demonstrated the relationships among workplace incivility, job satisfaction and turnover intention for tourist hotel chefs. Furthermore, the moderating effect of emotional intelligence on the relationship between workplace incivility and job satisfaction was also validated.

Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of mental retardation with many patients exhibiting attention deficits. Previous studies in fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) knock-out (KO) mice, a mouse model for fragile X, focused mainly on hippocampal-dependent plasticity and spatial memory. We demonstrate that FMR1 knock-out mice show a defect in trace fear memory without changes in locomotion, anxiety, and pain sensitivity. Whole-cell path-clamp recordings in the ACC show that long-term potentiation (LTP) was completely abolished. A similar decrease in LTP was found in the lateral amygdala, another structure implicated in fear memory. No significant changes were found in basal synaptic transmission. This suggests that synaptic plasticity in the ACC and amygdala of FMR1 KO mice plays an important role in the expression of behavioral phenotypes similar to the symptoms of fragile X syndrome.","[{'authorId': '78648886', 'name': 'Ming-gao Zhao'}, {'authorId': '5264465', 'name': 'H.

21e4b57f22ac5db99bc3a77524b82cd61c0a526b,"ABSTRACT Facial features that resemble emotional expressions influence key social evaluations, including trust. Here, we present four experiments testing how the impact of such expressive features is qualified by their processing difficulty. We show that faces with mixed expressive features are relatively devalued, and faces with pure expressive features are relatively valued. This is especially true when participants first engage in a categorisation task that makes processing of mixed expressions difficult and pure expressions easy. Critically, we also demonstrate that the impact of categorisation fluency depends on the specific nature of the expressive features. When faces vary on valence (i.e. sad to happy), trust judgments increase with their positivity, but also depend on fluency. When faces vary on social motivation (i.e. angry to sad), trust judgments increase with their approachability, but remain impervious to disfluency. This suggests that people intelligently use fluency to make judgments on valence-relevant judgment dimensions – but not when faces can be judged using other relevant criteria, such as motivation. Overall, the findings highlight that key social impressions (like trust) are flexibly constructed from inputs related to stimulus features and processing experience.","[{'authorId': '4135033', 'name': 'M.

2349f8be87d55c5bf5e62cda5364f8c252e027ad,"Declarations about how women and men differ emotionally abound in the psychological literature. They can be found in the Parsonian normative construction of family roles, with women described as the ""expressive"" experts and men as the ""instrumental"" experts (Parsons & Bales, 1955). They are manifest in measures of gender role identificalion, where emotion items constitute the key components of identification with the feminine and not masculine sex role (Constantinople, 1973). Emotionality also features prominently in the content of gender stereotypes with at least 75% agreement among subjects (both female and male) that the labels ""very emotional"" and ""very aware of feelings of others"" were seen to be more characteristic of females than males (Broverman, Vogel, Broverman, Clarkson, & Rosenkrantz, 1972). A converging result emerges strikingly in Shields's (1987) finding that more than 80% of males and females mention a female target when asked to name the most emotional person they know. Additionally. social pressures tend to facilitate emotionality in mothers as compared with fathers (Shields & Koster, 1989). and clinical thinking about gender underscores females' apparent greater access to their emotions (Chodorow, 1980). Perhaps because the belief in gender differences in emotionality is so pervasive and perennial, i t has tended to mask the complexity of defining what i t means to be emotional.

To clarify and compare results across this growing body of literature, a quantitative review was developed, along with a theoretically derived path diagram of key emotional labor constructs. Evidence from our structural meta-analytic model based on 116 primary studies demonstrates that examining affective dispositions and emotional labor constructs and the pattern of positive and negative results helps to clarify and add specificity to the literature. Results were consistent with the perspective that surface acting emotion regulation strategies have a pattern of negative relationships with work outcomes of job satisfaction and stress/exhaustion (but not with job performance), whereas deep acting emotion regulation strategies have a pattern of positive relationships with all of these work outcomes.","[{'authorId': '1401405221', 'name': 'J.

The empathy variables examined were emotional contagion (i.e. sharing the emotions of patients), empathic concern (i.e. being concerned for patients) and communicative effectiveness (i.e. effectively communicating with patients and their families). Nursing stress was explored through the variables of depersonalization, reduced personal accomplishment and emotional exhaustion. Multiple regression analyses revealed that the combination of the three emotional communication variables explained significant proportions of the variance in all three of the stress variables, as well as occupational commitment. The analyses further revealed that a lack of empathic concern and poor communicative responsiveness accounted for significant proportions of the variance in depersonalization. Lack of empathic concern, poor communicative responsiveness and high emotional contagion significantly contributed to reduced personal accomplishment. Emotional contagion explained a significant proportion of the variance in emotional exhaustion. Emotional contagion also significantly reduced occupational commitment.

The present review seeks to recall the history of our field in which emotions and instincts were mentioned in the same breath and in which neither psychologists nor biologists felt that animal emotions were off limits. One of the tenets supporting a renewed interest in this topic is to avoid unanswerable questions and to view emotions as mental and bodily states that potentiate behavior appropriate to environmental challenges.

In recent years social neuroscience made considerable progress in revealing the mechanisms that enable a person to feel what another is feeling. The present review provides an in‐depth and critical discussion of these findings. Consistent evidence shows that sharing the emotions of others is associated with activation in neural structures that are also active during the first‐hand experience of that emotion. Part of the neural activation shared between self‐ and other‐related experiences seems to be rather automatically activated. However, recent studies also show that empathy is a highly flexible phenomenon, and that vicarious responses are malleable with respect to a number of factors—such as contextual appraisal, the interpersonal relationship between empathizer and other, or the perspective adopted during observation of the other. Future investigations are needed to provide more detailed insights into these factors and their neural underpinnings. Questions such as whether individual differences in empathy can be explained by stable personality traits, whether we can train ourselves to be more empathic, and how empathy relates to prosocial behavior are of utmost relevance for both science and society.","[{'authorId': '47272511', 'name': 'T.

However, no study has directly compared the effectiveness of two types of internal versus external MI across multiple discrete emotions. In the present experiment, 40 undergraduate students watched film clips (external procedure) and recalled personal events (internal procedure) inducing 4 basic emotions (fear, anger, joy, sadness) and later completed a self-report questionnaire. Remarkably, both internal and external procedures elicited target emotions selectively, compared with nontarget emotions. When contrasting the intensity of target emotions, both techniques showed no significant differences, with the exception of Joy, which was more intensely elicited by the internal procedure. Importantly, when considering the overall level of intensity, it was always greater in the internal procedure, for each stimulus.

A simpler animal model would pave the way for systematic single cell recordings and invasive manipulations of the brain regions implicated in empathy. Recent evidence has been put forward for the existence of empathy in rodents. In this study, we describe a potential model of empathy in female rats, in which we studied interactions between two rats: a witness observes a demonstrator experiencing a series of footshocks. By comparing the reaction of witnesses with or without previous footshock experience, we examine the role of prior experience as a modulator of empathy. We show that witnesses having previously experienced footshocks, but not naïve ones, display vicarious freezing behavior upon witnessing a cage-mate experiencing footshocks. Strikingly, the demonstrator's behavior was in turn modulated by the behavior of the witness: demonstrators froze more following footshocks if their witness froze more. Previous experiments have shown that rats emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) when receiving footshocks. Thus, the role of USV in triggering vicarious freezing in our paradigm is examined. We found that experienced witness-demonstrator pairs emitted more USVs than naïve witness-demonstrator pairs, but the number of USVs was correlated with freezing in demonstrators, not in witnesses. Furthermore, playing back the USVs, recorded from witness-demonstrator pairs during the empathy test, did not induce vicarious freezing behavior in experienced witnesses. Thus, our findings confirm that vicarious freezing can be triggered in rats, and moreover it can be modulated by prior experience. Additionally, our result suggests that vicarious freezing is not triggered by USVs per se and it influences back onto the behavior of the demonstrator that had elicited the vicarious freezing in witnesses, introducing a paradigm to study empathy as a social loop.","[{'authorId': '4487960', 'name': 'P.

When an individual develops statements about attitude or needs, he or she uses social information--information about past behavior and about what others think. The process of attributing attitudes or needs from behavior is itself affected by commitment processes, by the saliency and relevance of information, and by the need to develop socially acceptable and legitimate rationalizations for actions. Both attitudes and need statements, as well as characterizations of jobs, are affected by informational social influence.

Furthermore, the “extroversion” and “empathy” factors from the OCEAN model are chosen to describe the most important individual personalities in such scenarios. Based on this, an improved emotional contagion model is proposed by combining the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model and individual personality under different political viewpoints. Finally, the crowd in a political rally is driven to move according to the new potential moving direction generated by emotional contagion and the original direction of the individual together. The experiments show that our method can intuitively demonstrate the emotional changes of those individuals with different political perspectives and reasonably simulate the crowd movement under the political rally scenes.","[{'authorId': '144470801', 'name': 'Pei Lv'}, {'authorId': '2223579', 'name': 'Zhujin Zhang'}, {'authorId': '7431398', 'name': 'Chaochao Li'}, {'authorId': '1932425', 'name': 'Yibo Guo'}, {'authorId': '2118868255', 'name': 'Bing Zhou'}, {'authorId': '2285442', 'name': 'Mingliang Xu'}]",29.0,"{'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems', 'pages': '377-386', 'volume': '6'}",24.0,Crowd Behavior Evolution With Emotional Contagion in Political Rallies,2019.0

However, management scholars have lagged behind in understanding this important form of communication. Although some theories discuss limited aspects of nonverbal behavior, there has yet to be a comprehensive review of nonverbal behavior geared toward organizational scholars. Furthermore, the extant literature is scattered across several areas of inquiry, making the field appear disjointed and challenging to access. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature on nonverbal behavior with an eye towards applying it to organizational phenomena. We begin by defining nonverbal behavior and its components. We review and discuss several areas in the organizational sciences that are ripe for further explorations of nonverbal behavior. Throughout the paper, we offer ideas for future research as well as information on methods to study nonverbal behavior in lab and field contexts. We hope our review will encourage organizational scholars to develop a deeper understanding of how nonverbal behavior influences the social world of organizations.","[{'authorId': '80572944', 'name': 'Silvia Bonaccio'}, {'authorId': '1401319421', 'name': ""J.

After the infection was first reported in December 2019, almost every country did not pay attention to this highly contaminated disease and failed to react swiftly. Now the whole planet is in an vulnerable state, resulting to increase the mortality rate and facing difficulties in all socio-economic aspects. That is why we have the urge to develop an efficient mathematical model (quarantine) based on social consciousness to control the epidemic. *Corresponding author: E-mail: kamrujjaman@du.ac.bd; Mahmud et al.; JALSI, 23(3): 20-27, 2020; Article no.JALSI.56918 Methods: This is a quarantine mathematical model. The outcome of the system is dependent on social consciousness. We have calculated the awareness level by considering various socio-economic factor of each country. In our model, the parameters are Education Index, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, population density, high literacy and stable economy. To maximize the efficiency of the model, it has to be implemented in initial stage. However, strict application of the method in vigorous stage of epidemic will also bring a satisfactory outcome. Results: In Spain, quarantine was effected on March 14, 2020. Spain experienced an increase in reported cases for 13 days of quarantine enforcement and from the 14th day, daily reported cases started to decrease with small fluctuation. Government ensured the social isolation through quarantine. After imposition of a quarantine on March 9, 2020 in Italy, within 13 days of lock-down, the maximum number of infection started to decrease. Similar results observed in France. Higher social consciousness would decrease the number of infected population dramatically while minimal or lower awareness will do a outburst. Conclusion: Outbreak will be in control of health care system which yields to reduce the death rate and will ensure social and economic stability.","[{'authorId': '1657417676', 'name': 'MD.

The incidence and characteristics of neurological complications are unclear. For this reason, the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) core COVID‐19 Task Force initiated a survey on neurological symptoms observed in patients with COVID‐19 infection. Methods A 17‐question online survey was made available on the EAN website and distributed to EAN members and other worldwide physicians starting on 9 April 2020. Results By 27 April 2020, proper data were collected from 2343 responders (out of 4199), of whom 82.0% were neurologists, mostly from Europe. Most responders (74.7%) consulted patients with COVID‐19 mainly in emergency rooms and in COVID‐19 units. The majority (67.0%) had evaluated fewer than 10 patients with neurological manifestations of COVID‐19 (neuro COVID‐19). The most frequently reported neurological findings were headache (61.9%), myalgia (50.4%), anosmia (49.2%), ageusia (39.8%), impaired consciousness (29.3%) and psychomotor agitation (26.7%). Encephalopathy and acute cerebrovascular disorders were reported at 21.0%. Neurological manifestations were generally interpreted as being possibly related to COVID‐19; they were most commonly recognized in patients with multiple general symptoms and occurred at any time during infection. Conclusion Neurologists are currently and actively involved in the management of neurological issues related to the COVID‐19 pandemic. This survey justifies setting up a prospective registry to better capture the prevalence of patients with neuro COVID‐19, neurological disease characteristics and the contribution of neurological manifestations to outcome.","[{'authorId': '143632514', 'name': 'E.

In this model, each individual has an assessed score of reputation which is obtained by considering the evaluation level of interactive partners for its present behavior. We focus on the effect of evaluation level on the changing intensity of interaction between individuals. For an individual with good behavior, the higher the evaluation level of its partners for its good behavior, the better its reputation, and the higher the probability of surrounding partners interaction with it. On the contrary, for an individual with bad behavior, the lower the evaluation level of its partners for its bad behavior, the worse its reputation, and the less the probability of surrounding neighbors interaction with it. Simulation results show that this effective mechanism can drastically facilitate the emergence and maintenance of cooperation in the population under a treacherous chip. Interestingly, for a small or moderate treacherous chip, the cooperation level monotonously ascends as the evaluation level increases; however, for a higher treacherous chip, existing an optimal evaluation level, which can result in the best promotion of cooperation. Furthermore, we find better agreement between simulation results and theoretical predictions obtained from an extended pair-approximation method, although there are some tiny deviations. We also show some typical snapshots of the system and investigate the reason for appearance and persistence of cooperation. The results further show the importance of evaluation level of individual behavior in coevolutionary relationships.","[{'authorId': '2144490250', 'name': 'Jiaqi Li'}, {'authorId': '48935517', 'name': 'Chun-yan Zhang'}, {'authorId': '3196028', 'name': 'Qinglin Sun'}, {'authorId': '6649345', 'name': 'Zengqiang Chen'}, {'authorId': '2013823978', 'name': 'Jianlei Zhang'}]",25.0,,53.0,Changing the Intensity of Interaction Based on Individual Behavior in the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma Game,2017.0

Evolutionarily stable states have a close relationship with Nash equilibria of repeated games, which are characterized by the folk theorem. When applying the folk theorem, one needs to compute the minimax profile of the game in order to find Nash equilibria. Computing the minimax profile is an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we investigate a new methodology to compute evolutionary stable states based on the level-k equilibrium, a new refinement of Nash equilibrium in repeated games. A level-k equilibrium is implemented by a group of players who adopt reactive strategies and who have no incentive to deviate from their strategies simultaneously. Computing the level-k equilibria is tractable because the minimax payoffs and strategies are not needed. As an application, this paper develops a tractable algorithm to compute the evolutionarily stable states and the Pareto front of n-player symmetric games. Three games, including the iterated prisoner's dilemma, are analyzed by means of the proposed methodology.","[{'authorId': '2008877581', 'name': 'Jiawei Li'}, {'authorId': '145528658', 'name': 'G.

267c9be2ad04195039b64e5ee05cdab2ff65bcf4,"Shared memory many-core processors such as GPUs have been extensively used in accelerating computation-intensive algorithms and applications. When porting existing algorithms from sequential or other parallel architecture models to shared memory many-core architectures, non-trivial modifications are often needed to match the execution patterns of the target algorithms with the characteristics of many-core architectures. Ray traversal is a fundamental process in many applications, and is commonly accelerated by spatial decomposition schemes captured in hierarchical data structures (e.g., kd-trees). However, ray traversal using hierarchical data structures needs to conduct repeated hierarchical searches. Such search process is time-consuming on shared memory manycore architectures since it incurs considerable amounts of expensive memory accesses and execution divergence. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial decomposition based data structure, called Shell, which completely avoids hierarchical search for ray traversal. In Shell, a structure is built on the boundary of each region in the decomposed space, which allows any ray traversing in a region to find the next neighboring region to traverse using table lookup schemes, without any hierarchical search. While our ray traversal approach works for other spatial decomposition paradigms and many-core processors in higher dimensional scenes, we illustrate it using kd-tree on GPU for 3D scenario and compare with the fastest known kd-tree searching algorithms for ray traversal. Experimental results in graphics ray tracing and radiation dose calculation show that our approach improves the performance by 3.5-5.5χ over the fastest known kd-tree based approaches.","[{'authorId': '2066515267', 'name': 'K.

The authors’ examination included 247 studies, containing 290 samples, and 21 antecedents and 16 consequences of LMX quality. Results indicated that while leader behaviors and perceptions, follower characteristics, interpersonal relationship characteristics, and contextual variables represent significant groups of LMX antecedents, leader variables explained the most variance in LMX quality. Moderator analyses revealed that the particular LMX scale, country of participants, and work setting studied did not produce meaningful influences on the relationships in the meta-analysis. However, power distance and individualism did moderate some of these relationships. To provide continuity with the LMX meta-analyses and conceptual reviews that have focused on LMX consequences, the authors tested a number of mediation models.

The evolutionary roots of human altruism, however, remain poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests a discontinuity between humans and other primates because individual chimpanzees do not spontaneously provide food to other group members, indicating a lack of concern for their welfare. Here, we demonstrate that common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) do spontaneously provide food to nonreciprocating and genetically unrelated individuals, indicating that other-regarding preferences are not unique to humans and that their evolution did not require advanced cognitive abilities such as theory of mind. Because humans and marmosets are cooperative breeders and the only two primate taxa in which such unsolicited prosociality has been found, we conclude that these prosocial predispositions may emanate from cooperative breeding.","[{'authorId': '143669842', 'name': 'Judith M Burkart'}, {'authorId': '144327037', 'name': 'E.

272da29be4f925f122e9c088e6df860925c24cd0,"ABSTRACT In the context of social and cultural relativity, there has been ample discussion about the fluidity and complexity of authenticity. This debate, termed ‘dilemma of authenticity’, centres around conflicting stances among tourism theorists, practitioners, marketers, and host communities with regards to how authenticity is perceived and how it influences tourists’ decision-making. This uncertainty has hindered agritourism entrepreneurs who remain unsure of how they may rely on authenticity to attract tourists. This paper examines perceptions of authenticity in working agricultural landscapes through two between-subject experiments to investigate how appealing the self-expressed authentic agricultural elements appear to potential tourists. One experiment was carried out in a controlled laboratory experiment employing Immersive Virtual Environment technology, and the second via a web-based survey using two-dimensional photos. Participants were undergraduate students and Amazon Mechanical Turk Master Workers, respectively. The results suggest that participants identify productive elements of agricultural landscapes as both authentic and appealing, though significantly differing in regards to socio-cultural elements. The triangulation of methods and samples reveal discrepant findings for wooded and riparian areas. This paper brings about novel findings about the perception of authenticity and appeal in agricultural settings.","[{'authorId': '101227053', 'name': 'Shahab Nazariadli'}, {'authorId': '29818324', 'name': 'D.

One challenging problem that blocks the construction of our control scheme is that the real control signal is wrapped in the coupling of quantization effect and nonsmooth backlash nonlinearity. To resolve this challenge, this paper presents a two-stage separation approach established on two new technical components, which are the approximate asymmetric backlash model and the nonlinear decomposition of quantizer, respectively. Then the real control is successfully separated from the coupling dynamics. Furthermore, by employing the neural networks and adaptation method in control design, a quantized controller is developed to guarantee the asymptotic convergence of tracking error to an adjustable region of zero and uniform ultimate boundedness of all closed-loop signals. Eventually, simulations are conducted to support our theoretical results.","[{'authorId': '2019470', 'name': 'G.

These data-driven insights enable companies to make responsible decisions that will improve peoples’ experiences with their products. Importantly, companies must also be responsible in how they conduct research. Existing ethical guidelines for research do not always robustly address the considerations that industry researchers face. For this reason, companies should develop principles and practices around research that are appropriate to the environments in which they operate, taking into account the values set out in law and ethics. This paper describes the research review process designed and implemented at Facebook, including the training employees receive, and the steps involved in evaluating proposed research. We emphasize that there is no one-size-fits-all model of research review that can be applied across companies, and that processes should be designed to fit the contexts in which the research is taking place. However, we hope that general principles can be extracted from Facebook’s process that will inform other companies as they develop frameworks for research review that serve their needs.","[{'authorId': '119080230', 'name': 'Molly C.

Five different orthographic data sets (20th century Italian poems, 20th century American poems, contemporary Swedish poems with their corresponding Italian translations, Italian speech samples, and American speech samples) were subjected to recurrence quantification analysis, a procedure which has been found to be diagnostically useful in the quantitative assessment of ordered series in fields such as physics, molecular dynamics, physiology, and general signal processing. Recurrence quantification was developed from recurrence plots as applied to the analysis of nonlinear, complex systems in the physical sciences, and is based on the computation of a distance matrix of the elements of an ordered series (in this case the letters consituting selected speech and poetic texts). From a strictly mathematical view, the results show the possibility of demonstrating invariance between different language exemplars despite the apparent low-level of coding (orthography). Comparison with the actual texts confirms the ability of the method to reveal recurrent structures, and their complexity. Using poems as a reference standard for judging speech complexity, the technique exhibits language independence, order dependence and freedom from pure statistical characteristics of studied sequences, as well as consistency with easily identifiable texts. Such studies may provide phenomenological markers of hidden structure as coded by the purely orthographic level.","[{'authorId': '37827738', 'name': 'F.

For ethical reasons, however, there is a serious lack of experimental data regarding crowd panic. Therefore, we have analyzed video recordings of the crowd disaster in Mina/Makkah during the Hajj in 1426H on 12 January 2006. They reveal two subsequent, sudden transitions from laminar to stop-and-go and ""turbulent"" flows, which question many previous simulation models. While the transition from laminar to stop-and-go flows supports a recent model of bottleneck flows [D. Helbing, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 168001 (2006)], the subsequent transition to turbulent flow is not yet well understood. It is responsible for sudden eruptions of pressure release comparable to earthquakes, which cause sudden displacements and the falling and trampling of people. The insights of this study into the reasons for critical crowd conditions are important for the organization of safer mass events. In particular, they allow one to understand where and when crowd accidents tend to occur.

The key difference between the present and other approaches for modelling human social evolution lies in the assumption that there is a large overlap between the human and dog behaviour complex because during their evolution in close contact with human groups dogs evolved functionally similar social skills. Thus the parallel investigation of the human and dog behaviour complex widens our possibility for understanding human social cognition because it allows the modelling of the interaction between various components in contrast to other models which are often restricted to modelling a single aspect of human social cognitive skills.,"[{'authorId': '52191123', 'name': 'Á.

Predictor variables were tipping motivations and demographic characteristics (age, gender and income). Target variable was loyalty to the server.,The findings suggest that social norm, food quality and income influence customers’ loyalty toward the same server on future visits. Social norm turned out to be the strongest predictor. If consumers did not have high social norm on tipping, their loyalty toward a particular server was affected by the combination of determinants such as server quality, social norm, income and food quality.,Future research can identify or develop scales of tipping motivations with stronger reliabilities in the context of restaurants. Future research can also explore other demographic differences (e.g. ethnicity and sexual orientation) in tipping motivations and server loyalty.,Servers are indeed the primary contact point and they are in the most influential position with consumers. Overall, results of this study provide an interesting insight in that restaurant guests’ experience can be ruined by bad quality of food or can be mitigated by server quality. Thus, this research highlights a step-by-step process as to the actions that a server may perform and manage in order to enhance server loyalty.,Loyalty has been examined in the context of products, brands or service providers.

This seminal book offers not only an answer regarding how to gain competitive advantage through people, but also a brand new, untapped human resource-psychological capital, or simply PsyCap. Generated from both the positive psychology movement and the authors' pioneering work on positive organizational behavior, PsyCap goes beyond traditionally recognized human and social capital. But PsyCap is not a vague or unscientific concept: to be included in PsyCap, a given positive construct must be based on theory, research, and valid measurement, must be open to development, and must have measurable performance impact. The positive constructs that have been determined to best meet these PsyCap criteria, efficacy (confidence), hope, optimism, and resiliency, are covered in separate chapters in Psychological Capital. After exploring other potential positive constructs such as creativity, wisdom, well being, flow, humor, gratitude, forgiveness, emotional intelligence, spirituality, authenticity, and courage, the authors summarize the research demonstrating the performance impact of PsyCap. They go on to provide the PsyCap Questionnaire (PCQ) as a measurement tool, and the PsyCap Intervention (PCI) as a development aid. Utility analysis indicates that investing in the development of PsyCap as presented in this book can result in a very substantial return. In total, Psychological Capital provides theory, research, measurements, and methods of application for the new resource of psychological capital, a resource that can be developed and sustained for competitive advantage.","[{'authorId': '2841678', 'name': 'F.

We empirically evaluated the effects of near visually realistic vs. non-realistic stylized appearance of virtual humans on the emotional response of participants in a medical virtual reality system that was designed to educate users in recognizing the signs and symptoms of patient deterioration. In a between-subjects experiment protocol, participants interacted with one of three different appearances of a virtual patient, namely visually realistic, cartoon-shaded and charcoal-sketch like conditions in a mixed reality simulation. Emotional impact were measured via a combination of quantitative objective measures were gathered using skin Electrodermal Activity (EDA) sensors, and quantitative subjective measures such as the Differential Emotion Survey (DES IV), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and Social Presence questionnaire. The emotional states of the participants were analyzed across four distinct time steps during which the medical condition of the virtual patient deteriorated (an emotionally stressful interaction), and were contrasted to a baseline affective state. Objective EDA results showed that in all three conditions, male participants exhibited greater levels of arousal as compared to female participants. We found that negative affect levels were significantly lower in the visually realistic condition, as compared to the stylized appearance conditions. Furthermore, in emotional dimensions of interest-excitement, surprise, anger, fear and guilt participants in all conditions responded similarly. However, in social emotional constructs of shyness, presence, perceived personality, and enjoyment-joy, we found that participants responded differently in the visually realistic condition as compared to the cartoon and sketch conditions. Our study suggests that virtual human appearance can affect not only critical emotional reactions in affective inter-oersonal trainina scenarios. but also users' oerceotions of oersonalitv and social characteristic of the virtual interlocutors.","[{'authorId': '51250937', 'name': 'Matias Volonte'}, {'authorId': '144403504', 'name': 'Sabarish V.

Participants (N = 146) completed measures of nonverbal immediacy, instructor rapport, perceived cognitive learning, and anticipated final course grade. Results revealed that immediacy and rapport were two distinct constructs. In testing the model, the enjoyable interaction dimension of instructor rapport mediated the relationship between immediacy and perceived learning but not anticipated final grades. The personal connection dimension of rapport mediated the relationship between immediacy and both perceived learning and anticipated final grade. These results explore the mechanism through which immediacy may lead to cognitive learning.","[{'authorId': '2646738', 'name': 'Brandi N. Frisby'}, {'authorId': '1685626797', 'name': 'Amy L.

2aa66e8b8cc87b112458d7fecca7352490fb4bb8,"Redirected behaviors occur when some course of action is thwarted or inhibited (frustration). They also occur as adjunctive behaviors in operant conditioning tasks, where they might reflect frustration about unrewarded responses. Because frustration is associated with stress, which could interfere with learning and memory, we studied whether the occurrence of redirected behavior is correlated with learning success in a series of visual-cue discrimination tasks. Eleven hens, aged 34 wk, were tested on acquisition, reversal, extinction, and relearning of a simple visual discrimination task. The experimenters randomly assigned red and blue cardboard discs as discriminative stimuli. A correct response was recorded when a hen pecked at the correct disc. The learning criterion was 90% correct responses in 20 trials in 2 consecutive task sessions. The following data were documented: number of pecks needed to achieve the learning criterion, latency in choosing, pecks at the experimenter, and pecks at the surroundings. The behavioral responses were analyzed using linear mixed model ANOVA. Redirected pecking at the surroundings was a significant indicator of learning failure in that the more the hens performed this behavior, the more trials they needed to complete the discrimination tasks (P = 0.012). The number of pecks at the experimenter during the tasks significantly influenced learning success (P = 0.020), with hens directing more pecks at the experimenter during reversal, reaching the learning criterion in fewer trials (P = 0.027). The more the hens pecked at the experimenter during acquisition and extinction, however, the more trials they needed to meet the learning criteria (acquisition: P = 0.048; extinction: P = 0.003). Thus, laying hens are susceptible to the effects of frustration as measured in terms of redirected pecking elicited by operant procedures in visual discrimination tasks. In general, any situation in which a desirable goal is obstructed or an expected reward is omitted may lead to frustration-related activities, such as redirected behavior, which could in turn lead to abnormal behavior and welfare issues for the animals.","[{'authorId': '35084109', 'name': 'F.

Wellbeing is best understood as a multifaceted phenomenon that can be assessed by measuring a wide array of subjective and objective constructs. This review summarizes the state of research on the various domains of wellbeing measured by psychologists and social scientists, and provides an overview of the main theoretical perspectives that integrate these domains. Among these theoretical perspectives, we highlight Well-being Theory, which decomposes the wellbeing construct into five domains: Positive emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment (PERMA). We conclude by formulating recommendations for future research on the measurement of wellbeing. These recommendations include the need to combine both objective and subjective indicators, and the use of a dashboard approach to measurement. This approach conveys the multifaceted nature of wellbeing and will help policy-makers and citizens understand which domains of wellbeing should constitute priorities for public policy.","[{'authorId': '145260013', 'name': 'M.

It is generally accepted that 2nd order descent methods are the most robust, fast and reliable approaches for nonlinear optimization of a general smooth function. However, in the context of computer vision, 2nd order descent methods have two main drawbacks: (1) The function might not be analytically differentiable and numerical approximations are impractical. (2) The Hessian might be large and not positive definite. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Supervised Descent Method (SDM) for minimizing a Non-linear Least Squares (NLS) function. During training, the SDM learns a sequence of descent directions that minimizes the mean of NLS functions sampled at different points. In testing, SDM minimizes the NLS objective using the learned descent directions without computing the Jacobian nor the Hessian. We illustrate the benefits of our approach in synthetic and real examples, and show how SDM achieves state-of-the-art performance in the problem of facial feature detection.

Results from both studies suggest that prosocial behavior is motivated primarily by concern for others.

The mounting frequency of product-harm crises and ill-prepared corporate responses to such crises can have profound consequences for brand equity. Yet there is little research on the marketing impact of crises. The authors employ the expectations–evidence framework to understand the impact of firms' responses to crises on customer-based brand equity. The results of a field survey and two laboratory experiments indicate that consumers interpret firm response on the basis of their prior expectations about the firm. The interaction of expectations and firm response is shown to affect postcrisis brand equity.

2bc83072b23e79f72aef21761c980d202a38ffd1,"Background Internet support groups (ISGs) enable individuals with specific health problems to readily communicate online. Peer support has been postulated to improve mental health, including depression, through the provision of social support. Given the growing role of ISGs for both users with depression and those with a physical disorder, there is a need to evaluate the evidence concerning the efficacy of ISGs in reducing depressive symptoms. Objective The objective was to systematically review the available evidence concerning the effect of ISGs on depressive symptoms. Method Three databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane) were searched using over 150 search terms extracted from relevant papers, abstracts, and a thesaurus. Papers were included if they (1) employed an online peer-to-peer support group, (2) incorporated a depression outcome, and (3) reported quantitative data. Studies included both stand-alone ISGs and those used in the context of a complex multi-component intervention. All trials were coded for quality. Results Thirty-one papers (involving 28 trials) satisfied the inclusion criteria from an initial pool of 12,692 abstracts. Sixteen trials used either a single-component intervention, a design in which non-ISG components were controlled, or a cross-sectional analysis, of which 10 (62.5%) reported a positive effect of the ISG on depressive symptoms. However, only two (20%) of these studies employed a control group. Only two studies investigated the efficacy of a depression ISG and neither employed a control group. Studies with lower design quality tended to be associated with more positive outcomes (P = .07). Overall, studies of breast cancer ISGs were more likely to report a reduction in depressive symptoms than studies of other ISG types (Fisher P = .02), but it is possible that this finding was due to confounding design factors rather than the nature of the ISG. Conclusions There is a paucity of high-quality evidence concerning the efficacy or effectiveness of ISGs for depression. There is an urgent need to conduct high-quality randomized controlled trials of the efficacy of depression ISGs to inform the practice of consumers, practitioners, policy makers, and other relevant users and providers of online support groups.","[{'authorId': '4743339', 'name': 'K.

Firstly, the coevolution of emotional contagion and behavior is described by the tie strength between microblogs, that is, with the spread of emotional contagion, user behavior such as emotional expression will be affected. Then, based on user interaction and the correlation with target microblog, the Hawkes process is adopted to quantify the tie strength between microblogs so as to build the corresponding weighted network. Secondly, in the weighted network, the Deepwalk algorithm is used to build the sequence representation of microblogs which are similar to the target microblog. Next, a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention network (the convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory network with a multihead attention mechanism) is designed to analyze the sentiment analysis of target and similar microblogs.

2c7390a391975430f3b4c52e137adf9e8157ef04,"Generalized estimating equations (Liang and Zeger, 1986) is a widely used, moment-based procedure to estimate marginal regression parameters. However, a subtle and often overlooked point is that valid inference requires the mean for the response at time t to be expressed properly as a function of the complete past, present, and future values of any time-varying covariate. For example, with environmental exposures it may be necessary to express the response as a function of multiple lagged values of the covariate series. Despite the fact that multiple lagged covariates may be predictive of outcomes, researchers often focus interest on parameters in a 'cross-sectional' model, where the response is expressed as a function of a single lag in the covariate series. Cross-sectional models yield parameters with simple interpretations and avoid issues of collinearity associated with multiple lagged values of a covariate. Pepe and Anderson (1994), showed that parameter estimates for time-varying covariates may be biased unless the mean, given all past, present, and future covariate values, is equal to the cross-sectional mean or unless independence estimating equations are used. Although working independence avoids potential bias, many authors have shown that a poor choice for the response correlation model can lead to highly inefficient parameter estimates. The purpose of this paper is to study the bias-efficiency trade-off associated with working correlation choices for application with binary response data. We investigate data characteristics or design features (e.g. cluster size, overall response association, functional form of the response association, covariate distribution, and others) that influence the small and large sample characteristics of parameter estimates obtained from several different weighting schemes or equivalently 'working' covariance models. We find that the impact of covariance model choice depends highly on the specific structure of the data features, and that key aspects should be examined before choosing a weighting scheme.","[{'authorId': '1860244', 'name': 'J.

New evidence, however, has challenged this view by demonstrating that emotions, contrary to diseases, spread selectively rather than blindly because their transfer is controlled by social factors. Here, we take a closer look at this top-down social control of emotional contagion. We review literature on the moderating role of social factors in emotional contagion and emotional mimicry, a process often considered a basic mechanism of emotional contagion. We argue that top-down social processes controlling emotional mimicry may be explained by the correction hypothesis formulated to account for contrast effects in priming research. We also analyze whether similar corrective processes may be involved in less automatic mechanisms of emotional contagion, such as social appraisal. Finally, we propose that the modulating effects of social factors on emotional contagion and its mechanisms, similar to priming effects, may be interpreted within the framework of dual-process theories.","[{'authorId': '3416420', 'name': 'Monika Wróbel'}, {'authorId': '5203685', 'name': 'K.

In this article, we present meta-analyses of these 3 effects. The mean effect size was significant in each case, such that assimilation resulted in impressions biased toward the primes, whereas anchoring and correction resulted in impressions biased away from the primes. Additionally, moderator analyses uncovered a number of variables that influence the strength of these effects, such as applicability, processing capacity, and the type of response measure. Based on these results, we propose a general model of how irrelevant information can bias judgments, detailing when and why assimilation and contrast effects result from default and corrective processes.","[{'authorId': '2480852', 'name': 'J.

This study examines how trust and monetary reward influence nurses' job satisfaction and strengthen organisational commitment.


BACKGROUND
Hospitals with high nurse retention rates typically have fewer medical errors and better quality care for patients. Therefore, health care administrators should provide a trustworthy workplace and a satisfactory reward system to retain experienced and skilled nurses.


METHOD
This study adopts the partial least squares method for parameter estimates and hypotheses based on 797 valid questionnaires from registered nurses in a Taiwan medical centre.


RESULT
All hypotheses were supported. The results show that the perceived trust of and rewards for registered nurses significantly influence their job satisfaction and organisational commitment. Although the impact of rewards is slightly stronger than that of trust among nurses on job satisfaction, the influence of trust among nurses is significantly higher than that of reward on organisational commitment.


CONCLUSION
The results show that administrators should enhance trust among nurses, establish a fair and attractive reward system, and increase nurse job satisfaction to elevate their commitment to the organisation.


IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT
To build a high level of organisational commitment, developing trust among nurses and increasing job satisfaction are more critical than compensating with monetary incentives alone.","[{'authorId': '2930814', 'name': 'Chiu-Ping Hsu'}, {'authorId': '14901616', 'name': 'Chi-Yun Chiang'}, {'authorId': '47183744', 'name': 'Chia-Wen Chang'}, {'authorId': '2729133', 'name': 'Heng-Chiang Huang'}, {'authorId': '2116250190', 'name': 'Chia-Chen Chen'}]",29.0,,55.0,Enhancing the commitment of nurses to the organisation by means of trust and monetary reward.,2015.0

A substantial body of research supports the relationship between access to financial resources and health and well-being, both at individual and aggregated (e.g. national) levels of analysis. Yet, surprisingly little occupational health psychology research has paid attention to financial issues experienced specifically by those in the labour force. With these issues in mind, the overarching goal of the present paper was to address conceptual and measurement issues in the study of objective and subjective aspects of financial stress and review several assessment options available to occupational health psychology researchers for both aspects of financial stress. Where appropriate, we offer guidance to researchers about choices among various financial stress measures and identify issues that require further research attention.

 Subthreshold-depression and anxiety have been associated with significant impairments in adults. This study investigates the characteristics of adolescent subthreshold-depression and anxiety with a focus on suicidality, using both categorical and dimensional diagnostic models.


METHODS
 Data were drawn from the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) study, comprising 12,395 adolescents from 11 countries. Based on self-report, including Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and Paykel Suicide Scale (PSS) were administered to students. Based on BDI-II, adolescents were divided into three groups: nondepressed, subthreshold-depressed and depressed; based on the SAS, they were divided into nonanxiety, subthreshold-anxiety and anxiety groups. Analyses of Covariance were conducted on SDQ scores to explore psychopathology of the defined groups. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore the relationships between functional impairments, suicidality and subthreshold and full syndromes.


RESULTS
 Thirty-two percent of the adolescents were subthreshold-anxious and 5.8% anxious, 29.2% subthreshold-depressed and 10.5% depressed, with high comorbidity. Mean scores of SDQ of subthreshold-depressed/anxious were significantly higher than the mean scores of the nondepressed/nonanxious groups and significantly lower than those of the depressed/anxious groups. Both subthreshold and threshold-anxiety and depression were related to functional impairment and suicidality.


CONCLUSIONS
Subthreshold-depression and subthreshold-anxiety are associated with an increased burden of disease and suicide risk. These results highlight the importance of early identification of adolescent subthreshold-depression and anxiety to minimize suicide. Incorporating these subthreshold disorders into a diagnosis could provide a bridge between categorical and dimensional diagnostic models.","[{'authorId': '2325389', 'name': 'J.

Zebrafish are now gaining popularity in genetics, pharmacological and behavioural research. As a vertebrate, zebrafish share considerable genetic sequence similarity with humans and are being used as an animal model for various human disease conditions. The advantages of zebrafish in comparison to other common vertebrate models include high fecundity, low maintenance cost, transparent embryos, and rapid development. Due to the spur of interest in zebrafish research, the need to establish and maintain a productive zebrafish housing facility is also increasing. Although literature is available for the maintenance of a zebrafish laboratory, a concise video protocol is lacking. This video illustrates the protocol for regular housing, feeding, breeding and raising of zebrafish larvae. This process will help researchers to understand the natural behaviour and optimal conditions of zebrafish husbandry and hence troubleshoot experimental issues that originate from the fish husbandry conditions. This protocol will be of immense help to researchers planning to establish a zebrafish laboratory, and also to graduate students who are intending to use zebrafish as an animal model.","[{'authorId': '6075102', 'name': 'Avdesh Avdesh'}, {'authorId': '48622881', 'name': 'Mengqi Chen'}, {'authorId': '1398908353', 'name': 'M.

2d95f939ecbd8e07d1e796c719a6ea47c1aeb38f,"Significance Although the positive impact of social bonds on individual’s fitness has recently been demonstrated, the mechanisms underlying the motivation to form long-term associations remain largely unknown. Current evidence shows that oxytocin modulates social behavior but evidence of its effects in bond maintenance remains scant, especially in nonreproductive contexts. We provide evidence that in the domestic dog oxytocin enhances social motivation to approach and affiliate with conspecifics and human partners, which constitutes the basis for the formation of any stable social bond. Furthermore, endogenous oxytocin levels increased after dogs engaged in affiliation with their dog partners, indicating a stimulation of the oxytocin system during social interactions. Our findings highlight the important role that oxytocin has in the expression of sociality in mammals. Recent evidence suggests that enduring social bonds have fitness benefits. However, very little is known about the neural circuitry and neurochemistry underlying the formation and maintenance of stable social bonds outside reproductive contexts. Oxytocin (OT), a neuropeptide synthetized by the hypothalamus in mammals, regulates many complex forms of social behavior and cognition in both human and nonhuman animals. Animal research, however, has concentrated on monogamous mammals, and it remains unknown whether OT also modulates social bonds in nonreproductive contexts. In this study we provide behavioral evidence that exogenous OT promotes positive social behaviors in the domestic dog toward not only conspecifics but also human partners. Specifically, when sprayed with OT, dogs showed higher social orientation and affiliation toward their owners and higher affiliation and approach behaviors toward dog partners than when sprayed with placebo. Additionally, the exchange of socio-positive behaviors with dog partners triggered the release of endogenous OT, highlighting the involvement of OT in the development of social relationships in the domestic dog. These data provide new insight into the mechanisms that facilitate the maintenance of close social bonds beyond immediate reproductive interest or genetic ties and complement a growing body of evidence that identifies OT as one of the neurochemical foundations of sociality in mammalian species.","[{'authorId': '121494427', 'name': 'Teresa Romero'}, {'authorId': '8018629', 'name': 'M.

Findings support our hypotheses that joint consumption leads to similar patterns or “coherence” in moment-to-moment evaluations and that greater coherence leads to more positive retrospective evaluations. We trace the emergence of coherence to processes of mimicry and emotional contagion in experiment 1 by comparing evaluations for pairs of participants who could see each other's expression with pairs who could not do so and in experiment 2 by coding participants' facial expressions and head movements for direct evidence of contagion.,"[{'authorId': '1954510', 'name': 'S.

2dfe0e7e81f65716b09c590652a4dd8452c10294,"According to embodied cognition accounts, viewing others’ facial emotion can elicit the respective emotion representation in observers which entails simulations of sensory, motor, and contextual experiences. In line with that, published research found viewing others’ facial emotion to elicit automatic matched facial muscle activation, which was further found to facilitate emotion recognition. Perhaps making congruent facial muscle activity explicit produces an even greater recognition advantage. If there is conflicting sensory information, i.e., incongruent facial muscle activity, this might impede recognition. The effects of actively manipulating facial muscle activity on facial emotion recognition from videos were investigated across three experimental conditions: (a) explicit imitation of viewed facial emotional expressions (stimulus-congruent condition), (b) pen-holding with the lips (stimulus-incongruent condition), and (c) passive viewing (control condition). It was hypothesised that (1) experimental condition (a) and (b) result in greater facial muscle activity than (c), (2) experimental condition (a) increases emotion recognition accuracy from others’ faces compared to (c), (3) experimental condition (b) lowers recognition accuracy for expressions with a salient facial feature in the lower, but not the upper face area, compared to (c). Participants (42 males, 42 females) underwent a facial emotion recognition experiment (ADFES-BIV) while electromyography (EMG) was recorded from five facial muscle sites. The experimental conditions’ order was counter-balanced. Pen-holding caused stimulus-incongruent facial muscle activity for expressions with facial feature saliency in the lower face region, which reduced recognition of lower face region emotions. Explicit imitation caused stimulus-congruent facial muscle activity without modulating recognition. Methodological implications are discussed.","[{'authorId': '7249951', 'name': 'T.

The authors first identify different theoretical models of the HRM‐WB‐IOP relationship, which they then use to map research in the area. The results show that mutual gains conceptualisations play a dominant role in extant HRM‐WB‐IOP research, at the expense of alternative conflicting outcomes and mutual losses models, which are also shown to receive very limited empirical support across the 46 studies.

We discuss one specific form of emotional empathy--other-focused feelings evoked by perceiving another person in need. First, evidence is reviewed suggesting that there are at least two distinct types of congruent emotional responses to perceiving another in need: feelings of personal distress (e.g., alarmed, upset, worried, disturbed, distressed, troubled, etc.) and feelings of empathy (e.g., sympathetic, moved, compassionate, tender, warm, softhearted, etc.). Next, evidence is reviewed suggesting that these two emotional responses have different motivational consequences. Personal distress seems to evoke egoistic motivation to reduce one's own aversive arousal, as a traditional Hullian tension-reduction model would propose. Empathy does not. The motivation evoked by empathy may instead be altruistic, for the ultimate goal seems to be reduction of the other's need, not reduction of one's own aversive arousal. Overall, the recent empirical evidence appears to support the more differentiated view of emotion and motivation proposed long ago by McDougall, not the unitary view proposed by Hull and his followers.","[{'authorId': '2243828035', 'name': 'C.

The likelihood that a behavior is encoded in terms of a particular trait category is postulated to be a function of the relative accessibility of that category in memory. In addition, the trait category used to encode a particular behavior is thought to affect subsequent judgments of the person along dimensions to which it is directly or indirectly related. To test these hypotheses, subjects first performed a sentence construction task that activated concepts associated with either hostility (Experiment 1) or kindness (Experiment 2). As part of an ostensibly unrelated impression formation experiment, subjects later read a description of behaviors that were ambiguous with respect to hostility (kindness) and then rated the target person along a variety of trait dimensions. Ratings of the target along these dimensions increased with the number of times that the test concept had previously been activated in the sentence construction task and decreased with the time interval between these prior activations and presentation of the stimulus information to be encoded. Results suggest that category accessibility is a major determinant of the way in which social information is encoded into memory and subsequently used to make judgments.

Increasing evidence suggests that the perception of dynamic displays leads to enhanced facial mimicry, especially for happiness and anger. However, little is known about the impact of dynamic stimuli on facial mimicry for fear and disgust. To investigate this issue, facial EMG responses were recorded in the corrugator supercilii, levator labii, and lateral frontalis muscles, while participants viewed static (photos) and dynamic (videos) facial emotional expressions. Moreover, we tested whether emotional empathy modulated facial mimicry for emotional facial expressions. In accordance with our predictions, the highly empathic group responded with larger activity in the corrugator supercilii and levator labii muscles. Moreover, dynamic compared to static facial expressions of fear revealed enhanced mimicry in the high-empathic group in the frontalis and corrugator supercilii muscles. In the low-empathic group the facial reactions were not differentiated between fear and disgust for both dynamic and static facial expressions. We conclude that highly empathic subjects are more sensitive in their facial reactions to the facial expressions of fear and disgust compared to low empathetic counterparts. Our data confirms that personal characteristics, i.e., empathy traits as well as modality of the presented stimuli, modulate the strength of facial mimicry.

This article reviews and synthesizes empirical research assessing gender, ethnic, and cultural differences in emotional support in the effort to ascertain the extent and import of these differences. Particular attention is given to demographic differences in (a) the value placed on the emotional support skills of relationship partners, (b) the intentions or goals viewed as especially relevant in emotional support situations, and (c) the evaluation of distinct approaches to providing emotional support. Theoretical, methodological, and practical implications of the findings are explored.","[{'authorId': '9650846', 'name': 'B.

Sixty-four healthy participants were randomly assigned to one of these conditions. Effects were examined by means of self-report and physiological measures (blood pressure, heart rate, skin conductance level, and skin conductance response). All four methods produced comparable levels of self-reported anger, while harassment and interview produced the largest cardiovascular effects, and electrodermal activity increased more in reaction to harassment, interview, and punishment conditions compared to film. Thus, physiological reactivity was especially increased by anger-induction methods that included personal contact (harassment and interview). Regarding specificity of self-reported emotions, fear and frustration were the only emotions out of nine non-target emotions that increased in comparable degree to anger following film, interview, and punishment, while harassment produced more self-reported anger than fear. Possible explanations and further recommendations are discussed.","[{'authorId': '3487749', 'name': 'J. Lobbestael'}, {'authorId': '3058280', 'name': 'A. Arntz'}, {'authorId': '2100994', 'name': 'R.

Drawing on this specific property, the theory of social learning, and the most direct implications of emotional contagion, our pilot experiment (N = 49) aimed to test whether the exposure to others’ grateful interactions on Facebook enhances (a) users’ felt gratitude, (b) expressed gratitude, and (c) their subjective well-being. For the threefold purpose, we created ad hoc Facebook groups in which the exposure to some accomplices’ exchange of grateful messages for 2 weeks was experimentally manipulated and users’ felt/expressed gratitude and well-being were consequently assessed. Results partially supported both hypotheses. Observing others’ exchange of grateful posts/comments on Facebook appeared to enhance participants’ in-person expression of gratitude (i.e., self-reported gratitude expression within face-to-face interactions), but not their direct and subjective experiences of gratitude. Similarly, exposure to others’ grateful messages improved some components of subjective well-being, such as satisfaction with life, but not negative and positive affect. Taken together, however, our preliminary findings suggest for the first time that social networking sites may actually amplify the spreading of gratitude and its benefits. Implications of our results for professionals and future research in the field of health, education, and social media communication are discussed.","[{'authorId': '1789635536', 'name': 'S.

An important aspect of individual behaviour is emotion which plays a significant role in all aspects of human decision making. For example, heightened emotional states can lead people to take highly unexpected or irrational actions. One popular motivation for simulation of virtual crowds is to generate believable characters in movies and computer games. Recently the concept of serious games has been introduced in both academic and industrial circles. In this paper, we propose an emotion engine, based on modern appraisal theory, that is able to model various emotional crowd characteristics. This appraisal engine is capable of capturing the dynamics of emotional contagion and we show how different crowd composition can lead to different patterns of emotional contagion. In addition, we describe a serious game designed for training military personnel in peaceful crowd control. We evaluate this engine in the context of a property protection protest scenario where the players or soldiers are tasked to maintain a peaceful protest without violence. A systematic evaluation is presented which supports the facial validity of the emotion engine and our model of emotional contagion.","[{'authorId': '2477947', 'name': 'Heiko Aydt'}, {'authorId': '143737543', 'name': 'M.

These studies converge in support of the proposal that affective empathy--making inferences about how another person feels--engages at least the following areas: prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal gyrus, anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex, temporal pole, amygdala and temporoparietal junction. We hypothesized that right-sided lesions to any one of these structures, except temporoparietal junction, would cause impaired affective empathy (whereas bilateral damage to temporoparietal junction would be required to disrupt empathy). We studied 27 patients with acute right hemisphere ischaemic stroke and 24 neurologically intact inpatients on a test of affective empathy. Acute impairment of affective empathy was associated with infarcts in the hypothesized network, particularly temporal pole and anterior insula. All patients with impaired affective empathy were also impaired in comprehension of affective prosody, but many patients with impairments in prosodic comprehension had spared affective empathy. Patients with impaired affective empathy were older, but showed no difference in performance on tests of hemispatial neglect, volume of infarct or sex distribution compared with patients with intact affective empathy.","[{'authorId': '145990645', 'name': 'R.

This raises privacy concerns hard to address due to the constrained resources on mobile devices. In this paper, we identify fundamental tradeoffs among three metrics-utility, privacy, and efficiency-in an MC system and propose a flexible optimization framework that can be adjusted to any desired tradeoff point with joint efforts of MC platform and workers. Since the underlying optimization problems are NP-hard, we present efficient approximation algorithms to solve them. Since worker statistics are needed when tuning the optimization models, we use an efficient aggregation approach to collecting worker feedbacks while providing differential privacy guarantees.

Nonetheless, here we report the first experimental evidence that ants, Cataglyphis cursor, use precisely directed rescue behavior to free entrapped victims; equally important, they carefully discriminate between individuals in distress, offering aid only to nestmates. Our experiments simulate a natural situation, which we often observed in the field when collecting Catagyphis ants, causing sand to collapse in the process. Using a novel experimental technique that binds victims experimentally, we observed the behavior of separate, randomly chosen groups of 5 C. cursor nestmates under one of six conditions. In five of these conditions, a test stimulus (the “victim”) was ensnared with nylon thread and held partially beneath the sand. The test stimulus was either (1) an individual from the same colony; (2) an individual from a different colony of C cursor; (3) an ant from a different ant species; (4) a common prey item; or, (5) a motionless (chilled) nestmate. In the final condition, the test stimulus (6) consisted of the empty snare apparatus. Our results demonstrate that ants are able to recognize what, exactly, holds their relative in place and direct their behavior to that object, the snare, in particular. They begin by excavating sand, which exposes the nylon snare, transporting sand away from it, and then biting at the snare itself. Snare biting, a behavior never before reported in the literature, demonstrates that rescue behavior is far more sophisticated, exact and complexly organized than the simple forms of helping behavior already known, namely limb pulling and sand digging. That is, limb pulling and sand digging could be released directly by a chemical call for help and thus result from a very simple mechanism. However, it's difficult to see how this same releasing mechanism could guide rescuers to the precise location of the nylon thread, and enable them to target their bites to the thread itself.","[{'authorId': '4501414', 'name': 'E.

However, there is limited research examining the phenomenon of emotional contagion in social anxiety, which is the topic of the current study. Design and Methods An experimental design was used in which undergraduate psychology students (N = 128) were assigned to either an experimental condition (watching a video of a socially anxious presenter) or a control condition (watching a video of a nonanxious presenter). Various measures were administered to assess social anxiety, emotional contagion, state anxiety, and related constructs. Results After controlling for baseline anxiety levels, participants in the experimental condition reported significantly higher levels of anxiety during and immediately after watching the video compared to individuals in the control condition (multivariate analysis of covariance, analysis of variance). Similar results were found across both conditions in participants with higher levels of trait social anxiety and higher public speaking anxiety (moderated regression analyses). Conclusions The findings suggest that social anxiety may be emotionally contagious, and provides insight into the role that emotional contagion may play in the association between social anxiety and interpersonal functioning.","[{'authorId': '2007304873', 'name': 'Pam Shaw'}, {'authorId': '2006852318', 'name': 'G.

However, important additional insights regarding reasons why entertainment—education messages have effects can be derived from the processing of persuasive content in narrative messages. Elaboration likelihood approaches suggest that absorption in a narrative, and response to characters in a narrative, should enhance persuasive effects and suppress counterarguing if the implicit persuasive content is counterattitudinal. Also, persuasion mediators and moderators such as topic involvement should be reduced in importance. Evidence in support of these propositions are reviewed in this article.

However, customers frequently complain at the place where they receive the service, making an investigation of the impact of a service recovery on observing customers necessary.

In addition, this paper tests whether service quality perceptions mediate, and customers’ locus of control attributions moderate these relationships. Design/methodology/approach – Study 1 tests the main hypothesis using a scenario-based experiment in two settings (restaurant, retail).

These assumptions allow the classical view to ‘ring true’—to appear obvious and therefore pleasing—when compared to the seemingly complex and counter-intuitive constructionist approach. As an approach to understanding emotions, Ralph employs a version of functionalism. At the turn of the 20th century, functionalism was pressed into service to rescue the classical view of emotion in the face of mounting disconfirming evidence. And so it is today (for a list of disconfirming evidence, see Table 1 in Barrett, this issue). But functionalism brings with it a set of philosophical assumptions. When scientists like Ralph and I debate the nature of emotion, we are really deliberating over the validity of these assumptions (see Table 1, next page). My goal here is to highlight them and offer my point of view in hopes of moving the dialogue forward. I discuss Ralph’s classical view of emotion as an attempt to defend these assumptions while at the same time remaining responsive to the accumulating empirical evidence that calls them into doubt.","[{'authorId': '1731779', 'name': 'L.

Three competing emotion-based theories yield differential predictions dependent on arousal levels, mood congruence, and functional relevance of information respectively. The aim of this study was to determine the most informative framework to understand the effect of emotion-inducing music on the short-term recall of information about narratives. Ninety-five participants (range = 18–58 years) were randomly allocated to one of four groups differentiated by the type of music presented to them, which was either happy (n = 26), sad (n = 19), fearful (n = 25), or calm (n = 25). Participants listened to music, followed by a positively or negatively emotionally-valenced narrative, and free recall of the narrative was tested approximately five minutes later. The results provided strongest support for the mood congruence theory in this context. After exposure to positive music, recall of positive information was significantly greater than recall of negative information. Mood regulation ability moderated this effect, with symmetrical mood congruence observed in participants with a tendency to repair their negative moods. Music may therefore offer an effective means of facilitating encoding of information when the mood induced by preceding music is congruent with the valence of information learnt. While the arousal and function theories may be more informative in other contexts (for instance, when music is played following learning or longer-term recall is tested), the current findings may help to clarify some of the inconsistencies previously observed in the research on music-facilitated recall.","[{'authorId': '97945281', 'name': 'Michael Tesoriero'}, {'authorId': '4026280', 'name': 'N.

In the current study, we aimed to examine the flow and content of tweets, exploring the role of COVID-19 key events on the popular Twitter platform. Methods Using representative freely available data, we performed a focused, social media-based analysis to capture COVID-19 discussions on Twitter, considering sentiment and longitudinal trends between January 19 and March 3, 2020. Different populations of users were considered. Core discussions were explored measuring tweets’ sentiment, by both computing a polarity compound score with 95% Confidence Interval and using a transformer-based model, pretrained on a large corpus of COVID-19-related Tweets. Context-dependent meaning and emotion-specific features were considered. Results We gathered 3,308,476 tweets written in English. Since the first World Health Organization report (January 21), negative sentiment proportion of tweets gradually increased as expected, with amplifications following key events. Sentiment scores were increasingly negative among most active users. Tweets content and flow revealed an ongoing scenario in which the global emergency seems difficult to be emotionally managed, as shown by sentiment trajectories. Conclusions Integrating social media like Twitter as essential surveillance tools in the management of the pandemic and its waves might actually represent a novel preventive approach to hinder emotional contagion, disseminating reliable information and nurturing trust. There is the need to monitor and sustain healthy behaviors as well as community supports also via social media-based preventive interventions.","[{'authorId': '3482113', 'name': 'C.

The present study aimed to investigate this question by providing two groups of participants (both n = 30) with two different descriptions regarding the original context of a sad-sounding piece of film music; a description of a concentration camp scene or a description of a nature documentary. The results of these two groups were compared to previously collected data (N = 60), where participants listened to either the same, sad-sounding piece of music without a description, or to neutral-sounding music. The induced emotions were measured as objectively as possible using indirect memory and judgment tasks. The results suggest that contextual information about a musical piece may indeed influence the emotional effects of that piece, as the sad narrative description appeared to intensify the sadness induced by the sad-sounding piece. The narrative descriptions may have enhanced emotion induction via the visual imagery mechanism (suggested by Juslin & Västfjäll, 2008), as 80% of participants in both groups reported thinking about imagery related to the narrative descriptions provided.","[{'authorId': '6178537', 'name': 'J.

We identified four dimensions that make remote event viewing engaging: immersion, immediacy, interaction, and sociality. We find that both live streams and the more curated event content found on Snapchat are immersive and immediate, yet Snapchat Live Stories enable quickly switching among different views of the event. Live streams, on the other hand, offer real time interaction and sociality in a way that Snapchat Live Stories do not. However, the interaction's impact depends on comment volume, comment content, and relationship between viewer and broadcaster. We describe how people experience events remotely using these social media, and identify design opportunities around detecting exciting content, leveraging multiple viewpoints, and enabling interactivity to create engaging user experiences for remotely participating in events.","[{'authorId': '2431050', 'name': 'Oliver L.

34d2a5ae87f6565881724cbe9c54e31f45ff3ed7,"Emotions are believed to converge both through emotional mimicry and social appraisal. The present study compared contagion of anger and happiness. In Experiment 1, participants viewed dynamic angry and happy faces, with facial electromyography recorded from the zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii as emotional mimicry. Self-reported emotional experiences were analyzed as emotional contagion. Experiment 2 manipulated social appraisal as the gaze of expression toward the target. The results showed that there was emotional contagion for angry and happy expressions both in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. Experiment 1 indicated an overt mimicry pattern for happy faces, but not for angry faces. Experiment 2 found an influence of social appraisal on angry contagion but not on happy diffusion. The two experiments suggest that the underlying processes of emotional mimicry and social appraisal are differentially relevant for different emotional contagion, with happiness processing following a mimicry-based path to emotional contagion, and anger processing requiring social appraisal.","[{'authorId': '2072969342', 'name': 'Huan Deng'}, {'authorId': '3275763', 'name': 'Ping Hu'}]",30.0,"{'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology', 'volume': '8'}",37.0,Matching Your Face or Appraising the Situation: Two Paths to Emotional Contagion,2018.0

We assume all nodes in the network are in the susceptible state initially except the information source which is in the infected state. Susceptible nodes may then be infected by infected nodes, and infected nodes may recover and will not be infected again after recovery. Given a snapshot of the network, from which we know all infected nodes but cannot distinguish susceptible nodes and recovered nodes, the problem is to find the information source based on the snapshot and the network topology. We develop a sample path based approach where the estimator of the information source is chosen to be the root node associated with the sample path that most likely leads to the observed snapshot. We prove for infinite-trees, the estimator is a node that minimizes the maximum distance to the infected nodes. A reverse-infection algorithm is proposed to find such an estimator in general graphs. We prove that for g-regular trees such that gq > 1, where g is the node degree and q is the infection probability, the estimator is within a constant distance from the actual source with high probability, independent of the number of infected nodes and the time the snapshot is taken. Our simulation results show that for tree networks, the estimator produced by the reverse-infection algorithm is closer to the actual source than the one identified by the closeness centrality heuristic.","[{'authorId': '48442503', 'name': 'Kai Zhu'}, {'authorId': '145404653', 'name': 'Lei Ying'}]",288.0,,24.0,Information source detection in the SIR model: A sample path based approach,2012.0

Participants saw a series of pictures, each accompanied by a word, designed to yield a negative or benign meaning when combined. Participants were either free to combine the picture and word as they wished (Experiment 1) or instructed to integrate them using either a descriptive sentence or a mental image (Experiment 2). Emotional response was consistently greater following imagery than after producing a sentence. Experiment 2 also demonstrated the causal effect of imagery on emotion and evaluative learning. Additional participants in Experiment 2 described aloud their images/sentences. Independent ratings of descriptions indicated that, as well as being more emotional, images differed from sentences elicited by identical cues by greater similarity to memories, and greater involvement of sensations and specific events. Results support the hypothesis that imagery evokes stronger affective responses than does verbal processing, perhaps because of sensitivity of emotional brain regions to imagery, the similarity of imagery to perception, and to autobiographical episodes.","[{'authorId': '143612534', 'name': 'E.

Happiness was accompanied by left-sided activation in the anterior temporal region compared with disgust. No differences in asymmetry were found between emotions in the central and parietal regions. When data aggregated across positive films were compared to aggregate negative film data, no reliable differences in brain activity were found.

There is a close relationship between the display of aggression and stress coping strategies. In order to gain more insight into biochemical pathways associated with aggression and stress coping, we assessed behavioral and neurobiological responses in two genetically selected rodent models, namely wild house mice selectively bred for a short (SAL) and long (LAL) attack latency and Wistar rats bred for high (HAB) or low (LAB) anxiety-related behavior. Compared to their line counterparts, the SAL mice and the LAB rats display a high level of intermale aggression associated with a proactive coping style. Both the SAL mice and the LAB rats show a reduced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response to non-social stressors. However, when exposed to social stressors (resident-intruder, sensory contact), SAL mice show an attenuated HPA response, whereas LAB rats show an elevated HPA response. In both rodent lines, the display of aggression is associated with high neuronal activation in the central amygdala, but reduced neuronal activation in the lateral septum. Furthermore, in the lateral septum, SAL mice have a reduced vasopressinergic fiber network, and LAB rats show a decreased vasopressin release during the display of aggression. Moreover, the two lines show several indications of an increased serotonergic neurotransmission. The relevance of these findings in relation to high aggression and stress coping is discussed. In conclusion, exploring neurobiological systems in animals sharing relevant behavioral characteristics might be a useful approach to identify general mechanisms of action, which in turn can improve our understanding of specific behavioral symptoms in human psychiatric disorders.","[{'authorId': '6612301', 'name': 'A.

These algorithms have great power to shape users' experiences, yet users are often unaware of their presence. Whether it is useful to give users insight into these algorithms' existence or functionality and how such insight might affect their experience are open questions. To address them, we conducted a user study with 40 Facebook users to examine their perceptions of the Facebook News Feed curation algorithm. Surprisingly, more than half of the participants (62.5%) were not aware of the News Feed curation algorithm's existence at all. Initial reactions for these previously unaware participants were surprise and anger. We developed a system, FeedVis, to reveal the difference between the algorithmically curated and an unadulterated News Feed to users, and used it to study how users perceive this difference. Participants were most upset when close friends and family were not shown in their feeds. We also found participants often attributed missing stories to their friends' decisions to exclude them rather than to Facebook News Feed algorithm. By the end of the study, however, participants were mostly satisfied with the content on their feeds. Following up with participants two to six months after the study, we found that for most, satisfaction levels remained similar before and after becoming aware of the algorithm's presence, however, algorithmic awareness led to more active engagement with Facebook and bolstered overall feelings of control on the site.","[{'authorId': '2419451', 'name': 'Motahhare Eslami'}, {'authorId': '47171390', 'name': 'A.

Objective, automated measurements of facial action intensity were paired with continuous ratings of emotional valence to investigate this possibility. Degree of eye constriction (the Duchenne marker) and mouth opening were each uniquely associated with smile intensity and, independently, with cry-face intensity.

The authors argue that attitudes themselves are influenced by reference points, namely, the presumed attitudes of others. Whereas exposure to a group that acts as a contextual reference should cause attitude assimilation, exposure to a group that acts as a comparative reference should cause attitude contrast. In Study 1, participants subliminally primed with their political ingroup or outgroup endorsed more extreme political positions than did controls. Study 2 demonstrated that prime types known to uniquely facilitate assimilation and contrast enhanced the polarization effect in the ingroup and outgroup conditions, respectively. Study 3 established an important boundary condition for whether group salience produces attitude assimilation or contrast by showing that perceived closeness to the elderly moderates the direction and strength of the group priming effect. The results suggest that the transition from assimilation to contrast occurs when a group ceases to function as a context and becomes a comparison point.

Although considerable progress has been made in understanding the genetic basis of morphologic traits (for example, body size and coat color) in dogs and wolves, the genetic basis of their behavioral divergence is poorly understood. An integrative approach using both behavioral and genetic data is required to understand the molecular underpinnings of the various behavioral characteristics associated with domestication. We analyze a 5-Mb genomic region on chromosome 6 previously found to be under positive selection in domestic dog breeds. Deletion of this region in humans is linked to Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), a multisystem congenital disorder characterized by hypersocial behavior. We associate quantitative data on behavioral phenotypes symptomatic of WBS in humans with structural changes in the WBS locus in dogs. We find that hypersociability, a central feature of WBS, is also a core element of domestication that distinguishes dogs from wolves. We provide evidence that structural variants in GTF2I and GTF2IRD1, genes previously implicated in the behavioral phenotype of patients with WBS and contained within the WBS locus, contribute to extreme sociability in dogs. This finding suggests that there are commonalities in the genetic architecture of WBS and canine tameness and that directional selection may have targeted a unique set of linked behavioral genes of large phenotypic effect, allowing for rapid behavioral divergence of dogs and wolves, facilitating coexistence with humans.","[{'authorId': '4145140', 'name': 'B.

In the first model, the meaning of an emotion word is represented by IT2 FSs on valence, activation, and dominance scales. In the second model, the meaning of an emotion word is represented by answers to an open-ended set of questions from the game of Emotion Twenty Questions (EMO20Q). The notion of meaning in the two proposed models is made explicit using the Frege an framework of extensional and intensional components of meaning. Inter- and intra-subject uncertainty is captured by using IT2 FSs learned from interval approach surveys. Similarity and subsethood operators are used for comparing the meaning of pairs of words. For the first model, we apply similarity and subsethood operators for the task of translating one emotional vocabulary, represented as a computing with words (CWW) codebook, to another. This act of translation is shown to be an example of CWW that is extended to use the three scales of valence, activation, and dominance to represent a single variable. We experimentally evaluate the use of the first model for translations and mappings between vocabularies. Accuracy is high when using a small emotion vocabulary as an output, but performance decreases when the output vocabulary is larger. The second model was devised to deal with larger emotion vocabularies, but presents interesting technical challenges in that the set of scales underlying two different emotion words may not be the same. We evaluate the second model by comparing it with results from a single-slider survey. We discuss the theoretical insights that the two models allow and the advantages and disadvantages of each.","[{'authorId': '1764265', 'name': 'Ebrahim (Abe) Kazemzadeh'}, {'authorId': '2108057415', 'name': 'Sungbok Lee'}, {'authorId': '145254843', 'name': 'Shrikanth S.

367639f05f88b2deb8b3c2bed41958da62d705be,"Heterogeneous, “aggregated” patterns in the spatial distributions of individuals are almost universal across living organisms, from bacteria to higher vertebrates. Whereas specific features of aggregations are often visually striking to human eyes, a heuristic analysis based on human vision is usually not sufficient to answer fundamental questions about how and why organisms aggregate. What are the individual-level behavioral traits that give rise to these features? When qualitatively similar spatial patterns arise from purely physical mechanisms, are these patterns in organisms biologically significant, or are they simply epiphenomena that are likely characteristics of any set of interacting autonomous individuals? If specific features of spatial aggregations do confer advantages or disadvantages in the fitness of group members, how has evolution operated to shape individual behavior in balancing costs and benefits at the individual and group levels? Mathematical models of social behaviors such as schooling in fishes provide a promising avenue to address some of these questions. However, the literature on schooling models has lacked a common framework to objectively and quantitatively characterize relationships between individual-level behaviors and group-level patterns. In this paper, we briefly survey similarities and differences in behavioral algorithms and aggregation statistics among existing schooling models. We present preliminary results of our efforts to develop a modeling framework that synthesizes much of this previous work, and to identify relationships between behavioral parameters and group-level statistics.","[{'authorId': '21679677', 'name': 'J.

In real crowds of high density, people manoeuvring the crowd need to twist their torso to pass between others. Our proposed method does not use the traditional disc-shaped agent, but instead employs capsule-shaped agents, which enables us to plan such torso orientations. Contrary to other crowd simulation systems, which often focus on the movement of the entire crowd, our method distinguishes between active agents that try to manoeuvre through the crowd, and passive agents that have no incentive to move. We introduce the concept of a focus point to influence crowd agent orientation. Recorded data from real human crowds are used for validation, which shows that our proposed model produces equivalent paths for 85 percent of the validation set. Furthermore, we present a character animation technique that uses the results from our crowd model to generate torso-twisting and side-stepping characters.","[{'authorId': '2254958962', 'name': 'Sybren A.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a meta-analysis of research investigating GI symptoms among children with ASD. METHODS: We searched Medline, PsycINFO, and PubMed databases (1980–2012) in peer-reviewed journals. Analysis involved studies with a comparison group presenting quantitative data on GI symptoms using combinations of terms for ASD and GI indicators. The systematic search yielded 15 studies. We calculated effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Children with ASD experience significantly more general GI symptoms than comparison groups, with a standardized mean difference of 0.82 (0.24) and a corresponding odds ratio (OR) of 4.42 (95% CI, 1.90–10.28). Analysis also indicated higher rates of diarrhea (OR, 3.63; 95% CI, 1.82–7.23), constipation (OR, 3.86; 95% CI, 2.23–6.71), and abdominal pain (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.19–5.07). CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate greater prevalence of GI symptoms among children with ASD compared with control children. Identified studies involved high methodological variability and lack of comprehensive data prohibited analysis of GI pathophysiologies (eg, gastroesophageal reflux) typically associated with organic etiologies, limiting conclusions about the underpinnings of the observed association. Future research must address critical questions about the causes and long-term impact of GI symptoms in ASD. Such analyses will require more systematic research and clinical activities, including improved diagnostic screening, standardized assessment, and exploration of potential moderators (eg, dietary restrictions).","[{'authorId': '10188565', 'name': 'B.

The work is motivated by the aim to provide technology with competences in perceiving and producing the emotional and nonverbal behaviors required to sustain a conversational dialogue. We present the Sensitive Artificial Listener (SAL) scenario as a setting which seems particularly suited for the study of emotional and nonverbal behavior since it requires only very limited verbal understanding on the part of the machine. This scenario allows us to concentrate on nonverbal capabilities without having to address at the same time the challenges of spoken language understanding, task modeling, etc. We first report on three prototype versions of the SAL scenario in which the behavior of the Sensitive Artificial Listener characters was determined by a human operator. These prototypes served the purpose of verifying the effectiveness of the SAL scenario and allowed us to collect data required for building system components for analyzing and synthesizing the respective behaviors. We then describe the fully autonomous integrated real-time system we created, which combines incremental analysis of user behavior, dialogue management, and synthesis of speaker and listener behavior of a SAL character displayed as a virtual agent. We discuss principles that should underlie the evaluation of SAL-type systems. Since the system is designed for modularity and reuse and since it is publicly available, the SAL system has potential as a joint research tool in the affective computing research community.","[{'authorId': '144951065', 'name': 'M.

This effect revealed itself through an increased mental accessibility of cleansing-related concepts, a greater desire for cleansing products, and a greater likelihood of taking antiseptic wipes. Furthermore, we showed that physical cleansing alleviates the upsetting consequences of unethical behavior and reduces threats to one's moral self-image.

This paper focuses on reference groups as a source of brand associations, which can be linked to one's mental representation of self to meet self-verification or self-enhancement goals. We conceptualize this linkage at an aggregate level in terms of self-brand connections, i.e., the extent to which individuals have incorporated a brand into their self-concept. Two studies show that brands used by member groups and aspiration groups can become connected to consumers' mental representation of self as they use these brands to define and create their self-concepts. Results from Experiment 1 show that the degree to which member group and aspiration group usage influences individual self-brand connections is contingent upon the degree to which the individual belongs to a member group or wishes to belong to an aspiration group. Experiment 2 finds that for individuals with self-enhancement goals, aspiration group brand use has a greater impact on self-brand connections; for individuals with self-verification goals, on the other hand, member group use has a greater impact.","[{'authorId': '46260604', 'name': 'Jennifer Edson Escalas'}, {'authorId': '38028485', 'name': 'J.

Employee wellbeing is an important issue for mental health services. Poor employee wellbeing (i.e., high levels of burnout or low job satisfaction) is associated with poorer consumer outcomes and higher staff turnover. This study set out to examine factors related to job satisfaction, turnover intention and burnout in a group of occupational therapists in mental health.


METHOD
Thirty-four occupational therapists (response rate approximately 60%) in a metropolitan public mental health service participated in a whole-of-service workforce survey. The survey included measures of job satisfaction, turnover intention, burnout, job hindrances, job challenges and job resources and questions about positive and negative aspects of positions and factors that attracted employees to their current position.


RESULTS
Burnout was associated with lower job satisfaction and higher turnover intention. Higher job satisfaction was associated with rewards (remuneration and recognition) as well as cognitively challenging work. The variables most significantly associated with poorer wellbeing (higher turnover intention and burnout) were recipient contact demands (perception that contact with service users or families was demanding), and feelings of stress or fatigue.


CONCLUSION
This study provides a detailed analysis of factors associated with job satisfaction, turnover intention and burnout in a group of occupational therapists working in mental health. To promote workforce wellbeing and enhanced retention, interventions to minimise burnout should be implemented and evaluated. These strategies should focus on enhancing job resources such as supervisor support, feedback and participation in decision making as well as building the personal resilience of occupational therapists working in mental health.","[{'authorId': '2988602', 'name': 'J.

It integrates three major affective characteristics: emotions, moods and personality that cover short, medium, and long term affect. The use of this model consists of two phases: In the preparation phase appraisal rules and personality profiles for characters must be specified with the help of AffectML - our XML based affect modeling language. In the runtime phase, the specified appraisal rules are used to compute real-time emotions and moods as results of a subjective appraisal of relevant input. The computed affective characteristics are represented in AffectML and can be processed by sub-sequent modules that control the cognitive processes and physical behavior of embodied conversational characters. ALMA is part of the VirtualHuman project which develops interactive virtual characters that serve as dialog partners with human-like conversational skills. ALMA provides our virtual humans with a personality profile and with real-time emotions and moods.

Through simulation, researchers can identify causal effects, specify critical parameter estimates, and clarify the state of the art with respect to what is understood about how processes evolve over time. Moreover, simulation methods are often the most time-effective and cost-effective means of doing so and sometimes are the only means.

Further, organizational scholars and practitioners frequently appear to assume that emotionality is the antithesis of rationality and, thus, frequently hold a pejorative view of emotion. This has led to four institutionalized mechanisms for regulating the experience and expression of emotion in the workplace: (1) neutralizing, (2) buffering, (3) prescribing, and (4) normalizing emotion. In contrast to this perspective, we argue that emotionality and rationality are interpenetrated, emotions are an integral and inseparable part of organizational life, and emotions are often functional for the organization. This argument is illustrated by applications to motivation, leadership, and group dynamics.","[{'authorId': '1966232', 'name': 'Blake E. Ashforth'}, {'authorId': '5995795', 'name': 'R.

39251ea8ef407d241b608d11a8d91ff7ada6f9b0,"Emotional contagion is a primitive form of empathy that does not need higher psychological functions. Recent studies reported that emotional contagion exists not only between humans but also among various animal species. The dog (Canis familiaris) is a unique animal and the oldest domesticated species. Dogs have coexisted with humans for more than 30,000 years and are woven into human society as partners bonding with humans. Dogs have acquired human-like communication skills and, likely as a result of the domestication process, the ability to read human emotions; therefore, it is feasible that there may be emotional contagion between human and dogs. However, the higher time-resolution of measurement of emotional contagion between them is yet to be conducted. We assessed the emotional reactions of dogs and humans by heart rate variability (HRV), which reflects emotion, under a psychological stress condition on the owners. The correlation coefficients of heart beat (R-R) intervals (RRI), the standard deviations of all RR intervals (SDNN), and the square root of the mean of the sum of the square of differences between adjacent RR intervals (RMSSD) between dogs and owners were positively correlated with the duration of dog ownership. Dogs’ sex also influenced the correlation coefficients of the RRI, SDNN, and RMSSD in the control condition; female showed stronger values. These results suggest that emotional contagion from owner to dog can occur especially in females and the time sharing the same environment is the key factor in inducing the efficacy of emotional contagion.","[{'authorId': '2457303', 'name': 'Maki Katayama'}, {'authorId': '35200320', 'name': 'Takatomi Kubo'}, {'authorId': '31877068', 'name': 'T.

39bde290382ee2c88427097b62331bf20d8fa612,"Background: In order to provide effective care to patients suffering from chronic pain secondary to neurological diseases, health professionals must appraise the role of the psychosocial factors in the genesis and maintenance of this condition whilst considering how emotions and cognitions influence the course of treatment. Furthermore, it is important not only to recognize the psychological reactions to pain that are common to the various conditions, but also to evaluate how these syndromes differ with regards to the psychological factors that may be involved. As an extensive evaluation of these factors is still lacking, the Italian Consensus Conference on Pain in Neurorehabilitation (ICCPN) aimed to collate the evidence available across these topics. Objectives: To determine the psychological factors which are associated with or predictive of pain secondary to neurological conditions and to assess the influence of these aspects on the outcome of neurorehabilitation. Methods: Two reviews were performed. In the first, a PUBMED search of the studies assessing the association between psychological factors and pain or the predictive value of these aspects with respect to chronic pain was conducted. The included papers were then rated with regards to their methodological quality and recommendations were made accordingly. In the second study, the same methodology was used to collect the available evidence on the predictive role of psychological factors on the therapeutic response to pain treatments in the setting of neurorehabilitation. Results: The first literature search identified 1170 results and the final database included 189 articles. Factors such as depression, anxiety, pain catastrophizing, coping strategies, and cognitive functions were found to be associated with pain across the various conditions. However, there are differences between chronic musculoskeletal pain, migraine, neuropathy, and conditions associated with complex disability with regards to the psychological aspects that are involved. The second PUBMED search yielded 252 studies, which were all evaluated. Anxiety, depression, pain catastrophizing, coping strategies, and pain beliefs were found to be associated to different degrees with the outcomes of multidisciplinary programs, surgery, physical therapies, and psychological interventions. Finally, sense of presence was found to be related to the effectiveness of virtual reality as a distraction tool. Conclusions: Several psychological factors are associated with pain secondary to neurological conditions and should be acknowledged and addressed in order to effectively treat this condition. These factors also predict the therapeutic response to the neurorehabilitative interventions.","[{'authorId': '3331953', 'name': 'G. Castelnuovo'}, {'authorId': '4518999', 'name': 'E.

Going through very dense groups or around huge ones would not seem natural and could break any sense of presence in a virtual environment. This paper aims to enable crowd simulators to handle such situations correctly. To this end, we need to understand how real humans decide to go through or around groups. As a first hypothesis, we apply the Principle of Minimum Energy (PME) on different group sizes and density. According to this principle, a walker should go around small and dense groups whereas he should go through large and sparse groups. Such principle has already been used for crowd simulation; the novelty here is to apply it to decide on a global avoidance strategy instead of local adaptations only. Our study quantifies decision thresholds. However, PME leaves some inconclusive situations for which the two solutions paths have similar energetic costs. In a second part, we propose an experiment to corroborate PME decisions thresholds with real observations. As controlling the factors of an experiment with many people is extremely hard, we propose to use Virtual Reality as a new method to observe human behavior. This work represents the first crowd simulation algorithm component directly designed from a VR-based study. We also consider the role of secondary factors in inconclusive situations. We show the influence of the group appearance and direction of relative motion in the decision process. Finally, we draw some guidelines to integrate our conclusions to existing crowd simulators and show an example of such integration. We evaluate the achieved improvements.","[{'authorId': '2123864', 'name': 'Julien Bruneau'}, {'authorId': '1851306', 'name': 'A. Olivier'}, {'authorId': '2235773', 'name': 'J.

We give a multi-agent individual decision-making framework, in which the action direction of each pedestrian (called agent) is determined by the distance of the agent to the exits, the number and density of agents and obstacles within the view field of the agent. Different from the existing results, we divide all the pedestrians in the stadium into four classes: young male, young female, old male and old female. In evacuation process, the weighting that affects individual decision-making between each class of agents is different. In the simulation, we consider two cases: (I) two exits are both unclogged, and (II) one of the two exits is totally clogged. In both cases, two typical scenes are simulated: (a) there is no obstacle and the agents are distributed randomly, and (b) there are obstacles and the agents are put regularly. In addition, we further analyze the effect of the exit width to the evacuation efficiency. The simulation can reproduce exactly the actual pedestrian evacuation process. Therefore, the proposed method might be useful to assess public buildings design.","[{'authorId': '2113456699', 'name': 'Zhang Lei'}, {'authorId': '31012286', 'name': 'Wang Jinhuan'}, {'authorId': '31174021', 'name': 'Shi Qiongyu'}, {'authorId': '2053914617', 'name': 'Zang Ting'}]",8.0,,12.0,A new dynamic cellular automaton model for pedestrian evacuation process in stadium,2013.0

Differences between subjects high and low in emotional empathy were investigated. The parameters compared were facial mimicry reactions, as represented by electromyographic (EMG) activity when subjects were exposed to pictures of angry or happy faces, and the degree of correspondence between subjects' facial EMG reactions and their self-reported feelings. The comparisons were made at different stimulus exposure times in order to elicit reactions at different levels of information processing. The high-empathy subjects were found to have a higher degree of mimicking behavior than the low-empathy subjects, a difference that emerged at short exposure times (17-40 ms) that represented automatic reactions. The low-empathy subjects tended already at short exposure times (17-40 ms) to show inverse zygomaticus muscle reactions, namely ""smiling"" when exposed to an angry face. The high-empathy group was characterized by a significantly higher correspondence between facial expressions and self-reported feelings. No differences were found between the high- and low-empathy subjects in their verbally reported feelings when presented a happy or an angry face. Thus, the differences between the groups in emotional empathy appeared to be related to differences in automatic somatic reactions to facial stimuli rather than to differences in their conscious interpretation of the emotional situation.","[{'authorId': '1404580609', 'name': 'M.

This paper reconciles negative illusions with previous research on positive illusions by showing that individuals hold positive illusions before a task but become disillusioned during task performance. Post-performance disillusionment is stronger when people experience a larger contrast between the targets they set before a task and their actual performance. Group members also experience disillusionment but manage to maintain their positive illusions. Group activity produces higher mean levels of positive affect (the enthusiasm effect), and severs the relationship between negative affect and performance evaluations (the buffering effect). An analysis shows that these two effects hold across six studies. Although previous literature has highlighted the enthusiasm effect of group activity, the buffering effect increases performance evaluations three times more.","[{'authorId': '36117819', 'name': 'C.

As a result of confirmatory factor analyses, it has been demonstrated that the structure of R-UCLA is three-factorial, the factors presents as follows: (1) intimate others, referring to the feeling of exclusion; (2) social others, referring to the lack of closeness and support in relationships; and (3) belonging and affiliation, referring to the lack of community bonds—all of which are reliable in their measurement as well as the total score of R-UCLA. Moreover, we demonstrated that the feeling of loneliness is positively related with shyness and negatively related with self-esteem.

3acd7216b91c610581e7f81d181032ed35ed354c,"Cognitive-experiential self-theory (CEST) is a psychodynamic theory of personality that achieves a high degree of integration through a synthesis of the psychodynamic, emotional unconscious of psychoanalysis, the affect-free unconscious of cognitive science, and principles of learning theory. According to CEST, people operate by two information-processing systems, a predominantly conscious, verbal, rational system and a predominantly preconscious, automatic, experiential, learning system. The two systems operate in parallel by different rules and are interactive. The influence of the experiential system on the rational system can account for everything that the psychoanalytic unconscious can and, unlike the latter, to do so in a manner consistent with evolutionary principles and cognitive science. An extensive research program is described that provides support for many of the assumptions in CEST, including the operating principles of the experiential system and the interaction of the two systems. The implications of the theory are discussed for psychotherapy and psychological research. According to CEST, there are three basic ways in which psychotherapeutic change can occur: by using the rational system to correct the experiential system, by learning directly from emotionally significant experience, and by communicating with the experiential system in its own medium (e.g., fantasy, imagery, metaphor). It is important in research to take into account the two processing systems and their influence on each other, rather than following the more customary procedure of assuming there is a single, unified system.

Study 1 used a scenario depicting a front-desk agent performing check-in procedures and Study 2 used a scenario depicting a restaurant server. Data were analyzed using Hayes’ (2013) PROCESS macro.,Study 1 demonstrated the mediating effect of perceived interpersonal skills in the relations between front desk agent attractiveness and participant positive word-of-mouth and service satisfaction. Study 2 reaffirmed this finding and showed that the attractiveness of servers positively impacted participants’ perceptions of the servers’ interpersonal skill and participants’ tipping behavior. Furthermore, the relation between attractiveness and interpersonal skills was moderated by servers’ genders and participants’ levels of self-esteem, such that the effect was stronger in response to female servers for participants with relatively low self-esteem. In addition, the effect of the three-way interaction among server gender, server’s level of attractiveness, and participant’s level of self-esteem on tipping was mediated by participant’s perceived interpersonal skills.,This paper investigated the under-researched constructs of participants’ self-esteem and service providers’ gender and their moderating roles within the service context. These results suggest that responses to service providers can be impacted by the attractiveness and gender of the provider and customers’ self-esteems, despite equivalent objective performance of the provider.","[{'authorId': '5180164', 'name': 'S.

A model was specified and tested as a prediction model for health and safety. First, a parsimonious model was specified. The model consisted of perceived job insecurity (as a stressor), organizational factors (information quality, leadership style, work task administration), and short-term stress reactions (job dissatisfaction, reduced work motivation). Second, the model was tested as a prediction model in three separate path analyses, in order to examine the model's contribution in explaining (1) physical health complaints, (2) mental health complaints, and (3) risk taking behavior. A quota sample of Norwegian employees (N= 1,002) was obtained by means of a self-completion questionnaire survey.

We consider the case in which each agent navigates independently without explicit communication with other agents. Our formulation is an extension of the Velocity Obstacle concept [3], which was introduced for navigation among (passively) moving obstacles. Our approach takes into account the reactive behavior of the other agents by implicitly assuming that the other agents make a similar collision-avoidance reasoning. We show that this method guarantees safe and oscillation- free motions for each of the agents. We apply our concept to navigation of hundreds of agents in densely populated environments containing both static and moving obstacles, and we show that real-time and scalable performance is achieved in such challenging scenarios.","[{'authorId': '144721873', 'name': 'J.

3b2e420b95d33a202ec07cfd9a8ca577f8159a21,"(1) Background: The current outbreak of COVID-19 infection is an ongoing challenge and a major threat to public health that requires surveillance, prompt diagnosis, as well as research efforts to understand the viral pathogenesis. Despite this, to date, very few studies have been performed concerning autoptic specimens. Therefore, this study aimed: (i) to reiterate the importance of the autoptic examination, the only method able to precisely define the cause of death; (ii) to provide a complete post-mortem histological and immunohistochemical investigation pattern capable of diagnosing death from COVID-19 infection. (2) Methods: In this paper, the lung examination of two subjects who died from COVID-19 are discussed, comparing the obtained data with those of the control, a newborn who died from pneumonia in the same pandemic period. (3) Results: The results of the present study suggest that COVID-19 infection can cause different forms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), due to diffuse alveolar damage and diffuse endothelial damage. Nevertheless, different patterns of cellular and cytokine expression are associated with anti-COVID-19 antibody positivity, compared to the control case. Moreover, in both case studies, it is interesting to note that COVID-19, ACE2 and FVIII positivity was detected in the same fields. (4) Conclusions: COVID-19 infection has been initially classified as exclusively interstitial pneumonia with varying degrees of severity. Subsequently, vascular biomarkers showed that it can also be considered a vascular disease. The data on Factor VIII discussed in this paper, although preliminary and limited in number, seem to suggest that the thrombogenicity of Sars-CoV2 infection might be linked to widespread endothelial damage. In this way, it would be very important to investigate the pro-coagulative substrate both in all subjects who died and in COVID-19 survivors. This is because it may be hypothesized that the different patterns with which the pathology is expressed could depend on different individual susceptibility to infection or a different personal genetic-clinical background. In light of these findings, it would be important to perform more post-mortem investigations in order to clarify all aspects of the vascular hypothesis in the COVID-19 infection.","[{'authorId': '4712263', 'name': 'L.

3b4043c1ea0b391bcc56310be25415fce852e5a3,"Pedestrian merging flows are common in a stairs evacuation process, which involves complex interactions among pedestrians that substantially restrict the efficiency of the stairs evacuation process. Analyzing the pedestrian merging flows process and improving the efficiency of stairs evacuation are urgent and essential tasks. A novel simplified stairs evacuation model for simulating and analyzing the stairs evacuation process, which considers the impact of merging flows, is proposed in this process. The dynamic pedestrian output rate of a floor platform is calculated by the number of pedestrians on the floor platform. The merging ratio determined by the design size of stairs is adopted to determine the ratio between the stairs pedestrian flow and the floor pedestrian flow in the pedestrian output rate of the floor platform. To evaluate the stairs evacuation process is divided into three stages based on the pedestrian merging flows process, and the evacuation time at each stage is computed by the dynamic pedestrian output rate of the floor platform. The stairs evacuation capacity is calculated by the evacuation time and the number of pedestrians. A case study of a six-floor building evacuation is investigated, and the reliability and feasibility of the proposed model is verified. By establishing different merging ratios, the optimal merging ratio is obtained by comparing the evacuation capacities of different merging ratios, which provides a reference of stairs design for designers.","[{'authorId': '47410953', 'name': 'Xia-zhong Zheng'}, {'authorId': '2064865719', 'name': 'D.

However, most of this work examines the impact of firm-specific resources on the overall performance of a firm. In this paper it is argued that, in some circumstances, adopting the effectiveness of business processes as a dependent variable may be more appropriate than adopting overall firm performance as a dependent variable. This idea is tested by examining the determinants of the effectiveness of the customer service business process in a sample of North American insurance companies. Results are consistent with resource-based expectations, and they show that distinctive advantages observable at the process level are not necessarily reflected in firm level performance.

So it is very significant for society management or marketing strategies to detect emotional communities in social networks. Based on the emotional homophily of users in social networks, it could confirm that users would like to gather together to form communities according to emotional similarity. This paper exploits multivariate emotional behaviors of users to measure users’ emotional similarity, then takes advantage of users’ emotional similarity as edge weight to remodel an emotional network and detect communities. The detailed process of detecting emotional communities is as follows: 1) an emotional network is constructed and emotional homophily in experimental dataset is verified; 2) both CNM and BGLL algorithms are employed to detect emotional communities in emotional network, and emotional characters of each community are analyzed; 3) in order to verify the superiority of emotional network for detecting emotional communities, 1 unweighted network and 3 other weighted and undirected networks are constructed as comparison. Comparison experiments indicate that the emotional network is more suitable for detecting emotional communities, the users’ emotional behaviors are more similar and denser in identical communities of emotional network than the contrastive networks’ communities. key words: emotional similarity, emotional homophily, emotional network, emotional community","[{'authorId': '2146281345', 'name': 'Jiang Zhu'}, {'authorId': '1735282', 'name': 'Bai Wang'}, {'authorId': '145965599', 'name': 'Bin Wu'}, {'authorId': '2107988786', 'name': 'Weiyu Zhang'}]",10.0,,29.0,Emotional Community Detection in Social Network,2017.0

Consistent with the notion that positive emotions help build personal resources, positive emotional expression correlated with the self-reported personality traits of affiliation, competence, and low negative emotionality across adulthood and predicted changes in competence and negative emotionality. Observers rated women displaying more positive emotion more favorably on several personality dimensions and expected interactions with them to be more rewarding; thus, demonstrating the beneficial social consequences of positive emotions. Finally, positive emotional expression predicted favorable outcomes in marriage and personal well-being up to 30 years later.

The authors use network linkage data from the population-based Framingham Heart Study to trace the topography of loneliness in people's social networks and the path through which loneliness spreads through these networks. Results indicated that loneliness occurs in clusters, extends up to 3 degrees of separation, is disproportionately represented at the periphery of social networks, and spreads through a contagious process. The spread of loneliness was found to be stronger than the spread of perceived social connections, stronger for friends than family members, and stronger for women than for men. The results advance understanding of the broad social forces that drive loneliness and suggest that efforts to reduce loneliness in society may benefit by aggressively targeting the people in the periphery to help repair their social networks and to create a protective barrier against loneliness that can keep the whole network from unraveling.

3be7ef2564d05670da2bdb5f2175bc4ab31de415,"ABSTRACT Facial mimicry has long been considered a main mechanism underlying emotional contagion (i.e. the transfer of emotions between people). A closer look at the empirical evidence, however, reveals that although these two phenomena often co-occur, the changes in emotional expressions may not necessarily be causally linked to the changes in subjective emotional experience. Here, we directly investigate this link, by testing a model in which facial activity served as a mediator between the observed emotional displays and subsequently felt emotions (i.e. emotional contagion). Participants watched videos of different senders displaying happiness, anger, or sadness, while their facial activity was recorded. After each video, participants rated their own emotions and assessed the senders’ likeability and competence. Participants both mimicked and reported feeling the emotions displayed by the senders. Moreover, their facial activity partially explained the association between the senders’ emotional displays and self-reported emotions, thereby supporting the notion that facial mimicry may be involved in emotional contagion.","[{'authorId': '4135033', 'name': 'M.

3c274445bd1bb8f4a6df7c53cd4289bc3c49d9a7,"Summary The past decades have seen mounting evidence that parasites alter their host’s behaviour in ways that benefit transmission, based on differences in the expression of behavioural traits between infected and control individuals, or on significant correlations between trait expression and infection levels. The multidimensional nature of host manipulation has only recently been recognised: parasites do not target single host traits, but instead suites of interrelated traits. Here, I use recent research on animal personality (behavioural differences among individuals consistent across time and situations) and behavioural syndromes (correlations at the population level among distinct behavioural traits, or between the same trait expressed in different contexts) to provide a framework from which simple testable patterns of host behavioural changes can be predicted. Following infection, a manipulative parasite could (i) change the temporal consistency of its host’s behavioural responses, (ii) change the slope of a host reaction norm, i.e. the way host behavioural traits are expressed as a function of an environmental gradient, or (iii) decouple two or more host behavioural traits and/or change the way in which they correlate with each other. Two case studies involving trematode parasites and their freshwater hosts are used to provide empirical illustrations of the above scenarios. These clearly illustrate the full richness of behavioural alterations induced by parasites, and how these effects would go unnoticed using the classical trait-by-trait comparisons of mean values between parasitised and non-parasitised individuals. However, the power of animal personality and behavioural syndromes to inform research on host manipulation by parasites will only be fully realised when underlying mechanisms are elucidated and linked to their phenotypic impacts.","[{'authorId': '145836042', 'name': 'R.

3c28037eff0c6c262f24d4ea27b151e010fa37ad,"Abstract Researchers have wondered how the brain creates emotions since the early days of psychological science. With a surge of studies in affective neuroscience in recent decades, scientists are poised to answer this question. In this target article, we present a meta-analytic summary of the neuroimaging literature on human emotion. We compare the locationist approach (i.e., the hypothesis that discrete emotion categories consistently and specifically correspond to distinct brain regions) with the psychological constructionist approach (i.e., the hypothesis that discrete emotion categories are constructed of more general brain networks not specific to those categories) to better understand the brain basis of emotion. We review both locationist and psychological constructionist hypotheses of brain–emotion correspondence and report meta-analytic findings bearing on these hypotheses. Overall, we found little evidence that discrete emotion categories can be consistently and specifically localized to distinct brain regions. Instead, we found evidence that is consistent with a psychological constructionist approach to the mind: A set of interacting brain regions commonly involved in basic psychological operations of both an emotional and non-emotional nature are active during emotion experience and perception across a range of discrete emotion categories.","[{'authorId': '2593387', 'name': 'Kristen A.

Although research on leadership and team processes have shown a positive relation between transformational leadership and workers' well-being, there is a lack of studies examining the “black box” of this association. The present study aimed to assess the mediation effect of team emotional intelligence (TEI) of the management team on the relationship between management's transformational behaviors and employees' responses. Data were gathered from two sources: 1,566 managers grouped into 188 teams pertaining to a total of 90 firms, and 4,564 workers from the same 90 firms.

3ca86ed8bcf50ef4dcf2661759d6e32a11a26c84,"Autism is a complex spectrum of disorders characterized by core behavioral deficits in social interaction, communication, repetitive stereotyped behaviors and restricted interests. Autism frequently presents with additional cognitive symptoms, including attentional deficits and intellectual disability. Preclinical models are important tools for studying the behavioral domains and biological underpinnings of autism, and potential treatment targets. The inbred BTBR T+tf/J (BTBR) mouse strain has been used as an animal model of core behavioral deficits in autism. BTBR mice exhibit repetitive behaviors and deficits in sociability and communication, but other aspects of their cognitive phenotype, including attentional performance, are not well characterized. We examined the attentional abilities of BTBR mice in the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) using an automated touchscreen testing apparatus. The 5-CSRTT is an analogue of the human continuous performance task of attention, and so both the task and apparatus have translational relevance to human touchscreen cognitive testing. We also measured basal extracellular levels of a panel of neurotransmitters within the medial prefrontal cortex, a brain region critically important for performing the 5-CSRTT. We found that BTBR mice have increased impulsivity, defined as an inability to withhold responding, and decreased motivation, as compared to C57Bl/6J mice. Both of these features characterize attentional deficit disorders in humans. BTBR mice also display decreased accuracy in detecting short stimuli, lower basal levels of extracellular acetylcholine and higher levels of kynurenic acid within the prefrontal cortex. Intact cholinergic transmission in prefrontal cortex is required for accurate performance of the 5-CSRTT, consequently this cholinergic deficit may underlie less accurate performance in BTBR mice. Based on our findings that BTBR mice have attentional impairments and alterations in a key neural substrate of attention, we propose that they may be valuable for studying mechanisms for treatment of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with attention deficits and autism.","[{'authorId': '35028454', 'name': 'Stephanie M.

However, the question of whether titles and artist names affect listeners when evaluating music has not yet been investigated. By using two well-known cognitive heuristics, the authors investigated whether names presented with music pieces influenced aesthetic and value judgments of music. Experiment 1 (N 48) focused on linguistic fluency. The same music excerpts were presented with easy-to-pronounce (fluent) and difficult-to-pronounce (disfluent) names. Experiment 2 (N 100) studied the affect heuristic. The same music excerpts were presented with positive (e.g., Kiss), negative (e.g., Suicide), and neutral (e.g., Window) titles. In both studies, aesthetic and value judgments of music were significantly influenced by the linguistic manipulation of the names. Participants in Experiment 1 evaluated the same music more positively when presented with fluent names compared to disfluent names. In Experiment 2, presenting the music with negative titles resulted in the lowest judgments. Moreover, music excerpts presented with neutral and negative titles were remembered significantly more often than positive titles. Finally, a comparison of the music presented with and without titles indicated that music excerpts were more liked in the presence of titles than in their absence. The present research shows different ways in which aesthetic and value judgments can be influenced by the names presented with music. Results suggest that like any other human judgment, evaluations of music also rely on heuristic principles that do not necessarily depend on the aesthetic stimuli themselves.","[{'authorId': '1405036163', 'name': 'Manuel Anglada-Tort'}, {'authorId': '153393992', 'name': 'J.

We report a quantitative meta-analysis of 212 studies (N = 80,850 participants) that measured the associations between coping and emotion regulation with symptoms of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Within the meta-analysis we address the association of broad domains of coping and emotion regulation (e.g., total coping, emotion regulation), intermediate factors of coping and emotion regulation (e.g., primary control coping, secondary control coping), and specific coping and emotion regulation strategies (e.g., emotional expression, cognitive reappraisal) with internalizing and externalizing symptoms. For cross-sectional studies, which made up the majority of studies included, we examine 3 potential moderators: age, measure quality, and single versus multiple informants. Finally, we separately consider findings from longitudinal studies as these provide stronger tests of the effects. After accounting for publication bias, findings indicate that the broad domain of emotion regulation and adaptive coping and the factors of primary control coping and secondary control coping are related to lower levels of symptoms of psychopathology. Further, the domain of maladaptive coping, the factor of disengagement coping, and the strategies of emotional suppression, avoidance, and denial are related to higher levels of symptoms of psychopathology.

We advance a new conceptual model of the 2 processing modes. The structural basis of the new model is the idea, supported by psychological and neuropsychological evidence, that humans possess 2 memory systems. One system slowly learns general regularities, whereas the other can quickly form representations of unique or novel events. Associative retrieval or pattern completion in the slow-learning system elicited by a salient cue constitutes the effortless processing mode. The second processing mode is more conscious and effortful; it involves the intentional retrieval of explicit, symbolically represented rulesfrom either memory system and their use to guide processing. After presenting our model, we review existing dual-process models in several areas, emphasizing their similar assumptions of a quick, effortless processing mode that rests on well-learned prior associations and a second, more effortful processing mode that involves rule-based inferences and is employed only when people have both cognitive capacity and motivation.

Purpose
This study aims to examine the impacts of restaurant servers’ actions on the customers’ emotional contagion and the impacts of customers’ emotional contagion on their intention to tip and the likelihood of tipping. This study also explores social compliance and examines its impacts on customers’ intentions to tip and the likelihood of tipping.


Design/methodology/approach
Taking a restaurant in Taiwan as an example, this study uses questionnaires to investigate five constructs of the research framework, which are restaurant servers’ actions, restaurant customers’ susceptibility to emotional contagion, customers’ intention to tip, customers’ likelihood of tipping and customers’ social compliance. The questionnaires were distributed online using Surveycake website. A total of 310 completed questionnaires were collected.


Findings
The results indicate the following: restaurant servers’ actions positively affect customers’ susceptibility to emotional contagion; customers’ emotional contagion positively affects their intention to tip and likelihood of tipping; customers’ social compliance positively affects their intentions to tip and the likelihood of tipping; and customers’ emotional contagion partially mediates the effects of restaurant servers’ actions on customers’ intention to tip and likelihood of tipping.


Originality/value
The hypothesis test results in this article not only successfully integrate or confirm the research findings of past scholars, but also expand the scope of research on related topics. Furthermore, the research findings of this study provide restaurant practitioners with rich marketing implications.

Although several authors have suggested a role of the mirror neuron system in interpersonal coupling, the underlying brain mechanisms are not well understood. Here we argue that more general theories of neural computations, namely predictive coding and the Free Energy Principle, could explain interpersonal coordination dynamics. Each brain minimizes coding costs by reducing the mismatch between the representations of observed and own motor behavior. Continuous mutual prediction and alignment result in an overall minimization of free energy, thus forming a stable attractor state.","[{'authorId': '2676203', 'name': 'L.

The massive amount of microblogging data is a useful and timely source that carries mass sentiment and opinions on various topics. Existing sentiment analysis approaches often assume that texts are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), usually focusing on building a sophisticated feature space to handle noisy and short texts, without taking advantage of the fact that the microblogs are networked data. Inspired by the social sciences findings that sentiment consistency and emotional contagion are observed in social networks, we investigate whether social relations can help sentiment analysis by proposing a Sociological Approach to handling Noisy and short Texts (SANT) for sentiment classification. In particular, we present a mathematical optimization formulation that incorporates the sentiment consistency and emotional contagion theories into the supervised learning process; and utilize sparse learning to tackle noisy texts in microblogging. An empirical study of two real-world Twitter datasets shows the superior performance of our framework in handling noisy and short tweets.","[{'authorId': '2109724368', 'name': 'Xia Hu'}, {'authorId': '38414402', 'name': 'Lei Tang'}, {'authorId': '1736632', 'name': 'Jiliang Tang'}, {'authorId': '38746648', 'name': 'Huan Liu'}]",390.0,,44.0,Exploiting social relations for sentiment analysis in microblogging,2013.0

In conditions characterized by too high levels of demands, employees may suffer from burnout. When job resources are high, they are likely to feel engaged with their work. Burnout in turn can be seen as an inhibitor of innovativeness, and work engagement as an antecedent to innovativeness, mediating the effects of resources and demands at work on innovativeness. We further argue that innovativeness can function as a resource or a demand, depending on how it is managed. In addition to understanding the dual role of innovativeness, the identification of job-specific demands and resources is central to supporting employee well-being and, subsequently, innovativeness. The implications of the proposed conceptual framework for academic researchers and managers are discussed.","[{'authorId': '113814154', 'name': 'H.

Emotional Response Theory (ERT) frames results—in particular, students’ responses illustrate the emotions outlined in ERT, including pleasure/displeasure, dominance/submissiveness, and arousal/nonarousal (Mottet, Frymier, & Beebe, 2006). Additionally, other emotional responses not originally conceptualized within ERT were found. Implications for instructional communication theory and future research directions are discussed.","[{'authorId': '10775154', 'name': 'Mark A. Generous'}, {'authorId': '2571620', 'name': 'M.

By following a data-driven approach focusing on User-Generated Content, we aimed to detect potential binge drinkers through the investigation of their language and shared topics. First, we gathered Twitter threads quoting BD and alcohol-related behaviours, by considering unequivocal keywords, identified by experts, from previous evidence on BD. Subsequently, a random sample of the gathered tweets was manually labelled, and two supervised learning classifiers were trained on both linguistic and metadata features, to classify tweets of genuine unique users with respect to media, bot, and commercial accounts. Based on this classification, we observed that approximately 55% of the 1 million alcohol-related collected tweets was automatically identified as belonging to non-genuine users. A third classifier was then trained on a subset of manually labelled tweets among those previously identified as belonging to genuine accounts, to automatically identify potential binge drinkers based only on linguistic features. On average, users classified as binge drinkers were quite similar to the standard genuine Twitter users in our sample. Nonetheless, the analysis of social media contents of genuine users reporting risky behaviours remains a promising source for informed preventive programs.","[{'authorId': '3482113', 'name': 'C.

Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) is a useful tool for social scientists because it allows for the comparison of response-variable means across multiple groups. MANOVA requires that the observations are independent, the response variables are multivariate normally distributed, and the covariance matrix of the response variables is homogeneous across groups. When the assumptions of normality and homogeneous covariance matrices are not met, past research has shown that the type I error rate of the standard MANOVA test statistics can be inflated while their power can be attenuated. The current study compares the performance of a nonparametric alternative to one of the standard parametric test statistics when these two assumptions are not met. Results show that when the assumption of homogeneous covariance matrices is not met, the nonparametric approach has a lower type I error rate and higher power than the most robust parametric statistic.

Our focus is on Twitter and its usage during the 2008 Presidential Debates. We find that analysis of Twitter usage patterns around this media event can yield significant insights into the semantic structure and content of the media object. Specifically, we find that the level of Twitter activity serves as a predictor of changes in topics in the media event. Further we find that conversational cues can identify the key players in the media object and that the content of the Twitter posts can somewhat reflect the topics of discussion in the media object, but are mostly evaluative, in that they express the poster's reaction to the media. The key contribution of this work is an analysis of the practice of microblogging live events and the core metrics that can leveraged to evaluate and analyze this activity. Finally, we offer suggestions on how our model of segmentation and node identification could apply towards any live, real-time arbitrary event.","[{'authorId': '1760364', 'name': 'David A.

This study investigates the level of, and factors associated with, HCP job satisfaction in the national primary healthcare (PHC) network in Lebanon. The study adopts a cross-sectional design to survey HCP at 99 PHC centres distributed across the country between October 2013 and May 2014. The study questionnaire consisted of four sections: socio-demographics/professional background, employment characteristics, level of job satisfaction (Measure of Job Satisfaction scale) and level of professional burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory-HSS scale). A total of 1,000 providers completed the questionnaire (75.8% response rate). Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to identify factors significantly associated with job satisfaction. Findings of the study highlight an overall mean job satisfaction score of 3.59 (SD 0.54) indicating that HCP are partially satisfied. Upon further examination, HCP were least satisfied with pay, training and job prospects. Gender, age, career plans, salary, exposure to violence, and level of burnout were significantly associated with the overall level of job satisfaction which was also associated with increased likelihood to quit. Overall, the study highlights how compensation, development and protection of PHC HCP can influence their job satisfaction. Recommendations include the necessity of developing a nationally representative committee, led by the Ministry of Public Health, to examine the policies and remuneration scales within the PHC sector and suggest mechanisms to bridge the pay differential with other sectors. The effective engagement of key stakeholders with the development, organisation and evaluation of professional development programmes offered to HCP in the PHC sector remains crucial. Concerned stakeholders should assess and formulate initiatives and programmes that enrich the physical, psychological and professional well-being of their HCP. The aforementioned suggestions are necessary to strengthen and sustain PHC HCP and support the provision of universal health coverage to the Lebanese population.","[{'authorId': '3876257', 'name': 'M.

Spatial models are being used with increasing frequency to help characterize these large-scale patterns and to evaluate the impact of interventions.

A comprehensive, integrative autopsy series that advances the mechanistic discussion surrounding this disease process is still lacking. METHODS Autopsies were performed at the Mount Sinai Hospital on 67 COVID-19 positive patients and data from the clinical records were obtained from the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse. The experimental design included a comprehensive microscopic examination carried out by a team of expert pathologists, along with transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, RNA in situ hybridization, as well as immunology and serology assays. RESULTS Laboratory results of our COVID-19 cohort show elevated inflammatory markers, abnormal coagulation values, and elevated cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and TNF. Autopsies revealed large pulmonary emboli in four cases. We report microthrombi in multiple organ systems including the brain, as well as conspicuous hemophagocytosis and a secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like syndrome in many of our patients. We provide electron microscopic, immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical evidence of the presence of the virus and the ACE2 receptor in our samples. CONCLUSIONS We report a comprehensive autopsy series of 67 COVID-19 positive patients revealing that this disease, so far conceptualized as a primarily respiratory viral illness, also causes endothelial dysfunction, a hypercoagulable state, and an imbalance of both the innate and adaptive immune responses. Novel findings reported here include an endothelial phenotype of ACE2 in selected organs, which correlates with clotting abnormalities and thrombotic microangiopathy, addressing the prominent coagulopathy and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Another original observation is that of macrophage activation syndrome, with hemophagocytosis and a hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like disorder, underlying the microangiopathy and excessive cytokine release.

This usually takes place within species; however, in the case of domestic dogs, it might be advantageous to recognize the emotions of humans as well as other dogs. In this sense, the combination of visual and auditory cues to categorize others' emotions facilitates the information processing and indicates high-level cognitive representations. Using a cross-modal preferential looking paradigm, we presented dogs with either human or dog faces with different emotional valences (happy/playful versus angry/aggressive) paired with a single vocalization from the same individual with either a positive or negative valence or Brownian noise. Dogs looked significantly longer at the face whose expression was congruent to the valence of vocalization, for both conspecifics and heterospecifics, an ability previously known only in humans. These results demonstrate that dogs can extract and integrate bimodal sensory emotional information, and discriminate between positive and negative emotions from both humans and dogs.","[{'authorId': '39447287', 'name': 'Natalia Albuquerque'}, {'authorId': '144187925', 'name': 'K.

Research suggests that mimicry is a subtle and flexible social behavior which plays an important role for communication and affiliation. However, fundamental questions like why and how people mimic still remain unclear. In this paper, we evaluate past theories of why people mimic and the brain systems that implement mimicry in social psychology and cognitive neuroscience. By reviewing recent behavioral and neuroimaging studies on the control of mimicry by social signals, we conclude that the subtlety and sophistication of mimicry in social contexts reflect a social top-down response modulation (STORM) which increases one's social advantage and this mechanism is most likely implemented by medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We suggest that this STORM account of mimicry is important for our understanding of social behavior and social cognition, and provides implications for future research in autism.","[{'authorId': '113310304', 'name': 'Y.

In this paper, we propose a framework of crowd formation via hierarchical planning, which includes cooperative-task, coordinated-behaviour and action-control planning. In cooperative-task planning, we improve the grid potential field to achieve global path planning for a team. In coordinated-behaviour planning, we propose a time-space table to arrange behaviour scheduling for a movement. In action-control planning, we combine the gaze-movement angle model and fuzzy logic control to achieve agent action. Our method has several advantages: (1) The hierarchical architecture is guaranteed to match the human decision process from high to low intelligence. (2) The agent plans his behaviour only with the local information of his neighbour; the global intelligence of the group emerges from these local interactions. (3) The time-space table fully utilizes the three-dimensional information. Our method is verified using crowds of various densities, from sparse to dense crowds, using quantitative performance measures. The approach is independent of the simulation model and can be extended to other crowd simulation tasks.","[{'authorId': '2290516', 'name': 'Xingce Wang'}, {'authorId': '2143066643', 'name': 'Na Liu'}, {'authorId': '1452343658', 'name': 'Shaolong Liu'}, {'authorId': '38103919', 'name': 'Zhongke Wu'}, {'authorId': '40426830', 'name': 'Mingquan Zhou'}, {'authorId': '2153101420', 'name': 'Jiale He'}, {'authorId': '2112625435', 'name': 'Peng Cheng'}, {'authorId': '1679209', 'name': 'C.

Nonetheless, recent work in our laboratories has revealed several new patterns of rescue behavior that appear to be much more complex than previously studied forms. This precisely-directed rescue behavior bears a remarkable resemblance to what has been labeled empathy in rats, and thus raises numerous philosophical and theoretical questions: How should rescue behavior (or empathy) be defined? What distinguishes rescue from other forms of altruism? In what ways is rescue behavior in ants different from, and similar to, rescue in other non-human animals? What selection pressures dictate its appearance? In this paper, we review our own experimental studies of rescue in both laboratory and field, which, taken together, begin to reveal some of the behavioral ecological conditions that likely have given rise to rescue behavior in ants. Against this background, we also address important theoretical questions involving rescue, including those outlined above. In this way, we hope not only to encourage further experimental analysis of rescue behavior, but also to highlight important similarities and differences in very distant taxa.","[{'authorId': '3010031', 'name': 'K.

To address this uncertainty, this paper attempts to systematically examine the impact of CMV on the inferences drawn from survey research in the IS area. First, we describe the available approaches for assessing CMV and conduct an empirical study to compare them. From an actual survey involving 227 respondents, we find that although CMV is present in the research areas examined, such biases are not substantial. The results also suggest that few differences exist between the relatively new marker-variable technique and other well-established conventional tools in terms of their ability to detect CMV. Accordingly, the marker-variable technique was employed to infer the effect of CMV on correlations from previously published studies. Our findings, based on the reanalysis of 216 correlations, suggest that the inflated correlation caused by CMV may be expected to be on the order of 0.10 or less, and most of the originally significant correlations remain significant even after controlling for CMV. Finally, by extending the marker-variable technique, we examined the effect of CMV on structural relationships in past literature. Our reanalysis reveals that contrary to the concerns of some skeptics, CMV-adjusted structural relationships not only remain largely significant but also are not statistically differentiable from uncorrected estimates. In summary, this comprehensive and systematic analysis offers initial evidence that (1) the marker-variable technique can serve as a convenient, yet effective, tool for accounting for CMV, and (2) common method biases in the IS domain are not as serious as those found in other disciplines.","[{'authorId': '40240832', 'name': 'N.

However, only recently has there been an increased focus on evaluating the fidelity of the results with respect to real-world situations. The focus to date has been on analyzing the properties of low-level features such as pedestrian trajectories, or global features such as crowd densities. We propose the first approach based on finding semantic information represented by latent Path Patterns  in both real and simulated data in order to analyze and compare them. Unsupervised clustering by non-parametric Bayesian inference is used to learn the patterns, which themselves provide a rich visualization of the crowd behavior. To this end, we present a new Stochastic Variational Dual Hierarchical Dirichlet Process ( SV-DHDP) model. The fidelity of the patterns is computed with respect to a reference, thus allowing the outputs of different algorithms to be compared with each other and/or with real data accordingly. Detailed evaluations and comparisons with existing metrics show that our method is a good alternative for comparing crowd data at a different level and also works with more types of data, holds fewer assumptions and is more robust to noise.","[{'authorId': '2149698569', 'name': 'He Wang'}, {'authorId': '2050262', 'name': 'Jan Ondřej'}, {'authorId': '1404017833', 'name': ""C.

While most people do not feel strongly that receiving “enough” Likes is important, roughly two-thirds of posters regularly receive more than “enough.” We also note a “Like paradox,” a phenomenon in which people's friends receive more Likes because their friends have more friends to provide those Likes. Individuals with lower levels of self-esteem and higher levels of self-monitoring are more likely to think that Likes are important and to feel bad if they do not receive “enough” Likes.

Major results were (a) comparison direction varied with relationship with the target; (b) precomparison negative mood led more often to upward comparison than to downward comparison, supporting a selective affect-cognition priming model in which dysphoria primes negative thoughts about the self (Bower, 1991; Forgas, Bower, & Moylan, 1990) rather than a motivational self-enhancement model (Wills, 1981,1991); (c) upward comparison decreased subjective well-being, whereas downward comparison increased it; and (d) high self-esteem individuals engaged in more self-enhancing comparison.

A new edited book (Suls & Wills, 1991), a symposium at the 1990 meeting of the Society for Experimental Social Psychology (SESP), and frequent journal articles attest to this vigor. Yet underlying the vitality is a feeling of uneasiness, obvious in the comments occasioned by the SESP symposium, in which a group of extraordinari ly knowledgeable participants showed little agreement about such apparently basic questions as ""Do people compare at all (or very much)? When do people compare? How do people balance upward and downward comparisons? How much does similarity count in comparison? Do people compare with actual targets, or are all comparisons constructed in people's heads? The problem is that there are many measures of social comparison, and they do not agree well with one another, leading to theoretical proliferation lacking a coherent empirical base. These measures may not agree with one another because of difficulties with the measures themselves (Wood, 1991), because they measure different motives for social comparison (cf. Wood & Taylor, 1991), or because they have been used in different contexts.

In North America alone, ∼30% of individuals who witness a traumatic event develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). While effects of direct trauma are evident, consequences of indirect or secondary trauma are often ignored. Also unclear is the role of social support in the consequences of these experiences. The social defeat paradigm, which involves aggressive encounters by a large Long-Evans male rat (resident) towards a smaller Sprague-Dawley male rat (intruder), is considered a rodent model of PTSD. We have modified this model to create a trauma witness model (TWM) and have used our TWM model to also evaluate social support effects. Basically, when an intruder rat is placed into the home cage of a resident rat, it encounters an agonistic behavior resulting in intruder subordination. The socially defeated intruder is designated the SD rat. A second rat, the cage mate of the SD, is positioned to witness the event and is the trauma witnessing (TW) rat. Experiments were performed in two different experimental conditions. In one, the SD and TW rats were cagemates and acclimatized together. Then, one SD rat was subjected to three sessions of social defeat for 7 d. TW rat witnessed these events. After each social defeat exposure, the TW and SD rats were housed together. In the second, the TW and SD rats were housed separately starting after the first defeat. At the end of each protocol, depression-anxiety-like behavior and memory tests were conducted on the SD and TW rats, blood withdrawn and specific organs collected. Witnessing traumatic events led to depression- and anxiety-like behavior and produced memory deficits in TW rats associated with elevated corticosterone levels.","[{'authorId': '6436418', 'name': 'G.

Results suggest that fear appeals are indeed processed differently for high and low involvement products. However, attitudes toward the brand did not significantly differ according to product involvement levels.

To test the construct validity of the short-form version of the Depression anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21), and in particular, to assess whether stress as indexed by this measure is synonymous with negative affectivity (NA) or whether it represents a related, but distinct, construct. To provide normative data for the general adult population.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional, correlational and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).


METHODS
The DASS-21 was administered to a non-clinical sample, broadly representative of the general adult UK population (N = 1,794). Competing models of the latent structure of the DASS-21 were evaluated using CFA.


RESULTS
The model with optimal fit (RCFI = 0.94) had a quadripartite structure, and consisted of a general factor of psychological distress plus orthogonal specific factors of depression, anxiety, and stress. This model was a significantly better fit than a competing model that tested the possibility that the Stress scale simply measures NA.


CONCLUSIONS
The DASS-21 subscales can validly be used to measure the dimensions of depression, anxiety, and stress. However, each of these subscales also taps a more general dimension of psychological distress or NA. The utility of the measure is enhanced by the provision of normative data based on a large sample.","[{'authorId': '2149900272', 'name': 'J. Henry'}, {'authorId': '144723673', 'name': 'J.

Election seasons are rife with episodic disagreements that erupt across news cycles, each a ripple in a larger ideological exchange. In democratic politics, controversy plays a crucial role in the peaceful transference of power. Sometimes its configurations change and become much more deadly, as domestic disputes change, and rush outwards with international consequences. Thus, with the scope of vast weather systems and disturbances, macro-disputes swirl and eddy across the globe. As important as electoral debates and politics may be, the controversies of science and technology supercede localizing disagreements by bringing into contention the vulnerabilities of culture to its own tenuous interface with the natural world and by opening up new horizons of conceptual and material change. On the negative side, science and technology controversies generally alert society and its institutions to the loss of degrees of freedom in maintaining a sustainable culture. On the positive side, they open up promises of overcoming nature's limits or offsetting technology's bi-products in the short and long term. Since science cannot escape its openness to probabilities and since technologies are inherently risky, contemporary controversies gather into themselves tensions between approach and avoidance, fear and hope, risk and security. Indeed, as the projects of modernity multiply and spread over space and time, the domain of controversy itself widens, and with these epistemic, cultural, social, technical and political phenomena the practices of communicative reasoning are ever more greatly challenged. ""Today, there is no doubt that controversies about scientific and science-related questions are becoming increasingly frequent and consequential upon policymaking as well as general public consciousness,"" writes Thomas Brante, who concludes that ""the sheer quantity of science-based controversies in modern society makes them interesting phenomena per se"" (188). In fact, the area of science and technology is so very rich in controversy that one is tempted to resist Gerald Markle and James Petersen, Ronald Gier and others who establish protocols and modes of analysis. Instead, let us not theorize the spaces of contention, but leave the field of controversy study open, and not a little unorganized-without decisive categories, unreduced to predictive processes (initiation, development, resolution, and revision), and free from genre constraints. It indeed may be the case that each science/ technology controversy is itself a singularity, drawing into the vortex of disagreement procedural methods, substantive claims, intersubjectively shared assumptions, personal and political risk configurations, legal authorizations, social presumptions, and institutional prerogatives. Our studies should resist the reduction of controversy to an epiphenomenon, an intrusion of ethnocentrism, a problem with identifiable patterns and predictable strategies of advocacy, with each instance awaiting proper resolution; rather let us hold that controversies persist as an ineradicable feature of all exchange. If all controversies are singularities, then what can be learned from a given controversy about aspects of the tenuous hold of the human projects of communication itself, in this case from inquiry into the ""natural"" world? The generative power of science and technology controversies may be appraised as a contest between modernity and traditional culture. The conflicts between community and society, between lifeworld and systems-world, engender over and over again the story of the fall from enthrallment to disenchantment. For the nineteenth century, for instance, the guarantee of progress allowed society to write off the stunning waste created by industrialization as a step toward progress; yet, in the efficient slaughter of the first world war and the technologically abetted savagery of the second, the equation between the self-correcting prospects of scientized excess and the price of progress in war-making threw the promise into disrepute. …","[{'authorId': '40997912', 'name': 'G.

The review shows that a great deal of the confusion surrounding the term is due to the fact that the phenomena involved in contagion are extremely heterogeneous, yet they typically have been placed under homogeneous rubrics. Accordingly, we propose herein that contagion should be conceptualized as a general type, social contagion, and three subtypes: disinhibitory, echo, and hysterical. In this article, we have distinguished social contagion and its subtypes from other types of social influence phenomena and reclassified theoretical and research articles under the newly proposed definitions. The proposed reconceptualization shows how contradictions in the literature can be resolved by distinguishing the type of contagion in question and provides the foundation for a more comprehensive and useful psychology of contagion.","[{'authorId': '47969462', 'name': 'D.

42e1b4c2b60baed1ee771a08946e2f430e0a6f15,"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a critical role in the generation and regulation of emotion. However, we lack an integrative framework for understanding how different emotion-related functions are organized across the entire expanse of the PFC, as prior reviews have generally focused on specific emotional processes (e.g., decision making) or specific anatomical regions (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex). Additionally, psychological theories and neuroscientific investigations have proceeded largely independently because of the lack of a common framework. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of functional neuroimaging, electrophysiological, lesion, and structural connectivity studies on the emotion-related functions of 8 subregions spanning the entire PFC. We introduce the appraisal-by-content model, which provides a new framework for integrating the diverse range of empirical findings. Within this framework, appraisal serves as a unifying principle for understanding the PFC’s role in emotion, while relative content-specialization serves as a differentiating principle for understanding the role of each subregion. A synthesis of data from affective, social, and cognitive neuroscience studies suggests that different PFC subregions are preferentially involved in assigning value to specific types of inputs: exteroceptive sensations, episodic memories and imagined future events, viscero-sensory signals, viscero-motor signals, actions, others’ mental states (e.g., intentions), self-related information, and ongoing emotions. We discuss the implications of this integrative framework for understanding emotion regulation, value-based decision making, emotional salience, and refining theoretical models of emotion. This framework provides a unified understanding of how emotional processes are organized across PFC subregions and generates new hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying adaptive and maladaptive emotional functioning.","[{'authorId': '4296355', 'name': 'Matthew L.

However, the phenomenon of vicarious anxiety—the experience of anxiety in response to observing others expressing anxiety—and the interpersonal mechanisms underlying it have not been fully investigated in prior research. In 4 studies, we investigate the role of empathy in experiencing vicarious anxiety, using film clips depicting target victims facing threats. In Studies 1 and 2, trait emotional empathy was associated with greater self-reported anxiety when observing target victims, and with perceiving greater anxiety to be experienced by the targets. Study 3 extended these findings by demonstrating that trait empathic concern—the tendency to feel concern and compassion for others—was associated with experiencing vicarious anxiety, whereas trait personal distress—the tendency to experience distress in stressful situations—was not. Study 4 manipulated state empathy to establish a causal relationship between empathy and experience of vicarious anxiety. Participants who took an empathic perspective when observing target victims, as compared to those who took an objective perspective using reappraisal-based strategies, reported experiencing greater anxiety, risk-aversion, and sleep disruption the following night. These results highlight the impact of one’s social environment on experiencing anxiety, particularly for those who are highly empathic. In addition, these findings have implications for extending basic models of anxiety to incorporate interpersonal processes, understanding the role of empathy in social learning, and potential applications for therapeutic contexts.","[{'authorId': '2174637', 'name': 'Jocelyn Shu'}, {'authorId': '40269007', 'name': 'S.

From a life-span perspective, normative age changes in emotion regulation may be more salient applying the same methodological approach on a broad age range examining both growth and decline during development. In addition, emotion-specific developmental patterns might show differential developmental trends. The present study examined age differences in seven emotion regulation strategies from early adolescence (age 11) to middle adulthood (age 50) for the three emotions of sadness, fear, and anger. The results showed specific developmental changes in the use of emotion regulation strategies for each of the three emotions. In addition, results suggest age-specific increases and decreases in many emotion regulation strategies, with a general trend to increasing adaptive emotion regulation. Specifically, middle adolescence shows the smallest emotion regulation strategy repertoire. Gender differences appeared for most emotion regulation strategies. The findings suggest that the development of emotion regulation should be studied in an emotion-specific manner, as a perspective solely on general emotion regulation either under- or overestimates existing emotion-specific developmental changes.","[{'authorId': '50742788', 'name': 'P.

Mo exerts a synergistic effect on the orexin system, controls energy expenditure and strengthens the ability of the individual to exercise. Some view Mo as a drug that enhances sports performance, since it induces a prolonged wakefulness and decreasing the sense of fatigue. These characteristics being similar to conventional stimulants have allowed Mo to emerge as a novel stimulant requiring medico-legal considerations.

However, there was no difference in the self-reported level of joviality between participants in the two conditions.

Participants viewed pictures of happy and angry expressions while the activity over their cheek and brow muscle region was monitored with electromyography (EMG).

The goal of the present research is to understand why it is that nonconscious mimicry has consequences that go beyond the dyad.

Much of the existing OCR research focuses on quantifiable OCR features such as star ratings and volume. More research that examines the influence of review elements, aside from numeric ratings, such as the verbatim text, particularly in services contexts is needed. The purpose of this research is to investigate the impact of service failures on consumer arousal and emotions.,The authors present three behavioral experiments that manipulate service failure and linguistic elements of OCRs by using galvanic skin response, survey measures and automated facial expression analysis.,Negative OCRs lead to the greatest levels of arousal when consumers read OCRs. Service failure severity impacts anger, and referential cohesion, an observable property of text that helps a reader better understand ideas in the text, negatively moderates the relationship between service failure severity and anger.,The authors are among the first to empirically test the effect of emotional contagion in a user-generated content context, demonstrating that it can occur when consumers read such content, even if they did not experience the events being described. The research uses a self-report and physiological measures to assess consumer perceptions, arousal and emotions related to service failures, increasing the robustness of the literature. These findings contribute to the marketing literature on OCRs in service failures, physiological measures of consumers’ emotions, the negativity bias and emotional contagion in a user-generated content context.","[{'authorId': '13020863', 'name': 'Alexa K.

Thirty-two participants listened to 12 music pieces differing in terms of a priori basic emotional quality, and rated the music from two points of view (i.e., emotion felt and emotion perceived) using 16 adjectives from dimensional models of emotion. As expected, in general, music seemed to arouse emotions similar to the emotional quality perceived in music. However, the affect ratings were significantly moderated by the point of view from which the emotions were assessed. Felt emotions were stronger than perceived emotions in connection with pleasure, but weaker in connection with arousal, positive activation, and negative activation. As also expected, negative perceived quality in music elicited less or an opposite felt emotion. That is, fearful music was perceived as negative but felt as positive.","[{'authorId': '1769521', 'name': 'K. Kallinen'}, {'authorId': '1751008', 'name': 'N.

At the same time, photo and video cameras can store a large number of video recordings and are often used to monitor the subjects remotely. Researchers frequently face the need to code considerable quantities of video recordings with relatively flexible software, often constrained by species‐specific options or exact settings. BORIS is a free, open‐source and multiplatform standalone program that allows a user‐specific coding environment to be set for a computer‐based review of previously recorded videos or live observations. Being open to user‐specific settings, the program allows a project‐based ethogram to be defined that can then be shared with collaborators, or can be imported or modified. Projects created in BORIS can include a list of observations, and each observation may include one or two videos (e.g. simultaneous screening of visual stimuli and the subject being tested; recordings from different sides of an aquarium). Once the user has set an ethogram, including state or point events or both, coding can be performed using previously assigned keys on the computer keyboard. BORIS allows definition of an unlimited number of events (states/point events) and subjects. Once the coding process is completed, the program can extract a time‐budget or single or grouped observations automatically and present an at‐a‐glance summary of the main behavioural features. The observation data and time‐budget analysis can be exported in many common formats (TSV, CSV, ODF, XLS, SQL and JSON). The observed events can be plotted and exported in various graphic formats (SVG, PNG, JPG, TIFF, EPS and PDF).","[{'authorId': '2079323', 'name': 'O. Friard'}, {'authorId': '40602934', 'name': 'M.

In the present paper, we present a simple mathematical model to describe this process in a three-dimensional affective space. We obtained data from 67 participants randomly assigned to two experimental groups. Participants watched either an upsetting or uplifting video previously calibrated for this goal. Immediately, participants reported their baseline subjective affect in three dimensions: (1) positivity, (2) negativity, and (3) arousal. In a second phase, participants rated the affect they subjectively judged from 10 target angry faces and ten target happy faces in the same three-dimensional scales. These judgments were used as an index of participant’s affective state after observing the faces. Participants’ affective responses were subsequently mapped onto a simple three-dimensional model of emotional contagion, in which the shortest distance between the baseline self-reported affect and the target judgment was calculated. The results display a double dissociation: negatively induced participants show more emotional contagion to angry than happy faces, while positively induced participants show more emotional contagion to happy than angry faces. In sum, emotional contagion exerted by the videos selectively affected judgments of the affective state of others’ faces. We discuss the directionality of emotional contagion to faces, considering whether negative emotions are more easily propagated than positive ones. Additionally, we comment on the lack of significant correlations between our model and standardized tests of empathy and emotional contagion.","[{'authorId': '2068036977', 'name': 'Andres Pinilla'}, {'authorId': '5668725', 'name': 'Ricardo M.

– Public employees are often confronted with aggression from citizens, managers and colleagues. This is sometimes a function of having a monopoly position of many public organizations. As a result, citizens cannot opt for alternative providers when not served well. This could give rise to aggression. Furthermore, increased budget cuts might give rise to higher stress, workload and consequential aggression at times. This paper analyzes articles on workplace aggression, both the three articles of this special issue and more broadly. The purpose of this paper is to provide researchers with methodological and theoretical future research suggestions for new studies on workplace aggression. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
– Literature review. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
– By taking new methodological and theoretical routes, scholars can contribute to the analysis and potential solutions concerning workplace aggression in the public sector. First, the authors advise researchers to move beyond cross-sectional surveys. Instead, diary studies, longitudinal studies and experimental methods (such as randomized control trials) should be increasingly used. Furthermore, scholars can focus more on theory development and testing. Future studies are advised to connect workplace aggression to theoretical models (such as the Job Demands-Resources model), to theories (for instance social learning theory) and to public administration concepts (such as public service motivation and trust in citizens).

Two conditions that may increase the probability of burnout contagion were investigated; namely, individual teachers' susceptibility to emotional contagion, and the frequency with which teachers are exposed to colleagues with student- and work-related problems. Consistent with hypotheses derived from theories about emotional contagion, the results suggest that bumout contagion was most pronounced under these 2 high-risk conditions. Specifically, the prevalence of perceived burnout among participants' colleagues was most strongly related to individual teachers' burnout (i. e., emotional exhaustion and depersonalization), when the teachers were highly susceptible to the emotions of others and when they frequently communicated with each other about work-related problems.","[{'authorId': '1776932', 'name': 'A.

The current pandemic is changing priorities for the general population, but it is also challenging the agenda of health professionals, including that of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals [3]. Everywhere in the world, psychiatric clinics are modifying their practice in order to guarantee care and support to persons with mental health problems, but also to those who are not mentally ill and are suffering from the psychosocial consequences of the pandemic. The number of those who will need psychiatric help is going to increase in the next weeks or months, requiring a reconsideration of our current practices.

The purpose of this study is to assess the comparative influence of two empathy dimensions (cognitive and emotional attributes) on emotional service experience and behavioral intention among business and leisure hotel guests. Studies relevant to empathy dimensions are relatively scarce in tourism and hospitality. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
The current study reviewed the concepts of empathy, and empirically compared perceptions of empathy attributes between the two groups. The survey was intended to examine how well the hotel employees emotionally handle hotel guests’ incidents or inquiries related to any discomforts through personalized attention. The data were collected from 330 hotel guests who had actually complained about service failures while staying at the hotel during the record-breaking summer of 2013 in terms of number of visitors to Jeju. An active empathetic listening (AEL) tool has been taken to measure the hotel guest’s cognitive views and behavioral intentions, as well as emotional empathy measures under the empathic concern and emotional contagion. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The results revealed that empathetic dimensions strongly influenced the service experiences of hotel guests. While the emotional service experience of business guests was almost completely determined by the cognitive empathy, the emotional service experience of the leisure guests was mainly governed by the emotional empathy. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
 
These outcomes suggest that the empathetic services through a “purpose of visit”-oriented manner might enhance the guest’s overall emotion positively.

This study aimed to compare emotion perception and social inference in opioid maintenance patients with abstinent ex-users and non-heroin-using controls, and determine whether any deficits in could be accounted for by cognitive deficits and/or risk factors for brain damage.


DESIGN
Case-control.


SETTING
Sydney, Australia.


PARTICIPANTS
A total of 125 maintenance patients (MAIN), 50 abstinent opiate users (ABST) and 50 matched controls (CON).


MEASUREMENTS
The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT) was used to measure emotion perception and social inference. Measures were also taken of executive function, working memory, information processing speed, verbal/non-verbal learning and psychological distress.


FINDINGS
After adjusting for age, sex, pre-morbid IQ and psychological distress, the MAIN group was impaired relative to CON (β = -0.19, P < 0.05) and ABST (β = -0.19, P < 0.05) on emotion perception and relative to CON (β = -0.25, P < 0.001) and ABST (β = -0.24, P < 0.01) on social inference. In neither case did the CON and ABST groups differ. For both emotion perception (P < 0.001) and social inference (P < 0.001), pre-morbid IQ was a significant independent predictor. Cognitive function was a major predictor of poor emotion perception (β = -0.44, P < 0.001) and social inference (β = -0.48, P < 0.001). Poor emotion recognition was also predicted by number of heroin overdoses (β = -0.14, P < 0.05). Neither time in treatment or type of maintenance medication (methadone or buprenorphine) were related to performance.


CONCLUSIONS
People in opioid maintenance treatment may have an impaired capacity for emotion perception and ability to make inferences about social situations.","[{'authorId': '143982280', 'name': 'S.

Arguably, one of the main reasons is that some essential qualities of human beings such as emotion have not been effectively modeled and incorporated into crowd simulation algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel computational model for emotion evolution and demonstrate its applications for crowd simulation. Specifically, our approach is designed to tackle three major issues in the emotion evolution process: (i) how to perceive and evaluate emotion when individuals face emergency or external events, (ii) how to evolve the emotion during induction, and (iii) how specific actions of individuals in a crowd are impacted by emotion. Through many experiments, we demonstrate that our method can effectively simulate emergent dynamic collective patterns observed in real-world crowd footages.","[{'authorId': '50090028', 'name': 'Hao Jiang'}, {'authorId': '145140508', 'name': 'Z.

Second, a significant amount of recent research has identified important downstream consequences of mimicking or being mimicked by another person. These include not only increased prosociality between interactants, but also unexpected effects on the individual, such as cognitive processing style, attitudes, consumer preferences, self-regulatory ability, and academic performance.

In Part II, we use this analysis to critically examine data from existing developmental research with children. We also assess the data currently available in the comparative literature which address these issues more directly.

482423db2c1f6bedd909ef7ad1ab3a1541e61dd1,"There is broad consensus in the literature that affect diffuses through social networks (such that a person may ""acquire"" or ""catch"" an affective state from his or her social contacts). It is further assumed that affect diffusion primarily occurs as the result of people's tendencies to synchronize their affective actions (such as smiles and frowns). However, as we show, there is a lack of clarity in the literature about the substrate and scope of affect diffusion. One consequence of this is a difficulty in distinguishing between affect diffusion and several other affective influence phenomena that look similar but have very different consequences. There is also a growing body of evidence that action synchrony is unlikely to be the only, or indeed the most important, pathway for affect diffusion. This paper has 2 key aims: (a) to craft a formal definition of affect diffusion that does justice to the core of the phenomenon while distinguishing it from other phenomena with which it is frequently confounded and (b) to advance a theory of the mechanisms of affect diffusion. This theory, which we call the multimodal theory of affect diffusion, identifies 3 parallel multimodal mechanisms that may act as routes for affect diffusion. It also provides a basis for novel predictions about the conditions under which affect is most likely to diffuse.","[{'authorId': '143692983', 'name': 'K.

An alternative approach is to conceptualize bias correction as guided by social perceivers' naive theories or perceptions of the bias at work. The subtraction theories were designed to deal with the assimilative biases typical of early priming experiments, but theory-based corrections can readily deal with either assimilative or contrastive biases.

The three terms “panic”, “irrationality”, and “herding” are ubiquitous in the crowd dynamics literature and have a strong influence on both modelling and management practices. The terms are also commonly shared between the scientific and nonscientific domains. The pervasiveness of the use of these terms is to the point where their underlying assumptions have often been treated as common knowledge by both experts and lay persons. Yet, at the same time, the literature on crowd dynamics presents ample debate, contradiction, and inconsistency on these topics. Method. This review is the first to systematically revisit these three terms in a unified study to highlight the scope of this debate. We extracted from peer-reviewed journal articles direct quotes that offer a definition, conceptualisation, or supporting/contradicting evidence on these terms and/or their underlying theories. To further examine the suitability of the term herding, a secondary and more detailed analysis is also conducted on studies that have specifically investigated this phenomenon in empirical settings. Results. The review shows that (i) there is no consensus on the definition for the terms panic and irrationality and that (ii) the literature is highly divided along discipline lines on how accurate these theories/terminologies are for describing human escape behaviour. The review reveals a complete division and disconnection between studies published by social scientists and those from the physical science domain and also between studies whose main focus is on numerical simulation versus those with empirical focus. (iii) Despite the ambiguity of the definitions and the missing consensus in the literature, these terms are still increasingly and persistently mentioned in crowd evacuation studies. (iv) Different to panic and irrationality, there is relative consistency in definitions of the term herding, with the term usually being associated with ‘(blind) imitation’. However, based on the findings of empirical studies, we argue why, despite the relative consistency in meaning, (v) the term herding itself lacks adequate nuance and accuracy for describing the role of ‘social influence’ in escape behaviour. Our conclusions also emphasise the importance of distinguishing between the social influence on various aspects of evacuation behaviour and avoiding generalisation across various behavioural layers. Conclusions. We argue that the use of these three terms in the scientific literature does not contribute constructively to extending the knowledge or to improving the modelling capabilities in the field of crowd dynamics. This is largely due to the ambiguity of these terms, the overly simplistic nature of their assumptions, or the fact that the theories they represent are not readily verifiable. Recommendations. We suggest that it would be beneficial for advancing this research field that the phenomena related to these three terms are clearly defined by more tangible and quantifiable terms and be formulated as verifiable hypotheses, so they can be operationalized for empirical testing.","[{'authorId': '8265765', 'name': 'M.

However, performance improvements were three times lower when classifiers were trained on natural or seminatural data (4.39% improvement) compared to acted data (12.1% improvement). Importantly, performance of the best unimodal classifier explained an impressive 80.6% (cross-validated) of the variance in multimodal accuracy.

In Homo sapiens and some non-human primates contagious yawning is higher between strongly than weakly bonded individuals. Up to date, it is still unclear whether this social asymmetry underlies emotional contagion (a basic form of empathy preferentially involving familiar individuals) as predicted by the Emotional Bias Hypothesis (EBH) or is linked to a top-down, selective visual attention bias (with selective attention being preferentially directed toward familiar faces) as predicted by the Attentional Bias Hypothesis (ABH). To verify whether the visual attentional bias explained the yawn contagion bias or not, in this study, we considered only yawns that could be heard but not seen by potential responders (auditory yawns). Around 294 of auditory yawning occurrences were extrapolated from over 2000 yawning bouts collected in free ranging humans for over nine years. Via GLMM, we tested the effect of intrinsic features (i.e., gender and age) and social bond (from strangers to family members) on yawn. The individual identity of the subjects (trigger and potential responder) was included as random factor. The social bond significantly predicted the occurrence of auditory yawn contagion, which was highest between friends and family members. A gender bias was also observed, with women responding most frequently to others’ yawns and men being responded to most frequently by others. These results confirm that social bond is per se one of the main drivers of the differences in yawn contagion rates between individuals in support of the EBH of yawn contagion.","[{'authorId': '3334949', 'name': 'I.

Studying the phase transition phenomenon is fundamental to analyzing and evaluating the crowd emotional contagion. However, it is a challenging issue since most people participate in both the physical and cyber networks at the same time. In this article, we focus on the emotional contagion in physical–cyber integrated networks from the phase transition perspective. To achieve this, we first construct a physical–cyber integrated network model to describe the interactions between physical and cyber networks. Second, we build an emotional contagion model to capture the characteristics of emotional contagion in the physical and cyber integrated networks accurately. Finally, we study the phase transition phenomenon of emotional contagion and identify the critical threshold by mapping the emotional contagion to the joint site/bond percolation model.

48d2a6f63c60a1ee10177e94868bda6b16febb91,"In emergency evacuations, crowds often become congested and stampeded because of extreme panic, resulting in injuries and fatalities. Safety officers can spread positive emotions and reduce crowd panic by issuing information or appeasement, which is an effective way to ensure evacuation safety. However, how to deploy safety officers appropriately and maximize positive emotional contagion to cover the largest number of chaotic individuals is still a challenging problem. To solve this problem, we propose an IoT-based positive emotional contagion (IoT-PEC) method for crowd evacuation. First, we employ IoT technologies to capture the attributes of crowd movement, such as position and velocity. Based on these attributes, the crowd chaos can be quantified by calculating the macroscopic and microscopic entropies. Second, we propose an entropy-based anisotropic emotional contagion model (E-AECM) to achieve the nonuniform positive emotional contagion considering the influence of chaos on the propagation rate. Third, we formulate the problem of safety officer placement as an optimization problem to maximize the positive emotional contagion on the chaos individuals. Finally, we implement a simulation system for crowd evacuation to visualize the results of positive emotion contagion. The proposed method can provide guidance for emergency response management.","[{'authorId': '3172102', 'name': 'Guijuan Zhang'}, {'authorId': '7382513', 'name': 'Dianjie Lu'}, {'authorId': '2118902760', 'name': 'Hong Liu'}]",28.0,"{'name': 'IEEE Internet of Things Journal', 'pages': '1057-1070', 'volume': '8'}",55.0,IoT-Based Positive Emotional Contagion for Crowd Evacuation,2020.0

Visual scenes, voices, bodies, other faces, cultural orientation, and even words shape how emotion is perceived in a face, calling into question the still-common assumption that the emotional state of a person is written on and can be read from the face like words on a page. Incorporating context during emotion perception appears to be routine, efficient, and, to some degree, automatic. This evidence challenges the standard view of emotion perception represented in psychology texts, in the cognitive neuroscience literature, and in the popular media and points to a necessary change in the basic paradigm used in the scientific study of emotion perception.","[{'authorId': '1731779', 'name': 'L.

The aim of this study was to examine whether Neuroticism and maladaptive coping strategies mediate the association between the serotonin transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5HTT-LPR) and symptoms of anxiety and depression in elite athletes who experience high levels of competitive stress. One hundred and thirty-three participants were genotyped for the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and then asked to complete the Cope Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory and the NEO Five-Factor Inventory. A path analysis was used to test the aforementioned hypothesis. The 5HTT-LPR was significantly associated with Neuroticism, the coping strategy of Focus on and Venting of Emotions’ (FVE) and symptoms of anxiety. FVE and Neuroticism mediated the association between the 5HTT-LPR and symptoms of anxiety (i.e., Cognitive Anxiety and Emotional Arousal Control). Also, Neuroticism was a mediator of the association between the 5HTT-LPR and FVE. Finally, FVE also mediated effects on the relationship between Neuroticism and symptoms of anxiety. Results suggest that the 5HTT-LPR may affect the susceptibility to develop symptoms of anxiety in elite athletes indirectly through mediation by FVE and Neuroticism.","[{'authorId': '39941164', 'name': 'M.

In this paper, we propose a novel crowd simulation method by modeling the generation and contagion of panic emotion under multihazard circumstances. In order to depict the effect from hazards and other agents to crowd movement, we first classify hazards into different types (transient and persistent, concurrent and nonconcurrent, and static and dynamic) based on their inherent characteristics. Second, we introduce the concept of perilous field for each hazard and further transform the critical level of the field to its invoked-panic emotion. After that, we propose an emotional contagion model to simulate the evolving process of panic emotion caused by multiple hazards. Finally, we introduce an emotional reciprocal velocity obstacles (RVOs) model to simulate the crowd behaviors by augmenting the traditional RVO model with emotional contagion, which for the first time combines the emotional impact and local avoidance together. Our experimental results demonstrate that the overall approach is robust, can better generate realistic crowds and the panic emotion dynamics in a crowd. Furthermore, it is recommended that our method can be applied to various complex multihazard environments.","[{'authorId': '2285442', 'name': 'Mingliang Xu'}, {'authorId': '2016679', 'name': 'Xiaozhen Xie'}, {'authorId': '144470801', 'name': 'Pei Lv'}, {'authorId': '35667840', 'name': 'Jiangwei Niu'}, {'authorId': '2113254290', 'name': 'Hua Wang'}, {'authorId': '7431398', 'name': 'Chaochao Li'}, {'authorId': '2070270237', 'name': 'Ruijie Zhu'}, {'authorId': '145140508', 'name': 'Z.

Experiment 1 presented participants with either the upper- or lower-half of facial expressions and used a forced-choice emotion categorisation task. This task emphasises cognition at the expense of ecological and social validity. Experiment 2 presented whole heads and expressions were occluded by clothing. Additionally, the emotion recognition task is more open-ended. This context has greater social validity. We found mimicry in both experiments, however mimicry differed in terms of which emotions were mimicked and the extent to which the mimicry involved muscle sites that were not observed. In the more cognitive context, there was relatively more motor matching (i.e. mimicking only what was seen). In the more socially valid context, participants were less likely to mimic only what they saw – and instead mimicked what they knew. Additionally, participants mimicked anger in the cognitive context but not the social context. These findings suggest that mimicry involves multiple mechanisms and that the more social the context, the more likely it is to reflect a mechanism of social regulation.","[{'authorId': '2109000458', 'name': 'Joshua D.

Single-unit responses in area 24 of cingulate cortex were examined in halothane-anesthetized rabbits during stimulation of the skin with transcutaneous electrical (TCES, 3-10 mA), mechanical (smooth or serrated forceps to the dorsal body surface or graded pressures of 100-1,500 g to the stabilized ear) and thermal (> 25 degrees C) stimulation. 2. Of 542 units tested in cingulate cortex, 150 responded to noxious TCES (> or = 6 mA), 93 of 221 units tested responded to noxious mechanical (serrated forceps) and 9 of 47 units tested responded to noxious heat (> 43 degrees C) stimuli. Twenty-five percent of the units that responded to noxious mechanical stimuli also responded to noxious heat stimuli. The only innocuous stimulus that evoked activity in cingulate cortex was a ""tap"" to the skin and this was effective for 11 of 14 tested units. 3. In 74 units that produced excitatory responses to TCES of the contralateral ear, response latency was 166 +/- 11.3 (SE) ms and response duration was 519 +/- 52.1 ms. 4. Twenty of the 150 units that responded to noxious TCES were initially inhibited. These responses were usually < 1 s in duration (17 of 20 units), whereas responses in the other 3 lasted for over 20 s. 5. Most units had broad receptive fields, because noxious mechanical stimuli anywhere on the dorsal surface of the rabbits, including the face and ears, evoked responses. A small number of units for which the entire body surface was tested (3 of 15 units) had receptive fields limited to the ears, rostral back, and forepaws. 6. Fifteen of 33 units tested had no preferential responses to noxious TCES of the ipsilateral and contralateral ears. Of the remaining units, 10 had a greater response to contralateral and 8 had a greater response to ipsilateral stimuli. 7. The locations of 186 units were histologically verified. Most nociceptive cingulate units were in dorsal area 24b in layers III (n = 35), II (n = 13), or V (n = 9). 8. Cortical knifecut lesions were made in five rabbits to determine if the responses in area 24 were dependent on lateral or posterior cortical inputs. These lesions did not alter the percentage of units driven by noxious stimuli nor response latency. 9. Injections of lidocaine were made into medial parts of the thalamus in six animals and injection and recording sites analyzed histologically.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","[{'authorId': '5344377', 'name': 'R.

To mimic the human situation of altered GR function claimed for depression, we generated mouse strains that underexpress or overexpress GR, but maintain the regulatory genetic context controlling the GR gene. To achieve this goal, we used the following: (1) GR-heterozygous mutant mice (GR+/-) with a 50% GR gene dose reduction, and (2) mice overexpressing GR by a yeast artificial chromosome resulting in a twofold gene dose elevation. GR+/- mice exhibit normal baseline behaviors but demonstrate increased helplessness after stress exposure, a behavioral correlate of depression in mice. Similar to depressed patients, GR+/- mice have a disinhibited hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system and a pathological dexamethasone/corticotropin-releasing hormone test. Thus, they represent a murine depression model with good face and construct validity. Overexpression of GR in mice evokes reduced helplessness after stress exposure, and an enhanced HPA system feedback regulation. Therefore, they may represent a model for a stress-resistant strain. These mouse models can now be used to study biological changes underlying the pathogenesis of depressive disorders. As a first potential molecular correlate for such changes, we identified a downregulation of BDNF protein content in the hippocampus of GR+/- mice, which is in agreement with the so-called neurotrophin hypothesis of depression.","[{'authorId': '47205531', 'name': 'Stephanie Ridder'}, {'authorId': '4892332', 'name': 'S.

In this study, we explore the theoretical model and structural dimensions of employee well-being (EWB) in organizations. Specifically, using both qualitative and quantitative methods, we find that EWB comprises three dimensions: life well-being, workplace well-being, and psychological well-being. We establish the reliability and validity of the newly developed EWB scale through a series of quantitative studies, which indicate that EWB is significantly correlated with affective organizational commitment and job performance based on the data collected from multiple sources at two points in time. We find that EWB has measurement invariance (configural invariance) across Chinese and American contexts. We also discuss the theoretical contributions of these findings to cross-cultural organizational behavior studies, along with the practical implications of our results.

The present review examines this model in terms of whether different types of emotion-evocative stimuli are associated with discrete and invariant patterns of responding in each response system, how such responses are structured, and if such responses converge across different response systems. Across response systems, the bulk of the available evidence favours the idea that measures of emotional responding reflect dimensions rather than discrete states. In addition, experiential, physiological, and behavioural response systems are associated with unique sources of variance, which in turn limits the magnitude of convergence across measures. Accordingly, the authors suggest that there is no “gold standard” measure of emotional responding. Rather, experiential, physiological, and behavioural measures are all relevant to understanding emotion and cannot be assumed to be interchangeable.","[{'authorId': '2172628', 'name': 'I.

Recently, in cognitive science, it has been suggested that dogs may have acquired the superior cognitive ability to communicate with humans, particularly using human-like visual cues during evolution, and that emotional bonding has developed between humans and dogs by means of similar social cues. This article discusses the biological aspects of human-dog attachment. Attachment requires the distinction of a specific figure using species-specific social cues and specific responses to the figure, brought about by neuroendocrinological homeostatic functions as well as behavioral aspects. It has been shown that dogs can distinguish a particular human figure (e.g. the owner) and exhibit specific autonomic reactions. Moreover, when dogs gaze at their owners, the latter's urinary oxytocin levels increase after the interaction. This understanding of the biological aspect of interspecies attachment suggests the possible elements that form the basis of cross-species empathy and the development of evolutionary cognitive abilities that may depend on not merely their genetic dendrogram.","[{'authorId': '8018629', 'name': 'M.

Emotional contagion can be a very effective and attractive strategy in communication and advertising, and understanding the mechanisms underlying emotional contagion can help marketers to improve their commercial approaches or develop better ones. The purpose of this study is to review and classify the various methodologies and theoretical approaches on emotional contagion, identify the best practices in this domain, and identify ways of gaging and measuring emotional contagion. The study is based on a mini literature review. We identify different mechanisms and approaches to emotional contagion described in the literature. Emotional contagion can be triggered by facial expressions, indirect human interactions, and/or by observing other people's behavior in direct and indirect interactions. Furthermore, emotional contagion can be triggered physiologically or neurologically by synchronizing with the emotional state of others during human interactions. Regarding the assessment and measurement of emotional contagion, we argue that methods based on neuroscience tools are much more accurate and effective than methods based on traditional research approaches. The study identifies guidelines for research on commercial communication through emotional contagion that can be especially interesting for academia and marketing practitioners. The findings are important for field marketers interested in developing new individualized approaches in their commercial strategies and marketing in general. In addition, the study can become the basis of research that further refines and compares the efficacy of the various techniques and tools involved.","[{'authorId': '15900924', 'name': 'C.

Empathy with a perceived human artist has been suggested as a common mechanism [1]. In this study, people heard 30 s excerpts of ambiguous music and poetry preceded by neutral, positively valenced, or negatively valenced information about the composer's or author’s intent. The information influenced their perception of the excerpts—excerpts paired with positive intent information were perceived as happier and excerpts paired with negative intent information were perceived as sadder (although across intent conditions, musical excerpts were perceived as happier than poetry excerpts). Moreover, the information modulated the aesthetic experience of the excerpts in different ways for the different excerpt types: positive intent information increased enjoyment and the degree to which people found the musical excerpts to be moving, but negative intent information increased these qualities for poetry.

Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis provided support for the model, suggesting that the presence of meaning, EI, and size and availability of an individual's social network are the strongest correlates of loneliness. EI therefore emerges as a potentially important factor in our understanding of loneliness, and the model provides a framework for future studies.

Our objective measures included the use of psycho-physical Electro Dermal Activity (EDA) sensors, and subjective measures inspired by social psychology research included the Differential Emotions Survey (DES IV) and Positive and Negative Affect Survey (PANAS). We analyzed the quantitative and qualitative measures associated with participants' emotional state at four distinct time-steps in the simulated interpersonal experience as the virtual patient's medical condition deteriorated. Results suggest that participants in the dynamic condition with animations exhibited a higher sense of co-presence and greater emotional response as compared to participants in the static condition, corresponding to the deterioration in the medical condition of the virtual patient. Negative affect of participants in the dynamic condition increased at a higher rate than for participants in the static condition. The virtual human animations elicited a stronger response in negative emotions such as anguish, fear, and anger as the virtual patient's medical condition worsened.","[{'authorId': '2134149709', 'name': 'Yanxiang Wu'}, {'authorId': '144403504', 'name': 'Sabarish V.

To investigate this assumption, the authors adopted a morph movie paradigm in which participants were shown movies of faces in which an emotional facial expression changed gradually to a neutral one (Study 1) or a neutral expression changed to an emotional one (Studies 2-4). Participants were asked to judge the point at which the emotional expression had disappeared or emerged, respectively. Individuals who were highly anxious with respect to attachment were more likely to perceive the offset (Study 1) as well as the onset (Studies 2 and 3) of the facial expressions of emotion earlier than other people. Moreover, this heightened state of vigilance may have led to poorer accuracy in judging facial expressions of emotion (Study 3), an effect that was reversed when anxious individuals were required to watch the movies for the same length of time as less anxious participants (Study 4). The results indicate that variation in attachment anxiety reflects, in part, differences in vigilance to cues of social and emotional significance.","[{'authorId': '101257925', 'name': 'R. C.

Firstly, to analyse the patency of the building, an evacuation formula is applied after binary processing. The function of evacuation time and some other parameters is given by means of regression analysis. Secondly, the cellular automata (CA) algorithm was applied to illustrate the effect of the bottleneck. The response of evacuation time could be approximately optimized through calculating time step of the CA simulation. Finally, the value of maximum evacuation population density could be determined according to the analysis of CA simulation results, which was related to the switch state of the emergency channel. The emergency evacuation model was simulated by using the Louvre museum as an example. The results of the simulation presented some feasible evacuation routes in all kinds of situations. Furthermore, the functional relationship would also be given among evacuation time with the diversity of tourists, pedestrian density, and width of exits.

The conscious experience of emotion cannot be assessed directly, but neural, behavioural and physiological indicators of emotion can be measured. Researchers have used these measures to characterize how animals respond to situations assumed to induce discrete emotional states (e.g. fear). While advancing our understanding of specific emotions, this discrete emotion approach lacks an overarching framework that can incorporate and integrate the wide range of possible emotional states. Dimensional approaches that conceptualize emotions in terms of universal core affective characteristics (e.g. valence (positivity versus negativity) and arousal) can provide such a framework. Here, we bring together discrete and dimensional approaches to: (i) offer a structure for integrating different discrete emotions that provides a functional perspective on the adaptive value of emotional states, (ii) suggest how long-term mood states arise from short-term discrete emotions, how they also influence these discrete emotions through a bi-directional relationship and how they may function to guide decision-making, and (iii) generate novel hypothesis-driven measures of animal emotion and mood.","[{'authorId': '1913339', 'name': 'M.

4bf038dc98355b8ce89347e03c3ad444a4b7aebc,"The current study examined the relationships of organizational orientations and Machiavellianism with nonverbal immediacy and job satisfaction in the organizational context. Participants included 160 full-time employees who worked at various for profit or non-profit organizations in the Mid-Atlantic area. Results indicated that the organizational orientations (i.e., upward mobile, ambivalent, and indifferent) and Machiavellianism were significant predictors of employee nonverbal immediacy and job satisfaction. The results were consistent with a preliminary theoretical model of relationships among these individual differences and organizational outcomes. Alan K. Goodboy & James C. McCroskey 295 Toward a Theoretical Model of the Role of Organizational Orientations and Machiavellianism on Nonverbal Immediacy Behavior and Job Satisfaction Competent organizations are concerned with fostering employee perceptions of job satisfaction. Research has consistently demonstrated that job satisfaction leads to valuable organizational outcomes such as an increase in job performance, organizational commitment, and organizational citizenship behavior (Crede, Chernyshenko, Stark, Dalal, & Bashshur, 2007; Huang & Hsiao, 2007; Judge, Thoresen, Bono, & Patton, 2001; Loher, Noe, Moeller, & Fitzgerald, 1985; Petty, McGee, & Cavender, 1984; Riketta, 2008). However, whether or not an employee is satisfied in the workplace is largely determined by individual differences (Judge, Heller, & Mount, 2002; Mount, Ilies, & Johnson, 2006) and organizational communication behavior (Madlock, 2006, 2008; Richmond & McCroskey, 2000). Two individual differences of importance in the workplace include organizational orientations and personality traits (McCroskey, McCroskey, & Richmond, 2005; McCroskey, Richmond, Johnson, & Smith, 2004). Considering past research, the aim of this study was to assess individual differences (i.e., organizational orientations, Machiavellianism) as potential predictors of employee communication behavior (i.e., immediacy) and job satisfaction. Organizational Orientations The term “organizational orientations” refers to the various ways people approach their roles in an organization and the different approaches people have toward work and the place of work in their lives (Richmond & McCroskey, 2001). Three organizational orientations have been identified: upward mobile, indifferent, and ambivalent. The upward mobile orientation refers to workers who possess a strong desire to be promoted and advance within the organization. These individuals are very devoted to their career and tend to identify with the organization. Considering that much of upward mobile individuals’ lives revolve around their careers, they frequently exert the extra effort needed to be a successful employee. The indifferent orientation refers to workers who are committed to their jobs as a means of earning a living. These individuals are primarily concerned with their paychecks, as their lives, in their view, exist mostly outside of the workplace. Working is a necessary means of having that life, but nothing more. The ambivalent orientation refers to workers who tend to be highly critical of any job and seem to find problems with any organization. These individuals are quite unpredictable and never truly accept any given organization. Ambivalents tend to frequently change jobs, looking for the “perfect” organization. Management usually has no problem seeing ambivalents leave the organization. The organizational orientations concept was advanced decades ago in the field of management (Presthus, 1962) but has just recently drawn the attention of quantitative researchers in the field of communication. McCroskey et al. (2004) conducted research that explained a great deal about the relevance of this concept to organizational communication. In their study, the researchers validated their research measures for the three organizational orientations and determined that organizational orientations are correlated with temperament variables. Canonical correlation analysis determined that the temperament variables of extroversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism were substantially correlated with the three organizational orientations. Also, organizational orientations were found to predict job satisfaction. Furthermore, McCroskey et al. Nonverbal Immediacy Behavior and Job Satisfaction 296 (2005) discovered that perceptions of supervisor credibility were related negatively to the indifferent and ambivalent orientations. Machiavellianism Another individual difference, Machiavellianism, is a trait that involves strategically manipulating others for person gain, often against the other’s self-interest (Wilson, Near, & Miller, 1996). It was conceptualized by Christie and Geis (1970), in their book Studies In Machiavellianism. According to Christie and Geis (1970), high Machs manipulate people to their advantage and tend to have little emotional involvement in their interpersonal relationships. Previous research gives an accurate depiction of the characteristics and predispositions of the Machiavellian individual. High Machs are less altruistic (Barber, 1994), more likely to cheat (Flynn, Reichard, & Slane, 1987), more flexible in tactic usage (Grams & Rogers, 1990), and less moral and empathetic (Padney & Singh, 1987). Research suggests that employees possessing a Machiavellian personality have both advantages and disadvantages for them in the workplace. With respect to deception, high Machs are much less likely to be caught. Geis and Moon (1981) discovered that high Machs were more convincing liars than low Machs. High Machs were harder to judge and were believed to be telling the truth more when lying than low Machs. The flexibility of the high Mach is another advantageous characteristic. For example, high Machs with an external locus of control have been suggested to be better managers (Gable & Dangello, 1994). The fact that high Machs use deception to get what they desire is problematic. From a supervisor’s organizational standpoint, the high Mach may appear less appealing than the low Mach. As stated before, the high Mach will be less altruistic, empathetic, and more likely to cheat. If the high Mach is perceived as this by superiors, he/she may suffer consequences. Consistent with attribution theory (Heider, 1958), high Machs tend to externalize their failures. Deception and manipulation are merely attempts to exert control over adverse conditions, and meta-analytic methodologies have suggested that high Machs have an external locus of control (Mudrack, 1990). This information denotes that having the Machiavellianism trait does not necessarily entail successful encounters concerning deception, manipulation, or betrayal. Some high Machs are good at manipulating, some are not, but having the trait means that the manipulation does occur. Whether or not deception attempts are successful is another thing. Moreover, varying results make it difficult to really understand the Machiavellian worker. For example, some research has found high Machs to be detached from their job, while other research has found high Machs to be quite involved in their job due to their obsessive compulsive nature (Mudrack, 1989). Also, the differentiation between high and low Machs can be attributed to collective variables. Self-presentation, gender orientation, receptivity to expressive behavior, gender, and self-monitoring have been discovered to differentiate between high and low Machs (Madonna, Wesley, & Anderson, 1989). Considering the discrepancies in organizational communication research regarding Machiavellian employees, several communication researchers have recently resurrected this program of research. For instance, Walter, Anderson, and Martin (2005) discovered that Machiavellian subordinates are motivated to communicate for control, escape, and relaxation. Furthermore, Teven, McCroskey, and Richmond (2006) revealed that Machiavellian supervisors are perceived as less credible by subordinates. Alan K. Goodboy & James C. McCroskey 297 Based on the extant research, it seems plausible that high Machs will lack an upward mobile orientation and have more of an ambivalent (if not indifferent) orientation for several reasons. First, research does not suggest that high Machs outperform low Machs in real-world organizational outcomes, which does not coincide with the upward mobile orientation. Sales performance (Turnbull, 1976), marketing job performance (Hunt & Chonko, 1984), and professor tenure (Hollan, 1975) are not related to the Machiavellianism trait. Upward mobiles however, are likely to perform better in the workplace considering their desire for promotion. Second, research has suggested that high Machs are not as satisfied with their jobs (Gable & Topol, 1987; Hollon, 1983; Hunt & Chonko, 1984; Walter et al., 2005). Upward mobiles however, live to work and tend to identify with organizations. Instead, workers possessing either ambivalent or indifferent orientations are more prone to job dissatisfaction. Third, communication behaviors exhibited by high Machs are not representative of upward mobility preferences. For example, Teven and Winters (2007) revealed that Machiavellian employees exhibit less caring and responsiveness, which is unrepresentative of the upward mobile employee. On the contrary, an upward mobile employee would be likely to communicate caring and should be quite responsive. Fourth, upward mobility has been correlated negatively with Machiavellianism (Heisler & Gemmill, 1977). Based on the four aforementioned research findings, we predicted that: H1: Employees higher in Machiavellianism will have higher ambivalent and indifferent organizational orientations but will have lower upward mobility orientations.

Most of the clustering algorithms depend on some assumptions in order to define the subgroups present in a data set. As a consequence, the resulting clustering scheme requires some sort of evaluation as regards its validity. The evaluation procedure has to tackle difficult problems such as the quality of clusters, the degree with which a clustering scheme fits a specific data set and the optimal number of clusters in a partitioning. In the literature, a wide variety of indices have been proposed to find the optimal number of clusters in a partitioning of a data set during the clustering process. However, for most of indices proposed in the literature, programs are unavailable to test these indices and compare them. The R package NbClust has been developed for that purpose. It provides 30 indices which determine the number of clusters in a data set and it offers also the best clustering scheme from different results to the user. In addition, it provides a function to perform k-means and hierarchical clustering with different distance measures and aggregation methods. Any combination of validation indices and clustering methods can be requested in a single function call. This enables the user to simultaneously evaluate several clustering schemes while varying the number of clusters, to help determining the most appropriate number of clusters for the data set of interest.","[{'authorId': '2258246', 'name': 'Malika Charrad'}, {'authorId': '2718843', 'name': 'Nadia Ghazzali'}, {'authorId': '5378480', 'name': 'V.

The work focuses on the conventional optical flow method such as Lucas & Kanade and Horn & Schunck methods as well as the most recent methods such as Classic+NL that combines the classic formulation with a new non-local term. The improvement in computational efficiency and increasing interest in robust and accurate motion estimation algorithms lead to increase in the use of optical flow in crowd analytic applications. The implementation of optical flow algorithms is investigated and an evaluation of those techniques is provided qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The qualitative analysis illustrates the optical flow performance in terms of large motion, occlusion, motion discontinuities, illumination and different light condition. Quantitative analysis is in terms of computational time and accuracy.","[{'authorId': '3279528', 'name': 'I. Kajo'}, {'authorId': '1791942', 'name': 'A. Malik'}, {'authorId': '1724923', 'name': 'N.

This is accomplished through a reduction of systemic risk, which refers to a risk that could be greater than the sum of the risks of the individual system constituents. Using network analysis, it is shown that the explicit socio-physical approach yields meaningful qualitative and quantitative differences when compared with approaches that focus on the social and physical views in isolation. The benefits of this proposed approach are illustrated on a case study using clustering analysis and a proof-of-concept simulation. This new approach leads to systemic risk reduction by enabling a more informed and coordinated response strategy following an incident and a better identification of possible consequences and preparation strategies prior to an incident.","[{'authorId': '144610188', 'name': 'William Ross'}, {'authorId': '1774782', 'name': 'A.

We found positive relationships of WFC with both job and family stressors for wives and with job stressors for husbands. We also found that job and family stressors predicted FWC for wives, but not for husbands. Furthermore, spouse's support buffered the relationship between one's job stressors and the experience of WFC for wives but accelerated these relationships for husbands.

In particular, frustration, loneliness, and worries about the future are common reactions and represent well-known risk factors for several mental disorders, including anxiety, affective, and post-traumatic stress disorders. The vast majority of available studies have been conducted in China, where the pandemic started. Italy has been severely hit by the pandemic, and the socio-cultural context is completely different from Eastern countries. Therefore, there is the need for methodologically rigorous studies aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 and quarantine measures on the mental health of the Italian population. In fact, our results will help us to develop appropriate interventions for managing the psychosocial consequences of pandemic. The “COVID-IT-mental health trial” is a no-profit, not-funded, national, multicentric, cross-sectional population-based trial which has the following aims: a) to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and its containment measures on mental health of the Italian population; b) to identify the main areas to be targeted by supportive long-term interventions for the different categories of people exposed to the pandemic. Data will be collected through a web-platform using validated assessment tools. Participants will be subdivided into four groups: a) Group 1—COVID-19 quarantine group. This group includes the general population which are quarantined but not isolated, i.e., those not directly exposed to contagion nor in contact with COVID-19+ individuals; b) Group 2—COVID-19+ group, which includes isolated people directly/indirectly exposed to the virus; c) Group 3—COVID-19 healthcare staff group, which includes first- and second-line healthcare professionals; d) Group 4—COVID-19 mental health, which includes users of mental health services and all those who had already been diagnosed with a mental disorder. Mental health services worldwide are not prepared yet to manage the short- and long-term consequences of the pandemic.

This research investigated the relationship between perceived career opportunities, affective commitment to the supervisor, and social isolation from colleagues on the one hand and nurses' well-being and turnover intentions on the other. In addition, this study explored the mediating role of affective commitment to the organisation in these relationships.


BACKGROUND
Previous research suggested that organisational commitment explained the effect of nurses' work environment on their turnover intentions. However, less is known about how organisational commitment may contribute to explain nurses' well-being.


METHOD
This research used a cross-sectional design. A sample of 244 nurses completed a questionnaire survey.


RESULTS
Results indicated that affective commitment to the organisation partially mediates the relationships between perceived career opportunities, affective commitment to the supervisor, and social isolation on one hand, and turnover intentions and well-being on the other hand.


CONCLUSION
This study showed that the way nurses assess various aspects of their work experience transposes to their emotional bond to their organisation, which in turn explains their well-being and turnover intentions.

One of the main factors that help to create a powerful brand is investment and improving the quality of services. Nowadays, the competition for improving the quality of services is raised as a key strategic issue for organizations that operate in the services sector. The aim of this research is to investigate how the dimensions of service quality affect the brand equity in the fast food industry. The customers of fast food industry (Restaurant Raphael) in Boushehr constitute the statistical population of this research. Given that the statistical population is unlimited, through sampling 390 questionnaires were distributed, collected and analyzed. For analyzing the data, the structural equations modelling was used by help of the software smart PLS. The results show that the entire dimensions of service quality of model SERVQUAL (tangible factors of services, reliability, responsiveness, assurance and empathy) have a positive and significant impact on the brand equity. It also became clear that among the five dimensions of quality of services, the tangible factors of services have the most impact on the brand equity in the fast food industry. So implementing the programs to enhance the quality of services will have to a very large extent a positive effect on increasing the brand equity in the fast food industry.","[{'authorId': '71631208', 'name': 'Majid Esmaeilpour'}, {'authorId': '80927381', 'name': 'Zahra Mohamadi'}, {'authorId': '116973313', 'name': 'A.

(b) Is the relationship between facial mimicry and liking symmetrical for the mimicker and the mimickee? (c) Does conscious mimicry have consequences for emotion recognition? A paradigm is introduced in which participants interact over a computer setup with a confederate whose prerecorded facial displays of emotion are synchronized with participants’ behavior to create the illusion of social interaction. In Experiment 1, the confederate did or did not mimic participants’ facial displays of various subsets of basic emotions. Mimicry promoted greater liking for the confederate regardless of which emotions were mimicked. Experiment 2 reversed these roles: participants were instructed to mimic or not to mimic the confederate’s facial displays. Mimicry did not affect liking for the confederate but it did impair emotion recognition.","[{'authorId': '145213848', 'name': 'Wojciech Kulesza'}, {'authorId': '15744706', 'name': 'A.

4e76f0042e84be5af93e292b0c480ec193ba1f4d,"Background Major depression is a serious challenge at both the individual and population levels. Although online health communities have shown the potential to reduce the symptoms of depression, emotional contagion theory suggests that negative emotion can spread within a community, and prolonged interactions with other depressed individuals has potential to worsen the symptoms of depression. Objective The goals of our study were to investigate longitudinal changes in psychological states that are manifested through linguistic changes in depression community members who are interacting with other depressed individuals. Methods We examined emotion-related language usages using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program for each member of a depression community from Reddit. To measure the changes, we applied linear least-squares regression to the LIWC scores against the interaction sequence for each member. We measured the differences in linguistic changes against three online health communities focusing on positive emotion, diabetes, and irritable bowel syndrome. Results On average, members of an online depression community showed improvement in 9 of 10 prespecified linguistic dimensions: “positive emotion,” “negative emotion,” “anxiety,” “anger,” “sadness,” “first person singular,” “negation,” “swear words,” and “death.” Moreover, these members improved either significantly or at least as much as members of other online health communities. Conclusions We provide new insights into the impact of prolonged participation in an online depression community and highlight the positive emotion change in members. The findings of this study should be interpreted with caution, because participating in an online depression community is not the sole factor for improvement or worsening of depressive symptoms. Still, the consistent statistical results including comparative analyses with different communities could indicate that the emotion-related language usage of depression community members are improving either significantly or at least as much as members of other online communities.

Positive visual contagion of this kind is common in humans, but whether it occurs in non-human animals is unknown. We explored the impact on female Barbary macaques of observing grooming, a behaviour that physiological and behavioural studies indicate has a relaxing effect on the animals involved. We compared females' behaviour between two conditions: after observing conspecifics groom, and in a matched control period. We found that observing grooming was associated with reduced behavioural indicators of anxiety, suggesting that seeing others groom is, in itself, relaxing. Observing grooming was also associated with a shorter latency to becoming involved in a grooming bout (and higher likelihood both of initiating that bout and being the groomer rather than groomee), and with elevated rates of other affiliative behaviours. These results provide evidence for positive visual contagion; this phenomenon may contribute fundamentally to group cohesion not just in this species, but also in the many mammal and bird species where grooming occurs. Our study highlights the importance of exploring social behaviour beyond the level of the interacting individuals, within the broader social context where it occurs.","[{'authorId': '94797748', 'name': 'J.

Distinct from a classical fluid because of the property that a crowd has the capacity to think, interesting new physical ideas are involved in its study. An appealing property of a crowd in motion is that the nonlinear, time-dependent, simultaneous equations representing a crowd are conformably mappable. This property makes many interesting applications analytically tractable. In this review examples are given in which the theory has been used to provide possible assistance in the annual Muslim Hajj, to understand the Battle of Agincourt, and, surprisingly, to locate barriers that actually increase the flow of pedestrians above that when there are no barriers present. Modern developments may help prevent some of the approximately two thousand deaths that annually occur in accidents owing to crowding.The field of crowd motion, that is, the field of “thinking fluids,” is an intriguing area of research with great promise.","[{'authorId': '1733226', 'name': 'R.

4e8d5f1b37e83aeeb6b58a1278e3bcfc36b4b88b,"An area of research that may shed light on the pressing problem of FL teacher attrition is emotion labor. Emotion labor (or emotional labour), a construct stemming from research in the fields of communication and psychology and focusing mainly on service professionals, has recently been taken up in education literature. Although student emotions in language acquisition have been examined, the field of applied linguistics has not yet tapped the explanatory potential of teacher emotions. The current project explores the emotion work of 5 teachers in rural U.S. high school FL classrooms. Thematic analysis of interviews with teachers of Spanish, French, and Latin yielded 5 key insights: perceived lack of community and institutional support for FL teachers, an excessive burden for motivation felt by these teachers, the use of teacher emotion labor to motivate their students, emotional burnout of the teachers, and perceived lack of teacher efficacy. The last two, while not inevitable, seem to be mutually influencing, forming a downward spiral that can eventually impact the willingness or ability of some teachers to continue in their careers. Implications of this study include recognition of the significance of teacher emotion labor in FL pedagogy and its potential role in teacher attrition.

A contact-free method, IRT provides the opportunity to uncover emotional states in free-ranging animals during social interactions. Here, we measured nose and ear temperatures of wild chimpanzees of Budongo Forest, Uganda, when exposed to naturally occurring vocalizations of conspecifics. We found a significant temperature decrease over the nose after exposure to conspecifics' vocalizations, whereas we found a corresponding increase for ear temperature. Our study suggests that IRT can be used in wild animals to quantify changes in emotional states in response to the diversity of vocalizations, their functional significance and acoustical characteristics. We hope that it will contribute to more research on physiological changes associated with social interactions in wild animals.","[{'authorId': '6669560', 'name': 'G.

Those changes that can be perceived by conspecifics have the potential to also affect other's emotional states, a process labeled as “emotional contagion.” Especially in the case of gregarious species, such as livestock, emotional contagion can have an impact on the whole group by, for instance, improving group coordination and strengthening social bonds. We noticed that the current trend of research on emotions in livestock, i.e., investigating affective states as a tool to assess and improve animal welfare, appears to be unbalanced. A majority of studies focuses on the individual rather than the social component of emotions. In this paper, we highlight current limitations in the latter line of research and suggest a stronger emphasis on the mechanisms of how emotions in livestock are transmitted and shared, which could serve as a promising tool to synergistically enhance the welfare of all individuals within a group.","[{'authorId': '4164386', 'name': 'Luigi Baciadonna'}, {'authorId': '2089514595', 'name': 'S.

Coupled nonlinear dynamical systems (logistic equations) were used to model the emergence, maintenance, and disruption of coordination in such relationships. For each system (partner), there was a control parameter corresponding to an internal state and a dynamical variable corresponding to behavior. Computer simulations investigated how the temporal coordination of behavior in a relationship reflects the similarity of partners’ control parameters and the strength of coupling (mutual influence between partners). Several types of coordination were observed, with in-phase synchronization occurring for strong coupling and similarity in internal states. In a variation of the model, each system could adjust its own control parameter to synchronize its dynamics with that of the other system.

The proposed approach moves from interactions at the microscopic scale and shows how the same modeling principles lead to kinetic and hydrodynamic models. Hence, a unified framework is developed which permits to derive models at each scale using the same principles and similar parameters. This approach can be used to simulate crowd dynamics in complex environments composed of interconnected areas, where the most appropriate scale of description can be selected for each area. This offers a pathway to the development of a multiscale computational model which has the capability to optimize the granularity of the description depending on the pedestrian local flow conditions. An important feature of the modeling at each scale is that the complex interaction between emotional states of walkers and their motion is taken into account.","[{'authorId': '46971369', 'name': 'B.

5071f3e07e3a3143961acd4640532c49dc493979,"Background Bystander affiliation (post-conflict affiliation from an uninvolved bystander to the conflict victim) may represent an expression of empathy in which the bystander consoles the victim to alleviate the victim's distress (“consolation”). However, alternative hypotheses for the function of bystander affiliation also exist. Determining whether ravens spontaneously offer consolation to distressed partners may not only help us to understand how animals deal with the costs of aggressive conflict, but may also play an important role in the empathy debate. Methodology/Principal findings This study investigates the post-conflict behavior of ravens, applying the predictive framework for the function of bystander affiliation for the first time in a non-ape species. We found weak evidence for reconciliation (post-conflict affiliation between former opponents), but strong evidence for both bystander affiliation and solicited bystander affiliation (post-conflict affiliation from the victim to a bystander). Bystanders involved in both interactions were likely to share a valuable relationship with the victim. Bystander affiliation offered to the victim was more likely to occur after intense conflicts. Renewed aggression was less likely to occur after the victim solicited affiliation from a bystander. Conclusions/Significance Our findings suggest that in ravens, bystanders may console victims with whom they share a valuable relationship, thus alleviating the victims' post-conflict distress. Conversely victims may affiliate with bystanders after a conflict in order to reduce the likelihood of renewed aggression. These results stress the importance of relationship quality in determining the occurrence and function of post-conflict interactions, and show that ravens may be sensitive to the emotions of others.","[{'authorId': '4570152', 'name': 'Orlaith N.

We aimed to clarify the temporal dynamics of this cortical activation by neuromagnetic recordings during execution, on-line imitation, and observation of right-hand reaching movements that ended with a precision pinch of the tip of a manipulandum. During execution, the left inferior frontal cortex [Brodmann's area (BA) 44] was activated first (peak approximately 250 ms before the pinching); this activation was followed within 100-200 ms by activation in the left primary motor area (BA4) and 150-250 ms later in the right BA4. During imitation and observation, the sequence was otherwise similar, but it started from the left occipital cortex (BA19). Activation was always strongest during action imitation. Only the occipital activation was detected when the subject observed the experimenter reaching his hand without pinching. These results suggest that the left BA44 is the orchestrator of the human ""mirror neuron system"" and is strongly involved in action imitation.

Here I argue that music is, by definition, sound that we believe has been in some way organized by a human agent, meaning that listening to any musical sounds can be a social experience. There are a number of distinct mechanisms by which we might associate musical sound with agency. While some of these mechanisms involve learning motor associations with that sound, it is also possible to have a more direct relationship from musical sound to agency, and the relative importance of these potentially independent mechanisms should be further explored. Overall, I conclude that the apparent paradox of solipsistic musical engagement is in fact unproblematic, because the way that we perceive and experience musical sounds is inherently social.","[{'authorId': '34174891', 'name': 'J.

Hofstede's individualism-collectivism dimension is used for illustration, because some research has shown that it is a key cultural aspect influencing response to marketing tactics. However, the key issue is to demonstrate an approach to understanding cultural impact, not to argue that any specific cultural dimension or schema is most important. The article proposes that culture could influence customer perceptions of perceived service quality and brand name, i.e., it has a direct effect on how people perceive these things. Moreover, culture could also moderate the relationships between service quality, brand name and loyalty, i.e., it influences the strength of the relationship between perceptions about the service a key form of purchase behavior. Results from a survey of 611 airline passengers across three Asian and three Western nationalities indicate this way of thinking about culture's impact on marketing models is plausible.","[{'authorId': '2097275218', 'name': 'Veerapong Malai'}, {'authorId': '71414602', 'name': 'M.

Surprisingly, little evidence has been found for similarity in personality—one of the most fundamental psychological constructs. We argue that the lack of evidence for personality similarity stems from the tendency of individuals to make personality judgments relative to a salient comparison group, rather than in absolute terms (i.e., the reference-group effect), when responding to the self-report and peer-report questionnaires commonly used in personality research. We employed two behavior-based personality measures to circumvent the reference-group effect. The results based on large samples provide evidence for personality similarity between romantic partners (n = 1,101; rs = .20–.47) and between friends (n = 46,483; rs = .12–.31).

We propose that feeling and expressing positive emotions on the job have favorable consequences on: 1 employees independent of their relationships with others e.g., greater persistence, 2 reactions of others to employees e.g., ""halo,"" or overgeneralization to other desirable traits, and 3 reactions of employees to others e.g., helping others. These three sets of intervening processes are proposed, in turn, to lead to work achievement, job enrichment and a higher quality social context. A partial test of this framework is made in an 18-month study of 272 employees. Results indicate that positive emotion on the job at time 1 is associated with evidence of work achievement more favorable supervisor evaluations and higher pay and a supportive social context more support from supervisors and coworkers at time 2.

These affective characteristics then combine to form a group's affective composition. We discuss explicit and implicit processes through which this affective combination occurs by examining the research on emotional contagion, entrainment, modeling, and the manipulation of affect. We also explore how elements of the affective context, such as organizationwide emotion norms and the group's particular emotional history, may serve to constrain or amplify group members' emotions. The outcome, group emotion, results from the combination of the group's affective composition and the affective context in which the group is behaving.

52647ddd3d27e5dbe1ac5fe47419db713c45732f,"Significance Cutaneous sensitivity appears to be abnormal in Rett syndrome and other autistic disorders. Using rats with disrupted methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) expression characteristic of Rett syndrome, we found that MeCP2 deficiency in sensory neurons led to augmented pressure and cold sensitivity but hyposensitivity to heat, accompanied by respective changes in cutaneous innervation. Transcriptome analysis of MeCP2-deficient ganglia showed up-regulation of genes associated with actin cytoskeletal dynamics and adhesion formation; down-regulating key genes in vivo normalized both mechanical sensitivity and innervation density. These findings provide evidence that ganglion cytoskeletal genes play key roles in determining mechanosensory properties, which may contribute to altered pain sensitivity in Rett syndrome and other painful conditions. Children with Rett syndrome show abnormal cutaneous sensitivity. The precise nature of sensory abnormalities and underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Rats with methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) mutation, characteristic of Rett syndrome, show hypersensitivity to pressure and cold, but hyposensitivity to heat. They also show cutaneous hyperinnervation by nonpeptidergic sensory axons, which include subpopulations encoding noxious mechanical and cold stimuli, whereas peptidergic thermosensory innervation is reduced. MeCP2 knockdown confined to dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons replicated this phenotype in vivo, and cultured MeCP2-deficient ganglion neurons showed augmented axonogenesis. Transcriptome analysis revealed dysregulation of genes associated with cytoskeletal dynamics, particularly those controlling actin polymerization and focal-adhesion formation necessary for axon growth and mechanosensory transduction. Down-regulation of these genes by topoisomerase inhibition prevented abnormal axon sprouting. We identified eight key affected genes controlling actin signaling and adhesion formation, including members of the Arhgap, Tiam, and cadherin families. Simultaneous virally mediated knockdown of these genes in Rett rats prevented sensory hyperinnervation and reversed mechanical hypersensitivity, indicating a causal role in abnormal outgrowth and sensitivity. Thus, MeCP2 regulates ganglion neuronal genes controlling cytoskeletal dynamics, which in turn determines axon outgrowth and mechanosensory function and may contribute to altered pain sensitivity in Rett syndrome.","[{'authorId': '5582941', 'name': 'A.

In this review, we examine the variability in the individual peptides produced in different tissues and the impact of the simultaneous presence of their precursors or fragments. We also discuss the problems inherent in accurately measuring which of the precursors and their derived peptides are present in biological samples. We address how not being able to measure all the combinations of precursors and fragments quantitatively has affected our understanding of the pathophysiology associated with POMC processing. To understand how different ratios of peptides arise, we describe the role of the pro-hormone convertases (PCs) and their tissue specificities and consider the cellular processing pathways which enable regulated secretion of different peptides that play crucial roles in integrating a range of vital physiological functions. In the pituitary, correct processing of POMC peptides is essential to maintain the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and this processing can be disrupted in POMC-expressing tumors. In hypothalamic neurons expressing POMC, abnormalities in processing critically impact on the regulation of appetite, energy homeostasis, and body composition. More work is needed to understand whether expression of the POMC gene in a tissue equates to release of bioactive peptides. We suggest that this comprehensive view of POMC processing, with a focus on gaining a better understanding of the combination of peptides produced and their relative bioactivity, is a necessity for all involved in studying this fascinating physiological regulatory phenomenon.","[{'authorId': '4497553', 'name': 'Erika Harno'}, {'authorId': '4784174', 'name': 'T.

Inspection of this literature suggests that researchers have focused the majority of their attention on studying (a) the effects of power and status on superior-subo rdinate communication, (b) trust as a moderator of superior-subo rdinate communication, and (c) semantic-information distance as a source of misunderstand ing in superior-subo rdinate communication. It is concluded that future research should increasingly be developmental and longitudinal in nature and should take into greater consideration the effects situational variables have on communication in the superior-subordinate dyad. Status hierarchy is inherent in the nature of purposeful organizations.

How superiors and subordinates interact and communicate to achieve both personal and organizational goals has been an object of investigation by social scientists for most of the 20th century.

Classical experiments in mammalian models, mainly in primates and rodents, have shown that the amygdala is essential for appetitive and aversive associative processing and that dysfunction of this brain region leads to various psychiatric conditions, including depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, phobias, autism, and posttraumatic stress disorder. In the past 2 decades, the zebrafish (Danio rerio; Cyprinidae) has emerged as a versatile, reliable vertebrate model organism for the in vivo study of development, gene function, and numerous aspects of human pathologies.

Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
This paper uses semi-structured interviews to investigate the role of MITDs on employees’ WLB. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The findings underscore the important role of MITDs in terms of the attainment of flexibility (how, where, and when work is done), which is significant for achieving WLB. However, the use of MITDs has blurred the division between work and non-work domains. This has inadvertently lengthened employees’ working hours, has affected their family relationships, and affected their general health and well-being. The evidence suggests that MITDs have the potential to improve WLB but could also lead to work-life conflict if not properly managed.

We propose a new robot-assisted pedestrian regulation and study passive human–robot interaction (HRI). A learning-based motion control approach is presented for a robot to efficiently interact with pedestrians for desirable collective motion. We first formulate the problem into an optimal control framework using the pedestrian dynamics description based on existing social force models with embedded HRI forces. To solve the defined optimal control problem, we propose an adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) approach to provide adjustable motion parameters of the robot to efficiently interact with pedestrians so that the regulated pedestrian flow tracks a desired velocity. The ADP control process only uses observed flow information rather than the models of pedestrians, and the ADP method provides feedback control with online learning and control capability. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can regulate pedestrian flows to desirable speeds by online learning.","[{'authorId': '2115484380', 'name': 'Chao Jiang'}, {'authorId': '2142260323', 'name': 'Zhen Ni'}, {'authorId': '144979422', 'name': 'Yi Guo'}, {'authorId': '2198278', 'name': 'Haibo He'}]",32.0,,54.0,Learning Human–Robot Interaction for Robot-Assisted Pedestrian Flow Optimization,2019.0

This hypothesis was tested by having subjects watch another female undergraduate receive electric shocks and then giving them a chance to help her by taking the remaining shocks themselves. In each of two experiments, subjects' level of empathic emotion (low versus high) and their ease of escape from continuing to watch the victim suffer if they did not help (easy versus difficult) were manipulated in a 2 X 2 design. We reasoned that if empathy led to altruistic motivation, subjects feeling a high degree of empathy for the victim should be as ready to help when escape without helping was easy as when it was difficult. But if empathy led to egoistic motivation, subjects feeling empathy should be more ready to help when escape was difficult than when it was easy. Results of each experiment followed the former pattern when empathy was high and the latter pattern when empathy was low, supporting the hypothesis that empathy leads to altruistic rather than egoistic motivation to help.","[{'authorId': '32526876', 'name': 'C.

To date, this question has been researched through quantitative studies that produce diverse findings and qualitative studies adopting either a privacy or a surveillance perspective. In this article, we argue that qualitative research which moves beyond these dominant paradigms can contribute to answering this question, and we demonstrate this by reporting on focus group research in three European countries (the United Kingdom, Norway and Spain). Our method created a space in which to make sense of the diverse findings of quantitative studies, which relate to individual differences (such as extent of social media use or awareness of social media data mining) and differences in social media data mining practices themselves (such as the type of data gathered, the purpose for which data are mined and whether transparent information about data mining is available). Moving beyond privacy and surveillance made it possible to identify a concern for fairness as a common trope among users, which informed their varying viewpoints on distinct data mining practices. We argue that this concern for fairness can be understood as contextual integrity in practice (Nissenbaum, 2009) and as part of broader concerns about well-being and social justice.","[{'authorId': '143694964', 'name': 'H.

The purpose of this paper is to examine affective events theory (AET) by testing the mediating effect of employees’ positive affect at work in the relationships of leaders’ use of positive humor with employees’ work engagement, job performance, and organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs); and the moderating effect of transformational leadership style on the relationship between leaders’ use of positive humor and subordinate’s positive affect at work. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
Data were obtained from 235 full-time employees working for a large information technology and business consulting corporation. Moderated mediation (Hayes, 2013) was performed to test the proposed model. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
Leaders’ positive humor was related to creation of subordinates’ positive emotions at work and work engagement. Positive emotions at work did not mediate between leaders’ humor and performance or OCBs. In addition, leaders’ use of transformational leadership style made the relationship between leaders’ positive humor and employees’ positive emotions at work stronger. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
 
This study provides evidence of the positive relationship of leaders’ positive humor with employees’ positive emotions at work and work engagement. Such knowledge may help to inform the training workshops in humor employed by practitioners and potentially create a more enjoyable and fun workplace, which can lead to greater employee engagement. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
AET helps explain effects of leader humor, but the effects of are complex. Leader’s use of even positive humor is most likely to have favorable effects mainly depending on their leadership style (transformational) and if their humor successfully leads to positive emotions among employees.","[{'authorId': '117834203', 'name': 'Ashita Goswami'}, {'authorId': '2067561734', 'name': 'Prakash K.

540a35ab499d7819ddffc5e2c99b84fe31395b75,"ABSTRACT Within social psychology, group identification refers to a mental process that leads an individual to conceive of herself as a group member. This phenomenon has recently attracted a great deal of attention in the debate about shared agency. In this debate, group identification is appealing to many because it appears to explain important forms of intentionally shared actions in a cognitively unsophisticated way. This paper argues that, unless important issues about group identification are not illuminated, the heuristic function ascribed to this notion for an understanding of shared agency remains dubious at best and unfulfilled at worst. This paper offers such a clarification by distinguishing and describing two different mental processes that constitute group identification: adoption of the group perspective and transformation in self-understanding. It is claimed that the latter process consists in the production of what Ruth Millikan labels “Pushmi-Pullyu representations” and that it is developmentally prior with respect to the ability of adopting the group perspective.","[{'authorId': '5687052', 'name': 'Alessandro Salice'}, {'authorId': '5932713', 'name': 'Kengo Miyazono'}]",18.0,,80.0,"Being one of us.

I argue that theories of emotion causation should ideally address the problems of elicitation, intensity, and differentiation. Each of these problems can be divided into a subquestion that asks about the relation between stimuli and emotions (i.e., the functional level of process description, cf. Marr, 1982) and a subquestion that asks about the mechanism and representations that intervene (i.e., the algorithmic level of process description). The overview reveals that theories of emotion causation sometimes differ with regard to the kind of process that they hold responsible for emotion causation. More precisely, they hold different assumptions regarding the conditions under which the process is supposed to operate (optimal versus suboptimal), the format of the representations involved (propositional versus perceptual), and the object or input of the central process (stimulus versus responses/experience). Further, the overview reveals that theories of emotion causation sometimes differ with regard to the level of process description that they focus on. Finally, the overview brings to light several similarities among the theories discussed.","[{'authorId': '2064945', 'name': 'A. Moors'}]",306.0,,132.0,Theories of emotion causation: A review,2009.0
5421a25239b38f459d5bd86e1c46d9ae8a04cc7c,"Background: The propagation of communicable diseases through a population is an inherent spatial and temporal process of great importance for modern society. For this reason a spatially explicit epidemiologic model of infectious disease is proposed for a greater understanding of the disease's spatial diffusion through a network of human contacts. Objective: The objective of this study is to develop an agent-based modelling approach the integrates geographic information systems (GIS) to simulate the spread of a communicable disease in an urban environment, as a result of individuals' interactions in a geospatial context. Methods: The methodology for simulating spatiotemporal dynamics of communicable disease propagation is presented and the model is implemented using measles outbreak in an urban environment as a case study. Individuals in a closed population are explicitly represented by agents associated to places where they interact with other agents. They are endowed with mobility, through a transportation network allowing them to move between places within the urban environment, in order to represent the spatial heterogeneity and the complexity involved in infectious diseases diffusion. The model is implemented on georeferenced land use dataset from Metro Vancouver and makes use of census data sets from Statistics Canada for the municipality of Burnaby, BC, Canada study site. Results: The results provide insights into the application of the model to calculate ratios of susceptible/infected in specific time frames and urban environments, due to its ability to depict the disease progression based on individuals' interactions. It is demonstrated that the dynamic spatial interactions within the population lead to high numbers of exposed individuals who perform stationary activities in areas after they have finished commuting. As a result, the sick individuals are concentrated in geographical locations like schools and universities. Conclusion: The GIS-agent based model designed for this study can be easily customized to study the disease spread dynamics of any other communicable disease by simply adjusting the modeled disease timeline and/or the infection model and modifying the transmission process. This type of simulations can help to improve comprehension of disease spread dynamics and to take better steps towards the prevention and control of an epidemic outbreak.

In this paper, we show how the combined strength and wisdom of the crowds can be used to generate a large, high‐quality, word–emotion and word–polarity association lexicon quickly and inexpensively. We enumerate the challenges in emotion annotation in a crowdsourcing scenario and propose solutions to address them. Most notably, in addition to questions about emotions associated with terms, we show how the inclusion of a word choice question can discourage malicious data entry, help to identify instances where the annotator may not be familiar with the target term (allowing us to reject such annotations), and help to obtain annotations at sense level (rather than at word level). We conducted experiments on how to formulate the emotion‐annotation questions, and show that asking if a term is associated with an emotion leads to markedly higher interannotator agreement than that obtained by asking if a term evokes an emotion.","[{'authorId': '143880621', 'name': 'Saif M.

We present the matching scores (accuracy) for recognition of facial expressions and the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) index of agreement. In 2005, matching scores of 89% were reported for FaceReader. However, previous research used a version of FaceReader that implemented older algorithms (version 1.0) and did not contain FACS classifiers. In this study, we tested the newest version (6.0). FaceReader recognized 88% of the target emotional labels in the Warsaw Set of Emotional Facial Expression Pictures (WSEFEP) and Amsterdam Dynamic Facial Expression Set (ADFES). The software reached a FACS index of agreement of 0.67 on average in both datasets. The results of this validation test are meaningful only in relation to human performance rates for both basic emotion recognition and FACS coding. The human emotions recognition for the 2 datasets was 85%, therefore FaceReader is as good at recognizing emotions as humans. To receive FACS certification, a human coder must reach an agreement of 0.70 with the master coding of the final test. Even though FaceReader did not attain this score, action units (AUs) 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 25 might be used with high accuracy.

Data were gathered from 160 hospital employees who were married, living with a partner, or had at least one child or dependent living at home and worked a minimum of 20 h/week. The results indicated that WFC related significantly to both types of job satisfaction, but the relation was significantly stronger to composite job satisfaction than to global job satisfaction. When considering all three forms of conflict simultaneously (time-based, strain-based, and behavior-based), regression results revealed that behavior-based was the only form of conflict significantly related to job satisfaction. The results underscore the importance of considering both the form and direction of WFC and suggest several practical implications for organizations.","[{'authorId': '115585303', 'name': 'Carly S.

In addition, the individual personality also plays an important role in crowd emotional contagion. However, few existing works have investigated the two factors jointly. To solve this problem, we propose a personalized virtual and physical cyberspace-based emotional contagion model (PVP-ECM) to simulate the process of crowd emotional contagion. First, we construct an individual emotion model and propose the personalized emotional contagion rules to consider the influences of the individual personality on crowd emotional contagion coupling the virtual and physical cyberspaces. Second, we use mean field theory to derive an evolution process and obtain mean field equations for the PVP-ECM. Then, we solve the PVP-ECM numerically using the finite difference method. Third, we construct a personalized BA scale-free network for the PVP-ECM simulation to further verify the stability of the model. Finally, we perform the PVP-ECM simulation and implement a simulation system to visualize the results of our theoretical analysis. The experimental results show that our approach can simulate the process of crowd emotional contagion more realistically.

We meta-analyzed studies adopting the model to (a) examine the intercorrelations among illness representation dimensions, coping strategies, and illness outcomes; (b) test the sufficiency of a process model in which relations between illness representations and outcomes were mediated by coping strategies; and (c) test effects of moderators on model relations. Studies adopting the common-sense model in chronic illness (k = 254) were subjected to random-effects meta-analysis. The pattern of zero-order corrected correlations among illness representation dimensions (identity, consequences, timeline, perceived control, illness coherence, emotional representations), coping strategies (avoidance, cognitive reappraisal, emotion venting, problem-focused generic, problem-focused specific, seeking social support), and illness outcomes (disease state, distress, well-being, physical, role, and social functioning) was consistent with previous analyses. Meta-analytic path analyses supported a process model that included direct effects of illness representations on outcomes and indirect effects mediated by coping. Emotional representations and perceived control were consistently related to illness-related and functional outcomes via, respectively, lower and greater employment of coping strategies to deal with symptoms or manage treatment. Representations signaling threat (consequences, identity) had specific positive and negative indirect effects on outcomes through problem- and emotion-focused coping strategies. There was little evidence of moderation of model effects by study design, illness type and context, and study quality.

The birds tended to view distant objects laterally while they preferentially viewed objects less than 20–30 cm away frontally; this was true whether they were looking at another bird or at an inanimate object. However, as well as switching between lateral and frontal viewing, the hens also swung their heads from side to side with movements so large that the same object appeared to be viewed with completely different parts of the retina, and even with different eyes, in rapid succession. When confronted with a novel object, the hens walked more slowly but continued to show large head movements. This suggests that, unlike mammals, which gaze fixedly at novel objects, hens investigate them by moving the head and looking at them with different, specialized, parts of their eyes. Many aspects of bird behaviour, such as search image formation, vigilance and visual discriminations, may be affected by the way they move the head and eyes.

5537ba72016bac0c6575049b5a802ab5ead77152,"Empathy, as originally defined, refers to an emotional experience that is shared among individuals. When discomfort or alarm is detected in another, a variety of behavioral responses can follow, including greater levels of nurturing, consolation or increased vigilance towards a threat. Moreover, changes in systemic physiology often accompany the recognition of distressed states in others. Employing a mouse model of cue-conditioned fear, we asked whether exposure to conspecific distress influences how a mouse subsequently responds to environmental cues that predict this distress. We found that mice are responsive to environmental cues that predict social distress, that their heart rate changes when distress vocalizations are emitted from conspecifics, and that genetic background substantially influences the magnitude of these responses. Specifically, during a series of pre-exposure sessions, repeated experiences of object mice that were exposed to a tone-shock (CS-UCS) contingency resulted in heart rate deceleration in subjects from the gregarious C57BL/6J (B6) strain, but not in subjects from the less social BALB/cJ (BALB) strain. Following the pre-exposure sessions, subjects were individually presented with the CS-only for 5 consecutive trials followed by 5 consecutive pairings of the CS with the UCS.

These physiological and behavioral responses of B6 mice to social distress parallel features of human empathy.

If so, these expressions should override situationally based expectations used by a person in attributing an emotion to another. An alternative account is offered in which the face provides information relevant to emotion but does not signal a specific emotion. Therefore, in specified circumstances, situational rather than facial information was predicted to determine the judged emotion. This prediction was supported in 3 studies--indeed, in each of the 22 cases examined (e.g., a person in a frightening situation but displaying a reported ""facial expression of anger"" was judged as afraid). Situational information was especially influential when it suggested a nonbasic emotion (e.g., a person in a painful situation but displaying a ""facial expression of fear"" was judged as in pain).","[{'authorId': '3024196', 'name': 'James M.

56291e3b433cdc3973c428ac2fe69aa19b1022f9,"Tracking generic human motion is highly challenging due to its high-dimensional state space and the various motion types involved. In order to deal with these challenges, a fusion formulation which integrates low- and high-dimensional tracking approaches into one framework is proposed. The low-dimensional approach successfully overcomes the high-dimensional problem of tracking the motions with available training data by learning motion models, but it only works with specific motion types. On the other hand, although the high-dimensional approach may recover the motions without learned models by sampling directly in the pose space, it lacks robustness and efficiency. Within the framework, the two parallel approaches, low- and high-dimensional, are fused via a probabilistic approach at each time step. This probabilistic fusion approach ensures that the overall performance of the system is improved by concentrating on the respective advantages of the two approaches and resolving their weak points. The experimental results, after qualitative and quantitative comparisons, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in tracking generic human motion.","[{'authorId': '2125754654', 'name': 'Yuandong Xu'}, {'authorId': '1723409', 'name': 'J.

Consistent with the proposition that facial reactions are automatically controlled, the results showed that the corrugator muscle reaction was facilitated to negative stimuli and the zygomatic muscle reaction was facilitated to positive stimuli. The results further showed that, despite the fact that subjects were required to not react with their facial muscles at all, they could not avoid producing a facial reaction that corresponded to the negative and positive stimuli.","[{'authorId': '4583182', 'name': 'U.

Design Longitudinal social network analysis. Setting Framingham Heart Study social network. Participants 4739 individuals followed from 1983 to 2003. Main outcome measures Happiness measured with validated four item scale; broad array of attributes of social networks and diverse social ties. Results Clusters of happy and unhappy people are visible in the network, and the relationship between people's happiness extends up to three degrees of separation (for example, to the friends of one's friends' friends). People who are surrounded by many happy people and thosewho are central in the network are more likely to become happy in the future. Longitudinal statistical models suggest that clusters of happiness result from the spread of happiness and not just a tendency for people to associate with similar individuals. A friend who lives within a mile (about 1.6 km) and who becomes happy increasesthe probability that a person is happy by 25% (95% confidence interval 1% to 57%). Similar effects are seen in coresident spouses (8%, 0.2% to 16%), siblings who live within a mile (14%, 1% to 28%), and next door neighbours (34%, 7% to 70%). Effects are not seen between coworkers. The effect decays with time and with geographical separation. Conclusions People's happiness depends on the happiness of others with whom they are connected.

However, as another famous multiobjective optimization framework, decomposition-based multiobjective optimization has not received sufficient attention from constrained evolutionary optimization. In this paper, we make use of decomposition-based multiobjective optimization to solve constrained optimization problems (COPs). In our method, first of all, a COP is transformed into a biobjective optimization problem (BOP). Afterward, the transformed BOP is decomposed into a number of scalar optimization subproblems. After generating an offspring for each subproblem by differential evolution, the weighted sum method is utilized for selection. In addition, to make decomposition-based multiobjective optimization suit the characteristics of constrained evolutionary optimization, weight vectors are elaborately adjusted. Moreover, for some extremely complicated COPs, a restart strategy is introduced to help the population jump out of a local optimum in the infeasible region. Extensive experiments on three sets of benchmark test functions, namely, 24 test functions from IEEE CEC2006, 36 test functions from IEEE CEC2010, and 56 test functions from IEEE CEC2017, have demonstrated that the proposed method shows better or at least competitive performance against other state-of-the-art methods.","[{'authorId': '7425642', 'name': 'Bing-chuan Wang'}, {'authorId': '2145572068', 'name': 'Han-Xiong Li'}, {'authorId': '8326747', 'name': 'Qingfu Zhang'}, {'authorId': '49418176', 'name': 'Yong Wang'}]",65.0,,63.0,Decomposition-Based Multiobjective Optimization for Constrained Evolutionary Optimization,2018.0

It describes that the retrospective evaluation of pain is largely based on the discomfort experienced at the most intense point (peak) and at the end of the episode. This is notable because it means that longer episodes with a better ending can be remembered as less aversive than shorter ones; this is even if the former had the same peak in painfulness and an overall longer duration of pain. Until now, this bias has not been studied in the domain of anxiety despite the high relevance of variable levels of anxiety in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Therefore, we set out to replicate the original studies but with an induction of variable levels of anxiety. Of 64 women, half watched a clip from a horror movie which ended at the most frightening moment. The other half watched an extended version of this clip with a moderately frightening ending. Afterward, all participants were asked to rate the global anxiety which was elicited by the video. When the film ended at the most frightening moment, participants retrospectively reported more anxiety than participants who watched the extended version.

We first discuss endogenous OT, which research suggests is not yet a reliable biomarker of stress-related disorders. Second, we review effects of intranasal (IN) OT on processes relevant to stress-related disorders in healthy populations (anhedonia, reward processing, psychosocial stress reactivity, fear/anxiety, and social behavior) and their neurobiological mechanisms (e.g., the salience network and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis). Third, we present the sparse but promising findings from clinical populations, followed by discussion of critical moderating variables to consider in the service of maximizing the therapeutic potential of OT (e.g., patient sex and child maltreatment). We also identify heterogeneous findings and limitations of existing research, including reliance on single-dose studies in psychiatrically healthy samples and unanswered questions regarding the effectiveness of IN drug delivery and dosing schedules. Well-controlled multidose studies including women and measures of potentially moderating variables are sorely needed and would inform our understanding of the utility of OT for preventing and treating stress-related psychiatric disorders.","[{'authorId': '3980010', 'name': 'Lauren M.

Developing machines able to engage humans in rich and natural interpersonal interactions requires capturing such dynamics. This paper addresses primitive emotional contagion during dyadic interactions in which roles are prefixed. Primitive emotional contagion was defined as the tendency people have to automatically mimic and synchronize their multimodal behavior during interactions and, consequently, to emotionally converge. To capture emotional contagion, a cross-recurrence based methodology that explicitly integrates short and long-term temporal dynamics through the analysis of both facial expressions and sentiment was developed. This approach is employed to assess emotional contagion at unimodal, multimodal and cross-modal levels and is evaluated on the Solid SAL-SEMAINE corpus. Interestingly, the approach is able to show the importance of the adoption of cross-modal strategies for addressing emotional contagion.","[{'authorId': '1958033', 'name': 'G.

Based on a survey of active users of mobile telecommunications services in Taiwan, we obtained the following findings. First, we found that empathy, network quality, reliability, and assurance, but not tangibles and responsiveness, have a significant effect on service quality and value perception. Second, the effect of overall service quality on brand equity is partially mediated by perceived value. Third, overall service quality has differential mediation effects on the relationships between specific service quality dimensions and perceived value. Finally, empathy and network quality have direct effects on brand equity. For managers, our study suggests the importance of identifying key service drivers for building strong service brand for high-tech service firms. The identification of key service drivers could then enable these firms to make strategic decisions on services investments. It also demonstrates the importance of the humanisation of technology for services firms. This study is original in that it explores the path from specific services qualities to service brand equity.","[{'authorId': '49372356', 'name': 'Hongwei He'}, {'authorId': '2152887123', 'name': 'Yan Li'}]",105.0,,67.0,Key service drivers for high-tech service brand equity: The mediating role of overall service quality and perceived value,2010.0

Their activation influences cognitive and perceptive processes: Previous work suggests that an approach orientation instigates a focus on larger units as compared to avoidance. Study 1 confirms this assumption using a paradigm that more directly taps a person's tendency to represent objects as belonging to small or large units than prior studies. It was further predicted that the self should also be represented as belonging to larger units, and hence be more interdependent under approach than under avoidance. Study 2 supports this prediction. As a consequence of this focus on belonging to larger units, it was finally predicted that approach results in a stronger identification with one's in-group than avoidance. Studies 3 and 4 support that prediction.","[{'authorId': '4304161', 'name': 'Ravit Nussinson'}, {'authorId': '49347341', 'name': 'M.

SENTIWORDNET 3.0 is an improved version of SENTIWORDNET 1.0, a lexical resource publicly available for research purposes, now currently licensed to more than 300 research groups and used in a variety of research projects worldwide. Both SENTIWORDNET 1.0 and 3.0 are the result of automatically annotating all WORDNET synsets according to their degrees of positivity, negativity, and neutrality. SENTIWORDNET 1.0 and 3.0 differ (a) in the versions of WORDNET which they annotate (WORDNET 2.0 and 3.0, respectively), (b) in the algorithm used for automatically annotating WORDNET, which now includes (additionally to the previous semi-supervised learning step) a random-walk step for refining the scores. We here discuss SENTIWORDNET 3.0, especially focussing on the improvements concerning aspect (b) that it embodies with respect to version 1.0. We also report the results of evaluating SENTIWORDNET 3.0 against a fragment of WORDNET 3.0 manually annotated for positivity, negativity, and neutrality; these results indicate accuracy improvements of about 20% with respect to SENTIWORDNET 1.0.","[{'authorId': '1766896', 'name': 'Stefano Baccianella'}, {'authorId': '1699411', 'name': 'Andrea Esuli'}, {'authorId': '145077269', 'name': 'F.

So far, very few data are available on the effects of prenatal stress on circadian functioning of the HPA axis. Here, we studied the effects of prenatal stress on the circadian rhythm of corticosterone secretion in male and female adult rats. To evaluate the effects of prenatal stress on various regulatory components of corticosterone secretion, we also assessed the diurnal fluctuation of adrenocorticotropin, total and free corticosterone levels, and hippocampal corticosteroid receptors. Finally, in the search of possible maternal factors, we studied the effects of repeated restraint stress on the pattern of corticosterone secretion in pregnant female rats. Results demonstrate that prenatal stress induced higher levels of total and free corticosterone secretion at the end of the light period in both males and females, and hypercorticism over the entire diurnal cycle in females. No diurnal fluctuation of adrenocorticotropin was observed in any group studied. The effects of prenatal stress on corticosterone secretion could be mediated, at least in part, by a reduction in corticosteroid receptors at specific times of day. Results also show that prepartal stress alters the pattern of corticosterone secretion in pregnant females. Those data indicate that prenatally stressed rats exhibit an altered temporal functioning of the HPA axis, which, taken together with their abnormal response to stress, reinforces the idea of a general homeostatic dysfunction in those animals.","[{'authorId': '2242099587', 'name': 'Muriel Koehl'}, {'authorId': '6233748', 'name': 'M.

A review of the comparative study of empathy is thus timely to complement and constrain anthropocentric views, and to integrate current findings. However, this is not an easy task. The study of animal empathy has developed using different paradigms, different concepts of the phenomena involved, and the absence of a systematic program. Herein, we carry out a comprehensive review of the literature on complex forms of empathy in non‐human animals: sympathetic concern and empathic perspective‐taking. In particular, we focus on consolation and targeted helping, as the best examples of each category. In so doing, we try to shed light on the current debate concerning whether these phenomena are exclusively human traits. First, we try to clarify the terminology and taxonomy of forms of empathy, providing operative criteria for these phenomena that are applicable to both human and non‐human animals. Second, we discuss whether the available evidence qualifies such behaviour as empathic. Third, we aim to provide an integrative view of the field, clarifying the challenges and conditions to satisfy. We also hope to highlight the importance of the study of these processes for elucidating the evolutionary history of this capacity across the animal kingdom.","[{'authorId': '1403368046', 'name': 'Ana Pérez-Manrique'}, {'authorId': '3340081', 'name': 'A.

Researchers have found that their internet-based communication may lead to the spread of suicidal ideation, which presents a set of challenges for suicide prevention. To develop effective prevention and intervention strategies that can be efficiently applied in online communities, we need to understand the behavior of PSI in internet-based communities. However, to date there have been no studies that specifically focus on the behavior of PSI in Chinese online communities. A total of 4489 postings in which users explicitly expressed their suicidal ideation were labeled from 560,000 postings in an internet-based suicidal community on Weibo (one of the biggest social media platforms in China) to explore their behavior. The results reveal that PSI are significantly more active than other users in the community. With the use of social network analysis, we also found that the more frequently users communicate with PSI, the more likely that users would become suicidal. In addition, Chinese women may be more likely to be at risk of suicide than men in the community.

To examine whether the impact of mistreatment by patients on nurses' burnout can be exacerbated or attenuated depending on emotion-regulation strategies, and to explore the moderating role of supervisor support in the relationship between mistreatment and deep acting.


BACKGROUND
Aggression from patients is known to contribute significantly to nurse burnout. To date, the moderating role of emotion regulation strategies in the mistreatment-outcomes relationship has seldom been considered.


METHODS
The sample consisted of 105 nurses who were working while studying for their Master's degree. Data were collected using self-reported questionnaires. The research hypotheses were tested using hierarchical regression analyses.


RESULTS
Mistreatment and surface acting significantly contributed to nurse burnout. Deep acting had a buffering effect on the relationship between mistreatment and depersonalisation. The results also indicate that supervisor support was negatively associated with surface acting and may increase deep acting in response to mistreatment.


CONCLUSION
The use of an effective strategy for regulating emotions and supervisor support can protect nurses from the depletion of emotional resources.


IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT
By introducing emotion-regulation skills training and by encouraging the availability of support from supervisors, health-care organisations can help nurses better cope with emotionally charged interactions.","[{'authorId': '14436961', 'name': 'Ruhama Goussinsky'}, {'authorId': '16078185', 'name': 'Yael Livne'}]",40.0,,54.0,Coping with interpersonal mistreatment: the role of emotion regulation strategies and supervisor support.,2016.0

Children were categorized as low, moderate, or high risk for developing disruptive behavior disorders, depending on severity of current behavior problems. Hypothetical and real encounters with others in distress were used to examine children's affect, behavior, autonomic activity, and social cognitions. When children witnessed someone in distress, empathic concern and prosocial behaviors were present at similar levels for all risk groups. However, moderate and high-risk children were less able than low-risk children to remain positively engaged with distress victims. Girls showed more prosocial behavior than boys, and boys showed more anger than girls. During sadness mood inductions to assess autonomic activity, risk groups did not differ on heart rate or vagal tone. Girls showed higher skin conductance than boys, with high-risk girls showing the highest levels. Higher heart rate (and heart rate deceleration) predicted empathic concern and prosocial behavior, whereas lower heart rate was associated with aggression and avoidance, irrespective of risk. Although biological correlates of emotions and behaviors that reflect caring versus indifference to others' distress are identified, they do not support an early direct link to externalizing psychopathologies.","[{'authorId': '1398158374', 'name': 'C.

One result was that subjects exhibited mood-state-dependent memory in recall of word lists, personal experiences recorded in a daily diary, and childhood experiences; people recalled a greater percentage of those experiences that were affectively congruent with the mood they were in dur- ing recall. Second, emotion powerfully influenced such cognitive processes as free associations, imaginative fantasies, social perceptions, and snap judgments about others' personalities (e.g., angry subjects generated an- gry associates, told hostile stories, and were prone to find fault with others). Third, when the feeling-tone of a narrative agreed with the reader's emotion, the salience and memorability of events in that narrative were increased. Thus, sad readers attended more to sad material, identified with a sad character from a story, and recalled more about that character. An associative network theory is proposed to account for these several results. In this theory, an emotion serves as a memory unit that can enter into associations with coincident events. Activation of this emotion unit aids retrieval of events associated with it; it also primes emotional themata for use in free association, fantasies, and per- ceptual categorization.","[{'authorId': '3057917', 'name': 'G.

Results indicated that one dimension of personality, Conscientiousness, showed consistent relations with all job performance criteria for all occupational groups. For the remaining personality dimensions, the estimated true score correlations varied by occupational group and criterion type. Extraversion was a valid predictor for two occupations involving social interaction, managers and sales (across criterion types). Also, both Openness to Experience and Extraversion were valid predictors of the training proficiency criterion (across occupations). Other personality dimensions were also found to be valid predictors for some occupations and some criterion types, but the magnitude of the estimated true score correlations was small (ρ < .10).

The proposed method interlinks the input examples into a structure we call the perception‐action graph (PAG) which can be used at run‐time to efficiently synthesize believable virtual crowds. A virtual character's state is encoded using a temporal representation, the Temporal Perception Pattern (TPP). The graph nodes store groups of similar TPPs whereas edges connecting the nodes store actions (trajectories) that were partially responsible for the transformation between the TPPs. The proposed method is being tested on various scenarios using different input data and compared against a nearest neighbours approach which is commonly employed in other data‐driven crowd simulation systems. The results show up to an order of magnitude speed‐up with similar or better simulation quality.","[{'authorId': '39066972', 'name': 'Panayiotis Charalambous'}, {'authorId': '1706408', 'name': 'Y.

Despite substantial literature addressing children and teenagers’ use and experience of music, little research has focused on their holistic (both intra- and extra-musical) understanding. This article reports on the third stage of a mixed-method nationwide UK enquiry concerning young people’s subjective experiences of music. This stage focused on meanings 10- to 18-year-olds attach to music. Participants from varied socio-demographic and music backgrounds (N = 84) listened to 20 short musical extracts through headphones, to which they gave free written responses. Their reports highlight shared cultural references, and the prevalence of perceived meanings indirectly related to or detached from the original musical source. Individual differences in age and training mediated musical meaning-making: 10- to 12-year-olds were most likely to report induced affect, employ self-reference (including self-in-scenario visualisations), and demonstrate vicarious experience through music. Increases in analytical listening, apparent from c. 15 years of age were primarily training-related. Participants aged 16 and above tended towards evaluative, detached modes of reporting, regardless of musical training level. Findings demonstrate that holistic understanding of music is subject to significant flux across adolescence.","[{'authorId': '87885003', 'name': 'Ruth Herbert'}, {'authorId': '2335627', 'name': 'Nicola Dibben'}]",10.0,,84.0,Making sense of music: Meanings 10- to 18-year-olds attach to experimenter-selected musical materials,2018.0

It is based on activation-evaluation space, a representation derived from psychology. The activation dimension measures how dynamic the emotional state is; the evaluation dimension is a global measure of the positive or negative feeling associated with the state. Research suggests that the space is naturally circular, i.e. states which are at the limit of emotional intensity define a circle, with alert neutrality at the centre. To turn those ideas into a recording tool, the space was represented by a circle on a computer screen, and observers described perceived emotional state by moving a pointer (in the form of a disc) to the appropriate point in the circle, using a mouse. Prototypes were tested, and in the light of results, refinements were made to ensure that outputs were as consistent and meaningful as possible. They include colour coding the pointer in a way that users readily associate with the relevant emotional state; presenting key emotion words as ‘landmarks’ at the strategic points in the space; and developing an induction procedure to introduce observers to the system. An experiment assessed the reliability of the developed system. Stimuli were 16 clips from TV programs, two showing relatively strong emotions in each quadrant of activationevaluation space, each paired with one of the same person in a relatively neural state. 24 raters took part. Differences between clips chosen to contrast were statistically robust. Results were plotted in activation-evaluation space as ellipses, each with its centre at the mean co-ordinates for the clip, and its width proportional to standard deviation across raters. The size of the ellipses meant that about 25 could be fitted into the space, i.e. FEELTRACE has resolving power comparable to an emotion vocabulary of 20 non-overlapping words, with the advantage of allowing intermediate ratings, and above all, the ability to track impressions continuously.","[{'authorId': '145635430', 'name': 'R.

We argue that employees make internal attributions when experiencing customer mistreatment and are likely to engage in rumination because of this perceived goal failure. The goal of this article was to test this conceptualization and examine the outcomes of customer mistreatment–induced rumination as well as emotional labor strategies as potential protective mechanisms against customer mistreatment. Findings from time-lagged data collected from 737 call-center customer representatives indicated that cognitive rumination mediated the relationship between customer mistreatment and supervisor-rated job performance, customer-directed sabotage, employee well-being, and emotional exhaustion. The second mediator, social sharing of negative events, mediated the relationship between customer mistreatment and emotional exhaustion only. As expected, cognitive rumination was positively related to customer sabotage and emotional exhaustion and negatively related to job performance and well-being. Social sharing of negative events was positively related to both well-being and emotional exhaustion.

In areas where elephants are living at high densities such damage can constitute an important management problem. A partial solution is to reduce elephant numbers by culling but this still leaves the problem of protecting specimen trees in amenity areas. In such cases an effective chemical repellent would be of great value. Elephants possess a pair of temporal scent glands. In the African Elephant, Loxodonta africana, there is evidence that the glands are particularly active in stressed or aggressive individuals, for example bulls in Musth (Buss et al. 1976, Poole & Moss 1981). Thus, the secretion may signal that an individual is frightened or aggressive and best avoided, and might therefore be potentially useful as a repellent. The secretion contains 5 volatile compounds; p-cresol, phenol, farnesol, farnesol hydrate and a farnesol dihydrate (Wheeler et al. 1982). The aims of this study were to investigate the behavioural responses of African Elephants to these chemicals; in particular, to determine whether they are repelled by them. The study was carried out in the Kruger National Park during July and August 1985. Observations were made on 7 young animals in captivity and on adults in the wild. Synthetic volatiles were used throughout. An equimolar mixture of acetic, propionic, butyric and valeric acids was used as a control olfactory stimulus.

Research shows that people automatically mimic other people’s perceived movements including their emotion expressions. However, IET does not seem to depend directly on mimicry, suggesting that other processes underlie contagion. Social appraisal is supported by studies showing that IET may depend on changes in explicit interpretations and evaluations of events, as well as implicitly registered cues relating to the direction of attention.

Theories of embodied emotion, however, suggest that such reactions might also occur across expressive channels, because simulation is based on integrated motoric and affective representations of that emotion. In the present studies, we examined this idea by focusing on facial and experiential reactions to nonverbal emotion vocalizations. In Studies 1 and 2, we showed that both hearing and reproducing vocalizations of anger, disgust, happiness, and sadness resulted in specific facial behaviors, as well as congruent self-reported emotions (Study 2). In Studies 3 and 4, we showed that the inhibition of congruent facial actions impaired listeners' processing of emotion vocalizations (Study 3), as well as their experiences of a concordant subjective state (Study 4). Results support the idea that cross-channel simulations of others' states serve facilitative functions similar to more strict imitations of observed expressive behavior, suggesting flexibility in the motoric and affective systems involved in emotion processing and interpersonal emotion transfer.

In the present study, we investigated the impact of dynamic facial expression and sex differences on facial mimicry and judgment of emotional intensity. Electromyography recordings were recorded from the corrugator supercilii, zygomaticus major, and orbicularis oculi muscles during passive observation of static and dynamic images of happiness and anger. The ratings of the emotional intensity of facial expressions were also analysed. As predicted, dynamic expressions were rated as more intense than static ones. Compared to static images, dynamic displays of happiness also evoked stronger activity in the zygomaticus major and orbicularis oculi, suggesting that subjects experienced positive emotion. No muscles showed mimicry activity in response to angry faces. Moreover, we found that women exhibited greater zygomaticus major muscle activity in response to dynamic happiness stimuli than static stimuli.

According to the prototype perspective, representations of early experiences are retained over time and continue to play an influential role in attachment behavior throughout the life course. In contrast, the revisionist perspective holds that early representations are subject to modification on the basis of new experiences and therefore may or may not reflect patterns of attachment later in life.

From a social comparison perspective, strangers’ positive posts on social media are expected to negatively affect viewers’ emotions. From an emotional contagion perspective, strangers’ positive posts should positively affect viewers’ emotions. The current lab experiment examines both the social comparison and the emotional contagion perspective while taking individual differences into account. Participants viewed positive, neutral, or no posts of confederates. In support of the social comparison perspective, individuals who tend to compare themselves to others reported lower positive affect if they had viewed positive posts than if they had viewed neutral or no posts. In support of the emotional contagion perspective, individuals who tend not to engage in social comparison reported higher positive affect after viewing positive posts than after viewing neutral or no posts. These findings indicate that individual differences in processing tendencies lead people to respond to social information on social media in opposite ways.","[{'authorId': '2254187670', 'name': 'Dian A. de Vries'}, {'authorId': '2254290471', 'name': 'A.

Reported anxiety and excitement were reliably related to the perceived anxiety and excitement of another person who was present during decision making. Risk and importance appraisals partially mediated effects of other's anxiety on own anxiety as predicted by social appraisal theory. However, other's emotion remained a significant independent predictor of own emotion after controlling for appraisals, supporting the additional impact of more direct forms of affect transfer such as emotion contagion. Significant affect-transfer effects remained even after controlling for participants' perceptions of the other's emotion in addition to all measured appraisals, confirming that affect transfer does not require explicit registration of someone else's feelings. This research provides some of the clearest evidence for the operation of both social appraisal and automatic affect transfer in everyday social life.","[{'authorId': '144603514', 'name': 'B.

Users’ perceptions of reciprocity in the community strengthen the influence of following past advice on active participation. However, a high level of reciprocity causes users following past advice to reduce their intentions to continue following that advice.Practical implicationsManagement tactics should specify active and passive participation in online travel communities.

These reactions reflect, in part, a tendency to mimic the facial stimuli. We investigated whether corresponding facial reactions can be elicited when people are unconsciously exposed to happy and angry facial expressions. Through use of the backward-masking technique, the subjects were prevented from consciously perceiving 30-ms exposures of happy, neutral, and angry target faces, which immediately were followed and masked by neutral faces. Despite the fact that exposure to happy and angry faces was unconscious, the subjects reacted with distinct facial muscle reactions that corresponded to the happy and angry stimulus faces. Our results show that both positive and negative emotional reactions can be unconsciously evoked, and particularly that important aspects of emotional face-to-face communication can occur on an unconscious level.","[{'authorId': '4583182', 'name': 'U.

The efficacy of the mean field theory approach is demonstrated on parameter estimation for one-dimensional mixture data and two-dimensional unsupervised stochastic model-based image segmentation. Experimental results indicate that in the 1-D case, the mean field theory approach provides results comparable to those obtained by Baum's (1987) algorithm, which is known to be optimal.

We report that transiently decreased amygdala Mecp2 expression during a sensitive period of brain sexual differentiation disrupts the organization of sex differences in juvenile social play behavior. Interestingly, neonatal treatment with Mecp2 small interfering RNA within the developing amygdala reduced juvenile social play behavior in males but not females. Reduced Mecp2 expression did not change juvenile sociability or anxiety-like behavior, suggesting that this disruption is associated with subtle behavioral modification. This suggests that Mecp2 may have an overlooked role in the organization of sexually dimorphic behaviors and that male juvenile behavior is particularly sensitive to Mecp2 disruption during this period of development.","[{'authorId': '1716445', 'name': 'Joseph R.

Six undergraduate senders' facial expressions were covertly videotaped as they watched emotionally loaded slides. After each slide, senders nominated the emotions term that best described their affective reaction and also rated the pleasantness and strength of that reaction. Similar nominations of emotion terms and ratings were later made by 53 undergraduate receivers who viewed the senders' videotaped facial expression. The central measure of communication accuracy was the match between senders' and receivers' emotion nominations. Overall accuracy was significantly greater than chance, although it was not impressive in absolute terms. Only happy, angry, and disgusted expressions were recognized at above-chance rates, whereas surprised expressions were recognized at rates that were significantly worse than chance. Female Ss were significantly better senders than were male Ss. Although neither sex was found to be better at receiving facial expressions, female Ss were better receivers of female senders' expressions than of male senders' expressions. Female senders' neutral and surprised expressions were more accurately recognized than were those of male senders. The only sex difference found for decoding emotions was a tendency for male Ss to be more accurate at recognizing anger. (25 ref)","[{'authorId': '144257022', 'name': 'H.

5eccf350a1f9aae6caa6b5968e0c845fa4626a97,"Repeated exposure to social stress can precipitate the development of psychosocial disorders including depression and comorbid cardiovascular disease. While a major component of social stress often encompasses physical interactions, purely psychological stressors (i.e. witnessing a traumatic event) also fall under the scope of social stress. The current study determined whether the acute stress response and susceptibility to stress-related consequences differed based on whether the stressor consisted of physical versus purely psychological social stress. Using a modified resident-intruder paradigm, male rats were either directly exposed to repeated social defeat stress (intruder) or witnessed a male rat being defeated. Cardiovascular parameters, behavioral anhedonia, and inflammatory cytokines in plasma and the stress-sensitive locus coeruleus were compared between intruder, witness, and control rats. Surprisingly intruders and witnesses exhibited nearly identical increases in mean arterial pressure and heart rate during acute and repeated stress exposures, yet only intruders exhibited stress-induced arrhythmias. Furthermore, re-exposure to the stress environment in the absence of the resident produced robust pressor and tachycardic responses in both stress conditions indicating the robust and enduring nature of social stress. In contrast, the long-term consequences of these stressors were distinct. Intruders were characterized by enhanced inflammatory sensitivity in plasma, while witnesses were characterized by the emergence of depressive-like anhedonia, transient increases in systolic blood pressure and plasma levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase. The current study highlights that while the acute cardiovascular responses to stress were identical between intruders and witnesses, these stressors produced distinct differences in the enduring consequences to stress, suggesting that witness stress may be more likely to produce long-term cardiovascular dysfunction and comorbid behavioral anhedonia while exposure to physical stressors may bias the system towards sensitivity to inflammatory disorders.","[{'authorId': '2238740982', 'name': 'Finnell Je'}, {'authorId': '2238823341', 'name': 'Lombard Cm'}, {'authorId': '2238823759', 'name': 'Padi Ar'}, {'authorId': '2238658578', 'name': 'Moffitt Cm'}, {'authorId': '2238820232', 'name': 'Wilson Lb'}, {'authorId': '2238820433', 'name': 'Wood Cs'}, {'authorId': '2238823276', 'name': 'Wood Sk'}]",80.0,,97.0,"Physical versus psychological social stress in male rats reveals distinct cardiovascular, inflammatory and behavioral consequences",2017.0

These informational underpinnings are conceptualized in a selective accessibility model that distinguishes 2 fundamental comparison processes. Similarity testing selectively makes accessible knowledge indicating target-standard similarity, whereas dissimilarity testing selectively makes accessible knowledge indicating target-standard dissimilarity. These respective subsets of target knowledge build the basis for subsequent target evaluations, so that similarity testing typically leads to assimilation whereas dissimilarity testing typically leads to contrast.

In novel environments, zebrafish swim to tank bottoms and dark backgrounds, behaviors attributed to anxiety associated with threat of predation. To examine possible genetic effects of inbreeding and segregation on this behavior, we compared Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC) AB and WIK lines to zebrafish and GloFish® from a pet store (PETCO) in two qualitatively different novel environments: the dive tank and aquatic light/dark plus maze. Behavior was observed in the dive tank for 5 min, immediately followed by 5 min in the light/dark plus maze. Among strains, WIK spent more time in the dive tank top than AB (76 ± 30 vs. 17 ± 11 sec), and AB froze in the plus maze center for longer than PETCO or GloFish® (162 ± 61 vs. 72 ± 29 or 27 ± 27 sec). Further, behavior of zebrafish exposed for 3 min to 25 mg/L nicotine, desipramine, chlordiazepoxide, yohimbine, 100 mg/L citalopram, 0.05% DMSO, or 0.5% ethanol was compared to controls. Approximately 0.1% of drug is available in brain after such exposures. Desipramine or citalopram-exposed fish spent more time in the dive tank top, and both reuptake inhibitors bound to serotonin transporters in zebrafish brain with high affinity (K(i) = 7 ± 5 and 9 ± 5 nM). In the plus maze, chlordiazepoxide, ethanol and DMSO-exposed fish crossed more lines and spent more time in white arms. Neither 25 mg/L nicotine nor yohimbine altered zebrafish behavior in novel environments, but nicotine was anxiolytic at higher doses. Overall, the light/dark plus maze and dive tank are distinct behavioral measures that are sensitive to treatment with anxiolytic compounds, but zebrafish line selection and solvents can influence baseline behavior in these tests.","[{'authorId': '6124174', 'name': 'James Sackerman'}, {'authorId': '5122003', 'name': 'J.

It was hypothesized that, although “social laughter” may represent some form of social facilitation, the laughter of others may act as a contextual cue directing the listener to search for a humourous interpretation of the stimulus material presented to him. Implications for the practice of using dubbed laughter in commercial broadcasting were briefly discussed.","[{'authorId': '2195796326', 'name': 'Raymond G. C.

The method is applied to the sentiment recognition module in the server, and the sentiment recognition function is effectively realized through the improved convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory (C-BiL) model. First, the implementation difficulties of the C-BiL model and specific sentiment classification design are described. Then, the specific design process of the C-BiL model is introduced, and the innovation of the C-BiL model is indicated. Finally, the experimental results of the models are compared and analyzed. Among the deep learning models, the accuracy of the C-BiL model designed in this study is relatively high irrespective of the binary classification, the three classification, or the five classification, with an average improvement of 2.47% in Diary data set, 2.16% in Weibo data set, and 2.08% in Fudan data set. Therefore, the C-BiL model designed in this study can not only successfully classify texts but also effectively improve the accuracy of text sentiment recognition.","[{'authorId': '2174533041', 'name': 'Baitao Liu'}]",1.0,,30.0,Research on Emotion Analysis and Psychoanalysis Application With Convolutional Neural Network and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory,2022.0

We appreciate her concerns; however, several comments in her Letter are already discussed and supported by data in our paper. We thus respectfully disagree with her claims about the limitations of our study and theoretical interpretation.

Vonk argues that we should distinguish between “responding to others’ internal states rather than to behaviors” before claiming emotional contagion in animals. While we appreciate the importance of disentangling these mechanisms, we disagree that “to experience emotional contagion implies that observers perceive others’ emotions.” Emotional contagion refers to the transfer of emotional states, …

Participants (N = 83) listened to different music pieces online. At the same time they gave a continuous self-report about their emotional state by moving their computer-mouse in a two-dimensional emotion space and indicating chills (strong emotions accompanied by shivers down the spine or goose pimples) by clicking the mouse button. The emotional dimensions assessed were arousal and valence. Participants reported that the music pieces caused different emotional reactions that were not significantly different from the lab study using the same stimuli. Thus, the validity of this Internet-based method could be confirmed. In general, nearly all participants evaluated positively most aspects of the study - with the exception of the participation time. None of the technical parameters investigated at the participants' computers significantly affected the emotional self-report, but an influence of the self-rated concentration on arousal and chill ratings was observed. The results also show that experiments in the Web offer a promising way for emotion research and provide insights on emotions experienced when listening to music in every day life.","[{'authorId': '144461383', 'name': 'Hauke Egermann'}, {'authorId': '2348591', 'name': 'F.

60e33c5ccd15023196dd7576f8aee9a41849f664,"Expectancy violations theory predicts and explains the effects of nonverbal behavior violations on interpersonal communication outcomes such as attraction, credibility, persuasion, and smooth interactions. Human interactions are strongly governed by expectations which, if violated, are arousing and trigger an appraisal process that may be moderated by the rewardingness of the violator. Violation interpretations and evaluations determine whether they are positive or negative violations. Positive violations are predicted to produce more favorable outcomes, and negative violations less favorable outcomes, than positive and negative confirmations respectively. Many of the theory's propositions have been supported empirically. Some contrary findings have led to revision of the theory. The theory has also been expanded to several kinds of nonverbal violations, including personal space, eye contact, posture, touch, involvement, and immediacy violations. The theory also spawned the investigation of the meanings associated with violations and the kinds of arousal that violations provoke.

The sentiment orientation of the idea title, description, and associated reviews is determined using a lexicon-based sentiment analysis approach. The research model is empirically tested using logistic regression analysis based on a dataset from the Microsoft community for business analytics products. The results reveal that the sentiment orientation of idea title has a negative influence on idea adoption, whilst the sentiment orientation of description has no influence on idea adoption. The sentiment orientation of the associated reviews has a positive influence on idea adoption, and this influence is moderated by the number of reviews. In addition, both idea title length and description length have a positive influence on idea adoption.

Two experiments were conducted to determine whether emotional experience and facial expression are influenced by vocal feedback as well. In experiment 1, subjects were asked to read a joyous, loving, sad, or angry script. The impact on emotional experience and expression was assessed in two ways: (a) subjects completed a self-report measure of emotion, and (b) judges rated subjects' faces as they read the scripts. In Experiments 2, subjects were required to try to reproduce a random sound pattern vocally. These tones were designed to mimic the voice quality, rhythm, intonation, and pausing associated with joy, love, sadness, anger, or fear, or in the control condition, with an emotionally neutral state. The impact on subjects' subjective emotional experience was assessed by a self-report questionnaire. As predicted, in both experiments, emotional experience and/or facial expression were affected by verbal and/or vocal feedback (Experiment 1)and by vocal feedback alone (Experiment 2).

Scientists have long sought to model the collective motion of large groups of individuals and study the mathematical basis of what seems to be apparently random behavior. A large number of macroscopic models have been proposed that describe crowd motion as a whole, much like the partial differential equations of fluid mechanics. This paper proposes a Lagrangian approach to the modeling of crowd dynamics by taking into consideration the various forces that act between the members of a crowd while they are in motion in a 2-D field. We attempt a realistic modeling of the attractive and repulsive forces between the members and seek to give a definite mathematical backbone to the terms “panic” and “evacuation.” That the dynamics is stable is demonstrated by constructing an appropriate Lyapunov energy function. We then linearize the dynamics to obtain mathematical expressions for the small perturbations about an equilibrium point. Through machine simulations and by tracking the motion of actual crowd systems, we show the validity of the mathematics of group formation and evacuation that we have proposed.","[{'authorId': '1500559043', 'name': 'Sudipto Mukherjee'}, {'authorId': '2755504', 'name': 'Debdipta Goswami'}, {'authorId': '153609700', 'name': 'Sarthak Chatterjee'}]",24.0,,53.0,A Lagrangian Approach to Modeling and Analysis of a Crowd Dynamics,2015.0

We find that in recent years the sociology of tourism was marked by three general trends: the growing application of specific novel theories from other fields to tourism, the examination of new facets of touristic phenomena and an intensified inquiry into the status of tourism as an intellectual or cultural project. We conclude that while the application of a range of novel theoretical perspectives and facets largely reflects the postmodern move away from binary thinking and concepts, the sociology of tourism still makes little contribution back to the discipline of sociology, and will need to address important emergent topics such as deglobalization and current nationalistic movements towards isolationism, to do so.","[{'authorId': '145823382', 'name': 'S.

To investigate this issue, we measured self-reported emotion, facial muscle activity, and autonomic activity in 32 participants while they listened to popular music composed with either a happy or a sad emotional expression. Results revealed a coherent manifestation in the experiential, expressive, and physiological components of the emotional response system, which supports the emotivist position. Happy music generated more zygomatic facial muscle activity, greater skin conductance, lower finger temperature, more happiness and less sadness than sad music. The finding that the emotion induced in the listener was the same as the emotion expressed in the music is consistent with the notion that music may induce emotions through a process of emotional contagion.","[{'authorId': '2484956', 'name': 'L.

6205a05653976e11aea56e84ce15cd7345434fc3,"Sharing others’ emotional states may facilitate understanding their intentions and actions. Here we show that networks of brain areas “tick together” in participants who are viewing similar emotional events in a movie. Participants’ brain activity was measured with functional MRI while they watched movies depicting unpleasant, neutral, and pleasant emotions. After scanning, participants watched the movies again and continuously rated their experience of pleasantness–unpleasantness (i.e., valence) and of arousal–calmness. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to derive multisubject voxelwise similarity measures [intersubject correlations (ISCs)] of functional MRI data. Valence and arousal time series were used to predict the moment-to-moment ISCs computed using a 17-s moving average. During movie viewing, participants' brain activity was synchronized in lower- and higher-order sensory areas and in corticolimbic emotion circuits. Negative valence was associated with increased ISC in the emotion-processing network (thalamus, ventral striatum, insula) and in the default-mode network (precuneus, temporoparietal junction, medial prefrontal cortex, posterior superior temporal sulcus). High arousal was associated with increased ISC in the somatosensory cortices and visual and dorsal attention networks comprising the visual cortex, bilateral intraparietal sulci, and frontal eye fields. Seed-voxel–based correlation analysis confirmed that these sets of regions constitute dissociable, functional networks. We propose that negative valence synchronizes individuals’ brain areas supporting emotional sensations and understanding of another’s actions, whereas high arousal directs individuals’ attention to similar features of the environment. By enhancing the synchrony of brain activity across individuals, emotions may promote social interaction and facilitate interpersonal understanding.","[{'authorId': '2036051', 'name': 'L.

6243794a90773449b36f13cdf728d5a13e66c59d,"A number of recent hypotheses have attempted to explain the ultimate evolutionary origins of laughter and humor. However, most of these have lacked breadth in their evolutionary frameworks while neglecting the empirical existence of two distinct types of laughter—Duchenne and non‐Duchenne—and the implications of this distinction for the evolution of laughter as a signal. Most of these hypotheses have also been proposed in relative isolation of each other and remain disjointed from the relevant empirical literature. Here we attempt to remedy these shortcomings through a synthesis of previous laughter and humor research followed by (i) a reevaluation of this research in light of theory and data from several relevant disciplines, and (ii) the proposal of a synthetic evolutionary framework that takes into account phylogeny and history as well as proximate mechanisms and adaptive significance. We consider laughter to have been a preadaptation that was gradually elaborated and co‐opted through both biological and cultural evolution. We hypothesize that Duchenne laughter became fully ritualized in early hominids between 4 and 2 mya as a medium for playful emotional contagion. This mechanism would have coupled the emotions of small hominid groups and promoted resource‐building social play during the fleeting periods of safety and satiation that characterized early bipedal life. We further postulate that a generalized class of nonserious social incongruity would have been a reliable indicator of such safe times and thereby came to be a potent distal elicitor of laughter and playful emotion. This class of stimuli had its origins in primate social play and was the foundation for formal human humor. Within this framework, Duchenne laughter and protohumor were well established in the hominid biobehavioral repertoire when more cognitively sophisticated traits evolved in the hominid line between 2 mya and the present. The prior existence of laughter and humor allowed them to be co‐opted for numerous novel functions, and it is from this process that non‐Duchenne laughter and the “dark side” of laughter emerged. This perspective organizes the diversified forms and functions that characterize laughter and humor today and clarifies when and how laughter and humor evolved during the course of human evolution.","[{'authorId': '5226454', 'name': 'Matthew M.

Since neurovirulence may be determined at the early stages of infection of the central nervous system (CNS), we hypothesize that it may depend on the ability of the virus to induce proinflammatory signals from brain cells for the recruitment of blood-derived inflammatory cells. To test this hypothesis, we studied the interaction between coronaviruses (mouse hepatitis virus) of different neurovirulences with primary cell cultures of brain immune cells (astrocytes and microglia) and mouse tissues. We found that the level of neurovirulence of the virus correlates with its differential ability to induce proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin 12 [IL-12] p40, tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-6, IL-15, and IL-1β) in astrocytes and microglia and in mouse brains and spinal cords. These findings suggest that coronavirus neurovirulence may depend on a novel discriminatory ability of astrocytes and microglia to induce a proinflammatory response in the CNS.","[{'authorId': '2117014703', 'name': 'Yun Li'}, {'authorId': '50660673', 'name': 'L.

Any negative electronic word of mouth (eWOM) has the potential to become an online firestorm, yet not every post does, so finding ways to detect and respond to negative eWOM constitutes a critical managerial priority. The authors develop a comprehensive framework that integrates different drivers of negative eWOM and the response approaches that firms use to engage in and disengage from online conversations with complaining customers. A text-mining study of negative eWOM demonstrates distinct impacts of high- and low-arousal emotions, structural tie strength, and linguistic style match (between sender and brand community) on firestorm potential. The firm’s response must be tailored to the intensity of arousal in the negative eWOM to limit the virality of potential online firestorms. The impact of initiated firestorms can be mitigated by distinct firm responses over time, and the effectiveness of different disengagement approaches also varies with their timing. For managers, these insights provide guidance on how to detect and reduce the virality of online firestorms.","[{'authorId': '80237519', 'name': 'D. Herhausen'}, {'authorId': '143876868', 'name': 'S.

The grief, anger, fear, anxiety, and depression that commonly beset cancer patients and their families can further erode health and well-being. However, there is a favorable aspect to cancer. A person who has been diagnosed with it, defined as a survivor, will often lead a fuller, more meaningful life. Survivors may have a greater appreciation of being alive, a diminished fear of death, a more optimistic outlook, and a deeper faith in God. They have described the experience as life changing “from black and white to full color” and one expressed his spiritual renewal in these terms: “I savor and cherish every moment. I smell the grass when I cut it, bask in the feel of the sun on my face, and watch ants and clouds go by.” Harold Benjamin, PhD, and founder of the Wellness Community, a support program for those fighting for recovery from cancer, once said, “The more laughter there is, the higher the quality-of-life, and the higher the quality-of-life, the greater the will to live.” This article explores the effects of therapeutic humor and an optimistic perspective on the quality of the lives of cancer survivors.","[{'authorId': '144666210', 'name': 'Janice Mcmurray'}]",215.0,,0.0,Laughter,1885.0

Millions of users every day log on their Facebook or Twitter accounts to get updates and news, read about their topics of interest, and become exposed to new opportunities and interactions. Although recent studies suggest that the contents users produce will affect the emotions of their readers, we still lack a rigorous understanding of the role and effects of contents sentiment on the dynamics of information diffusion. This work aims at quantifying the effect of sentiment on information diffusion, to understand: (i) whether positive conversations spread faster and/or broader than negative ones (or vice-versa); (ii) what kind of emotions are more typical of popular conversations on social media; and, (iii) what type of sentiment is expressed in conversations characterized by different temporal dynamics. Our findings show that, at the level of contents, negative messages spread faster than positive ones, but positive ones reach larger audiences, suggesting that people are more inclined to share and favorite positive contents, the so-calledpositive bias. As for the entire conversations, we highlight how different temporal dynamics exhibit different sentiment patterns: for example, positive sentiment builds up for highly-anticipated events, while unexpected events are mainly characterized by negative sentiment. Our contribution represents a step forward to understand how the emotions expressed in short texts correlate with their spreading in online social ecosystems, and may help to craft effective policies and strategies for content generation and diffusion.","[{'authorId': '48898287', 'name': 'Emilio Ferrara'}, {'authorId': '121937545', 'name': 'Zeya Yang'}]",168.0,,69.0,Quantifying the Effect of Sentiment on Information Diffusion in Social Media,2015.0

In this article, I propose such a framework by suggesting that PEs can play 3 roles when people attempt to regulate their emotional response to negative events. First, PEs may serve as the ultimate target of emotion regulation (ER) such that people attempt to feel better by regulating their PEs regardless of whether they also regulate their negative emotions. Second, PEs may serve as a mediator of ER such that people regulate their PEs in order to satisfy their ultimate goal of regulating their negative emotions. Third, PEs may serve as a moderator of ER such that incidental PEs (those occurring from some other source besides ER) may moderate people's ability to regulate positive or negative emotions. I also discuss how to determine what roles that PEs are playing in a given instance of ER, how PEs may sometimes not help ER, and how this framework contributes to the burgeoning literature on regulatory flexibility by providing different roles of PEs in ER that may be more or less effective for different people and circumstances.

Many studies have shown that daily repeated maternal separation (MS), an animal model of early life stress, can regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) and affect subsequent brain function and behavior during adulthood. However, the molecular basis of the long-lasting effects of early life stress on brain function has not been fully elucidated. In this mini review, we present various cases of MS in rodents and illustrate the alterations in HPA axis activity by focusing on corticosterone (CORT). We then show a characterization of the brain regions affected by various patterns of MS, including repeated MS and single time MS at various stages before weaning, by investigating c-Fos expression. These CORT and c-Fos studies suggest that repeated early life stress may affect neuronal function in region- and temporal-specific manners, indicating a critical period for habituation to early life stress. Next, we introduce how early life stress can impact behavior, namely by inducing depression, anxiety or eating disorders, and alterations in gene expression in adult mice subjected to MS.","[{'authorId': '3814139', 'name': 'M.

Prior missing tag identification protocols concentrated on identifying all of the tags. However, there may be some scenarios in which we just care about the key tags instead of all tags, making it inefficient to merely identify the missing key tags due to the interference of replies from the ordinary tags (i.e., nonkey tags). In this paper, we propose to investigate the problem of efficiently and completely identifying the missing key tags for anonymous RFID systems in which the tag privacy is required to be well protected. First, we propose a vector-based missing key tag identification protocol called VEKI. Then we propose an improved protocol called iVEKI, which consists of two phases: 1) ordinary tag deactivation and 2) missing key tag identification. The parameters of the proposed VEKI and iVEKI protocols are theoretically optimized to maximize the time efficiency. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the proposed VEKI and iVEKI protocols and the simulation results illustrate that they outperform other existing protocols in terms of execution time.","[{'authorId': '7315005', 'name': 'Honglong Chen'}, {'authorId': '3623271', 'name': 'Zhibo Wang'}, {'authorId': '144956430', 'name': 'Feng Xia'}, {'authorId': '2000338741', 'name': 'Yanjun Li'}, {'authorId': '49649544', 'name': 'Leyi Shi'}]",31.0,,33.0,Efficiently and Completely Identifying Missing Key Tags for Anonymous RFID Systems,2018.0

The asymmetric inhibition model proposes that right-lateralized executive control inhibits processing of positive or approach-related distractors, and left-lateralized control inhibits negative or withdrawal-related distractors. These complementary processes allow us to maintain and achieve current goals in the face of emotional distraction.

Typically, this evaluative discrimination is conceptualized as being bipolar (hostile-hospitable). This conceptualization is certainly evident in the area of attitudes, where the ubiquitous bipolar attitude measure, by gauging the net affective predisposition toward a stimulus, treats positive and negative evaluative processes as equivalent, reciprocally activated, and interchangeable. Contrary to conceptualizations of this evaluative process as bipolar, recent evidence suggests that distinguishable motivational systems underlie assessments of the positive and negative significance of a stimulus. Thus, a stimulus may vary in terms of the strength of positive evaluative activation and the strength of negative evaluative activation it evokes. Low activation of positive and negative evaluative processes by a stimulus reflects attitude neutrality or indifference, whereas high activation of positive and negative evaluative processes reflects attitude ambivalence. As such, attitudes can be represented more completely within a bivariate space than along a bipolar continuum. Evidence is reviewed showing that the positive and negative evaluative processes underlying many attitudes are distinguishable (stochastically and functionally independent), are characterized by distinct activation functions (positivity offset and negativity bias principles), are related differentially to attitude ambivalence (corollary of ambivalence asymmetries), have distinguishable antecedents (heteroscedacity principle), and tend to gravitate from a bivariate toward a bipolar structure when the underlying beliefs are the target of deliberation or a guide for behavior (principle of motivational certainty). The implications for societal phenomena such as political elections and democratic structures are discussed.","[{'authorId': '2285765', 'name': 'J. Cacioppo'}, {'authorId': '34953711', 'name': 'W.

This study was undertaken to clarify how genetic liability and stressful life events interact in the etiology of major depression.


METHOD
Information about stressful life events and onset of major depressive episodes in the past year was collected in a population-based sample of female-female twin pairs including 2,164 individuals, 53,215 person-months of observation, and 492 onsets of depression.


RESULTS
Nine ""personal"" and three aggregate ""network"" stressful events significantly predicted onset of major depression in the month of occurrence, four of which predicted onset with an odds ratio of > 10 and were termed ""severe"": death of a close relative, assault, serious marital problems, and divorce/breakup. Genetic liability also had a significant impact on risk of onset of depression. For severe stressful events, as well as for 10 of the 12 individual stressful events, the best-fitting model for the joint effect of stressful events and genetic liability on onset of major depression suggested genetic control of sensitivity to the depression-inducing effects of stressful life events. In individuals at lowest genetic risk (monozygotic twin, co-twin unaffected), the probability of onset of major depression per month was predicted to be 0.5% and 6.2%, respectively, for those unexposed and exposed to a severe event. In those at highest genetic risk (monozygotic twin, co-twin affected), these probabilities were 1.1% and 14.6%, respectively. Linear regression analysis indicated significant Genotype by Environment interaction in the prediction of onset of major depression.


CONCLUSIONS
Genetic factors influence the risk of onset of major depression in part by altering the sensitivity of individuals to the depression-inducing effect of stressful life events.","[{'authorId': '7225980', 'name': 'K.

Beyond the core brain areas typically activated in pain empathy studies (insular and anterior cingulate cortices), the diversity of paradigms used may reveal secondary networks that subserve other more specific processes. A coordinate-based meta-analysis of fMRI experiments on pain empathy was conducted to obtain activation likelihood estimates along three factors and seven conditions: visual cues (body parts, facial expressions), visuospatial (first-person, thirdperson), and cognitive (self-, stimuli-, other-oriented tasks) perspectives. The core network was found across cues and perspectives, and common activation was observed in higher-order visual areas. Body-parts distinctly activated areas related with sensorimotor processing (superior and inferior parietal lobules, anterior insula) while facial expression distinctly involved the inferior frontal gyrus. Self- compared to other-perspective produced distinct activations in the left insula while stimulus- versus other-perspective produced distinctive responses in the inferior frontal and parietal lobules, precentral gyrus, and cerebellum. Pain empathy relies on a core network which is modulated by several secondary networks. The involvement of the latter seems to depend on the visual cues available and the observer's mental state that can be influenced by specific instructions.","[{'authorId': '74158235', 'name': 'Josiane Jauniaux'}, {'authorId': '46572712', 'name': 'A.

Moreover, there is considerable agreement in our impressions, which carry significant social outcomes. Appearance matters because some facial qualities are so useful in guiding adaptive behavior that even a trace of those qualities can create an impression. Specifically, the qualities revealed by facial cues that characterize low fitness, babies, emotion, and identity are overgeneralized to people whose facial appearance resembles the unfit (anomalous face overgeneralization), babies (babyface overgeneralization), a particular emotion (emotion face overgeneralization), or a particular identity (familiar face overgeneralization). We review studies that support the overgeneralization hypotheses and recommend research that incorporates additional tenets of the ecological theory from which these hypotheses are derived: the contribution of dynamic and multi-modal stimulus information to face perception; bidirectional relationships between behavior and face perception; perceptual learning mechanisms and social goals that sensitize perceivers to particular information in faces.","[{'authorId': '4667187', 'name': 'Leslie A.

The victims of bullying are subjected to being terrorized, annoyed, excluded, belittled, deprived of resources, isolated and prevented from claiming rights. The victims of bullying have decreased job satisfaction, work performance, motivation and productivity. Bullying also negatively affects victims' social relationships inside and outside the institution.


OBJECTIVES
This study was conducted as a cross-sectional and descriptive study for the purpose of assessing the workplace, bullying of nurses in Turkey and the effects it has on nursing practices.


METHOD
The sample was composed of 286 nurses, and all of the respondents were female. The research instrument was a questionnaire in five parts. The first section included the participants' demographic information; the other variables were measured in four categories: psychologically violent behaviours, workload, organizational effects and depression.


FINDINGS
Thirty-seven per cent of the nurses participating in the research had never or almost never encountered workplace bullying behaviour in the last 12 months, 21% of the nurses had been exposed to these behaviours. There were no differences between position and educational level in workplace bullying. Workplace bullying leads to depression, lowered work motivation, decreased ability to concentrate, poor productivity, lack of commitment to work, and poor relationships with patients, managers and colleagues.


CONCLUSION
Workplace bullying is a measurable problem that negatively affects the psychology and performance of the nurses in this study.","[{'authorId': '1435532960', 'name': 'D. Yıldırım'}]",249.0,,37.0,Bullying among nurses and its effects.,2009.0

However, recent reports suggest they may have a much earlier therapeutic onset. A reduction in amygdala responsivity has been implicated in the therapeutic action of SSRIs. Aims To investigate the effect of a single dose of an SSRI on the amygdala response to emotional faces. Method Twenty-six healthy volunteers were randomised to receive a single oral dose of citalopram (20 mg) or placebo. Effects on the processing of facial expressions were assessed 3 h later using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results Volunteers treated with citalopram displayed a significantly reduced amygdala response to fearful facial expressions compared with placebo. Conclusions Such an immediate effect of an SSRI on amygdala responses to threat supports the idea that antidepressants have an earlier onset of therapeutically relevant effects than conventionally thought.","[{'authorId': '34575423', 'name': 'S.

Sixty-two female undergraduates were randomly paired and they engaged in a 6-min unstructured conversation. Interpersonal synchrony was evaluated by calculating the cross-wavelet coherence of the time-series movement data, extracted using a video-image analysis software. The existence of synchrony was tested using a pseudo-synchrony paradigm. In addition, the frequency at which the synchrony occurred and the distribution of the relative phase was explored. The results showed that the value of cross-wavelet coherence was higher in the experimental participant pairs than in the pseudo pairs. Further, the coherence value was higher in the frequency band under 0.5 Hz. These results support the validity of evaluating interpersonal synchron Behavioral mimicry and interpersonal syyby using wavelet transform even in an unstructured conversation. However, the role of relative phase was not clear; there was no significant difference between each relative-phase region. The theoretical contribution of these findings to the area of interpersonal coordination is discussed.","[{'authorId': '152235686', 'name': 'K.

This study examines the structure of 105 work groups and management teams to address the question of whether conflict can be beneficial. Multiple methods were used to examine the effects of conflict on both individualand group-level variables to provide a more refined model of intragroup conflict. Results show that whether conflict was beneficial depended on the type of conflict and the structure of the group in terms of task type, task interdependence, and group norms. Relationship and task conflicts were negatively associated with individuals' satisfaction, liking of other group members, and intent to remain in the group. In groups performing very routine tasks, disagreements about the task were detrimental to group functioning. In contrast, in groups performing nonroutine tasks, disagreements about the tasks did not have a detrimental effect, and in some cases, such disagreements were actually beneficial. Contrary to expectations, norms encouraging open discussion of conflict were not always advantageous. The results suggest that while such norms were associated with an increase in the number and intensity of relationship conflicts, they did not increase members' ability to deal with the conflicts constructively.

To address these questions, we developed a nonexperimental, noninvasive method to detect and quantify contagion of semantic expression in massive online social networks, which we review and discuss here. Using only observational data, the method avoids performing emotional experiments on users of online social networks, a research practice that recently became an object of criticism and concern. Our model combines geographic aggregation and instrumental variables regression to measure the effect of an exogenous variable on an individual's expression and the influence of this change on the expression of others to whom that individual is socially connected. In a previous work, we applied our method to the emotional content of posts generated by a large sample of users over a period of three years. Those results suggest that each post expressing a positive or negative emotion can cause friends to generate one to two additional posts expressing the same emotion, and it also inhibits their use of the opposite emotion. Here, we generalize our method so it can be applied to contexts different than emotional expression and to different forms of content generated by the users of online platforms. The method allows us to determine the usage of words in the same semantic category spread, and to estimate a signed relationship between different semantic categories, showing that an increase in the usage of one category alters the usage of another category in one's social contacts. Finally, it also allows us to estimate the total cumulative effect that a person has on all of her social contacts.","[{'authorId': '2362022', 'name': 'Lorenzo Coviello'}, {'authorId': '2016371', 'name': 'J.

Participants were asked to recognize dynamic facial expressions of emotion (fear or anger in Experiment 1 and blends of fear and surprise or of anger and disgust in Experiment 2) in a target face presented at the center of a screen while a subliminal contextual face appearing in the periphery expressed an emotion (fear or anger) or not (neutral) and either looked at the target face or not. Results of Experiment 1 revealed that recognition of the target emotion of fear was improved when a subliminal angry contextual face gazed toward-rather than away from-the fearful face. We replicated this effect in Experiment 2, in which facial expression blends of fear and surprise were more often and more rapidly categorized as expressing fear when the subliminal contextual face expressed anger and gazed toward-rather than away from-the target face. With the contextual face appearing for 30 ms in total, including only 10 ms of emotion expression, and being immediately masked, our data provide the first evidence that social influence on emotion recognition can occur automatically.","[{'authorId': '7464625', 'name': 'C.

66e7eac48275fcef13dd61c91ac0792d04e1f33e,"Multi-agent systems simulation is used to predict human behaviour in emergency evacuation cases. However, as human behaviour can change under the effect of emotions, it is essential to create models of artificial agents and simulations that mimic such behaviour in order to make prediction of the overall system performance. In emotional agents, the role of emotional contagion is important. Emotional contagion is a result of interaction between agents which could affect each others emotions. It is the case that in emergency situations, emotions (especially calmness, fear and panic) may propagate in various ways, depending on the agents personality type as well as other factors. In this paper, we review various methods of emotional contagion. In order to develop emotional agent simulation, we start from a formal state-based modelling method and devise a number of variations of known emotional contagion methods. NetLogo visual simulation is used, in which a number of experiments is conducted. The results are useful to demonstrate different behaviour of different emotional contagion models in the evacuation of an open square area.","[{'authorId': '2228757', 'name': 'Marina Ntika'}, {'authorId': '2520399', 'name': 'I.

Using Brunswik’s lens model as a framework, we explored how hierarchical rank influences the acoustic properties of a speaker’s voice and how these hierarchy-based acoustic cues affect perceivers’ inferences of a speaker’s rank. By using objective measurements of speakers’ acoustic cues and controlling for baseline cue levels, we were able to precisely capture the relationship between acoustic cues and hierarchical rank, as well as the covariation among the cues. In Experiment 1, analyses controlling for speakers’ baseline cue levels found that the voices of individuals in the high-rank condition were higher in pitch and loudness variability but lower in pitch variability, compared with the voices of individuals in the low-rank condition. In Experiment 2, perceivers used higher pitch, greater loudness, and greater loudness variability to make accurate inferences of speakers’ hierarchical rank. These experiments demonstrate that acoustic cues are systematically used to reflect and detect hierarchy.","[{'authorId': '6204019', 'name': 'S.

676df45d5a567df15a663916ad0d759a81ff932a,"Emotional contagion has been explained as arising from embodied simulation. The two most accepted theories of music-induced emotions presume a mechanism of internal mimicry: the BRECVEMA framework proposes that the melodic aspect of music elicits internal mimicry leading to the induction of basic emotions in the listener, and the Multifactorial Process Model proposes that the observation or imagination of motor expressions of the musicians elicits muscular and neural mimicry, and emotional contagion. Two behavioral studies investigated whether, and to what extent, mimicry is responsible for emotion contagion, and second, to what extent context for affective responses in the form of visual imagery moderates emotional responses. Experiment 1 tested whether emotional contagion is influenced by mimicry by manipulating explicit vocal and motor mimicry. In one condition, participants engaged in mimicry of the melodic aspects of the music by singing along with the music, and in another, participants engaged in mimicry of the musician’s gestures when producing the music, by playing along (“air guitar”-style). The experiment did not find confirmatory evidence for either hypothesized simulation mechanism, but it did provide evidence of spontaneous visual imagery consistent with the induced and perceived emotions. Experiment 2 used imagined rather than performed mimicry, but found no association between imagined motor simulation and emotional intensity. Emotional descriptions read prior to hearing the music influenced the type of perceived and induced emotions and support the prediction that visual imagery and associated semantic knowledge shape listeners’ affective experiences with music. The lack of evidence for the causal role of embodied simulation suggests that current theorization of emotion contagion by music needs refinement to reduce the role of simulation relative to other mechanisms. Evidence for induction of affective states that can be modulated by contextual and semantic associations suggests a model of emotion induction consistent with constructionist accounts.","[{'authorId': '1422864382', 'name': 'J.

“Prosumers” (combining “producer” and “consumers”) describes consumers’ ability to openly share their product/service experiences and thereby drive sales and digital marketing. Understanding what motivates active prosumers to engage in electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) and share or review their hotel experiences online can help organizations empathize with consumers and use their messages to co-create value. Identifying prosumers’ motivators can enable companies to properly target them as resources for review or consumer feedback studies. This paper aims to investigate the influence of motivators (intrinsic and extrinsic), service quality and age on consumers’ eWOM communication behaviors. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
A panel of 204 travelers was surveyed regarding their hotel travel experiences, propensity to write online reviews, preferred review-writing platform, motivations for writing reviews and impressions of service quality. To test the hypotheses, a multivariate regression analysis was performed with eWOM as the dependent variable. Differences in eWOM as a function of preferred review platform were also tested using ANOVA, with a multiple comparison analysis that underlines the differences between prosumers who prefer different types of review platforms and their eWOM behaviors. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
Both intrinsic and extrinsic motivators, as well as service reliability, had a significant influence on eWOM behavior, while service tangibility had a negative relationship. Additionally, prosumers’ engagement in eWOM about their hospitality experience differed according to their preferred review platform. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
 
The findings of the analysis underline the importance of consumer motivations and of satisfaction with service quality in the context of digital review behavior. For marketing and hospitality research, this shows the benefits of including not only individual characteristics and demographics when analyzing review behavior but also elements such as perceptions of service quality. Given the differences in how the dimensions of service quality affect consumers’ engagement in online review behavior, this represents a very important topic for research and can be included in future studies that analyze the consumer review behavior model. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
 
Regarding the implications for practitioners, this study highlights the important role played by consumer satisfaction with service in the hospitality industry and its effect on their involvement in online reviews. Managers should be focused constantly on offering great service to their guests, while, at the same time, offering them motivations to engage in posting positive reviews about their vacation. Moreover, as the results of this study imply that various dimensions of service quality have a different impact, managers should focus especially on the aspects that consumers consider important and constantly include in their reviews, such as the tangibles dimension. The results of this study also have the potential to provide to businesses more information to improve the social aspects of vacationing, which can not only improve perceptions about service quality but can also have a positive influence on consumers’ motivations.

Purpose
Despite the growing consensus that consumers extensively use online reviews and that negative reviews can significantly damage brand equity, it remains uncertain whether negative online reviews that focus on different aspects of a service have a similar or differential effect on brand equity. This study aims to fill this gap and explores the mediating role of emotional contagion and what kind of response helps better deter their negative effect.


Design/methodology/approach
This research is conducted through a one-panel study and three experimental studies. SAS enterprise miner is used for text mining analysis and Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Process macro models are used to analyze the experimental data.


Findings
Negative reviews related to the tangibility, responsiveness and empathy dimensions have a more detrimental effect on brand equity than negative reviews related to the assurance and reliability dimensions. The results also provide evidence that emotional contagion is more prevalent when consumers read reviews that are specific to the empathy and responsiveness dimensions. Finally, accommodative responses from the service provider are more effective in deterring the effect of a negative online review on brand equity.


Research limitations/implications
The generalizability of this study is limited to the restaurant and hotel industry.


Practical implications
The findings will also help the brand manager in understanding the comparative effect of service quality-specific negative reviews on brand equity and also the type of responses that brand managers should give to negative reviews.


Originality/value
Despite online reviews receiving increased attention in academic research, Service quality (SERVQUAL) dimension-specific reviews have not been studied until now. This study contributes to the service quality-related literature by providing evidence that not all negative online reviews related to different Service quality (SERVQUAL) dimensions equally affect brand equity.

Married couples (N = 306) from 2 major cities in China (Shanghai and Jinan) completed questionnaires measuring a relationship-oriented personality trait (i.e., family orientation), perceived family and work support, and work-family conflict and enhancement. The results showed that family orientation and perceived family support was positively associated with family-to-work enhancement and negatively associated with family-to-work conflict for both husbands and wives. Perceived work support was positively associated with family-to-work enhancement for wives and negatively associated with work-to-family conflict for husbands.

To determine whether an abnormal immune profile was present at a cellular level that may predispose female carriers to autoinflammatory conditions, we investigated dynamic cytokine production following stimulation of blood cells. In addition, splenocyte responses were examined in an FMR1 CGG knock-in mouse model of the fragile X premutation. Methods Human monocyte and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) were isolated from the blood of 36 female FMR1 premutation carriers and 15 age-matched controls. Cells were cultured with media alone, LPS or PHA. In the animal model, splenocytes were isolated from 32 CGG knock-in mice and 32 wild type littermates. Splenocytes were cultured with media alone or LPS or PMA/Ionomycin. Concentrations of cytokines (GM-CSF, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, IFNγ, TNFα, and MCP-1) were determined from the supernatants of cellular cultures via Luminex multiplex assay. Additionally, phenotypic cellular markers were assessed on cells isolated from human subjects via flow cytometry. Results We found decreases in cytokine production in human premutation carriers as well as in the FMR1 knock-in mice when compared with controls. Levels of cytokines were found to be associated with CGG repeat length in both human and mouse. Furthermore, T cells from human premutation carriers showed decreases in cell surface markers of activation when compared with controls. Conclusions In this study, FMR1 CGG repeat expansions are associated with decreased immune responses and immune dysregulation in both humans and mice. Deficits in immune responses in female premutation carriers may lead to increased susceptibility to autoimmunity and further research is warranted to determine the link between FMR1 CGG repeat lengths and onset of autoinflammatory conditions.","[{'authorId': '3944905', 'name': 'M.

Gender differences in growth of lung function were documented, with girls generating greater volume-standardized maximal expiratory flows until age 18.5 years. Beyond that age boys generated higher expiratory flows in proportion to total lung capacity (TLC). There was a time lag of up to 1 year between the age of peak growth velocity in lung volume and peak growth velocity in height. Age at peak growth in flow lagged another year behind that in volume.

Adult Asian (Elephas maximus) and African (Loxodonta africana) elephants have complex social societies that differ markedly between the sexes. Elephant social structure and cooperative behavior may have evolved in part to prepare young elephants to meet the challenges of an expansive environment, predators and parasites. In captivity, such forces are relaxed or eliminated, yet captive elephants display a similar repertoire of behaviors as their wild counterparts. Elephants live in herds of related adult females from several generations. This female social unit is centered on calves and the matriarch. Adult males reside in bachelor herds, singly, or frequent female groups, depending on male age and reproductive condition. In captivity, female elephants are usually housed together, although group size is smaller than in the wild, whereas adult males are generally housed separately from other elephants. Beyond these general similarities between wild and captive settings, captive elephants are housed in a wider range of group sizes, degrees of relatedness, and age structures than would be typical in the wild. This variation in social structure can be used to explore questions about cooperative behavior. Following a comparison of wild and captive social structures for elephants, three such potential avenues for study are discussed. Specifically, research with captive elephants could shed light on the development of social behavior, the functional significance of allomothering, and the ability of elephants to recognize kin or social group members. Beside the potential theoretical implications and insight into wild elephant behavior, the examination of social behavior also has important ramifications for the management of animals in captivity.

AKI is common among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is an independent risk factor for mortality. Although there are numerous potential mechanisms underlying COVID-19-associated AKI, our current knowledge of kidney pathologic findings in COVID-19 is limited.


METHODS
We examined the postmortem kidneys from 42 patients who died of COVID-19. We reviewed light microscopy findings in all autopsies and performed immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and in situ hybridization studies for SARS-CoV-2 on a subset of samples.


RESULTS
The cohort had a median age of 71.5 years (range, 38-97 years); 69% were men, 57% were Hispanic, and 73% had a history of hypertension. Among patients with available data, AKI developed in 31 of 33 patients (94%), including 6 with AKI stage 1, 9 with stage 2, and 16 with stage 3. The predominant finding correlating with AKI was acute tubular injury. However, the degree of acute tubular injury was often less severe than predicted for the degree of AKI, suggesting a role for hemodynamic factors, such as aggressive fluid management. Background changes of hypertensive arterionephrosclerosis and diabetic glomerulosclerosis were frequent but typically mild. We identified focal kidney fibrin thrombi in 6 of 42 (14%) autopsies. A single Black patient had collapsing FSGS. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were largely unrevealing, and in situ hybridization for SARS-CoV-2 showed no definitive positivity.


CONCLUSIONS
Among a cohort of 42 patients dying with COVID-19, autopsy histologic evaluation revealed acute tubular injury, which was typically mild relative to the degree of creatinine elevation. These findings suggest potential for reversibility upon resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","[{'authorId': '6627876', 'name': 'D. Santoriello'}, {'authorId': '48799205', 'name': 'P.

One of the main forms of e-WOM is the product reviews consumers post on different Web sites, and how this form of e-WOM stands up to this claim is yet unknown. For example, do consumers trust the accuracy of these reviews posted by anonymous reviewers, and, do readers trust negative and positive reviews equally? Past research has shown that people tend to weight negative information more than positive information during evaluation. Through an observation study and two laboratory experiments, we investigate the existence of this negativity effect in e-WOM consumer reviews for utilitarian versus hedonic products, and investigate the influence of the reader's attributions regarding the reviewer's motivations on this. Both types of studies show that product type moderates the effect of review valence, and readers exhibit a negativity bias for utilitarian product reviews only. Furthermore, the lab studies show that the reader's attributions about the motivations of the reviewer mediate the effect of this moderation on their attitude about the review. We find that compared with the utilitarian case, readers of negative hedonic product reviews are more likely to attribute the negative opinions expressed, to the reviewer's internal (or non-product related) reasons; and therefore are less likely to find the negative reviews useful. However, in the utilitarian case, readers’ are more likely to attribute the reviewer's negative opinions to external (or product related) motivations, and therefore find negative reviews more useful than positive reviews on average.","[{'authorId': '2208727007', 'name': 'Sercan Sen'}, {'authorId': '39701017', 'name': 'Dawn Lerman'}]",1162.0,,56.0,Why are you telling me this?

Prof. Dr. Uğur Güdükbay July, 2010 Crowd simulation has a wide range of application areas such as biological and social modeling, military simulations, computer games and movies. Simulating the behavior of animated virtual crowds has been a challenging task for the computer graphics community. As well as the physical and the geometrical aspects, the semantics underlying the motion of real crowds inspire the design and implementation of virtual crowds. Psychology helps us understand the motivations of the individuals constituting a crowd. There has been extensive research on incorporating psychological models into the simulation of autonomous agents. However, in our study, instead of the psychological state of an individual agent as such, we are interested in the overall behavior of the crowd that consists of virtual humans with various psychological states. For this purpose, we incorporate the three basic constituents of affect: personality, emotion and mood. Each of these elements contribute variably to the emergence of different aspects of behavior. We thus examine, by changing the parameters, how groups of people with different characteristics interact with each other, and accordingly, how the global crowd behavior is influenced. In the social psychology literature, crowds are classified as mobs and audiences. Audiences are passive crowds whereas mobs are active crowds with emotional, irrational and seemingly homogeneous behavior. In this thesis, we examine how audiences turn into mobs and simulate the common properties of mobs to create collective misbehavior. So far, crowd simulation research has focused on panicking crowds among all types of mobs. We extend the state of the art to simulate different types of mobs based on the taxonomy. We demonstrate various scenarios that realize the behavior of distinct mob types. Our model is built on top of an existing crowd simulation system, HiDAC iv","[{'authorId': '2643744', 'name': 'Funda Durupinar'}]",48.0,,117.0,From audiences to mobs : crowd simulation with psychological factors,2010.0

A smiling face can signal the experience of enjoyable emotions, but people can also smile to convince another person that enjoyment is occurring when it is not. For this reason, the ability to discriminate between felt and faked enjoyment expressions is a crucial social skill. Despite its importance, adults show remarkable individual variation in this ability. Revealing the factors responsible for these huge individual differences is a key challenge in this domain. Here we investigated, on a large sample of participants, whether individual differences in smile authenticity recognition are accounted for by differences in the predisposition to experience other people's emotions, i.e., by susceptibility to emotional contagion. Results showed that susceptibility to emotional contagion for negative emotions increased smile authenticity detection, while susceptibility to emotional contagion for positive emotions worsened detection performance, because it leaded to categorize most of the faked smiles as sincere. These findings suggest that susceptibility to emotional contagion plays a key role in complex emotion recognition, and point out the importance of analyzing the tendency to experience other people's positive and negative emotions as separate abilities.","[{'authorId': '4192721', 'name': 'V.

Some authors argue that triangulation is just for increasing the wider and deep understanding of the study phenomenon, while others have argued that triangulation is actually used to increase the study accuracy, in this case triangulation is one of the validity measures. Triangulation is defined as the use of multiple methods mainly qualitative and quantitative methods in studying the same phenomenon for the purpose of increasing study credibility. This implies that triangulation is the combination of two or more methodological approaches, theoretical perspectives, data sources, investigators and analysis methods to study the same phenomenon.However, using both qualitative and quantitative paradigms in the same study has resulted into debate from some researchers arguing that the two paradigms differ epistemologically and ontologically. Nevertheless, both paradigms are designed towards understanding about a particular subject area of interest and both of them have strengths and weaknesses. Thus, when combined there is a great possibility of neutralizing the flaws of one method and strengthening the benefits of the other for the better research results.

6c8a3a23a9dda76402597d002ba0ca649befabe0,"Temperament describes the idea that individual behavioural differences are repeatable over time and across situations. This common phenomenon covers numerous traits, such as aggressiveness, avoidance of novelty, willingness to take risks, exploration, and sociality. The study of temperament is central to animal psychology, behavioural genetics, pharmacology, and animal husbandry, but relatively few studies have examined the ecology and evolution of temperament traits. This situation is surprising, given that temperament is likely to exert an important influence on many aspects of animal ecology and evolution, and that individual variation in temperament appears to be pervasive amongst animal species. Possible explanations for this neglect of temperament include a perceived irrelevance, an insufficient understanding of the link between temperament traits and fitness, and a lack of coherence in terminology with similar traits often given different names, or different traits given the same name. We propose that temperament can and should be studied within an evolutionary ecology framework and provide a terminology that could be used as a working tool for ecological studies of temperament. Our terminology includes five major temperament trait categories: shyness‐boldness, exploration‐avoidance, activity, sociability and aggressiveness. This terminology does not make inferences regarding underlying dispositions or psychological processes, which may have restrained ecologists and evolutionary biologists from working on these traits. We present extensive literature reviews that demonstrate that temperament traits are heritable, and linked to fitness and to several other traits of importance to ecology and evolution. Furthermore, we describe ecologically relevant measurement methods and point to several ecological and evolutionary topics that would benefit from considering temperament, such as phenotypic plasticity, conservation biology, population sampling, and invasion biology.","[{'authorId': '8533209', 'name': 'D.

For instance, the unique characteristics of NIRS give it potential as a tool for investigating the role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in emotion processing. However, there are several obstacles in the application of NIRS to emotion research. In this mini-review, we discuss the findings of studies that used NIRS to assess the effects of PFC activation on emotion. Specifically, we address the methodological challenges of NIRS measurement with respect to the field of emotion research, and consider potential strategies for mitigating these problems. In addition, we show that two fields of research, investigating (i) biological predisposition influencing PFC responses to emotional stimuli and (ii) neural mechanisms underlying the bi-directional interaction between emotion and action, have much to gain from the use of NIRS. With the present article, we aim to lay the foundation for the application of NIRS to the above-mentioned fields of emotion research.","[{'authorId': '3057995', 'name': 'H.

Our approach is based on the methods of the kinetic theory of active particles. The model allows us to weight between two competing behaviors depending on fear level: the search for less congested areas and the tendency to follow the stream unconsciously (herding). The fear level of each pedestrian influences her walking speed and is influenced by the fear levels of her neighbors. Numerically, we solve our pedestrian model with emotional contagion using an operator splitting scheme. We simulate evacuation scenarios involving two groups of interacting pedestrians to assess how domain geometry and the details of fear propagation impact evacuation dynamics. Further, we reproduce the evacuation dynamics of an experimental study involving distressed ants.","[{'authorId': '2157268089', 'name': 'Daewa Kim'}, {'authorId': '2060769402', 'name': ""Kaylie O'Connell""}, {'authorId': '153631230', 'name': 'W.

This could involve focusing on the identity of an object while ignoring identity-preserving transformations such as changes in viewpoint or focusing on its current viewpoint while ignoring its identity. To effectively filter out variation due to the irrelevant dimension, performing either type of task is likely to require high-level, abstract search templates. Past work has found target recognition signals in areas of ventral visual cortex and in subregions of parietal and frontal cortex. However, target status in these tasks is typically associated with the identity of an object, rather than identity-orthogonal properties such as object viewpoint. In this study, we used a task that required subjects to identify novel object stimuli as targets according to either identity or viewpoint, each of which was not predictable from low-level properties such as shape. We performed functional MRI in human subjects of both sexes and measured the strength of target-match signals in areas of visual, parietal, and frontal cortex. Our multivariate analyses suggest that the multiple-demand (MD) network, including subregions of parietal and frontal cortex, encodes information about an object's status as a target in the relevant dimension only, across changes in the irrelevant dimension. Furthermore, there was more target-related information in MD regions on correct compared with incorrect trials, suggesting a strong link between MD target signals and behavior. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Real-world target detection tasks, such as searching for a car in a crowded parking lot, require both flexibility and abstraction. We investigated the neural basis of these abilities using a task that required invariant representations of either object identity or viewpoint. Multivariate decoding analyses of our whole brain functional MRI data reveal that invariant target representations are most pronounced in frontal and parietal regions, and the strength of these representations is associated with behavioral performance.","[{'authorId': '153298430', 'name': 'Margaret M.

In humans, empathy for others is facilitated by having had a similar prior experience. It increases with the intensity of distress that observers believe is occurring to others, and is associated with acute emotional responses to witnessing others’ distress. We sought to develop a relatively simple and fast mouse model of human empathy that resembled these characteristics. We modeled empathy by measuring the freezing of observer mice to observing the footshock of a subject mouse. Observer mice froze to subject footshocks only when they had a similar shock experience 24 hours earlier. Moreover, this freezing increased with the number of footshocks given to the subject and it was accentuated within seconds after footshock delivery. Freezing was not seen in naïve observers or in experienced observers that observed a subject who was spared footshock. Observers did not freeze to a subject’s footshock when they had experienced a swim stress 24 hours prior, demonstrating a specific effect for shared experience, as opposed to a generalized stressor in eliciting observer mouse freezing. We propose that this two-day experimental protocol resembles many aspects of human empathy in a mouse model that is amenable to transgenic analysis of neural substrates for empathy and its impairment in certain clinical disorders.","[{'authorId': '2065101640', 'name': 'Jeff Sanders'}, {'authorId': '4556154', 'name': 'M.

In Experiment 2, lay participants performed a recognition task on emotional expressions created with FACSGen software and rated the similarity of expressions displayed by human and FACSGen faces. Results showed good to excellent classification levels for all AUs by the four FACS coders, suggesting that the AUs are valid exemplars of FACS specifications. Lay participants' recognition rates for nine emotions were high, and comparisons of human and FACSGen expressions were very similar. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the software in producing reliable and emotionally valid expressions, and suggest its application in numerous scientific areas, including perception, emotion, and clinical and neuroscience research.","[{'authorId': '50755536', 'name': 'Eva G.

Until recently, it was assumed that the human capacity to solve the correspondence problem is innate.

We review evidence from studies of non-human animals, children and adults, focusing on research in cognitive neuroscience that uses training and naturally occurring variations in expertise to examine the role of experience in the formation of the mirror system. The relevance of this research depends on the widely held assumption that the mirror system plays a causal role in generating imitative behaviour. We also report original data supporting this assumption. These data show that theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation of the inferior frontal gyrus, a classical mirror system area, disrupts automatic imitation of finger movements.

However, the existing research mainly focuses on investigating motion patterns in crowds, while the emotional aspects of crowd behaviors are left unexplored. Analyzing the emotion of crowd behaviors is indeed extremely important, as it uncovers the social moods that are beneficial for video surveillance. In this paper, we propose a novel crowd representation termed crowd mood. Crowd mood is established based upon the discovery that the social emotional hypothesis of crowd behaviors can be revealed by investigating the spacing interactions and the structural levels of motion patterns in crowds. To this end, we first learn the structured trajectories of crowds by particle advection using low-rank approximation with group sparsity constraint, which implicitly characterizes the coherent motion patterns. Second, rich emotional motion features are explicitly extracted and fused by support vector regression to reflect social characteristics. In particular, we construct weighted features in a boosted manner by considering the features’ significance. Finally, crowd mood is intuitively presented as affective curves to track the emotion states of the crowd dynamics, which is robust to noise, sensitive to semantic shift, and compact for pattern expressions. Extensive evaluations on crowd video data sets demonstrate that our approach effectively models crowd mood and achieves significantly better results with comparisons to several alternative and state-of-the-art approaches for various tasks, i.e., crowd mood classification, global abnormal mood detection, and crowd emotion matching.","[{'authorId': '2108027128', 'name': 'Yanhao Zhang'}, {'authorId': '145583736', 'name': 'Lei Qin'}, {'authorId': '145592290', 'name': 'R.

This is particularly evident for emotional faces and voices in a social context. Over the past years, a multitude of studies have addressed the question of how affective cues conveyed by auditory and visual channels are integrated. Behavioral studies show that hearing and seeing emotional expressions can support and influence each other, a notion which is supported by investigations on the underlying neurobiology. Numerous electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies have identified brain regions subserving the integration of multimodal emotions and have provided new insights into the neural processing steps underlying the synergistic confluence of affective information from voice and face. In this paper we provide a comprehensive review covering current behavioral, electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging findings on the combination of emotions from the auditory and visual domains. Behavioral advantages arising from multimodal redundancy are paralleled by specific integration patterns on the neural level, from encoding in early sensory cortices to late cognitive evaluation in higher association areas. In summary, these findings indicate that bimodal emotions interact at multiple stages of the audiovisual integration process.","[{'authorId': '35024919', 'name': 'M.

Further, it aims to analyze the mediating role of SWB in the relationship between PsyCap and CC in the Indian manufacturing sector.,A quantitative survey-based research design employing data from 300 employees in the National Capital Region (NCR) of India was used in the present research.,The results demonstrated that PsyCap acted as a predictor for SWB and CC. Additionally, SWB partially mediated the relationship between PsyCap and CC.,The limitations of the present research would have to do with the purposive sample set chosen during the data collection. The sample consisted of middle- and upper-middle-class Indian employees working in the NCR having knowledge of English language and computer skills. Perhaps, future research works should take into account a wider sample in terms of the regions across India and not only the NCR. Although the findings showed that SWB reduced the relationship between PsyCap and CC, still that relationship was significant statistically. Further research studies might also explore various moderators while simultaneously studying SWB. In the research, SWB acted as a significant mediator of the relation between PsyCap and CC, yet at the same time, it may be the scenario that employees who are committed toward their career would be more inclined to espouse a greater sense of SWB (i.e. mediator is caused by the outcome). Hence, the authors duly recognize the need to test this substitute model. Since, SWB places chief emphasis on respondent’s own experiences and perspectives; it does not denote a consummate understanding of their mental health as people may have psychological disorders even if they experience happiness. Hence, the use of other measures in addition to SWB in comprehending a person’s psychological health is desirable (Diener et al., 1997).,This study suggests that in order for organizations to have a workforce committed to their career and hence, their profession, the supervisors will need to train the employees having a higher incidence of PsyCap to increase their SWB. Consequently, the supervisors will, in turn, need to recruit employees already having the four dimensions of PsyCap, i.e. hope, efficacy, resilience and optimism at the workplace in order for them to have a higher life satisfaction, positive affect, reduced negative affect (three components of SWB) and increased CC.,Employees who develop within themselves a state of being hopeful, efficacious, resilient and optimistic will also be strongly oriented toward having greater life satisfaction, positive affect and lower levels of negative affect. This, in part, would help them achieve the required commitment toward their career and hence, help them in sticking with their jobs.,The present study advances the existing work on positive organizational behavior by exhibiting the noteworthy role of PsyCap in predicting SWB and CC. Further, it helps in demonstrating the inevitable role of SWB in partially mediating the relationship between PsyCap and CC.","[{'authorId': '114128764', 'name': 'Hansika Singhal'}, {'authorId': '82827289', 'name': 'Renu Rastogi'}]",56.0,,51.0,Psychological capital and career commitment: the mediating effect of subjective well-being,2018.0

However, to realize its potential, the exchange between the two disciplines, as well as the intradisciplinary coordination, should be further improved. We make three proposals for how this could be achieved. The proposals refer to: 1) systematizing and classifying the assumptions of psychological emotion theories; 2) formalizing emotion theories in implementation-independent formal languages (set theory, agent logics); and 3) modeling emotions using general cognitive architectures (such as Soar and ACT-R), general agent architectures (such as the BDI architecture) or general-purpose affective agent architectures. These proposals share two overarching themes. The first is a proposal for modularization: deconstruct emotion theories into basic assumptions; modularize architectures. The second is a proposal for unification and standardization: Translate different emotion theories into a common informal conceptual system or a formal language, or implement them in a common architecture.","[{'authorId': '3213879', 'name': 'R.

We conducted 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies involving rhythm perception and production to address this question. In experiment 1, on each trial subjects 1st listened in anticipation of tapping, and then tapped along with musical rhythms. Recruitment of the supplementary motor area, mid-premotor cortex (PMC), and cerebellum was observed during listen with anticipation. To test whether this activation was related to motor planning or rehearsal, in experiment 2 subjects naively listened to rhythms without foreknowledge that they would later tap along with them. Yet, the same motor regions were engaged despite no action-perception connection. In contrast, the ventral PMC was only recruited during action and action-coupled perceptual processes, whereas the dorsal part was only sensitive to the selection of actions based on higher-order rules of temporal organization. These functional dissociations shed light on the nature of action-perception processes and suggest an inherent link between auditory and motor systems in the context of rhythm.","[{'authorId': '2108264216', 'name': 'Joyce L.

People high or low in emotional empathy were exposed to pictures of happy and angry faces while their facial electromyography from the zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii muscle regions was detected. High empathy participants rapidly reacted with larger zygomatic muscle activity to happy as compared with angry faces as early as after 500 ms after stimulus onset, and with larger corrugator muscle activity to angry than to happy faces after 500 ms. Accordingly, this group also reacted with a corresponding experience of emotion. The low empathy participants, in contrast, did not differentiate between the happy and angry stimuli with either facial muscles or in their self experience of emotion. The findings are related to the facial feedback hypothesis and the results are interpreted as support for the hypothesis that rapid and automatically evoked facial mimicry may be one important mechanism for emotional and empathic contagion to occur.","[{'authorId': '4583182', 'name': 'U.

While most studies have investigated how animals reacted in response to conspecifics’ distress, dogs so far have mainly been targeted to examine cross-species empathic responses. To investigate whether dogs would respond with empathy-like behavior also to conspecifics, we adopted a playback method using conspecifics’ vocalizations (whines) recorded during a distressful event as well as control sounds. Our subjects were first exposed to a playback phase where they were subjected either to a control sound, a familiar whine (from their familiar partner) or a stranger whine stimulus (from a stranger dog), and then a reunion phase where the familiar partner entered the room. When exposed to whines, dogs showed a higher behavioral alertness and exhibited more stress-related behaviors compared to when exposed to acoustically similar control sounds. Moreover, they demonstrated more comfort-offering behaviors toward their familiar partners following whine playbacks than after control stimuli. Furthermore, when looking at the first session, this comfort offering was biased towards the familiar partner when subjects were previously exposed to the familiar compared to the stranger whines. Finally, familiar whine stimuli tended to maintain higher cortisol levels while stranger whines did not. To our knowledge, these results are the first to suggest that dogs can experience and demonstrate “empathic-like” responses to conspecifics’ distress-calls.","[{'authorId': '1401509134', 'name': 'M.

Results for individual muscle sites varied between muscles and depending on data treatment. For difference scores, acceptable internal consistencies were found only for corrugator supercilii, and test-retest reliabilities were low. For contrast measures describing patterns of reactions to stimuli, such as high zygomaticus major combined with low corrugator supercilii, acceptable internal consistencies were found for facial reactions to smiling faces and positive affective reactions to affiliative images (Study 2). Facial reactions to negative emotions (Study 1) and facial reactions to power and somewhat less to achievement imagery (Study 2) showed unsatisfactory internal consistencies. For contrast measures, good temporal stability over 24 months (Study 1) and 15 months (Study 2), respectively, was obtained. In Study 1, the effect of method factors such as mode of presentation was more reliable than the emotion effect. Overall, people's facial reactions to affective stimuli seem to be influenced by a variety of factors other than the emotion-eliciting element per se, which resulted in biased internal consistency estimates.

This article assesses the impact of these changes on the job satisfaction and work motivation of public employees in 34 European countries. Congruent with previous studies linking income and working hours with job attitudes, the article finds a negative impact on both. There are no free austerity lunches: while public employees may work longer hours for lower pay, they are less satisfied and less motivated when doing so. One caveat applies: the effect on motivation—although not satisfaction—is mitigated when employees feel that their values are aligned with those of their organization. This puts a premium on public managers fostering value alignment, particularly when it is hardest to achieve: in times of cutbacks.","[{'authorId': '37950806', 'name': 'M.

6fd8df156aceda310911ed93338e91a4219f512b,"Empathy for pain (vicariously felt pain), an ability to feel, recognize, understand and share the painful emotions of others, has been gradually accepted to be a common identity in both humans and rodents, however, the underlying neural and molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Recently, we have developed a rat model of empathy for pain in which pain can be transferred from a cagemate demonstrator (CD) in pain to a naïve cagemate observer (CO) after 30 min dyadic priming social interaction. The naïve CO rats display both mechanical pain hypersensitivity (hyperalgesia) and enhanced spinal nociception. Chemical lesions of bilateral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) abolish the empathic pain response completely, suggesting existence of a top-down facilitation system in production of empathy for pain. However, the social transfer of pain was not observed in non-cagemate observer (NCO) after dyadic social interaction with a non-cagemate demonstrator (NCD) in pain. Here we showed that dyadic social interaction with a painful CD resulted in elevation of circulating norepinephrine (NE) and increased neuronal activity in the locus coeruleus (LC) in the CO rats. Meanwhile, CO rats also had over-expression of P2X3, but not TRPV1, in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Chemical lesion of the LC-NE neurons by systemic DSP-4 and pharmacological inhibition of central synaptic release of NE by clonidine completely abolished increase in circulating NE and P2X3 receptor expression, as well as the sympathetically-maintained development of empathic mechanical hyperalgesia. However, in the NCO rats, neither the LC-NE neuronal activity nor the P2X3 receptor expression was altered after dyadic social interaction with a painful NCD although the circulating corticosterone and NE were elevated. Finally, in the periphery, both P2X3 receptor and α1 adrenergic receptor were found to be involved in the development of empathic mechanical hyperalgesia. Taken together with our previous results, empathy for pain observed in the CO rats is likely to be mediated by activation of the top-down mPFC-LC/NE-sympathoadrenomedullary (SAM) system that further up-regulates P2X3 receptors in the periphery, however, social stress observed in the NCO rats is mediated by activation of both hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis and SAM axis.","[{'authorId': '40463760', 'name': 'Yun-Fei Lü'}, {'authorId': '2108850218', 'name': 'Yan Yang'}, {'authorId': '2109497113', 'name': 'Chun-Li Li'}, {'authorId': '2152542739', 'name': 'Yan Wang'}, {'authorId': '2145255640', 'name': 'Zhen Li'}, {'authorId': '81677355', 'name': 'Jun Chen'}]",30.0,,92.0,The Locus Coeruleus–Norepinephrine System Mediates Empathy for Pain through Selective Up-Regulation of P2X3 Receptor in Dorsal Root Ganglia in Rats,2017.0

Areas of complex fractionated atrial electrograms and high dominant frequency have been proposed as critical regions for maintaining atrial fibrillation; however, there is a paucity of data on the relationship between the characteristics of electrograms and the propagation pattern underlying them. In this study, a realistic 3D computer model of the human atria has been developed to investigate this relationship. The model includes a realistic geometry with fiber orientation, anisotropic conductivity and electrophysiological heterogeneity. We simulated different tachyarrhythmic episodes applying both transient and continuous ectopic activity. Electrograms and their dominant frequency and organization index values were calculated over the entire atrial surface. Our simulations show electrograms with simple potentials, with little or no cycle length variations, narrow frequency peaks and high organization index values during stable and regular activity as the observed in atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia (except in areas of conduction block) and in areas closer to ectopic activity during focal atrial fibrillation. By contrast, cycle length variations and polymorphic electrograms with single, double and fragmented potentials were observed in areas of irregular and unstable activity during atrial fibrillation episodes. Our results also show: 1) electrograms with potentials without negative deflection related to spiral or curved wavefronts that pass over the recording point and move away, 2) potentials with a much greater proportion of positive deflection than negative in areas of wave collisions, 3) double potentials related with wave fragmentations or blocking lines and 4) fragmented electrograms associated with pivot points.

Moreover, when emotions are transmitted from one individual to the next, leading to state matching (emotional contagion), information transfer and coordination between group members are facilitated.

In this paper, I review the evidence for discrimination of vocal expression of emotions, which is a necessary step for emotional contagion to occur. I then describe possible proximate mechanisms underlying vocal contagion of emotions, propose criteria to assess this phenomenon and review the existing evidence. The literature so far shows that non-human animals are able to discriminate and be affected by conspecific and also potentially heterospecific (e.g. human) vocal expression of emotions. Since humans heavily rely on vocalizations to communicate (speech), I suggest that studying vocal contagion of emotions in non-human animals can lead to a better understanding of the evolution of emotional contagion and empathy.","[{'authorId': '4679108', 'name': 'E.

In a model with continuous space and time we find that if two particles arrive symmetrically in a plane at a large angle, then (i) radial repulsion and (ii) linear self-propelling toward a fixed preferred speed are sufficient for them to depart at a smaller angle. For this local gain of momentum explicit velocity alignment is not necessary, nor are adhesion or attraction, inelasticity or anisotropy of the particles, or nonlinear drag. With many particles obeying these microscopic rules of motion we find that their spatial confinement to a square with periodic boundaries (which is an indirect form of attraction) leads to stable macroscopic ordering. As a function of the strength of added noise we see--at finite system sizes--a critical slowing down close to the order-disorder boundary and a discontinuous transition. After varying the density of particles at constant system size and varying the size of the system with constant particle density we predict that in the infinite system size (or density) limit the hysteresis loop disappears and the transition becomes continuous. We note that animals, humans, drones, etc., tend to move asynchronously and are often more responsive to motion than positions. Thus, for them velocity-based continuous models can provide higher precision than coordinate-based models. An additional characteristic and realistic feature of the model is that convergence to the ordered state is fastest at a finite density, which is in contrast to models applying (discontinuous) explicit velocity alignments and discretized time. To summarize, we find that the investigated model can provide a minimal description of flocking.","[{'authorId': '34014051', 'name': 'I.

Furthermore, it explores the differential association of contagion to leaders, colleagues, and clients, namely, a holistic mapping. Participants (N = 694) from six organizations were asked how frequently they both absorbed and transmitted four basic emotions from or to others, and whether the emotional experience occurred with regard to their leaders, colleagues, and clients. The findings reveal that positive and negative emotions considered for within-individual bidirectional contagion were more frequently experienced with colleagues followed by clients, whereas leaders were the least associated with emotional contagion.

In this chapter therefore, beginning with a multi-level perspective taken from the OB literature, we introduce the roles played by emotions and emotional regulation in the workplace and discuss their implications for HRM. We do so by considering five levels of analysis: (1) within-person temporal variations, (2) between persons (individual differences), (3) interpersonal processes; (4) groups and teams, and (5) the organization as a whole. We focus especially on processes of emotional regulation in both self and others, including discussion of emotional labor and emotional intelligence. In the opening sections of the chapter, we discuss the nature of emotions and emotional regulation from an OB perspective by introducing the five-level model, and explaining in particular how emotions and emotional regulation play a role at each of the levels. We then apply these ideas to four major domains of concern to HR managers: (1) recruitment, selection, and socialization; (2) performance management; (3) training and development; and (4) compensation and benefits. In concluding, we stress the interconnectedness of emotions and emotional regulation across the five levels of the model, arguing that emotions and emotional regulation at each level can influence effects at other levels, ultimately culminating in the organization’s affective climate.","[{'authorId': '70294020', 'name': 'N.

In this diary study, we investigated multi-level predictors of daily counterproductive work behavior (CWB) relying on the theoretical frameworks of affective events theory and the emotion-centered model of CWB. We assessed significant work events, event-based fairness perceptions, negative emotional reactions to work events, and employee CWB over a 10-day period. We tested within-person relations predicting CWB, and cross-level moderating effects of two emotion regulation strategies (suppression and reappraisal). Results from a multi-level path analysis revealed that significant work events had both direct and indirect effects on negative emotional reactions. Further, negative emotional reactions in turn mediated the relationships between significant work events and all forms of daily CWB as well as the relationship between event-based fairness perceptions and daily CWB-O. Results also supported the moderating role of reappraisal emotion regulation strategy on relations between significant work events and negative emotional reactions. Less support, however, was found for the moderating influence of suppression on the link between negative emotional reactions and CWB. Among the broad work event categories we identified, our supplemental analyses revealed that negative work events involving interactions with supervisors elicited the highest levels of employee negative emotional reactions. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[{'authorId': '8381772', 'name': 'Fadel K.

One interesting finding is that even if there is no percolation in the individual networks, percolation (i.e., information epidemics) can take place in the conjoint social-physical network. We also show, both analytically and experimentally, that the fraction of individuals who receive an item of information (started from an arbitrary node) is significantly larger in the conjoint social-physical network case, as compared to the case where the networks are disjoint. These findings reveal that conjoining the physical network with online social networks can have a dramatic impact on the speed and scale of information diffusion.","[{'authorId': '3054744', 'name': 'Osman Yağan'}, {'authorId': '46990811', 'name': 'Dajun Qian'}, {'authorId': '47540395', 'name': 'Junshan Zhang'}, {'authorId': '145532804', 'name': 'D.

Prey fish under threat of predation can signal risk to conspecific fish, which then exhibit defensive responses. Fish also assess predation risk by visual cues and change their behavior accordingly. Here, we explored whether these behavioral changes act as visual alarm signals to conspecific fish that are not initially under risk. We show that shoals of zebrafish (Danio rerio) visually exposed to a predator display antipredator behaviors. In addition, these defensive maneuvers trigger antipredator reactions in conspecifics and, concomitantly, stimulate the hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal axis, leading to cortisol increase. Thus, we conclude that zebrafish defensive behaviors act as visual alarm cues that induce antipredator and stress response in conspecific fish.","[{'authorId': '8958180', 'name': 'T. A.

Here we report that pre-extinction administration of losartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, accelerated attenuation of physiological threat expression. During early extinction, losartan enhanced threat-signal specific ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activation and its coupling with the basolateral amygdala. Multivoxel pattern analysis revealed that losartan reduced whole brain, particularly vmPFC, threat expression and voxel-wise mediation analyses further confirmed that losartan-accelerated extinction crucially involved vmPFC processing. Overall the results provide initial evidence for a critical role of the RA system in extinction learning in humans and suggest that adjunct losartan administration may facilitate the efficacy of extinction-based therapies.","[{'authorId': '46468612', 'name': 'F.

Naturally, the facial features of a subject taken from different instances of the same emotion have wide variations. In the presence of two or more facial features, the variation of the attributes together makes the emotion recognition problem more complicated. This variation is the main source of uncertainty in the emotion recognition problem, which has been addressed here in two steps using type-2 fuzzy sets. First a type-2 fuzzy face space is constructed with the background knowledge of facial features of different subjects for different emotions. Second, the emotion of an unknown facial expression is determined based on the consensus of the measured facial features with the fuzzy face space. Both interval and general type-2 fuzzy sets (GT2FS) have been used separately to model the fuzzy face space. The interval type-2 fuzzy set (IT2FS) involves primary membership functions for m facial features obtained from n-subjects, each having l-instances of facial expressions for a given emotion. The GT2FS in addition to employing the primary membership functions mentioned above also involves the secondary memberships for individual primary membership curve, which has been obtained here by formulating and solving an optimization problem. The optimization problem here attempts to minimize the difference between two decoded signals: the first one being the type-1 defuzzification of the average primary membership functions obtained from the n-subjects, while the second one refers to the type-2 defuzzified signal for a given primary membership function with secondary memberships as unknown.

Patients diagnosed with ASD are often devoid of empathy and impaired in understanding other people’s emotional perspective. The neuronal correlates of this impairment are not fully understood. Replicating such a behavioral phenotype in a mouse model of autism would allow us insight into the neuronal background of the problem. Here we tested BTBR T+Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) and c57BL/6J (B6) mice in two behavioral paradigms: the Transfer of Emotional Information test and the Social Proximity test. In both tests BTBR mice displayed asocial behavior. We analyzed c-Fos protein expression in several brain regions after each of these tests, and found that, unlike B6 mice, BTBR mice react to a stressed cagemate exposure in the Transfer of Emotional Information test with no increase of c-Fos expression in either the prefrontal cortex or the amygdala. However, after Social Proximity exposure we observed a strong increase in c-Fos expression in the CA3 field of the hippocampus and two hypothalamic regions of BTBR brains. This response was accompanied by a strong activation of periaqueductal regions related to defensiveness, which suggests that BTBR mice find unavoidable social interaction highly aversive.","[{'authorId': '4871849', 'name': 'K.

Current nurse shortages and limited budgets have increased the need for hospitals to improve their efficiency and cost-effectiveness. It is proposed that fostering innovative behaviour is one way that hospitals can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of nurses. A cross-sectional self-report survey was completed by 220 nurses working within Australian hospitals. The results show that an employee’s perception of their wellbeing completely mediated the relationship between satisfaction with training opportunities and their innovative behaviour and partially mediated the relationship between satisfaction with teamwork and innovative behaviour. The findings shed new light on how HR management factors can foster innovative behaviour. The results raise new implications for managers seeking to stimulate innovative behaviour, highlighting the importance of cultivating an organisational environment conducive to positive perceptions of wellbeing.","[{'authorId': '12568823', 'name': 'Matthew J.

In contrast, OCRs have no significant impact on the sales of the models of strong brands, although these models do receive a significant sales boost from their greater brand equity. Higher sales lead to a larger number of positive OCRs, and increased positive OCRs aid a brand's transition from weak to strong. This creates a positive feedback loop between sales and positive OCRs for models of weak brands that not only helps their sales but also increases overall brand equity, benefiting all models of the brand. In contrast to the view that brands matter less in the presence of OCRs, we find that OCRs matter less in the presence of strong brands.

Fig. S1 and Table S1; for all online suppl. material, see www. karger.com/doi/10.1159/000504180). Categorical diagnostics were conducted during hospital admission and independently confirmed by a standardized clinical interview according to DSM IV criteria. In addition, GAD and MDD symptom load was dimensionally assessed using validated self-report scales (Penn State Worry Questionnaire, PSWQ; Beck Depression Inventory II, BDIII), indicating that depressive symptom load was higher in MDD compared to both, GAD patients and HC, while GAD symptom load was higher in both patient groups relative to HC (all psBonferroni-corrected < 0.001) but comparable between patient groups (p > 0.1). MRI data collection, preprocessing, and modeling adhered to evaluated standard protocols (online suppl. material). The main interaction contrast of interest ([affective pain > affective control] > [physical pain > physical control]) was subjected to a voxelwise mixed ANOVA, including group as between-subject factor (FWE-pcluster = 0.05, whole-brain). Results of this categorial strategy revealed a significant interaction effect of diagnosis in a cluster predominantly located in the right dorsal anterior insula (rdAI) spreading into the adjacent vlPFC (FWE-pcluster = 0.023, k = 119). Post hoc analyses demonstrated that compared to HC, MDD patients exhibited exaggerated neural reactivity during affective pain yet attenuated reactivity during physical pain observation in this region, whereas GAD patients did not (Fig. 1b). Based on the contribution of both the insula and right amygdala to emotional empathy [7], functional connectivity alterations between these regions were examined in MDD relative to HC (contrast [affective pain > affective control] > [physical pain > physical control]) which revealed aberrant rdAI-right basolateral amygdala (rBLA) functional communication in MDD (FWE-psvc < 0.05, k = 5, MNI peak coordinates x/y/z: 24/3/–30, Fig. 1c). Post hoc analyses revealed decreased rdAI-rBLA functional connectivity during affective yet increased connectivity during physical pain observation in MDD patients relative to HC. Further exploratory voxel-wise ANOVAs separately examined empathy-specific neural activation differences ([physical pain > physical control]; [affective pain > affective control]) and revealed that both diagnostic groups demonstrated decreased bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC, FWE-pcluster = 0.05, k = 95, Fig. 1d) reactivity during observation of physical pain. To explore empathic differences in daily life, the personal distress scale from the Interpersonal Reactivity Index was assessed, revealing that MDD patients reported higher discomfort when confronted with suffering of others compared to both, HC and GAD patients (Fig. 1e, online suppl.

Finally, a confirmatory dimensional approach was employed to examine associations between MDD and GAD symptom load, and personal distress with rdAI pain empathic reactivity and connecAnxiety disorders and depression are highly prevalent, debilitating, and commonly comorbid mental disorders. Epidemiological, symptomatic, and pathogenetic perspectives suggest a particularly strong relationship between generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), leading to a continuous debate about their nosological and neurobiological uniqueness [1]. Traditional case control studies in either MDD or GAD patients suggest shared dysregulations in emotional and cognitive domains and underlying amygdala-frontal circuits [1, 2], while initial studies have reported disorder-specific dysregulations in the insular and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) [3]. During recent years, dysregulations in social processes, such as emotional empathy, have gained increasing attention as transdiagnostic etiological and diagnostic factors for internalizing disorders, including both depression and anxiety [4]. Expression of emotional empathy is dependent on the integrity of the anterior insula (AI) and adjacent ventral frontal regions, but while initial evidence suggests that empathic experience is impaired in MDD [5], common and distinct neural alterations in this domain between MDD and GAD and whether these vary between physical and affective pain observation have not been examined. To this end, the present neuroimaging study examined neural empathic reactivity and everyday empathic experience in unmedicated, treatment-naïve first-episode GAD (n = 35) and MDD (n = 37) patients and healthy controls (HC, n = 35) by means of a validated blocked-design emotional (pain) empathy fMRI paradigm [6] employing visually presented physical and affective pain stimuli, as well as corresponding control stimuli (Fig. 1a).

We propose a nonhomogeneous Partially Observed Markov Decision Process POMDP model to examine the latent health outcomes for online health community members. The transition between different health states is modeled as a probability function that incorporates different forms of social support that patients exchange via discussion board posts. We find that patients benefit from learning from others and that their participation in the online community helps them to improve their health and to better engage in their disease self-management process. Our results also reveal differences in the influence of various forms of social support exchanged on the evolution of patients' health conditions. We find evidence that informational support is the most prevalent type in the online healthcare community. Nevertheless, emotional support plays the most significant role in helping patients move to a healthier state. Overall, the influence of social support is found to vary depending on patients' health conditions. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed POMDP model can provide accurate predictions for patients' health states and can be used to recover missing or unavailable information on patients' health conditions.","[{'authorId': '46518162', 'name': 'L.

72f561406d191aaa09392aede1f28cf952d0605e,"A central theme in contemporary psychology is the distinction between implicit and explicit evaluation. Research has shown various dissociations between the two kinds of evaluations, including different antecedents, different consequences, and discrepant evaluations of the same object. The current article provides a briefreview ofthe associative–propositional evaluation (APE)model, whichaccounts for these dissociations by conceptualizing implicit and explicit evaluations as the behavioral outcomes of two functionallydistinct, yet mutuallyinteracting, mentalprocesses. Whereasimplicit evaluations are assumed to be the outcome of associative processes, explicit evaluations are conceptualized as the outcome of propositional processes. Associative processes determine the activation of mental contents on the basis of feature similarity and spatiotemporal contiguity; propositional processes involve the validation of activated mental contents on the basis of cognitive consistency. The APE model includes specific assumptions about mutual interactions between the two processes, implying precise predictions about converging versus diverging patterns of implicit and explicit evaluation. Conflicts between the “head” and the “heart” can be rather common in everyday life. We may feel romantically attracted to a particular person despite firmly believing that this person is not a good match; and the sight of a high-caloriedessertmay elicitanimpulse toindulge althoughwe know that it is unhealthy and detrimental for our goal to lose weight. Conversely, we may experience feelings of apprehension and discomfort when encountering members of stigmatized groups even though we intellectually abhor prejudice and wish to express solidarity with minorities; and a small spider may elicit an unpleasant fright response although we know that it is entirely harmless. Over the last two decades, psychologists have gained valuable insights into the causes and consequences of such evaluative conflicts by comparing verbal judgments on traditionalself-reportmeasures(e.g.,attitude scales,likeability ratings)tospontaneousresponses on performance-based paradigms (e.g.,sequential priming tasks, implicit association test). 1 Conceptually, evaluative judgments on the former type of measures can be described as explicit evaluations in the sense that their evaluative meaning is explicit in the observed response (e.g., participants explicitly report their agreement or disagreement with an evaluative statement about an object). Conversely, spontaneous responses on the latter type of measures can be described as implicit evaluations in the sense that their evaluative meaning is implicit in the observed response (e.g.,evaluative responses are inferred from participants’ latencies in responding topositive and negativewords that are precededby brief presentations ofanobject). The main goal of the current article is to provide a brief review of the associative– propositional evaluation (APE) model, which explains dissociations between implicit and explicit evaluations in terms of two functionally distinct mental processes (Gawronski & Bodenhausen, 2006, 2007, 2011).

Some research suggests that Facebook use can have negative consequences for well-being. Instagram, a photo-sharing social network created in 2010, has particular characteristics that may make users susceptible to negative consequences. This study tested a theoretically grounded moderated meditation model of the association between Instagram use and depressive symptoms through the mechanism of negative social comparison, and moderation by amount of strangers one follows. One hundred and seventeen 18-29 year olds completed online questionnaires containing demographics, frequency of Instagram use, amount of strangers followed on Instagram, the Center for Epidemiological Resources Scale for Depression, and the Social Comparison Rating Scale. Instagram use was marginally positively associated with depressive symptoms, and positive social comparison was significantly negatively associated with depressive symptoms. Amount of strangers followed moderated the associations of Instagram use with social comparison (significantly) and depressive symptoms (marginally), and further significantly moderated the indirect association of Instagram use with depressive symptoms through social comparison. Findings generally suggest that more frequent Instagram use has negative associations for people who follow more strangers, but positive associations for people who follow fewer strangers, with social comparison and depressive symptoms. Implications of negative associations of social networking for people who follow strangers and the need for more research on Instagram use given its increasing popularity are explored.","[{'authorId': '2044916', 'name': 'Katerina Lup'}, {'authorId': '3184703', 'name': 'Leora Trub'}, {'authorId': '80726473', 'name': 'L.

Due to the lack of a robust behavioral assay system, studies of empathy in laboratory animals have been absent from the literature. This unit describes a protocol for assessing social observational fear learning as a precursor of empathy in the mouse. In this assay, the observer animal is conditioned for context‐dependent fear by observing the behavior of the demonstrator animal receiving aversive stimuli. The magnitude of the fear response of the observer is positively influenced by the animal's familiarity with the demonstrator. This indicates that the degree of familiarity, and its relationship to empathy, can be modeled in an animal system by a method relevant to human disease. Curr. Protoc.

However, this overlap raises the question of whether it may reflect a unique distributed population of bimodal neurons or, alternatively, the activity of intermingled but independent populations. We used fMRI on 28 female volunteers and used multivariate pattern analysis techniques to probe for more fine-grain spatial representations of seen and felt pain. Using a whole-brain approach, we found that only in the anterior insula (bilaterally) the distribution of cortical activity evoked by seeing another person's hand in pain was spatially similar to that of pain felt on one's own hand.

Furthermore, for the anterior insula, the spatial distribution of activity associated with one's pain also replicates that of the perception of negative but painless stimuli.

For network-visible channels-status updates and posts on others' timelines-they also rated their satisfaction with replies they received. People shared differently between channels, with more intense and negative emotions in private messages. People felt more satisfied after sharing more positive emotions in all channels and after sharing more personally relevant emotions in network-visible channels. Finally, people's overall satisfaction after sharing emotions in network-visible channels is strongly tied to their reply satisfaction.

Evaluation of ability is concerned with the question “Can I do X?” and relies on the existence of a proxy performer. A proxy's relative standing on attributes vis‐à‐vis the comparer and whether the proxy exerted maximum effort on a preliminary task are variables influencing his or her informational utility. Evaluation of opinions is concerned with the questions “Do I like X?”“Is X correct?” and “Will I like X?” Important variables that affect an individual's use of social comparison to evaluate his or her opinions are the other person's expertise, similarity with the individual, and previous agreement with the individual. Whether social comparison serves a self-enhancement function depends on whether the comparer assimilates or contrasts his or her self relative to superior or inferior others.

Despite extensive research, it is still debated whether impairments in social skills of individuals with pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) are related to specific deficits in the early processing of emotional information. We aimed to test both automatic processing of facial affect as well as the integration of auditory and visual emotion cues in individuals with PDD.


METHODS
In a group of high-functioning adult individuals with PDD and an age- and IQ-matched control group, we measured facial electromyography (EMG) following presentation of visual emotion stimuli (facial expressions) as well as the presentation of audiovisual emotion pairs (faces plus voices). This emotionally driven EMG activity is considered to be a direct correlate of automatic affect processing that is not under intentional control.


RESULTS
Our data clearly indicate that among individuals with PDD facial EMG activity is heightened in response to happy and fearful faces, and intact in response to audiovisual affective information.


CONCLUSIONS
This study provides evidence for enhanced sensitivity to facial cues at the level of reflex-like emotional responses in individuals with PDD. Furthermore, the findings argue against impairments in crossmodal affect processing at this level of perception. However, given how little comparative work has been done in the area of multisensory perception, there is certainly need for further exploration.","[{'authorId': '7622865', 'name': 'M.

Emerging data on the trust game, a laboratory economic exchange, suggests that people trust strangers excessively (i.e., far more than their tolerance for risk and cynical views of their peers should allow). What produces this puzzling ""excess"" of trust? We argue that people trust due to a norm mandating that they show respect for the other person's character, presuming the other person has sufficient integrity and goodwill even if they do not believe it privately. Six studies provided converging evidence that decisions to trust follow the logic of norms. Trusting others is what people think they should do, and the emotions associated with fulfilling a social duty or responsibility (e.g., guilt, anxiety) account for at least a significant proportion of the excessive trust observed. Regarding the specific norm in play, trust rates collapse when respect for the other person's character is eliminated as an issue.","[{'authorId': '103054059', 'name': 'D.

Prior to testing with a trapped cagemate, restrainer door opening was trained and baseline opening latencies when the restrainer was empty or baited with food were established. The findings show that the first-time release occurred sooner than in previous research and that rats used a previously demonstrated response to release the trapped cagemate. Further, rats opened the restrainer door more often and with shorter latencies when the restrainer contained a cagemate than when the restrainer was empty, but less often and with longer latencies than when the restrainer contained food.

In the field of cognitive zoology, contagious behaviors have also received attention. Several such behaviors have been documented in various species. Nevertheless, emotional and behavioral contagion differ. Emotional contagion – a term predominantly used in human psychology – requires that the contagious behavior leads to converging emotional states. In non-linguistic animals, it is difficult to determine whether a behavior “caught” from someone else results in a similar affective state or remains a purely behavioral response. Some studies suggest the latter as a possibility. To disentangle the problem, we explored instances of contagious behaviors within the play domain. In several species, play involves a variety of behaviors falling into different categories: social, object and locomotor play. If a category of play in one individual induces a different category of play in another, this suggests the spread of a generally playful mood rather than a species-specific motor response. Although some studies suggest emotional contagion in mammals, it is not known whether it occurs in birds. We investigated play contagion in a group of ravens, well known for their complex social skills. The results indicate emotional contagion: the birds engaged in all categories of play on a higher level under the condition where contagion was likely to occur.

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the emotional contagion theory in print ads, and expand the literature of smiling to different type of smiles and gender congruency. Emotional contagion happens when an emotion is transferred from a sender to a receiver by the synchronization of emotions from the emitter. Drawing on emotional contagion theory, the authors expand this concept and propose that smiles in static facial expressions influence product evaluation. They suggest that false smiles do not have the same impact as genuine smiles on product evaluation, and the congruence between the model gender–product in a static ad and the gender of the viewer moderates the effects.


Design/methodology/approach
In Experiment 1, subjects were randomly assigned to view one of the two ad treatments to guard against systematic error (e.g. bias). In Experiment 2, it was investigated whether viewing a static ad featuring a model with a false smile can result in a positive product evaluation as was the case with genuine smiles (H3). In Experiment 3, it was assumed that when consumers evaluate an ad featuring a smiling face, the facial expression influences product evaluation, and this influence is moderated by the congruence between the gender of the ad viewer and the product H gender of the model in the ad.


Findings
Across three experiments, the authors found that the model’s facial expression influenced the product evaluation. Second, they supported the association between a model’s facial expression and mimicry synchronization. Third, they showed that genuine smiles have a higher impact on product evaluation than false smiles. This novel result enlarges the research on genuine smiles to include false smiles. Fourth, the authors supported the gender–product congruence effect in that the gender of the ad’s reader and the model have a moderating effect on the relationship between the model’s facial expression and the reader’s product evaluation.


Originality/value
Marketing managers would benefit from understanding that genuine smiles can encourage positive emotions on the part of consumers via emotional contagion, which would be very useful to create a positive effect on products. The authors improved upon previous psychological theory (Gunnery et al., 2013; Hennig-Thurau et al., 2006) showing that a genuine smile results in higher evaluation scores of products presented in static ads. The theoretical explanation for this effect is the genuine smile, which involves contraction of both zygomatic major and orbicularis oculi muscles. These facial muscles can be better perceived and transmit positive emotions (Hennig-Thurau et al., 2006).

According to Gross's (1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271-299) process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners.

In prior literature, researchers have studied spokespersons in general, but few have studied faces explicitly. This paper aims to answer three questions that are important to both researchers and practitioners: 1 Do faces affect how a viewer reacts to an advertisement on the metrics that advertisers care about? 2 If faces do have an effect, is it large enough to warrant careful selection of faces when constructing print advertisements? 3 If faces do have an effect and the effect is large, what facial features elicit such differential reactions on these metrics, and are such reactions different across individuals and/or product categories? Relying on the eigenface method, a holistic approach widely used in the computer science field for face recognition, we conducted an empirical study to answer these three questions. The results show that different faces do have an effect on people's attitude toward the advertisement, attitude toward the brand, and purchase intention and that the effect is nontrivial. Multiple segments were identified and substantial differences were found among people's reactions to the faces in the ads across those segments. We also found that the effect of faces interacts with product categories and is mediated by various facial traits such as attractiveness, trustworthiness, and competence. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.","[{'authorId': '2149551702', 'name': 'Li Xiao'}, {'authorId': '143878192', 'name': 'Min Ding'}]",58.0,,47.0,Just the Faces: Exploring the Effects of Facial Features in Print Advertising,2014.0

Overall, deep acting displayed weak relationships with indicators of impaired well-being and job attitudes but positive relationships with emotional performance and customer satisfaction (ρs .18 and .37). A meta-analytic regression analysis provides information on the unique contribution of emotion-rule dissonance, surface acting, and deep acting in statistically predicting well-being and performance outcomes.

This paper aims to draw attention to the need for a nuanced view of the emotional contagion framework. It proposes and empirically tests a refined model of emotional contagion and its effects in the hotel sector by focusing on the front-desk service encounter interactions. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
Data were collected from three separate groups of paired informants: receptionists, hotel customers and interaction observers. The sample included 573 full customer service interactions in 47 hotels in Catalonia. The model was tested with structural equation modelling. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
Emotional contagion has specific mechanisms at the hotel front-desk. No relationship was found between receptionists’ inner mood and their outwardly displayed emotions. Yet, receptionists’ displayed emotions enhance customer mood, and, largely, customer satisfaction. Ultimately, this affects customer behavioural intentions. It was also discovered that guests are able to clearly distinguish between their satisfaction with the specific service encounter at the front desk and the overall satisfaction with the hotel stay. The positive effects of employees’ displayed emotions are of particular importance in lower-star hotels and are less important at the high end. Perceived training opportunities have a positive effect on customer satisfaction and improve the employee-displayed emotion. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
 
Researchers should examine employee outcomes that are more stable than mood, but may enhance or be related to the effective display of emotions at the front desk, such as employee satisfaction and commitment. In general, emotions and behaviours of employees and consumers should be further examined in other services across the hospitality industry, in different cultural contexts and in terms of their impact on company performance. Researchers should heed the precise type of mechanism that takes place in each service context. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
 
The hotel management should focus their efforts on ensuring positive emotional performance, regardless of employees’ inner mood. Managers should carefully interpret differentiated results according to whether they have been drawn from overall satisfaction or customer service interaction surveys. The training provision is of particular importance in lower-star hotels, where customer outcomes depend more on employee-displayed emotion. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
This study empirically corroborates that customer outcomes of front-desk services are linked to receptionists’ displayed emotions, and not to employees’ feelings. Onsite data collection, multiple-informant approach, paired dyads and structural equation modelling hold a great potential for study designs that seek insights into interpersonal phenomena in hospitality services research.","[{'authorId': '119365498', 'name': 'Yury Ustrov'}, {'authorId': '2795936', 'name': 'M.

This article accepts their argument that the mere preference for social interaction is not the central element of Extraversion. However, it claims that the real core of the Extraversion factor is the tendency to behave in ways that attract social attention. Data from a sample of 200 respondents were used to test the 2 hypotheses with comparisons of measures of reward sensitivity and social attention in terms of their saturation with the common variance of Extraversion measures.

Indeed, in PS rats there is evidence of impaired social play behaviour, disturbances in a variety of circadian rhythms, enhanced anxiety and increased hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity. This study was designed to experimentally investigate the degree of reversibility of PS‐induced disturbances of social play and HPA reactivity by assessing the effect of the enrichment of the physical environment on PS rats during periadolescence. PS subjects showed a reduced expression of social play behaviour and a prolonged corticosterone secretion in response to restraint stress, but both these effects were markedly reversed following environmental enrichment. Interestingly, the enrichment procedure increased social behaviour but had no effect on corticosterone secretion in nonstressed animals, indicating a differential impact of the postnatal environment as a function of prenatal background. As a whole, results clearly indicate that rats prenatally exposed to stress can benefit during periadolescence from the modulatory effects of an enriched environment. Moreover, they confirm that PS may well represent a suitable animal model for the design and testing of new therapeutic strategies for behavioural disorders produced by early insults.","[{'authorId': '1398302422', 'name': 'S.

784ee2a3f41c3d5a8bb46b63a1af19a6bf85141f,"Results over the last decades have provided evidence suggesting that HPA axis dysfunction is a major risk factor predisposing to the development of psychopathological behaviour. This susceptibility can be programmed during developmental windows of marked neuroplasticity, allowing early-life adversity to convey vulnerability to mental illness later in life. Besides genetic predisposition, also environmental factors play a pivotal role in this process, through embodiment of the mother’s emotions, or via nutrients and hormones transferred through the placenta and the maternal milk. The aim of the current translational study was to mimic a severe stress condition by exposing female CD-1 mouse dams to abnormal levels of corticosterone (80 µg/mL) in the drinking water either during the last week of pregnancy (PreCORT) or the first one of lactation (PostCORT), compared to an Animal Facility Rearing (AFR) control group. When tested as adults, male mice from PostCORT offspring and somewhat less the PreCORT mice exhibited a markedly increased corticosterone response to acute restraint stress, compared to perinatal AFR controls. Aberrant persistence of adolescence-typical increased interest towards novel social stimuli and somewhat deficient emotional contagion also characterised profiles in both perinatal-CORT groups. Intranasal oxytocin (0 or 20.0 µg/kg) generally managed to reduce the stress response and restore a regular behavioural phenotype. Alterations in density of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors, oxytocin and µ- and κ-opioid receptors were found. Changes differed as a function of brain areas and the specific age window of perinatal aberrant stimulation of the HPA axis. Present results provided experimental evidence in a translational mouse model that precocious adversity represents a risk factor predisposing to the development of psychopathological behaviour.","[{'authorId': '1837749', 'name': 'G.

786f1dd67049560e2bddfd828c68ccdec75588bf,"In humans, the susceptibility to yawn contagion has been theoretically and empirically related to our capacity for empathy. Because of its relevance to evolutionary biology, this phenomenon has been the focus of recent investigations in non-human species. In line with the empathic hypothesis, contagious yawning has been shown to correlate with the level of social attachment in several primate species. Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) have also shown the ability to yawn contagiously. To date, however, the social modulation of dog contagious yawning has received contradictory support and alternative explanations (i.e., yawn as a mild distress response) could explain positive evidence. The present study aims to replicate contagious yawning in dogs and to discriminate between the two possible mediating mechanisms (i.e., empathic vs. distress related response). Twenty-five dogs observed familiar (dog’s owner) and unfamiliar human models (experimenter) acting out a yawn or control mouth movements. Concurrent physiological measures (heart rate) were additionally monitored for twenty-one of the subjects. The occurrence of yawn contagion was significantly higher during the yawning condition than during the control mouth movements. Furthermore, the dogs yawned more frequently when watching the familiar model than the unfamiliar one demonstrating that the contagiousness of yawning in dogs correlated with the level of emotional proximity. Moreover, subjects’ heart rate did not differ among conditions suggesting that the phenomenon of contagious yawning in dogs is unrelated to stressful events. Our findings are consistent with the view that contagious yawning is modulated by affective components of the behavior and may indicate that rudimentary forms of empathy could be present in domesticated dogs.","[{'authorId': '121494427', 'name': 'Teresa Romero'}, {'authorId': '7152405', 'name': 'A.

Many studies have discovered patterns in static graphs, identifying properties in a single snapshot of a large network, or in a very small number of snapshots; these include heavy tails for in- and out-degree distributions, communities, small-world phenomena, and others. However, given the lack of information about network evolution over long periods, it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about trends over time.Here we study a wide range of real graphs, and we observe some surprising phenomena. First, most of these graphs densify over time, with the number of edges growing super-linearly in the number of nodes. Second, the average distance between nodes often shrinks over time, in contrast to the conventional wisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of the number of nodes (like O(log n) or O(log(log n)).Existing graph generation models do not exhibit these types of behavior, even at a qualitative level. We provide a new graph generator, based on a ""forest fire"" spreading process, that has a simple, intuitive justification, requires very few parameters (like the ""flammability"" of nodes), and produces graphs exhibiting the full range of properties observed both in prior work and in the present study.","[{'authorId': '1702139', 'name': 'J.

In this study, we integrate qualitative user-marketer interaction content data from a fan page brand community on Facebook and consumer transactions data to assemble a unique data set at the individual consumer level. We then quantify the impact of community contents from consumers (user-generated content, i.e., UGC) and marketers (marketer-generated content, i.e., MGC) on consumers' apparel purchase expenditures. A content analysis method was used to construct measures to capture the informative and persuasive nature of UGC and MGC while distinguishing between directed and undirected communication modes in the brand community. In our empirical analysis, we exploit differences across consumers' fan page joining decision and across timing differences in fan page joining dates for our model estimation and identification strategies. Importantly, we also control for potential self-selection biases and relevant factors such as pricing, promotion, social network attributes, consumer demographics, and unobserved heterogeneity. Our findings show that engagement in social media brand communities leads to a positive increase in purchase expenditures. Additional examinations of UGC and MGC impacts show evidence of social media contents affecting consumer purchase behavior through embedded information and persuasion. We also uncover the different roles played by UGC and MGC, which vary by the type of directed or undirected communication modes by consumers and the marketer. Specifically, the elasticities of demand with respect to UGC information richness are 0.006 (directed communication) and 3.140 (undirected communication), whereas those for MGC information richness are insignificant. Moreover, the UGC valence elasticity of demand is 0.180 (undirected communication), whereas that for MGC valence is 0.004 (directed communication). Overall, UGC exhibits a stronger impact than MGC on consumer purchase behavior. Our findings provide various implications for academic research and practice.","[{'authorId': '2979479', 'name': 'K.

78a2a2e7b51c75e04b00a2f2ca8f5fccceb82ad4,"Opioid use disorders are characterized in part by impairments in social functioning. Previous research indicates that laboratory rats, which are frequently used as animal models of addiction‐related behaviors, are capable of prosocial behavior. For example, under normal conditions, when a ‘free’ rat is placed in the vicinity of rat trapped in a plastic restrainer, the rat will release or ‘rescue’ the other rat from confinement. The present study was conducted to determine the effects of heroin on prosocial behavior in rats. For 2 weeks, rats were given the opportunity to rescue their cagemate from confinement, and the occurrence of and latency to free the confined rat was recorded. After baseline rescuing behavior was established, rats were randomly selected to self‐administer heroin (0.06 mg/kg/infusion i.v.) or sucrose pellets (orally) for 14 days. Next, rats were retested for rescuing behavior once daily for 3 days, during which they were provided with a choice between freeing the trapped cagemate and continuing to self‐administer their respective reinforcer. Our results indicate that rats self‐administering sucrose continued to rescue their cagemate, whereas heroin rats chose to self‐administer heroin and not rescue their cagemate. These findings suggest that rats with a history of heroin self‐administration show deficits in prosocial behavior, consistent with specific diagnostic criteria for opioid use disorder. Behavioral paradigms providing a choice between engaging in prosocial behavior and continuing drug use may be useful in modeling and investigating the neural basis of social functioning deficits in opioid addiction.","[{'authorId': '2244094364', 'name': 'Seven E.

78df597327b3628980ee51ab6bb31594ed93ff5b,"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been proved to be more suitable than reinforcement learning for path planning in large-scale scenarios. In order to more effectively complete the DRL-based collaborative path planning in crowd evacuation, it is necessary to consider the space expansion problem brought by the increase of the number of agents. In addition, it is often faced with complicated circumstances, such as exit selection and congestion in crowd evacuation. However, few existing works have integrated these two aspects jointly. To solve this problem, we propose a planning approach for crowd evacuation based on the improved DRL algorithm, which will improve evacuation efficiency for large-scale crowd path planning. First, we propose a framework of congestion detection-based multi-agent reinforcement learning, the framework divides the crowd into leaders and followers and simulates leaders with a multi-agent system, it considers the congestion detection area is set up to evaluate the degree of congestion at each exit. Next, under the specification of this framework, we propose the improved Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (IMADDPG) algorithm, which adds the mean field network to maximize the returns of other agents, enables all agents to maximize the performance of a collaborative planning task in our training period. Then, we implement the hierarchical path planning method, which upper layer is based on the IMADDPG algorithm to solve the global path, and lower layer uses the reciprocal velocity obstacles method to avoid collisions in crowds. Finally, we simulate the proposed method with the crowd simulation system. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.","[{'authorId': '1384404569', 'name': 'Shangfei Zheng'}, {'authorId': '2118903809', 'name': 'Hong Liu'}]",40.0,,47.0,Improved Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient for Path Planning-Based Crowd Simulation,2019.0

Previous work has shown that reduced central drive to the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis is responsible, since parvocellular paraventricular nucleus neurone responses are reduced. One of the main input pathways to the paraventricular nucleus that is activated by the majority of stressors is the brainstem noradrenergic system. This review outlines key noradrenergic mechanisms that mediate hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis responses to acute stress, and addresses aspects of their adaptation in pregnancy and lactation that can explain the stress hyporesponsiveness at that time. In summary, reduced noradrenaline release and adrenergic receptor expression in the paraventricular nucleus may lead to reduced sensitivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis to adrenergic antagonists and agonists and its responses to stress. While there are subtle differences in these changes between pregnancy and lactation, it would appear that reduced effectiveness of the noradrenergic input can at least partly account for the reduced hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis responses both pre- and post-natally.","[{'authorId': '2594742', 'name': 'A.

The results of various stability and change models that were tested using structural equation modelling (SEM) indicated that demanding patient contacts lead to increased burnout among physicians. In addition, the findings suggested that about one quarter of the variance in physician's actual burnout levels across one decade is accounted for by a stable component, whereas about three quarters is accounted for by a change component.

Annu Rev Psychol 2008, 59:279-300. doi:10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093625) used empathy as an umbrella term and proposed a comprehensive model for the evolution of empathy with some of its basic elements in nonhuman animals. In de Waal's model, empathy consists of several layers distinguished by required cognitive levels; the perception-action mechanism plays the core role for connecting ourself and others. Then, human-like empathy such as perspective-taking develops in outer layers according to cognitive sophistication, leading to prosocial acts such as targeted helping. I agree that animals demonstrate many empathy-related phenomena; however, the species differences and the level of cognitive sophistication of the phenomena might be interpreted in another way than this simple linearly developing model. Our recent studies with chimpanzees showed that their perspective-taking ability does not necessarily lead to proactive helping behavior. Herein, as a springboard for further studies, I reorganize the empathy-related phenomena by proposing a combination model instead of the linear development model. This combination model is composed of three organizing factors: matching with others, understanding of others, and prosociality. With these three factors and their combinations, most empathy-related matters can be categorized and mapped to appropriate context; this may be a good first step to discuss the evolution of empathy in relation to the neural connections in human and nonhuman animal brains. I would like to propose further comparative studies, especially from the viewpoint of Homo-Pan (chimpanzee and bonobo) comparison.

Statistical control is widely used in correlational studies with the intent of providing more accurate estimates of relationships among variables, more conservative tests of hypotheses, or ruling out alternative explanations for empirical findings. However, the use of control variables can produce uninterpretable parameter estimates, erroneous inferences, irreplicable results, and other barriers to scientific progress. As a result, methodologists have provided a great deal of advice regarding the use of statistical control, to the point that researchers might have difficulties sifting through and prioritizing the available suggestions.

However, evidence regarding the job burnout-depression association is limited in that most studies are cross-sectional in nature. Moreover, little is known about factors that may influence the job burnout-depression association, other than individual or organizational factors (e.g., gender, supervisor support). The current study seeks to address these gaps by (a) unraveling the temporal relationship between job burnout and depression and (b) examining whether the job burnout-depression association may be contingent upon the degree to which employees engage in physical activity. On the basis of a full-panel 3-wave longitudinal design with a large sample of employees (N = 1,632), latent difference score modeling indicated that an increase in depression from Time 1 to Time 2 predicts an increase in job burnout from Time 2 to Time 3, and vice versa. In addition, physical activity attenuated these effects in a dose-response manner, so that the increase in job burnout and depression was strongest among employees who did not engage in physical activity and weakest to the point of nonsignificance among those engaging in high physical activity.","[{'authorId': '2851346', 'name': 'S.

Then, we introduce eMODUL, which consolidates this literature into a conceptual model. In particular, this model stresses the importance of emotional modulations and the roles they play with respect to the system autonomy depending on the targeted computational/cognitive processes (e.g., allocation of resources, organization of behavior). To illustrate these aspects and support our theoretical model, we review two robotic experiments where eMODUL is instantiated. The results demonstrate the interest of our approach for the development of interaction/communication and autonomy/adaptation capabilities in cognitive robots. In terms of natural cognition understanding they give additional insights into the emergence of emotion, the construction of multilevel appraisal, and the link between emotion and cognition in task-related emotions.","[{'authorId': '143626519', 'name': 'Marwen Belkaid'}, {'authorId': '2392156', 'name': 'N.

The network thus casts the pursuit of medical knowledge in a web-based context, marked by the pivotal importance of patient experience captured in the form of patient data.

Nagasawa et al. show that such gaze-mediated bonding also exists between us and our closest animal companions, dogs (see the Perspective by MacLean and Hare). They found that mutual gazing increased oxytocin levels, and sniffing oxytocin increased gazing in dogs, an effect that transferred to their owners. Wolves, who rarely engage in eye contact with their human handlers, seem resistant to this effect. Science, this issue p. 333; see also p. 280 The human-dog bond is facilitated by the interaction of oxytocin feedback loops that emerged over the course of domestication. [Also see Perspective by MacLean and Hare] Human-like modes of communication, including mutual gaze, in dogs may have been acquired during domestication with humans. We show that gazing behavior from dogs, but not wolves, increased urinary oxytocin concentrations in owners, which consequently facilitated owners’ affiliation and increased oxytocin concentration in dogs. Further, nasally administered oxytocin increased gazing behavior in dogs, which in turn increased urinary oxytocin concentrations in owners. These findings support the existence of an interspecies oxytocin-mediated positive loop facilitated and modulated by gazing, which may have supported the coevolution of human-dog bonding by engaging common modes of communicating social attachment.","[{'authorId': '8018629', 'name': 'M.

7b3f8d9692a3ecd7d585ecc7d22d40f851260190,"The spontaneous tendency to synchronize our facial expressions with those of others is often termed emotional contagion. It is unclear, however, whether emotional contagion depends on visual awareness of the eliciting stimulus and which processes underlie the unfolding of expressive reactions in the observer. It has been suggested either that emotional contagion is driven by motor imitation (i.e., mimicry), or that it is one observable aspect of the emotional state arising when we see the corresponding emotion in others. Emotional contagion reactions to different classes of consciously seen and “unseen” stimuli were compared by presenting pictures of facial or bodily expressions either to the intact or blind visual field of two patients with unilateral destruction of the visual cortex and ensuing phenomenal blindness. Facial reactions were recorded using electromyography, and arousal responses were measured with pupil dilatation. Passive exposure to unseen expressions evoked faster facial reactions and higher arousal compared with seen stimuli, therefore indicating that emotional contagion occurs also when the triggering stimulus cannot be consciously perceived because of cortical blindness. Furthermore, stimuli that are very different in their visual characteristics, such as facial and bodily gestures, induced highly similar expressive responses. This shows that the patients did not simply imitate the motor pattern observed in the stimuli, but resonated to their affective meaning. Emotional contagion thus represents an instance of truly affective reactions that may be mediated by visual pathways of old evolutionary origin bypassing cortical vision while still providing a cornerstone for emotion communication and affect sharing.","[{'authorId': '3005853', 'name': 'M.

Inter-subject phase synchronization (ISPS) is an approach for exploratory analysis of task-based fMRI data that reveals brain networks dynamically synchronized to task-features across subjects. We applied ISPS to task-fMRI data assessing vicarious pain empathy in healthy subjects (n=238). The task employed physical (limb) and affective (faces) painful and corresponding non-painful visual stimuli. ISPS revealed two distinct networks synchronized during physical pain observation, one encompassing anterior insula and midcingulate regions strongly engaged in (vicarious) pain, and another encompassing parietal and inferior frontal regions associated with social cognitive processes which may further modulate and support the pain empathic response. No robust network synchronization was observed while processing facial expressions of pain, possibly reflecting high inter-individual variation in response to socially transmitted pain experience. ISPS also revealed networks related to task onset or general processing of physical (limb) or affective (face) stimuli which encompassed networks engaged in object manipulation or face processing, respectively. Together, the ISPS approach permits segregation of networks engaged in different psychological processes, providing additional insight into shared neural mechanisms of empathy for physical pain across individuals.","[{'authorId': '46265559', 'name': 'Lei Xu'}, {'authorId': '4932842', 'name': 'Taylor Bolt'}, {'authorId': '6239704', 'name': 'Jason S.

To test hypotheses concerning the occurrence of antiphonal laughter, participants (n = 148) were tested as part of either same- or mixed-sex friend or stranger dyads, and were audiorecorded while they played brief games intended to facilitate laugh production. An index of antiphonal laughter for each dyad was derived using Yule's Q. Significantly more antiphonal laughter was produced in friend than in stranger dyads, and females in mixed-sex dyads produced more antiphonal laughter than did their male partners. Antiphonal laughter may therefore reflect a mutually positive stance between social partners, and function to reinforce shared positive affective experiences.","[{'authorId': '5528228', 'name': 'M.

Using cross-sectional survey data, we tested a hypothesized predictive model using structural equation modeling; the model was observed to fit well with the data. When teachers lack immediacy, are unclear, and/or demonstrate poor communication competence, students tend to report heightened negative emotional reactions.

Prenatal and postnatal stresses can have different long-term behavioral effects, and appropriate postnatal manipulations can counteract the behavioral effects of prenatal stress. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of changes in the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in the long-term effects of prenatal and postnatal events and of interactions between them. We investigated stress-induced corticosterone secretion and hippocampal corticosteroid receptors in male adult rats submitted to prenatal and/or postnatal manipulations. Repeated restraint during the last week of pregnancy was used as prenatal stressor, and adoption at birth was used to change the postnatal environment. We found that (1) prenatal stress prolongs stress-induced corticosterone secretion in adult rats, which was attributed to the observed decrease in central corticosteroid receptors; (2) adoption, irrespective of the stress experience of the foster mother, reverses the effects of prenatal stress; and (3) adoption per se increases maternal behavior and decreases the stress- induced corticosterone secretion peak in the adult offspring. In conclusion, certain prenatal and postnatal manipulations appear to have opposite long-term effects on the activity of the HPA axis, and adoption, probably by modifying maternal behavior, can protect against the effects of prenatal stress. Thus, changes in the activity of the HPA axis may be one of the biological substrates of the long-term effects of certain perinatal events.","[{'authorId': '6349708', 'name': 'S.

Nevertheless, contemporary deterrence researchers have mostly overlooked the distinction between perceived sanction risk and fear of apprehension. Whereas perceived risk is a cognitive judgment, fear involves visceral feelings of anxiety or dread. Equally important, a theory explicating the influence of deterrence on both criminal propensity and situational offending has remained elusive. We develop a theoretical model in which perceived risk and fear are distinguished at both the general and situational levels. We test this theoretical model with data from a set of survey-based experiments conducted in 2016 with a nationwide sample of adults (N = 965). We find that perceived risk and fear are empirically distinct and that perceived risk is positively related to fear at both the general and situational levels. Certain background and situational factors have indirect effects through perceived risk on fear. In turn, perceived risk has indirect effects through fear on both criminal propensity and situational intentions to offend. Fear's inclusion increases explanatory power for both criminal propensity and situational offending intentions. Fear is a stronger predictor than either self-control or prior offending of situational intentions to offend.","[{'authorId': '12362318', 'name': 'Justin T.

A robust emotion recognition system should be able to compensate for these differences across speakers. A natural approach is to normalize the features before training the classifiers. However, the normalization scheme should not affect the acoustic differences between emotional classes. This study presents the iterative feature normalization (IFN) framework, which is an unsupervised front-end, especially designed for emotion detection. The IFN approach aims to reduce the acoustic differences, between the neutral speech across speakers, while preserving the inter-emotional variability in expressive speech. This goal is achieved by iteratively detecting neutral speech for each speaker, and using this subset to estimate the feature normalization parameters. Then, an affine transformation is applied to both neutral and emotional speech. This process is repeated till the results from the emotion detection system are consistent between consecutive iterations. The IFN approach is exhaustively evaluated using the IEMOCAP database and a data set obtained under free uncontrolled recording conditions with different evaluation configurations.

In this paper, we present our ongoing research effort at USC MultiComp Lab to create models of human communication dynamic that explicitly take into consideration the multimodal and interpersonal aspects of human face-to-face interactions. The computational framework presented in this paper has wide applicability, including the recognition of human social behaviors, the synthesis of natural animations for robots and virtual humans, improved multimedia content analysis, and the diagnosis of social and behavioral disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder).","[{'authorId': '49933077', 'name': 'Louis-Philippe Morency'}]",5.0,,19.0,Computational study of human communication dynamic,2011.0

However, there are a number of inconsistencies in the literature, and important questions remain regarding the conditions under which stress effects emerge as well as basic questions about how stress impacts different phases of memory. In this meta-analysis, we examined 113 independent studies in humans with 6,216 participants that explored effects of stress on encoding, postencoding, retrieval, or postreactivation phases of episodic memory. The results indicated that when stress occurred prior to or during encoding it impaired memory, unless both the delay between the stressor and encoding was very short and the study materials were directly related to the stressor, in which case stress improved encoding. In contrast, postencoding stress improved memory unless the stressor occurred in a different physical context than the study materials. When stress occurred just prior to or during retrieval, memory was impaired, and these effects were larger for emotionally valenced materials than neutral materials. Although stress consistently increased cortisol, the magnitude of the cortisol response was not related to the effects of stress on memory. Nonetheless, the effects of stress on memory were generally reduced in magnitude for women taking hormonal contraceptives. These analyses indicate that stress disrupts some episodic memory processes while enhancing others, and that the effects of stress are modulated by a number of critical factors. These results provide important constraints on current theories of stress and memory, and point to new questions for future research.","[{'authorId': '3738716', 'name': 'G.

Positive, neutral and negative moods were induced using audiovisual presentations. Individual and group consensus judgments of nine person categories on three judgmental dimensions (evaluation, competence and self-confidence) were obtained in two experimental sessions separated by a two-week interval. Results showed that individuals made more positive judgments when happy, and more negative judgments when sad than did controls. Group discussion resulted in a further polarization of positive judgments, and the attenuation of negative judgments.

Existing literature has demonstrated that the linguistic style matching (LSM) between the coming users’ posts [user-generated content (UGC)] and existing firms’ content will influence users’ behavior, like promoting users to release more posts. However, little research has been conducted to analyze how firms’ feedbacking behaviors influence LSM. To fill the gap, this paper uses Python to measure the LSM between 69,463 posts from 9,777 users and existing firms’ generated content in the MIUI community and examines the impact of firms’ feedbacks on this LSM. The results show that the firms’ feedbacks frequency increased the LSM, but the firms’ feedbacks text length decreased the LSM. In addition, users’ textual sentiment and the published text length moderate the impact of firms’ feedbacks (e.g., frequency, text length) on LSM. Specifically, the users’ textual sentiment valence increases the positive effect of firms’ feedbacks frequency and weakens the negative effect of firms’ feedbacks text length on LSM. The users’ produced content text length reduced the positive effect of firms’ feedbacks frequency and offset the negative effect of the firms’ feedbacks text length on LSM. Further, the effects above are significant for the relatively active users but not for the inactive ones. Based on communication accommodation theory, this paper investigates the impact of firms’ feedbacks frequency and text length on subsequent users’ posting behaviors, providing an essential reference for guiding firms’ virtual brand community management.","[{'authorId': '117203921', 'name': 'Dewen Liu'}, {'authorId': '2178669237', 'name': 'Chenyiming Gong'}, {'authorId': '2158335160', 'name': 'Sikang Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2115772336', 'name': 'Yongbin Ma'}]",6.0,,63.0,The influence of firm’s feedbacks on user-generated content’s linguistic style matching–An explanation based on communication accommodation theory,2022.0

However, models of crowd dynamics are still lacking a systematic individual-level experimental verification, and the local mechanisms underlying the formation of collective patterns are not yet known in detail. We have conducted a set of well-controlled experiments with pedestrians performing simple avoidance tasks in order to determine the laws ruling their behaviour during interactions. The analysis of the large trajectory dataset was used to compute a behavioural map that describes the average change of the direction and speed of a pedestrian for various interaction distances and angles. The experimental results reveal features of the decision process when pedestrians choose the side on which they evade, and show a side preference that is amplified by mutual interactions. The predictions of a binary interaction model based on the above findings were then compared with bidirectional flows of people recorded in a crowded street. Simulations generate two asymmetric lanes with opposite directions of motion, in quantitative agreement with our empirical observations. The knowledge of pedestrian behavioural laws is an important step ahead in the understanding of the underlying dynamics of crowd behaviour and allows for reliable predictions of collective pedestrian movements under natural conditions.","[{'authorId': '2954267', 'name': 'M.

This article examines the validity of scales designed to tap three such trait variables.

The Emotional Empathy Scale was shown to be construct invalid in that it was multidimensional at both the first- and second-order factor levels. The subscales may be useful, but the composite score is meaningless. The data also showed that the two Self-Consciousness Scales could be reduced to a single second-order factor. This raises some questions about how the scales should be treated, but does not pose any problems for interpreting earlier research. Finally, the Self-Monitoring Scale yielded four primary factors and two second-order factors. Consistent with earlier investigations, this study shows that the scale exhibits very little correspondence to the self-monitoring construct. Its continued use is strongly discouraged. Recommendations for the use and interpretation of research that has employed the scales are offered, and the implications for past and present communication theory are examined.","[{'authorId': '3655547', 'name': 'J.

Although the behavioral repertoire of this species manifests along three-dimensional (3D), most of the efforts in behavioral pharmacology rely on two-dimensional (2D) projections acquired from a single overhead or front camera. We recently showed that, compared to a 3D scoring approach, 2D analyses could lead to inaccurate claims regarding individual and social behavior of drug-free experimental subjects. Here, we examined whether this conclusion extended to the field of behavioral pharmacology by phenotyping adult zebrafish, acutely exposed to citalopram (30, 50, and 100 mg/L) or ethanol (0.25%, 0.50%, and 1.00%), in the novel tank diving test over a 6-min experimental session. We observed that both compounds modulated the time course of general locomotion and anxiety-related profiles, the latter being represented by specific behaviors (erratic movements and freezing) and avoidance of anxiety-eliciting areas of the test tank (top half and distance from the side walls). We observed that 2D projections of 3D trajectories (ground truth data) may introduce a source of unwanted variation in zebrafish behavioral phenotyping. Predictably, both 2D views underestimate absolute levels of general locomotion. Additionally, while data obtained from a camera positioned on top of the experimental tank are similar to those obtained from a 3D reconstruction, 2D front view data yield false negative findings.","[{'authorId': '145838336', 'name': 'S.

This was accomplished by assessing responses to pictures that varied systematically in these parameters. Along with overall effects of picture valence reported in previous work, we found effects of thematic content (i.e., specific nature of objects/events depicted) for all measures except heart rate. In addition, we found that the magnitude of startle blink, skin conductance, and corrugator muscle reactions increased with increasing affective intensity of pictures. Additionally, for these three measures, intensity effects also interacted with effects of picture content. These results indicate that stimulus parameters of intensity and thematic content exert separate-and in some cases interactive-modulatory effects on physiological reactions to emotional pictures.","[{'authorId': '2825853', 'name': 'E.

Given the importance of understanding empathy's evolutionary emergence, it is unsurprising that many studies attempt to find evidence for it in other species. To address the question of what should constitute evidence for empathy, we offer a critical comparison of two recent studies of rescuing behaviour that report similar phenomena but are interpreted very differently by their authors. In one of the studies, rescue behaviour in rats was interpreted as providing evidence for empathy, whereas in the other, rescue behaviour in ants was interpreted without reference to sharing of emotions. Evidence for empathy requires showing that actor individuals possess a representation of the receiver's emotional state and are driven by the psychological goal of improving its wellbeing. Proving psychological goal-directedness by current standards involves goal-devaluation and causal sensitivity protocols, which, in our view, have not been implemented in available publications. Empathy has profound significance not only for cognitive and behavioural sciences but also for philosophy and ethics and, in our view, remains unproven outside humans.","[{'authorId': '118760486', 'name': 'Marco Vasconcelos'}, {'authorId': '3010031', 'name': 'K.

7f8baa24bdbefb0c5b1a0a98a52fa34defad8258,"Hypothesis I: There exists, in the human organism, a drive to evaluate his opinions and his abilities. While opinions and abilities may, at first glance, seem to be quite different things, there is a close functional tie between them. They act together in the manner in which they affect behavior. A person’s cognition (his opinions and beliefs) about the situation in which he exists and his appraisals of what he is capable of doing (his evaluation of his abilities) will together have bearing on his behavior. The holding of incorrect opinions and/or inaccurate appraisals of one’s abilities can be punishing or even fatal in many situations. It is necessary, before we proceed, to clarify the distinction between opinions and evaluations of abilities since at first glance it may seem that one’s evaluation of one’s own ability is an opinion about it. Abilities are of course manifested only through performance which is assumed to depend upon the particular ability. The clarity of the manifestation or performance can vary from instances where there is no clear ordering criterion of the ability to instances where the performance which reflects the ability can be clearly ordered. In the former case, the evaluation of the ability does function like other opinions which are not directly testable in “objective reality’. For example, a person’s evaluation of his ability to write poetry will depend to a large extent on the opinions which others have of his ability to write poetry. In cases where the criterion is unambiguous and can be clearly ordered, this furnishes an objective reality for the evaluation of one’s ability so that it depends less on the opinions of other persons and depends more on actual comparison of one’s performance with the performance of others. Thus, if a person evaluates his running ability, he will do so by comparing his time to run some distance with the times that other persons have taken. In the following pages, when we talk about evaluating an ability, we shall mean specifically the evaluation of that ability in situations where the performance is unambiguous and is known. Most situations in real life will, of course, present situations which are a mixture of opinion and ability evaluation. In a previous article (7) the author posited the existence of a drive to determine whether or not one’s opinions were “correct”. We are here stating that this same drive also produces behavior in people oriented toward obtaining an accurate appraisal of their abilities. The behavioral implication of the existence of such a drive is that we would expect to observe behaviour on the part of persons which enables them to ascertain whether or not their opinions are correct and also behavior which enables them accurately to evaluate their abilities.

It was with a view to obtaining more insight regarding the effects of the various factors which govern the spread of contagious epidemics that the present investigation was undertaken. Reference may here be made to the work of Ross and Hudson (1915-17) in which the same problem is attacked. The problem is here carried to a further stage, and it is considered from a point of view which is in one sense more general. The problem may be summarised as follows: One (or more) infected person is introduced into a community of individuals, more or less susceptible to the disease in question. The disease spreads from the affected to the unaffected by contact infection. Each infected person runs through the course of his sickness, and finally is removed from the number of those who are sick, by recovery or by death. The chances of recovery or death vary from day to day during the course of his illness. The chances that the affected may convey infection to the unaffected are likewise dependent upon the stage of the sickness. As the epidemic spreads, the number of unaffected members of the community becomes reduced. Since the course of an epidemic is short compared with the life of an individual, the population may be considered as remaining constant, except in as far as it is modified by deaths due to the epidemic disease itself. In the course of time the epidemic may come to an end. One of the most important probems in epidemiology is to ascertain whether this termination occurs only when no susceptible individuals are left, or whether the interplay of the various factors of infectivity, recovery and mortality, may result in termination, whilst many susceptible individuals are still present in the unaffected population. It is difficult to treat this problem in its most general aspect. In the present communication discussion will be limited to the case in which all members of the community are initially equally susceptible to the disease, and it will be further assumed that complete immunity is conferred by a single infection.","[{'authorId': '14880558', 'name': 'W.

Implement and evaluate a co-designed staff wellbeing program.


BACKGROUND
Working in healthcare can be physically and psychologically demanding. The job demands-resources model indicates job resources moderate the impact of job demands on staff wellbeing. Wellbeing initiatives introduced by organisations improve staff commitment, reduce absences and incidents.


METHOD
A qualitative descriptive design was applied. In 2019, within an Australian local health district, 232 healthcare professionals across eight hospitals and two community settings attended a six-week wellbeing program which included a variety of self-care strategies, e.g. mindfulness. Nine one-hour focus groups were completed 2-4 weeks post-program. Data was analysed using thematic analysis to explore participants' thoughts and experiences.


RESULTS
Participants' experienced joy from workshops, and guilt for leaving peers with their workload. Participants developed strong interpersonal relationships with workshop attendees within a 'safe wellbeing space'. Broader impacts expressed by participants; learnt coping mechanisms and proactive self-care practices, easily embedded into daily routines. Participants shared their 'toolkit' with colleagues, family and friends, positively impacting the wellbeing of people around them.


CONCLUSION
Participants encouraged by their new wellbeing 'tool-kit' engaged with colleagues, better managed stressors and shared learnings.


IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT

Yet, their systematic experimental study remains a challenging open problem due to ethical and methodological constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate the viability of shared three-dimensional virtual environments as an experimental platform for conducting crowd experiments with real people. In particular, we show that crowds of real human subjects moving and interacting in an immersive three-dimensional virtual environment exhibit typical patterns of real crowds as observed in real-life crowded situations. These include the manifestation of social conventions and the emergence of self-organized patterns during egress scenarios. High-stress evacuation experiments conducted in this virtual environment reveal movements characterized by mass herding and dangerous overcrowding as they occur in crowd disasters. We describe the behavioural mechanisms at play under such extreme conditions and identify critical zones where overcrowding may occur. Furthermore, we show that herding spontaneously emerges from a density effect without the need to assume an increase of the individual tendency to imitate peers. Our experiments reveal the promise of immersive virtual environments as an ethical, cost-efficient, yet accurate platform for exploring crowd behaviour in high-risk situations with real human subjects.","[{'authorId': '2954267', 'name': 'M.

80ec07885b166f7ff1602fcc484ae0f630988840,"The literature establishes that customer and frontline employee (FLE) emotions converge during their encounters as a result of a transient, contagion-based process in which emotions flow from one actor to another. Recent evidence suggests, however, that this transient process does not produce emotional convergence among frontline dyads engaged in ongoing exchange, a surprising finding, given the wealth of evidence in support of the idea that customers and FLEs engaged in relational exchange strongly influence one another. In light of this evidence, we argue here that customers and FLEs engaged in ongoing exchange experience similar emotions not as a result of the transient transfer of emotions, but because they develop the tendency to undergo a similar emotional response to relationship events, a phenomenon we call the shared frontline experience. Informed by the social psychology literature, we support this idea by advancing a conceptual model that highlights the role of relationship closeness, personality similarity, and dyadic attachment style in producing the shared frontline experience. The proposed model also suggests that firms stand to benefit from the shared frontline experience of customers and FLEs if they provide the dyad with autonomy, a decision not without risk. Future research directions suggested by this perspective are discussed.","[{'authorId': '7391583', 'name': 'A. Zablah'}, {'authorId': '74811971', 'name': 'Nancy J.

EA has particularly interested researchers in the context of romantic couples. Reviews of the literature suggest a possible link between romantic partners’ EA and their relationship satisfaction (Ickes & Simpson, 2001; Sillars & Scott, 1983). To assess the magnitude of this association and examine possible moderators, we performed a meta-analytic review of 21 studies (total N = 2,739 participants) that examined the association between EA and satisfaction. We limited our review to studies measuring EA using the dyadic interaction paradigm (Ickes, Stinson, Bissonnette, & Garcia, 1990). We found a small but significant association between the two (r = .134, p < .05). Subsequent moderation analyses demonstrated that EA for negative emotions (one’s accuracy when assessing a partner’s negative emotions) was more closely related to satisfaction (r = .171, p < .05) than EA for positive ones (r = .068, p > .1). The association was also stronger in relationships of moderate length, suggesting that EA may be more meaningful when relationships are consolidating but before they become stable. Gender and procedural variations on the dyadic interaction paradigm did not moderate the association, and there was no difference depending on whether the association was between EA and perceivers’ or targets’ satisfaction (i.e., actor or partner effects). We discuss the implications of these findings and offer recommendations for future EA studies.","[{'authorId': '8243558', 'name': 'Haran Sened'}, {'authorId': '2389940', 'name': 'M.

To assess the propensity of pet dogs to actively rescue distressed humans without explicit training, this study tested whether sixty pet dogs would release their seemingly trapped owners from a large box. To examine the causal mechanisms that shaped this behavior, the readiness of each dog to open the box was tested in three conditions: 1) the owner sat in the box and called for help (distress test), 2) an experimenter placed high-value food rewards in the box (food test), and 3) the owner sat in the box and calmly read aloud (reading test). Dogs were as likely to release their distressed owner as to retrieve treats from inside the box, indicating that rescuing an owner may be a highly rewarding action for dogs. After accounting for opening ability, dogs released the owner more often when the owner called for help than when the owner read aloud calmly. In addition, opening latencies decreased with test number in the distress test but not the reading test. Thus, rescuing the owner could not be attributed solely to social facilitation, stimulus enhancement, or social contact-seeking behavior. Dogs displayed more stress behaviors in the distress test than in the reading test, and stress scores decreased with test number in the reading test but not in the distress test. This evidence of emotional contagion supports the hypothesis that rescuing the distressed owner was an empathetically-motivated prosocial behavior. Success in the food task and previous (in-home) experience opening objects were both strong predictors of releasing the owner. Thus, prosocial behavior tests for dogs should control for physical ability and previous experience.","[{'authorId': '1638736128', 'name': 'Joshua Van Bourg'}, {'authorId': '1638738498', 'name': 'Jordan Elizabeth Patterson'}, {'authorId': '7516261', 'name': 'C.

Although a variety of functions have been proposed and examined at different levels of abstraction, what is undeniable is that when emotional processing is compromised, most things social go awry. In this review we survey the research findings documenting the functions of emotion and link these to new discoveries about how emotion is accurately processed and transmitted. We focus specifically on emotion processing in dyads and groups, which reflects the current scientific trend. Within dyads, emotional expressions and learning and understanding through vicarious emotion are the phenomena of interest. Behavioral and brain mechanisms supporting their successful occurrence are evaluated. At the group level, group emotions and group-based emotions, two very different phenomena, are discussed, and mechanistic accounts are reviewed.","[{'authorId': '1986858', 'name': 'P.

Unlike prior studies that have explored potential explanations related to lyrics, memories, and mood regulation, we investigated the types of emotions induced by unfamiliar, instrumental sad music, and whether these responses are consistently associated with certain individual difference variables. One hundred and two participants were drawn from a representative sample to minimize self-selection bias. The results suggest that the emotional responses induced by unfamiliar sad music could be characterized in terms of three underlying factors: Relaxing sadness, Moving sadness, and Nervous sadness. Relaxing sadness was characterized by felt and perceived peacefulness and positive valence. Moving sadness captured an intense experience that involved feelings of sadness and being moved. Nervous sadness was associated with felt anxiety, perceived scariness and negative valence. These interpretations were supported by indirect measures of felt emotion. Experiences of Moving sadness were strongly associated with high trait empathy and emotional contagion, but not with other previously suggested traits such as absorption or nostalgia-proneness. Relaxing sadness and Nervous sadness were not significantly predicted by any of the individual difference variables. The findings are interpreted within a theoretical framework of embodied emotions.","[{'authorId': '2804198', 'name': 'T. Eerola'}, {'authorId': '6178537', 'name': 'J.

In this study, 53 adults with MDD and 53 healthy adults carried hand-held electronic devices for approximately 7 days and were prompted randomly 8 times per day to report their levels of current negative affect (NA), positive affect (PA), and the occurrence of significant events. In terms of NA, compared with healthy controls, depressed participants reported greater instability and greater reactivity to positive events, but comparable levels of inertia and reactivity to negative events. Neither average levels of NA nor NA reactivity to, frequency or intensity of, events accounted for the group difference in instability of NA. In terms of PA, the MDD and control groups did not differ significantly in their instability, inertia, or reactivity to positive or negative events.

Adolescents seek new experiences and higher levels of rewarding stimulation, and often engage in risky behaviors, without considering future outcomes or consequences. These behaviors can have adaptive benefits with regard to the development of independence and survival without parental protection, but also render the adolescent more vulnerable to harm. Indeed, the risk of injury or death is higher during the adolescent period than in childhood or adulthood, and the incidence of depression, anxiety, drug use and addiction, and eating disorders increases. Brain pathways that play a key role in emotional regulation and cognitive function undergo distinct maturational changes during this transition period. It is clear that adolescents think and act differently from adults, yet relatively little is known about the precise mechanisms underlying neural, behavioral, and cognitive events during this period. Increased investigation of these dynamic alterations, particularly in prefrontal and related corticolimbic circuitry, may aid this understanding. Moreover, the investigation of mammalian animal models of adolescence—such as those examining impulsivity, reward sensitivity, and decision making—may also provide new opportunities for addressing the problem of adolescent vulnerability.","[{'authorId': '3744574', 'name': 'A.

We addressed this issue using experience-sampling, the most reliable method for measuring in-vivo behavior and psychological experience. We text-messaged people five times per day for two-weeks to examine how Facebook use influences the two components of subjective well-being: how people feel moment-to-moment and how satisfied they are with their lives. Our results indicate that Facebook use predicts negative shifts on both of these variables over time. The more people used Facebook at one time point, the worse they felt the next time we text-messaged them; the more they used Facebook over two-weeks, the more their life satisfaction levels declined over time. Interacting with other people “directly” did not predict these negative outcomes. They were also not moderated by the size of people's Facebook networks, their perceived supportiveness, motivation for using Facebook, gender, loneliness, self-esteem, or depression.

The epidemic threshold is a fundamental metric for the epidemic process to determine the condition when an epidemic can either survive or die out in a network.

In this work, we explore the effect of the heterogeneity in both infection rates and recovery rates on the epidemic threshold through both analysis and simulations. We discover that heterogeneous infection rates and heterogeneous recovery rates have the opposite impact on the epidemic threshold. Specifically, the heterogeneity in infection rates leads to a larger epidemic threshold than in the homogeneous case. Moreover, as the degree of the heterogeneity of infection rates gets higher, the epidemic threshold increases. On the other hand, the heterogeneity in recovery rates generates a smaller epidemic threshold than in the homogeneous case.

Further analyses consistently identified shared neural representations in the bilateral mid-insula.

838f936c8d5468acbe8bdec033a5d6a1b62594db,"Hypothesis testing in neuroimaging studies relies heavily on treating named anatomical regions (e.g., “the amygdala”) as unitary entities. Though data collection and analyses are conducted at the voxel level, inferences are often based on anatomical regions. The discrepancy between the unit of analysis and the unit of inference leads to ambiguity and flexibility in analyses that can create a false sense of reproducibility. For example, hypothesizing effects on “amygdala activity” does not provide a falsifiable and reproducible definition of precisely which voxels or which patterns of activation should be observed. Rather, it comprises a large number of unspecified sub-hypotheses, leaving room for flexible interpretation of findings, which we refer to as “model degrees of freedom.” From a survey of 135 functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging studies in which researchers claimed replications of previous findings, we found that 42.2% of the studies did not report any quantitative evidence for replication such as activation peaks. Only 14.1% of the papers used exact coordinate-based or a priori pattern-based models. Of the studies that reported peak information, 42.9% of the ‘replicated’ findings had peak coordinates more than 15 mm away from the ‘original’ findings, suggesting that different brain locations were activated, even when studies claimed to replicate prior results. To reduce the flexible and qualitative region-level tests in neuroimaging studies, we recommend adopting quantitative spatial models and tests to assess the spatial reproducibility of findings. Techniques reviewed here include permutation tests on peak distance, Bayesian MANOVA, and a priori multivariate pattern-based models. These practices will help researchers to establish precise and falsifiable spatial hypotheses, promoting a cumulative science of neuroimaging.","[{'authorId': '2115291102', 'name': 'Yong-Pyo Hong'}, {'authorId': '89194791', 'name': 'Yejong Yoo'}, {'authorId': '2111706997', 'name': 'Jihoon Han'}, {'authorId': '2549424', 'name': 'T.

With respect to emotion, interpreted as a discrete affective process, mood is more controllable, more nebulous, and more related to mind/cognition; in addition, causes are less well-defined than those eliciting emotion. Therefore, firstly, the rational for the distinction between emotion and mood was provided. Then, the main frontal EEG asymmetry models were presented, such as the motivational approach/withdrawal, valence/arousal, capability, and inhibition asymmetric models. Afterward, the frontal EEG asymmetry of mood was investigated following three research lines, that is considering studies involving different mood induction procedures, dispositional mood (positive and negative affect), and mood alterations in both healthy and clinical populations. In general, results were found to be contradictory, no model is unequivocally supported regardless the research line considered. Different methodological issues were raised, such as: the composition of samples used across studies, in particular, gender and age were found to be critical variables that should be better addressed in future studies; the importance of third variables that might mediate the relationship between frontal EEG asymmetries and mood, for example bodily states and hormonal responses; the role of cognition, namely the interplay between mood and executive functions. In light of these issues, future research directions were proposed. Amongst others, the need to explore the neural connectivity that underpins EEG asymmetries, and the need to include both positive and negative mood conditions in the experimental designs have been highlighted.","[{'authorId': '1704993', 'name': 'Massimiliano Palmiero'}, {'authorId': '2864443', 'name': 'L.

The sympathetic skin conductance response (SCR) is one index of autonomic arousal. The precise functional neuroanatomy underlying generation and representation of SCR during motivational behavior is undetermined, although it is impaired by discrete brain lesions to ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and parietal lobe. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study brain activity associated with spontaneous fluctuations in amplitude of SCR, and activity corresponding to generation and afferent representation of discrete SCR events. Regions that covaried with increased SCR included right orbitofrontal cortex, right anterior insula, left lingual gyrus, right fusiform gyrus, and left cerebellum. At a less stringent level of significance, predicted areas in bilateral medial prefrontal cortex and right inferior parietal lobule covaried with SCR. Generation of discrete SCR events was associated with significant activity in left medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral extrastriate visual cortices, and cerebellum. Activity in right medial prefrontal cortex related to afferent representation of SCR events. Activity in bilateral medial prefrontal lobe, right orbitofrontal cortex, and bilateral extrastriate visual cortices was common to both generation and afferent representation of discrete SCR events identified in a conjunction analysis. Our results suggest that areas implicated in emotion and attention are differentially involved in generation and representation of peripheral SCR responses. We propose that this functional arrangement enables integration of adaptive bodily responses with ongoing emotional and attentional states of the organism.","[{'authorId': '31528641', 'name': 'H.

8526f4bf5c29c59681301c4d01c224be55b7b04d,"—Psychological states such as thoughts and feelings are real. Brain states are real. The problem is that the two are not real in the same way, creating the mind–brain correspondence problem. In this article, I present a possible solution to this problem that involves two suggestions. First, complex psychological states such as emotion and cognition can be thought of as constructed events that can be causally reduced to a set of more basic, psychologically primitive ingredients that are more clearly respected by the brain. Second, complex psychological categories like emotion and cognition are the phenomena that require explanation in psychology, and, therefore, they cannot be abandoned by science. Describing the content and structure of these categories is a necessary and valuable scientific activity. Physical concepts are free creations of the human mind, and are not, however it may seem, uniquely determined by the external world. The cardinal passions of our life, anger, love, fear, hate, hope, and the most comprehensive divisions of our intellectual activity, to remember , expect, think, know, dream , with the broadest genera of aesthetic feeling, joy, sorrow, pleasure, pain, are the only facts of a subjective order which this vocabulary deigns to note by special words. From its inception in the early 18th century (as an amalgam of philosophy, neurology, and physiology), psychology has always been in a bit of an identity crisis, trying to be both a social and a natural science. 1 Psychologists attempt to bridge the social and natural worlds using the conceptual tools of their time. Throughout our history, the link between the two has felt less like a solid footbridge and more like a tightrope requiring lightness of foot and a really strong safety net. Mind–brain, and relatedly, behavior– brain, correspondence continue to be central issues in psychology, and they remain the largest challenge in 21st-century psychology. The difficulty in linking the human mind to behavior on the one hand and to the brain on the other is rooted, ironically enough, in the way the human brain itself works. Human brains categorize continuously, effortlessly, and relentlessly. Categorization plays a fundamental role in every human activity, including science. Categorizing functions like a chisel, dividing up the sensory world into figure and ground, leading us to attend to certain features and to ignore others. Via the process of categorization, the brain transforms only some sensory stimulation into information.

Recent work analyzing massive datasets advances our understanding of popularity, but one major gap remains: To precisely quantify the relationship between the popularity of an online item and the external promotions it receives. This work supplies the missing link between exogenous inputs from public social media platforms, such as Twitter, and endogenous responses within the content platform, such as YouTube. We develop a novel mathematical model, the Hawkes intensity process, which can explain the complex popularity history of each video according to its type of content, network of diffusion, and sensitivity to promotion. Our model supplies a prototypical description of videos, called an endo-exo map. This map explains popularity as the result of an extrinsic factor -- the amount of promotions from the outside world that the video receives, acting upon two intrinsic factors -- sensitivity to promotion, and inherent virality. We use this model to forecast future popularity given promotions on a large 5-months feed of the most-tweeted videos, and found it to lower the average error by 28.6% from approaches based on popularity history. Finally, we can identify videos that have a high potential to become viral, as well as those for which promotions will have hardly any effect.","[{'authorId': '1808087', 'name': 'Marian-Andrei Rizoiu'}, {'authorId': '33650938', 'name': 'Lexing Xie'}, {'authorId': '1732536', 'name': 'S.

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to apply the concept of power imbalance to explain workplace and demographic characteristics associated with bullying by different perpetrators in the healthcare sector.


Design/methodology/approach
All 69,927 members of the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation (Victoria) were invited to participate in an online survey in 2014; 4,891 responses were received (7 per cent response rate). Participants were asked about their exposure to workplace bullying (WPB) by different perpetrators. The questionnaire addressed demographic characteristics and perceptions of workplace characteristics (workplace type, leading indicators of occupational health and safety (OHS), prioritisation of OHS, supervisor support for safety and bureaucracy). Analysis involved descriptive statistics and regression analyses.


Findings
The study found that the exposure of nurses and health workers to bullying is relatively high (with 42 per cent of respondents experiencing WPB in the past 12 months) and there are multiple perpetrators of bullying. The research revealed several demographic predictors associated with the different types of perpetrators. Downward and horizontal bullying were the most prevalent forms. Workplace characteristics were more important predictors of bullying by different perpetrators than were demographic characteristics.


Research limitations/implications
There are limitations to the study due to a low response rate and the cross-sectional survey.


Practical implications
Practical implications of this study emphasise the importance of focussed human resource strategies to prevent bullying.


Originality/value
The key contribution of this research is to draw from theoretical explanations of power to inform understanding of the differences between perpetrators of bullying. The study highlights the workplace characteristics that influence bullying.

This study examines the role of firms’ social media engagement initiatives surrounding customers’ experiential interaction events in influencing the sentiment of customers’ digital engagement. Results indicate that marketers can influence the sentiment of customers’ digital engagement beyond their performance during customers’ interactions, and for unfavorable event outcomes, informational marketer-generated content, more so than emotional content, can enhance customer sentiment.

The topology corresponds to a multiplex network where two diffusive processes are interacting affecting each other. The analysis using a microscopic Markov chain approach reveals the phase diagram of the incidence of the epidemics and allows us to capture the evolution of the epidemic threshold depending on the topological structure of the multiplex and the interrelation with the awareness process. Interestingly, the critical point for the onset of the epidemics has a critical value (metacritical point) defined by the awareness dynamics and the topology of the virtual network, from which the onset increases and the epidemics incidence decreases.","[{'authorId': '35559595', 'name': 'C.

We constructed a model based on the literature and tested it on a sample of 313 participants from the group being stigmatized. The results demonstrate: (1) relevance and stigma perception promote negative emotions, including anxiety, anger, and grief; (2) the arousal of anger and grief leads to a rise in the altruistic tendency within the stigmatized group; and (3) stigmatization-induced negative emotions have a complete mediating effect between perceived relevance and altruistic tendency, as well as perceived stigma and altruistic tendency. For a country and nation, external stigma will promote the group becoming more united and mutual help. One wish to pass the buck but end up helping others unintentionally.

869841d348332405f301be40babbe00a94aee07d,"Background: The current outbreak of COVID-19 infection, which started in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019, is an ongoing challenge and a significant threat to public health requiring surveillance, prompt diagnosis, and research efforts to understand a new, emergent, and unknown pathogen and to develop effective therapies. Despite the increasing number of published studies on COVID-19, in all the examined studies the lack of a well-defined pathophysiology of death among patients who died following COVID-19 infection is evident. Autopsy should be considered mandatory to define the exact cause of death, thus providing useful clinical and epidemiologic information as well as pathophysiological insights to further provide therapeutic tools. Methods: A literature review was performed on PubMed database, using the key terms: “COVID-19”, “nCov 19”, and “Sars Cov 2”. 9709 articles were retrieved; by excluding all duplicated articles, additional criteria were then applied: articles or abstracts in English and articles containing one of the following words: “death”, “died”, “comorbidity”, “cause of death”, “biopsy”, “autopsy”, or “pathological”. Results: A total of 50 articles met the inclusion criteria. However, only 7 of these studies reported autopsy-based data. Discussion: The analysis of the main data from the selected studies concerns the complete analysis of 12,954 patients, of whom 2269 died (with a mortality rate of 17.52%). Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection was obtained in all cases and comorbidities were fully reported in 46 studies. The most common comorbidities were: cardiovascular diseases (hypertension and coronary artery disease), metabolic disorders (diabetes, overweight, or obesity), respiratory disorders (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and cancer. The most common reported complications were: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury, cardiac injury, liver insufficiency, and septic shock. Only 7 papers reported histological investigations. Nevertheless, only two complete autopsies are described and the cause of death was listed as COVID-19 in only one of them. The lack of postmortem investigation did not allow a definition of the exact cause of death to determine the pathways of this infection. Based on the few histopathological findings reported in the analyzed studies, it seems to be a clear alteration of the coagulation system: frequently prothrombotic activity with consequent thromboembolism was described in COVID-19 patients. As a scientific community, we are called on to face this global threat, and to defeat it with all the available tools necessary. Despite the improvement and reinforcement of any method of study in every field of medicine and science, encouraging the autopsy practice as a tool of investigation could also therefore, help physicians to define an effective treatment to reduce mortality.","[{'authorId': '34192476', 'name': 'M.

Here we review the consequences of interacting with social network sites for subjective well-being—that is, how people feel moment-to-moment and how satisfied they are with their lives. We begin by clarifying the constructs that we focus on in this review: social network sites and subjective well-being. Next, we review the literature that explains how these constructs are related. This research reveals: (a) negative relationships between passively using social network sites and subjective well-being, and (b) positive relationships between actively using social network sites and subjective well-being, with the former relationship being more robust than the latter. Specifically, passively using social network sites provokes social comparisons and envy, which have negative downstream consequences for subjective well-being. In contrast, when active usage of social network sites predicts subjective well-being, it seems to do so by creating social capital and stimulating feelings of social connectedness.

87d82723cb5163ce30d01be1e9116c7df90e4769,"Despite decades of research with humans, the biological mechanisms that motivate an individual to help others remain poorly understood. In order to investigate the roots of pro-sociality in mammals, we established the helping behavior test, a paradigm in which rats are faced with a conspecific trapped in a restrainer that can only be opened from the outside. Over the course of repeated test sessions, rats exposed to a trapped cagemate learn to open the door to the restrainer, thereby helping the trapped rat to escape (Ben-Ami Bartal et al., 2011). The discovery of this natural behavior provides a unique opportunity to probe the motivation of rodent helping behavior, leading to a deeper understanding of biological influences on human pro-sociality. To determine if an affective response motivates door-opening, rats received midazolam, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic, and tested in the helping behavior test. Midazolam-treated rats showed less helping behavior than saline-treated rats or rats receiving no injection. Yet, midazolam-treated rats opened a restrainer containing chocolate, highlighting the socially specific effects of the anxiolytic. To determine if midazolam interferes with helping through a sympatholytic effect, the peripherally restricted beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist nadolol was administered; nadolol did not interfere with helping. The corticosterone response of rats exposed to a trapped cagemate was measured and compared to the rats’ subsequent helping behavior. Rats with the greatest corticosterone responses showed the least helping behavior and those with the smallest responses showed the most consistent helping at the shortest latency. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for the interaction between stress and pro-social behavior. Finally, we observed that door-opening appeared to be reinforcing. A novel analytical tool was designed to interrogate the pattern of door-opening for signs that a rat’s behavior on one session influenced his behavior on the next session. Results suggest that helping a trapped rat has a greater motivational value than does chocolate. In sum, this series of experiments clearly demonstrates the fundamental role of affect in motivating pro-social behavior in rodents and the need for a helper to resonate with the affect of a victim.","[{'authorId': '1404575700', 'name': 'Inbal Ben-Ami Bartal'}, {'authorId': '25243211', 'name': 'H.

As healthcare often is studied in relation to operational rather than socio-technical aspects of Lean such as teamwork, the purpose of this paper is to explore how a Swedish hospital Lean intervention was related to changes in teamwork over time.


DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH
Teamwork was measured with the Group Development Questionnaire (GDQ) employee survey during Lean implementation at three units, in 2010 (n = 133) and 2011 (n = 130). Qualitative data including interviews, observations and document analysis were used to characterize the Lean implementation and context. The expected teamwork change patterns were compared with GDQ data through linear regression analysis.


FINDINGS
At Ward-I, Lean implementation was successful and teamwork improved. At Ward-II, Lean was partially implemented and teamwork improved slightly, while both Lean and teamwork deteriorated at the emergency department (ED). The regression analysis was significant at ED (p = 0.02) and the Ward-II (p = 0.04), but not at Ward-I (p = 0.11).


RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS
Expected changes in teamwork informed by theory and qualitative data may make it possible to detect the results of a complex change.


PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS
Overall, Lean may have some impact on teamwork, if properly implemented. However, this impact may be more prominent in relation to structural and productivity issues of teamwork than group members' relational issues. Practitioners should note that, with groups struggling with initial stages of group functioning, Lean may be very challenging.


ORIGINALITY/VALUE
This study focussed specifically on implications of Lean for nurse teamwork in a hospital setting using both qualitative and quantitative data. Importantly, the group functioning at the time when Lean is initiated may affect the implementation of Lean.","[{'authorId': '4793018', 'name': 'Waqar Ulhassan'}, {'authorId': '6276237', 'name': 'H.

88a21f7a9520cab2885fc84f53ddc67238f92b9d,"The theory of embodied music cognition states that the perception and cognition of music is firmly, although not exclusively, linked to action patterns associated with that music. In this regard, the focus lies mostly on how music promotes certain action tendencies (i.e., dance, entrainment, etc.). Only recently, studies have started to devote attention to the reciprocal effects that people’s body movements may exert on how people perceive certain aspects of music and sound (e.g., pitch, meter, musical preference, etc.). The present study positions itself in this line of research. The central research question is whether expressive body movements, which are systematically paired with music, can modulate children’s perception of musical expressiveness. We present a behavioral experiment in which different groups of children (7–8 years, N = 46) either repetitively performed a happy or a sad choreography in response to expressively ambiguous music or merely listened to that music. The results of our study show indeed that children’s perception of musical expressiveness is modulated in accordance with the expressive character of the dance choreography performed to the music. This finding supports theories that claim a strong connection between action and perception, although further research is needed to uncover the details of this connection.","[{'authorId': '2809185', 'name': 'Pieter-Jan Maes'}, {'authorId': '1712585', 'name': 'M.

The attachment security of 15 children could be classified. Each of these children displayed disorganized attachment patterns, but almost half (40%) of them were subclassified as securely attached. To assess the validity of the attachment classifications, children and their mothers were observed in a separate interaction. Mothers of children who were subclassified as securely attached displayed greater sensitivity than mothers of children who were subclassified as insecurely attached. Children who were subclassified as securely attached more frequently initiated social interaction with their mothers than did children who were subclassified as insecurely attached. Children with secure and insecure subclassifications were compared to investigate correlations between attachment organization and representational ability and social-emotional understanding. Although children with underlying secure attachments were no more likely to initiate joint attention, they were more responsive to bids for joint attention, made requests more frequently, and demonstrated greater receptive language ability than children subclassified as insecurely attached. Discussion focuses on dynamics that may contribute to individual differences in the attachment organization of autistic children and on the reciprocal relationship between advances in our understanding of normal and pathological development.","[{'authorId': '12925623', 'name': 'Lisa Capps'}, {'authorId': '152510948', 'name': 'M.

This result could be due to the difficulty of autistic children in establishing reciprocal gaze behaviour with human partners. Furthermore, the presence of a contagious effect in autistic children could change according their degree of functioning. We evaluated the contagious effect of yawning in both autistic children with different degrees of functioning and in typically developing children exposed to the viewing and hearing of others yawn. Furthermore the frequency and the daily distribution of spontaneous yawning were evaluated and compared among three groups. Autism Spectrum Disorder can selectively affect some behaviour. In autistic children the contagious effect of yawning is largely impaired, whereas the spontaneous production and daily distribution are not. These results support the hypothesis of a link between contagious yawning and social abilities and the existence of different processes underlying spontaneous and contagious yawning.","[{'authorId': '4489410', 'name': 'F.

Increased phosphorylation of eIF2α has been described in peripheral neurons from neuropathic and diabetic rats. However, the role of eIF2α phosphorylation in pain has not been reported. Here we show that phosphorylation of eIF2α controls thermal, but not mechanical, sensation via modulation of the activity of a major heat transducer, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1. We also find that chronic inflammation-induced eIF2α phopshorylation contributes to inflammation-induced thermal hypersensitivity. These results demonstrate that eIF2α phosphorylation plays a major role in controlling noxious heat sensitivity. A response to environmental stress is critical to alleviate cellular injury and maintain cellular homeostasis. Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) is a key integrator of cellular stress responses and an important regulator of mRNA translation. Diverse stress signals lead to the phosphorylation of the α subunit of eIF2 (Ser51), resulting in inhibition of global protein synthesis while promoting expression of proteins that mediate cell adaptation to stress. Here we report that eIF2α is instrumental in the control of noxious heat sensation. Mice with decreased eIF2α phosphorylation (eIF2α+/S51A) exhibit reduced responses to noxious heat. Pharmacological attenuation of eIF2α phosphorylation decreases thermal, but not mechanical, pain sensitivity, whereas increasing eIF2α phosphorylation has the opposite effect on thermal nociception. The impact of eIF2α phosphorylation (p-eIF2α) on thermal thresholds is dependent on the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1. Moreover, we show that induction of eIF2α phosphorylation in primary sensory neurons in a chronic inflammation pain model contributes to thermal hypersensitivity. Our results demonstrate that the cellular stress response pathway, mediated via p-eIF2α, represents a mechanism that could be used to alleviate pathological heat sensation.","[{'authorId': '5757262', 'name': 'A.

In the first experiment, emotional contagion occurred among ""receivers"" who ""caught"" a happy emotion from ""senders"" whom the receivers liked. The relationship between the emotion experienced by senders and receivers was found to be mediated by receivers mimicking smiling on the part of senders. Exposing receivers to happy senders they liked also resulted in receivers having a positive attitudinal bias toward a product. The happiness experienced by receivers via contagion was found to mediate the effects of sender emotion and receiver liking of the sender on receiver product attitudes. The second experiment replicated the first while demonstrating that observation of the facial expressions of senders by receivers, thus allowing mimicking of smiling, was a necessary condition for emotional contagion to occur. The relevance of emotional contagion for understanding consumer behavior across various substantive domains is discussed.

While new strategies and tools for obtaining health data have expanded researchers' abilities to design and test personalized and adaptive health interventions, the deployment of pervasive sensing and computational techniques to gather research data is raising ethical challenges for Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) charged with protecting research participants. To explore experiences with, and perceptions about, technology-enabled research, and identify solutions for promoting responsible conduct of this research we conducted focus groups with human research protection program and IRB affiliates. Our findings outline the need for increased collaboration across stakeholders in terms of: (1) shared and dynamic resources that improve awareness of technologies and decrease potential threats to participant privacy and data confidentiality, and (2) development of appropriate and dynamic standards through collaboration with stakeholders in the research ethics community.","[{'authorId': '4317796', 'name': 'Camille Nebeker'}, {'authorId': '39453188', 'name': 'J.

89235a6c86806027d041dd19b7f472eeeb7465b3,"Background Web 2.0 has improved interactions among peers on the Internet, especially for the many online patient communities that have emerged over the past decades. Online communities are said to be particularly beneficial peer support resources for patients with breast cancer. However, most studies of online patient communities have focused on those members who post actively (posters), even though there are many members who participate without posting (lurkers). In addition, little attention has been paid to the usage of online communities among non-English-speaking patients. Objective The present study explored the differences in peer support received by lurkers and posters in online breast cancer communities. It also examined the effects of such support on both groups’ mental health. Methods We conducted an exploratory, descriptive, cross-sectional, Web-based survey among members of four Japanese online breast cancer communities. In an online questionnaire, we asked questions regarding sociodemographics, disease-related characteristics, mental health, participation in online communities, and peer support received from those communities. Results Of the 465 people who accessed the questionnaire, 253 completed it. Of the respondents, 113/220 (51.4%) were lurkers. There was no significant difference between lurkers and posters with regard to sociodemographic variables. About half of the posters had been given a diagnosis of breast cancer less than a year previously, which was a significantly shorter period than that of the lurkers (P = .02). The 5 support functions extracted by factor analysis were the same for both posters and lurkers. These were emotional support/helper therapy, emotional expression, conflict, advice, and insight/universality. When the support scores were calculated, insight/universality scored highest for both posters and lurkers, with scores that were not significantly different between the two groups. Among the 5 support scores, emotional support/helper therapy and emotional expression were significantly higher among posters. For posters, emotional support/helper therapy and advice were negatively correlated with the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Emotional expression, advice, and insight/universality were negatively correlated with the anxiety subscale for lurkers. Conclusion We found that posters felt they received more benefits from online communities than lurkers did, including emotional support, helping other patients, and expressing their emotions. Yet even lurkers were found to gain a certain amount of peer support through online communities, especially with regard to advice and insight/universality. The results demonstrate that participation in online communities—even as a lurker—may be beneficial to breast cancer patients’ mental health.","[{'authorId': '2768980', 'name': 'Yoko Setoyama'}, {'authorId': '47959264', 'name': 'Y.

89bb3f984cdaee33d96bf98187cad38a583d0147,"The study of crowd movement has recently become a popular research topic due to the increasing frequency of public safety issues. Compared with human evacuation experiments and drills, which may have personal safety risks and require a large number of volunteers, a simple and convenient computer simulation has become the mainstream research method. The computer simulation first needs to characterize small groups in the crowd to model the motion state of crowds for more accurate crowd modeling. In this paper, a top–bottom hierarchical clustering algorithm based on off-line crowd trajectories is proposed to provide small group information for crowd motion simulation. First, an unmanned aerial vehicle and a tracking technology are used to capture the pedestrian flow and extract the pedestrian trajectory. Second, a top–bottom hierarchical clustering strategy is proposed to divide the crowd into groups, which solves the problem of the difficulty of ascertaining small groups. This method solves the problem of automatically determining cluster centers by using the improved density peak clustering algorithm combined with a greedy algorithm. One factor of distinguishing small groups is improved by replacing the angle of the direction of motion with the distance difference, thus reducing the computational complexity. Specifically, the mean distance between trajectories based on the Euclidean distance is used for the top-level coarse-grained clustering; then, the improved Hausdorff mean distance is determined in the bottom-level fine-grained clustering. Third, the proposed algorithm is validated by classifying the groups of pedestrians in real videos. The experiments show that the proposed method is applicable and effective.","[{'authorId': '152998599', 'name': 'Yan Li'}, {'authorId': '2118903809', 'name': 'Hong Liu'}, {'authorId': '4243457', 'name': 'Xiangwei Zheng'}, {'authorId': '2658163', 'name': 'Yanbin Han'}, {'authorId': '2154884052', 'name': 'Liang Li'}]",12.0,,57.0,A Top–Bottom Clustering Algorithm Based on Crowd Trajectories for Small Group Classification,2019.0
89d4461dee981d003ca56a2279c55a866a0c611c,"Antagonistic crowd behaviors are often observed in cases of serious conflict. Antagonistic emotions, which is the typical psychological state of agents in different roles (i.e., cops, activists, and civilians) in crowd violence scenes, and the way they spread through contagion in a crowd are important causes of crowd antagonistic behaviors. Moreover, games, which refers to the interaction between opposing groups adopting different strategies to obtain higher benefits and less casualties, determine the level of crowd violence. We present an antagonistic crowd simulation model (ACSEE), which is integrated with antagonistic emotional contagion and evolutionary game theories. Our approach models the antagonistic emotions between agents in different roles using two components: mental emotion and external emotion. We combine enhanced susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) and game approaches to evaluate the role of antagonistic emotional contagion in crowd violence. Our evolutionary game theoretic approach incorporates antagonistic emotional contagion through deterrent force, which is modelled by a mixture of emotional forces and physical forces defeating the opponents. Antagonistic emotional contagion and evolutionary game theories influence each other to determine antagonistic crowd behaviors. We evaluate our approach on real-world scenarios consisting of different kinds of agents. We also compare the simulated crowd behaviors with real-world crowd videos and use our approach to predict the trends of crowd movements in violence incidents. We investigate the impact of various factors (number of agents, emotion, strategy, etc.) on the outcome of crowd violence. We present results from user studies suggesting that our model can simulate antagonistic crowd behaviors similar to those seen in real-world scenarios.","[{'authorId': '7431398', 'name': 'Chaochao Li'}, {'authorId': '144470801', 'name': 'Pei Lv'}, {'authorId': '1699159', 'name': 'Dinesh Manocha'}, {'authorId': '2113254290', 'name': 'Hua Wang'}, {'authorId': '2110450498', 'name': 'Yafei Li'}, {'authorId': '2118869098', 'name': 'Bing Zhou'}, {'authorId': '2285442', 'name': 'Mingliang Xu'}]",26.0,"{'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing', 'pages': '729-745', 'volume': '13'}",99.0,ACSEE: Antagonistic Crowd Simulation Model With Emotional Contagion and Evolutionary Game Theory,2019.0

The data on traumatic stress were posited from a certain cognitive-behavioural viewpoint, with particular emotional components based almost in their entirety on western, mostly white individuals seeking treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder, and focusing on that time frame. As such, mechanisms such as fear and emotional conditioning theory and the ways traumas are encoded in memory only partially explain trauma response. Conservation of resources theory posits that severe trauma responses occur when personal, social or material resources, which are key to the self, survival and social attachments, are lost severely and rapidly. These resources tend to aggregate or fail to aggregate in what conservation of resources theory terms ‘resource caravans’; they do not exist in isolation. Because resource caravans are created and sustained within the environmental and social context of resource caravan passageways, environmental context is fundamental to trauma response. It is argued that resource loss and the maintaining of resource caravans are the best predictors of trauma response, both in terms of posttraumatic stress disorder and in terms of the idioms of trauma distress across cultures.","[{'authorId': '3475315', 'name': 'S.

Considering the geographical proximity and political ties between Hong Kong and Mainland China, the share of inbound tourists to Hong Kong has been, and will continuously be, largely occupied by Mainland Chinese tourists on an uprising basis. The phenomenon of the “Chinese tourists' wave”, operationalizing as the influx of tourists from Mainland China, has brought tremendous change on Hong Kong's tourism industry, economy and local community. It is, thus, of necessity to understand the perceptions and response toward this phenomenon from local residents' perspective as they are the stakeholders of local tourism. Drawing on the findings from three focus group interviews with 18 Hong Kong residents, three conventional dimensions, namely “Economic”, “Social-cultural” and “Environmental” were identified and discussed to demonstrate the local residents' perceptions toward the impact of “Chinese tourists' wave” phenomenon. Generally, residents tend to recognize the positive economic impacts as well as negative social–cultural and environmental impacts generated from this tourism phenomenon.

Animal models indicate that this process is neurally underpinned by a shift in ventral–dorsal striatal control of behavior; however, this shift has not been directly examined in humans. The present resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study employed a two‐step approach to: (a) precisely map striatal alterations using a novel, data‐driven network classification strategy combining intrinsic connectivity contrast with multivoxel pattern analysis and, (b) to determine whether a ventral to dorsal striatal shift in connectivity with reward and regulatory control regions can be observed in abstinent (28 days) male cannabis‐dependent individuals (n = 24) relative to matched controls (n = 28). Network classification revealed that the groups can be reliably discriminated by global connectivity profiles of two striatal regions that mapped onto the ventral (nucleus accumbens) and dorsal striatum (caudate). Subsequent functional connectivity analysis demonstrated a relative shift between ventral and dorsal striatal communication with fronto‐limbic regions that have been consistently involved in reward processing (rostral anterior cingulate cortex [ACC]) and executive/regulatory functions (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex [PFC]). Specifically, in the cannabis‐dependent subjects, connectivity between the ventral striatum with the rostral ACC increased, whereas both striatal regions were uncoupled from the regulatory dorsomedial PFC. Together, these findings suggest a shift in the balance between dorsal and ventral striatal control in cannabis dependence. Similar changes have been observed in animal models and may promote the loss of control central to addictive behavior.","[{'authorId': '46468612', 'name': 'F.

In Experiment 3, spontaneous vocal affect was measured as participants described the emotions of an ingroup or outgroup sports team fan.

The predominant focus of reform has been on content, pedagogy, technology and assessment, with little attention to instructor characteristics. However, there is strong theoretical and empirical evidence that instructors' attitudes impact the quality of teaching and learning. The objective of this study was to develop and initially validate a scale to measure instructors' attitudes toward reform-oriented (or concept-based) teaching of introductory statistics in the health and behavioral sciences, at the tertiary level. This scale will be referred to as FATS (Faculty Attitudes Toward Statistics). Data were obtained from 227 instructors (USA and international), and analyzed using factor analysis, multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis. The overall scale consists of five sub-scales with a total of 25 items, and an overall alpha of 0.89. Construct validity was established. Specifically, the overall scale, and subscales (except perceived difficulty) plausibly differentiated between low-reform and high-reform practice instructors. Statistically significant differences in attitude were observed with respect to age, but not gender, employment status, membership status in professional organizations, ethnicity, highest academic qualification, and degree concentration. This scale can be considered a reliable and valid measure of instructors' attitudes toward reform-oriented (concept-based or constructivist) teaching of introductory statistics in the health and behavioral sciences at the tertiary level.

Background Violence against nurses is a common problem that persists worldwide. Design This was a descriptive cross‐sectional study. Methods An online questionnaire form and the Nursing Professional Commitment Scale were used to collect the data. The study was carried out online during the COVID‐19 pandemic between October–December 2020. A total of 263 nurses agreed to participate in the study. The STROBE checklist was followed for observational studies. Results During the COVID‐19 pandemic, 8.4% of the nurses stated that they were exposed to physical violence, 57.8% to verbal violence, 0.8% to sexual violence and 61.6% to mobbing. 52.1% of the nurses stated that they thought of quitting the profession during the COVID‐19 pandemic. The mean total Nursing Professional Commitment Scale score was 71.33 ± 15.05. Conclusions This study revealed that nurses' exposure to physical, verbal and sexual violence during the COVID‐19 pandemic decreased compared to before the pandemic. Nurses' exposure to mobbing during the pandemic was found to increase. A statistically significant difference was found between the status of the nurses' exposure to physical violence, verbal violence, and mobbing, working hours, number of patients given care, and their thoughts of quitting the profession. It was found that the status of exposure to physical violence, thinking of quitting the profession and working hours decreased professional commitment. Relevance to clinical practice In the light of these results, it is recommended that measures to prevent violence should be addressed in a multifaceted way. In managing the pandemic process, the decisions and practices should not be left to the managers' initiative to prevent mobbing. Initiatives that will increase nurses' professional commitment during the pandemic process should be planned and implemented.","[{'authorId': '41068150', 'name': 'Sultan Özkan Şat'}, {'authorId': '116433314', 'name': 'P.

Some researchers consider most social media communications as public, and posts from networks such as Twitter are routinely harvested and published without anonymization and without direct consent from users. In this chapter, we argue that researchers must move beyond the permissions granted by ‘legal’ accounts of the use of these new forms of data (e.g., Terms and Conditions) to a more nuanced and reflexive ethical approach that puts user expectations, safety, and privacy rights center stage. Through two projects, we present qualitative and quantitative data that illustrate social media users’ views on the use of their data by researchers. Over four in five report expecting to be asked for their consent and nine in ten expect anonymity ahead of publication of their Twitter posts. Given the unique nature of this online public environment and what we know about users’ views pertaining to informed consent, anonymity, and harm, we conclude researchers seeking to embark on social media research should conduct a risk assessment to determine likely privacy infringement and potential user harm from publishing user content.","[{'authorId': '2116741885', 'name': 'M.

Drawing on emotional contagion and emotional labor theories, they investigate the influence of the extent of service employees' display of positive emotions and the authenticity of their emotional labor display on customers' emotional states and, subsequently, on customers' assessments of the service interaction and their relationship with the service provider. To test the study hypotheses, 223 consumers participated in a simulated service encounter in which actors played the roles of service employees. In a 2 × 2 factorial design, the employees varied both the extent of their smiling behavior and their emotional labor display by engaging in surface or deep acting.

8b373bf6c032eebbffd408d941af8e690bfc3291,"Critical thresholds represent one of the most important diffusion indicators of epidemic outbreaks. However, we believe that recent studies have overemphasized ways that the power-law connectivity distribution features of social networks affect epidemic dynamics and critical thresholds. As a result, two important factors have been overlooked: resource limitations and transmission costs associated with social interactions and daily contact. Here we present our results from the simultaneous application of mean-field theory and an agent-based network simulation approach for analyzing the effects of resources and costs on epidemic dynamics and critical thresholds. Our main findings are: (a) a significant critical threshold does exist when resources and costs are taken into consideration, and it has a lower bound whenever contagion events occur in scale-free networks; (b) when transmission costs increase or individual resources decrease, critical contagion thresholds in scale-free networks grow linearly and steady density curves shrink linearly; (c) regardless of whether the resources of individuals obey delta, uniform, or normal distributions, they have the same critical thresholds and epidemic dynamics as long as the average value of usable resources remains the same across different scale-free networks; and (d) the spread of epidemics in scale-free networks remains controllable as long as resources are properly restricted and intervention strategy investments are significantly increased.","[{'authorId': '3162443', 'name': 'Chung-Yuan Huang'}, {'authorId': '2879735', 'name': 'Yu-Shiuan Tsai'}, {'authorId': '2216207827', 'name': 'Chuen-Tsai Sun'}, {'authorId': '39803427', 'name': 'J.

8c6b883514e51113bca42d7164b0521b5bb7cf86,"Sensor-based discovery (i.e. dynamic) path planning is problematic because the path needs to be continually recomputed as new information is discovered. A process-based client-server approach is presented that permits concurrent sensor-based map and localization-correction updates as well as concurrent path computation and execution. A potential function is created by solving Laplace's equation (i.e. a harmonic function) using an iteration kernal convolved with an occupancy-grid representation of the current free space. The path produced (i.e. by steepest gradient descent on the harmonic function) is optimal in the sense of globally minimizing the distance to the goal as well as locally minimizing a hitting probability. This helps alleviate the influence of uncertainty on path planning. On a regular grid, the computation of the harmonic function is linear in the total number of grid elements, thus constraining this planner to be local. A global planner-provided that an a priori CAD map of the fixed objects exists-provides information to the local planner about the effects of a global goal. An algorithm for the three typical local scenarios found in indoor office-like environments is presented showing how a global goal is projected into the local context for each case. Since objects are sensed on-the-fly it is possible to discover that passage through a hallway or room may be blocked. A zero gradient vector in the local potential function is used to signal a blocked passage and subsequently initiate global replanning. The technique has been used to control a Nomadics 200 robot.","[{'authorId': '1702003', 'name': 'J. Zelek'}, {'authorId': '3631473', 'name': 'M.

We then examined how factors related to viewer, streamer, and viewer-streamer interaction were associated with three forms of social support provision: emotional, instrumental, and financial support. Our main findings are: parasocial relationship was consistently correlated with all three types of social support, while social presence was only related with instrumental and financial support; interpersonal attractiveness was associated with emotional and instrumental support and lonely people were more likely to give instrumental support.

Persistent pain is measured by means of self-report, the sole reliance on which hampers diagnosis and treatment. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) holds promise for identifying objective measures of pain, but brain measures that are sensitive and specific to physical pain have not yet been identified.


METHODS
In four studies involving a total of 114 participants, we developed an fMRI-based measure that predicts pain intensity at the level of the individual person. In study 1, we used machine-learning analyses to identify a pattern of fMRI activity across brain regions--a neurologic signature--that was associated with heat-induced pain. The pattern included the thalamus, the posterior and anterior insulae, the secondary somatosensory cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the periaqueductal gray matter, and other regions. In study 2, we tested the sensitivity and specificity of the signature to pain versus warmth in a new sample. In study 3, we assessed specificity relative to social pain, which activates many of the same brain regions as physical pain. In study 4, we assessed the responsiveness of the measure to the analgesic agent remifentanil.


RESULTS
In study 1, the neurologic signature showed sensitivity and specificity of 94% or more (95% confidence interval [CI], 89 to 98) in discriminating painful heat from nonpainful warmth, pain anticipation, and pain recall. In study 2, the signature discriminated between painful heat and nonpainful warmth with 93% sensitivity and specificity (95% CI, 84 to 100). In study 3, it discriminated between physical pain and social pain with 85% sensitivity (95% CI, 76 to 94) and 73% specificity (95% CI, 61 to 84) and with 95% sensitivity and specificity in a forced-choice test of which of two conditions was more painful. In study 4, the strength of the signature response was substantially reduced when remifentanil was administered.


CONCLUSIONS
It is possible to use fMRI to assess pain elicited by noxious heat in healthy persons. Future studies are needed to assess whether the signature predicts clinical pain.

Thanks to the increasing adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHR), rich patient information is being collected over time. Using EHR data as input, we propose a multivariate context-sensitive Hawkes process or cHawkes, which simultaneously infers the disease relationship network and models temporal progression of patients. Besides learning disease network and temporal progression model, cHawkes is able to predict when a specific patient might have other related diseases in future given the patient history, which in turn can have many potential applications in predictive health analytics, public health policy development and customized patient care. Extensive experiments on real EHR data demonstrate that cHawkes not only can uncover meaningful disease relations and model accurate temporal progression of patients, but also has significantly better predictive performance compared to several baseline models.","[{'authorId': '3242613', 'name': 'E.

Based on theories of emotion transmission between interaction partners, we propose a reciprocal effects model linking teachers’ and students’ enjoyment in class. The model suggests that there are positive reciprocal links between teachers’ and students’ enjoyment and that these links are mediated by teachers’ and students’ observations of each other’s classroom behaviors. The model was tested using 3-wave longitudinal data collected across the 1st 6 months of a school year from N = 69 teachers (78% female) and their 1,643 students from Grades 5 to 10 (57% female). A multilevel structural equation model confirmed our mediation hypotheses. Teacher enjoyment at the beginning of the school year (Time 1 [T1]) was positively related to student perceptions of teachers’ enthusiasm during teaching 4 weeks later (T2), which was positively related to student enjoyment at midterm (T3). Further, student enjoyment at T1 was positively related to teacher perceptions of their students’ engagement in class at T2, which was positively related to teacher enjoyment at T3. This study is the first to provide longitudinal evidence of reciprocal emotion transmission between teachers and students. Implications for future research and teacher training are discussed.","[{'authorId': '15597959', 'name': 'A.

Yet findings on embodied cognition in other domains suggest that the influence might also work in the opposite direction: Real or imagined body movements during music listening may codetermine music preferences. We had participants listen to music and concurrently activate muscles whose innervation has been shown to be associated with ""positive"" and ""negative"" affect (activation vs. inhibition of smiling muscles, vertical vs. horizontal head movements, and arm flexion vs. arm extension). Activation of the positively associated muscle groups led to higher preference ratings for the music pieces than activation of the negatively associated ones. A first exploration of candidate explanations for the effect suggests that it is most likely due to conditioning processes. It is concluded that body movements, both real and imagined, may play an important role in the development of music preferences.","[{'authorId': '3203620', 'name': 'P.

In a large-scale evacuation action, there are complicated interactions between people and the disaster environment, and it is very difficult to present such interactions in quantitative functions or specific values. In this paper, a qualitatively simulated approach to model and study the panic spread is proposed. First, the internal structure of the evacuation system is described and various internal and external phenomena related to the change of evacuees’ behaviors in the evacuation process are qualitatively interpreted. Based on the qualitative knowledge, a qualitative simulation model of a large-scale evacuation system is established. The calculation results of inverse group matrix verify the rationality and stability of our model. According to the implementation of a series of scenarios with different input, some uncertainty factors that can affect the panic spread in the evacuation process are analyzed, in which the spread of disaster, the rescue guidance, and the normal emotional evacuees are mainly considered. This model reproduces a well-known phenomenon in crowd evacuation, namely “fast is slow”, and confirms that the severity of disaster exponentially positively correlates with the panic spread, and the effectiveness of rescue guidance is influenced by the leading emotion in the crowds as a whole.","[{'authorId': '1957751', 'name': 'Jinghong Wang'}, {'authorId': '47321711', 'name': 'S.

Using video vignettes of customers complaining about a service failure as stimulus material, the authors measured the facial displays and affective states of service providers as proxies for emotional contagion. Following a two-step approach, service providers' facial expressions were first recorded and assessed, revealing that service providers' facial displays matched those of the angry consumer. Second, a mixed ANOVA revealed service providers reported stronger negative affective states after exposure to an angry complaint than prior to exposure. The results demonstrated that during a complaint situation, angry outbursts by consumers can initiate the emotional contagion process, and service providers are susceptible to “catch” consumer anger through emotional contagion.

Empathy involves not only the affective experience of the other person's actual or inferred emotional state but also some minimal recognition and understanding of another's emotional state. In light of multiple levels of analysis ranging from developmental psychology, social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and clinical neuropsychology, this article proposes a model of empathy that involves parallel and distributed processing in a number of dissociable computational mechanisms.

Our stereological counts of VENs in FI and LA show them to be more numerous in humans than in apes. In humans, small numbers of VENs appear the 36th week postconception, with numbers increasing during the first 8 months after birth. There are significantly more VENs in the right hemisphere in postnatal brains; this may be related to asymmetries in the autonomic nervous system. VENs are also present in elephants and whales and may be a specialization related to very large brain size. The large size and simple dendritic structure of these projection neurons suggest that they rapidly send basic information from FI and LA to other parts of the brain, while slower neighboring pyramids send more detailed information. Selective destruction of VENs in early stages of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) implies that they are involved in empathy, social awareness, and self‐control, consistent with evidence from functional imaging.","[{'authorId': '2100520', 'name': 'J.

According to embodied simulation theories understanding emotions of others is fostered by involuntarily mimicking the perceived expressions, causing a “reactivation” of the corresponding mental state. Some studies suggest automatic facial mimicry during expression viewing; however, findings on the relationship between mimicry and emotion perception abilities are equivocal. The present study investigated individual differences in emotion perception and its relationship to facial muscle responses - recorded with electromyogram (EMG) - in response to emotional facial expressions. N° = °269 participants completed multiple tasks measuring face and emotion perception. EMG recordings were taken from a subsample (N° = °110) in an independent emotion classification task of short videos displaying six emotions. Confirmatory factor analyses of the m. corrugator supercilii in response to angry, happy, sad, and neutral expressions showed that individual differences in corrugator activity can be separated into a general response to all faces and an emotion-related response. Structural equation modeling revealed a substantial relationship between the emotion-related response and emotion perception ability, providing evidence for the role of facial muscle activation in emotion perception from an individual differences perspective.","[{'authorId': '5005238', 'name': 'Janina Künecke'}, {'authorId': '38376298', 'name': 'A.

8e8349de58bbb8a544c58d5536347c2d28d16ce8,"Local collision avoidance algorithms in crowd simulation often ignore agents beyond a neighborhood of a certain size. This cutoff can result in sharp changes in trajectory when large groups of agents enter or exit these neighborhoods. In this work, we exploit the insight that exact collision avoidance is not necessary between agents at such large distances, and propose a novel algorithm for extending existing collision avoidance algorithms to perform approximate, long-range collision avoidance. Our formulation performs long-range collision avoidance for distant agent groups to efficiently compute trajectories that are smoother than those obtained with state-of-the-art techniques and at faster rates. Comparison to real-world data demonstrates that crowds simulated with our algorithm exhibit an improved speed sensitivity to density similar to human crowds. Another issue often sidestepped in existing work is that discrete and continuum collision avoidance algorithms have different regions of applicability. For example, low-density crowds cannot be modeled as a continuum, while high-density crowds can be expensive to model using discrete methods. We formulate a hybrid technique for crowd simulation which can accurately and efficiently simulate crowds at any density with seamless transitions between continuum and discrete representations. Our approach blends results from continuum and discrete algorithms, based on local density and velocity variance. In addition to being robust across a variety of group scenarios, it is also highly efficient, running at interactive rates for thousands of agents on portable systems.","[{'authorId': '10153422', 'name': 'Abhinav Golas'}, {'authorId': '40319117', 'name': 'Rahul Narain'}, {'authorId': '144564863', 'name': 'Sean Curtis'}, {'authorId': '144247566', 'name': 'M.

We alternatively propose a contextual view of emotional mimicry, which states that emotional mimicry depends on the social context: we only mimic emotional signals that are interpreted to promote affiliation goals and not necessarily what we see. As a further consequence, we are less likely to mimic strangers and we do not mimic people we do not like nor emotions that signal antagonism.","[{'authorId': '3067657', 'name': 'U.

In crowds, in spite of the complexity of the environment made of numerous obstacles, humans demonstrate remarkable capacities in avoiding collisions. Cognitive science work on human locomotion states that relatively succinct information is extracted from the optic flow to achieve safe locomotion. In this paper, we explore a novel vision-based approach of collision avoidance between walkers that fits the requirements of interactive crowd simulation. By simulating humans based on cognitive science results, we detect future collisions as well as the level of danger from visual stimuli. The motor-response is twofold: a reorientation strategy prevents future collision, whereas a deceleration strategy prevents imminent collisions. Several examples of our simulation results show that the emergence of self-organized patterns of walkers is reinforced using our approach. The emergent phenomena are visually appealing. More importantly, they improve the overall efficiency of the walkers' traffic and avoid improbable locking situations.","[{'authorId': '2050262', 'name': 'Jan Ondřej'}, {'authorId': '2235773', 'name': 'J.

Audience members (N = 105) were surveyed at three concerts by a ‘pro-am’ orchestra – an orchestra made up of both professionals and amateurs – about their response to the concerts and factors that influenced that response. It was found that emotional contagion can enhance the emotional response of audience members at concerts, and that this is mediated by the sense of social bonding participants have with other people present.

Although research indicates that the job insecurity construct has cognitive (i.e., the perceived negative change to one’s job) and affective (i.e., the emotional reactions to the potential change to one’s job) components, scholars rarely apply this distinction between cognitive and affective job insecurity in their conceptualization and theory development. On the basis of 535 independent samples, a meta-analysis in Study 1 found that (1) job insecurity was significantly related to 51 out of 56 outcomes and correlates; (2) affective job insecurity had stronger relations with the majority of outcomes and correlates than did cognitive job insecurity as well as explained valid, unique variance in outcomes and correlates above and beyond cognitive job insecurity; and (3) in most cases, affective job insecurity mediated the relationships between cognitive job insecurity and its outcomes. Furthermore, Study 2 examines a moderator that may explain why individuals with the same level of cognitive job insecurity may display different levels of affective job insecurity. Specifically, we found a stronger relationship between cognitive job insecurity and affective job insecurity among individuals with high work centrality with two samples. Overall, results demonstrate that it is empirically meaningful to treat cognitive job insecurity and affective job insecurity as two separate constructs and that affective job insecurity is more closely related to employee outcomes than is cognitive job insecurity. Future research could further assess affective job insecurity and continue to explore moderators and mediators in the cognitive job insecurity–affective job insecurity relationship.","[{'authorId': '1737158', 'name': 'Lixin Jiang'}, {'authorId': '6050544', 'name': 'L.

Results showed that Hong Kong residents perceive Mainland Chinese tourists very positively due to their important role in Hong Kong’s economic development. However, it is undeniable that their negative and dissatisfactory attitudes are also very apparent. Based on the findings, Hong Kong residents can be defined as “ambivalent supporters,” and the negative impact of this attitude on tourism development in Hong Kong is becoming very influential. In the long run, how to change local residents from “ambivalent supporters to “ardent supporters” needs to be addressed in order to ensure the healthy development of Hong Kong inbound tourism.","[{'authorId': '121194486', 'name': 'Huawen Shen'}, {'authorId': '145363996', 'name': 'J.

The line managers from these work units rated the implemented empowerment-focused HR practices in, and the relative labour productivity of, their work unit.

In addition, job demands negatively mediate the influence of labour productivity on work engagement.

90b1a735ca7c31ddee3c18ca2d92be6adaffaa2b,"INTRODUCTION
Because of their circulation through the blood, the multiplicity of receptor sites, and the diversity of functions, opioids may most accurately be designated as a hormone. Opioids modulate the intensity of pain. In mammals, the opioid system has been modified to modulate social interactions as well (Panksepp and Watt, 2011).


METHODS
Over 10,000 patient encounters were observed on a neuropsychoanalytic addiction medicine service. Cold pressor times (CPT) were recorded before and after stimulation of the opioid system with low-dose naltrexone (LDN) for patients after opioid detoxification and for fibromyalgia patients.


RESULTS
Patients maintained on opioids relate autistically. The cold, unrelated nature of their human interactions was reversed by detoxification from opioids. Fibromyalgia patients have difficulty participating in human relationships, as if they lack an ability to respond interpersonally, as do post-detoxification patients. LDN improved pain tolerance as shown by a significant increase on CPT for post detoxification patients from 16 seconds to 55 seconds and in fibromyalgia patients from 21 seconds to 42 seconds, and improved relatedness. The correlation of opioid prescribing increasing over time and autism prevalence increasing over time is highly significant.


CONCLUSIONS
1. Opioid-maintained patients relate autistically. 2. Autism is a hyperopioidergic disorder. 3. Fibromylagia is a hypoopioidergic disorder. 4. Low opioid tone caused by opioid maintenance or fibromyalgia can usually be reversed with low-dose naltrexone. 5. The increase in the incidence of autism may have been caused by the increase in use of opioids for analgesia during childbirth.","[{'authorId': '46853130', 'name': 'Brian Johnson'}, {'authorId': '15052111', 'name': 'Scott F Ulberg'}, {'authorId': '13606373', 'name': 'Swati Shivale'}, {'authorId': '2062162686', 'name': 'J.

Prior research examining the link between individual differences in attachment avoidance and anxiety and emotional connectedness in couples has interestingly shown counter-intuitive effects of individual attachment styles on couples’ shared emotions, such that attachment anxiety was associated with the lowest levels of emotional synchrony (Butner, Diamond, & Hicks, 2007). These results beg for additional research on whether and how individual differences in attachment styles moderate the transmission of emotion between partners. Using daily diaries and second-by-second measures of emotional experience from 30 couples, it was hypothesised that couples high in attachment avoidance (disengagement) would show lower levels, whereas couples high in attachment anxiety (hypervigilance) would show higher levels of emotion transmission. Results were counter to our predictions; attachment avoidance increased — and attachment anxiety decreased — emotion transmission between partners. Findings suggest attachment dynamics may not have the same effect on couples’ joint emotional functioning in a dyadic context as they do on individuals’ emotional functioning.","[{'authorId': '2968287', 'name': 'A.

Emotional responses were superior predictors of cognitive learning and state motivation compared to instructor communication.

There are emotional, cognitive, and conditioning views, applying in varying degrees across species. An adequate description of the ultimate and proximate mechanism can integrate these views. Proximately, the perception of an object's state activates the subject's corresponding representations, which in turn activate somatic and autonomic responses. This mechanism supports basic behaviors (e.g., alarm, social facilitation, vicariousness of emotions, mother-infant responsiveness, and the modeling of competitors and predators) that are crucial for the reproductive success of animals living in groups. The Perception-Action Model (PAM), together with an understanding of how representations change with experience, can explain the major empirical effects in the literature (similarity, familiarity, past experience, explicit teaching, and salience). It can also predict a variety of empathy disorders. The interaction between the PAM and prefrontal functioning can also explain different levels of empathy across species and age groups. This view can advance our evolutionary understanding of empathy beyond inclusive fitness and reciprocal altruism and can explain different levels of empathy across individuals, species, stages of development, and situations.","[{'authorId': '5011255', 'name': 'S.

916940bdf5ffdfb52df372771b5ab95ca1cce2a0,"Abstract Emotional contagion, the emotional state‐matching of an individual with another, seems to be crucial for many social species. In recent years evidence on emotional contagion in different animal species has accumulated. However, despite its adaptative advantages and its presumed simplicity, the study and direct demonstration of this phenomenon present more complexities than previously thought. For these reasons, a review of the literature on emotional contagion in nonhuman species is timely to integrate current findings. In this paper thus, we carry out a comprehensive review of the most relevant studies on emotional contagion in animals and discuss the main problems and challenges of the field. We conclude that more research is needed to broaden our understanding of the mechanisms and functions of emotional contagion and the extent to which this process is present in a wide variety of species. Furthermore, the comparative study of emotional contagion would benefit from the use of systematized paradigms including both behavioral and physiological measures and the simultaneous recording of the responses of the interacting individuals to reliably assess an emotional state‐matching between them and reliable controls.

Observational data suggest that a wide variety of behaviors may spread in human social networks, but subjects in such studies can choose to befriend people with similar behaviors, posing difficulty for causal inference. Here, we exploit a seminal set of laboratory experiments that originally showed that voluntary costly punishment can help sustain cooperation. In these experiments, subjects were randomly assigned to a sequence of different groups to play a series of single-shot public goods games with strangers; this feature allowed us to draw networks of interactions to explore how cooperative and uncooperative behaviors spread from person to person to person. We show that, in both an ordinary public goods game and in a public goods game with punishment, focal individuals are influenced by fellow group members’ contribution behavior in future interactions with other individuals who were not a party to the initial interaction. Furthermore, this influence persists for multiple periods and spreads up to three degrees of separation (from person to person to person to person). The results suggest that each additional contribution a subject makes to the public good in the first period is tripled over the course of the experiment by other subjects who are directly or indirectly influenced to contribute more as a consequence. These results show experimentally that cooperative behavior cascades in human social networks.","[{'authorId': '2016371', 'name': 'J. Fowler'}, {'authorId': '2560153', 'name': 'N.

91fd67a6644cfb8745831dd9f72a4156210d4926,"We propose a dynamic structural model that illuminates the economic mechanisms shaping individual behavior and outcomes on crowdsourced ideation platforms. We estimate the model using a rich data set obtained from IdeaStorm.com, a crowdsourced ideation initiative affiliated with Dell. We find that, on IdeaStorm.com, individuals tend to significantly underestimate the costs to the firm for implementing their ideas but overestimate the potential of their ideas in the initial stages of the crowdsourcing process. Therefore, the “idea market” is initially overcrowded with ideas that are less likely to be implemented. However, individuals learn about both their abilities to come up with high-potential ideas as well as the cost structure of the firm from peer voting on their ideas and the firm's response to contributed ideas. We find that individuals learn rather quickly about their abilities to come up with high-potential ideas, but the learning regarding the firm's cost structure is quite slow. Contributors of low-potential ideas eventually become inactive, whereas the high-potential idea contributors remain active. As a result, over time, the average potential of generated ideas increases while the number of ideas contributed decreases. Hence, the decrease in the number of ideas generated represents market efficiency through self-selection rather than its failure. Through counterfactuals, we show that providing more precise cost signals to individuals can accelerate the filtering process. Increasing the total number of ideas to respond to and improving the response speed will lead to more idea contributions. However, failure to distinguish between high-and low-potential ideas and between high-and low-ability idea generators leads to the overall potential of the ideas generated to drop significantly.

9247735b98984ba53dec6c1a0bb3f82d0fe63625,"Alexithymia represents a transdiagnostic marker across psychiatric entities associated with emotional impairments, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Accumulating evidence suggests that interoceptive dysfunctions that underpin the core symptomatic emotion recognition and empathy deficits in ASD may be contributed to by high levels of alexithymia rather than autistic symptoms per se. However, previous findings are hampered by generally elevated alexithymia in ASD patients, and thus were not able to differentiate common and distinct contributions across the entire spectrum of variations of autism and alexithymia. Moreover, the multi-factorial nature of the domains affected, such as distinct neural reactivity towards perceiving physical and affective pain, has not been accounted for. Against this background the present fMRI study employed a dimensional trait approach in n = 242 healthy subjects to determine common and distinct associations between both traits and pain empathic responses towards physical and affective pain. Higher levels of alexithymia associated with increased left anterior insula pain empathic reactivity. Disentangling these effects revealed a positive association during perceived physical pain, but a negative one during affective pain. No significant associations with trait autism were found, but an interaction effect between the trait dimensions was observed in the mid-cingulate cortex. Moderation analysis demonstrated that trait autism only impacted mid-cingulate reactivity towards physical pain in high alexithymia subjects, whereas reactivity towards affective pain was specifically associated with trait autism in low alexithymia subjects.

The key concept is that of ""threshold"": the number or proportion of others who must make one decision before a given actor does so; this is the point where net benefits begin to exceed net costs for that particular actor. Beginning with a frequency distribution of thresholds, the models allow calculation of the ultimate or ""equilibrium"" number making each decision. The stability of equilibrium results against various possible changes in threshold distributions is considered. Stress is placed on the importance of exact distributions distributions for outcomes.

Emotional empathy is a multifaceted and multilayered phenomenon which ranges from relatively simple processes such as emotional matching behaviour to more complex processes involving interaction between emotional and cognitive perspective taking systems.

To investigate whether this capacity exists outside the mother/offspring bond, we conducted a similar experiment in which domestic hens were exposed to the mild distress of unrelated, but familiar adult conspecifics. Each observer hen was exposed to two replicates of four conditions, in counterbalanced order; control (C); control with noise of air puff (CN); air puff to conspecific hen (APC); air puff to observer hen (APH). During each test, the observer hens' behaviour and physiology were measured throughout a 10 min pre-treatment and a 10 min treatment period. Despite showing signs of distress in response to an aversive stimulus directed at themselves (APH), and using methodology sufficiently sensitive to detect empathy-like responses previously, observer hens showed no behavioural or physiological responses to the mild distress of a familiar adult conspecific.

Path analyses showed that the facial EMG activity consistently predicted the valence ratings for the emotions experienced in response to dynamic facial expressions. The experienced valence ratings in turn predicted the recognized valence ratings in Study 2.

The findings obtained using path analysis suggest that the proposed model explained almost 50% for nurses and less than 14% for police officers. In the case of nurses, the strong significant relationship between HRM inputs and outputs may provide a further plausible explanation for one of the long-term consequences of new public management – namely, the inability to retain skilled employees (especially those in the health sector) across numerous OECD countries. The implication of these findings is that the present public sector HRM policy choice should be re-examined because of its impact on HRM outcomes. Moreover, public sector employees should not be regarded as one uniform group that responds alike to the same policy. Whilst the merits of pursuing a strong auditing focus may have benefited organisations financially, the benefits can only remain if public sector employees, including professionals, are prepared to work under those conditions. The inability to retain nurses in numerous countries, coupled with past studies that have identified (poor) management as a contributing factor, suggests that past HRM policy choices may have to be replaced by new HRM policy choices that focus on employees' perceptions of well-being.

Structurally, music associated with groove is often characterised by rhythmic complexity in the form of syncopation, frequently observed in musical styles such as funk, hip-hop and electronic dance music. Structural complexity has been related to positive affect in music more broadly, but the function of syncopation in eliciting pleasure and body-movement in groove is unknown. Here we report results from a web-based survey which investigated the relationship between syncopation and ratings of wanting to move and experienced pleasure. Participants heard funk drum-breaks with varying degrees of syncopation and audio entropy, and rated the extent to which the drum-breaks made them want to move and how much pleasure they experienced. While entropy was found to be a poor predictor of wanting to move and pleasure, the results showed that medium degrees of syncopation elicited the most desire to move and the most pleasure, particularly for participants who enjoy dancing to music. Hence, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between syncopation, body-movement and pleasure, and syncopation seems to be an important structural factor in embodied and affective responses to groove.","[{'authorId': '38809249', 'name': 'Maria A.

The MBMS model utilizes real human motion samples recorded in motion capture experiments as templates for simulating novel motions. Such human motion samples are stored in a motion database. When a user submits an input simulation scenario to the model, a motion search engine termed the ldquoroot motion finderrdquo in the model searches the motion database and retrieves the motion samples that closely match the given scenario. The retrieved motions, referred to as root motions, may significantly differ from one another in the underlying movement technique. Such variability within the root motion set is analyzed and graphically summarized by a model component termed the motion variability analyzer. This analysis helps users rapidly identify alternative movement techniques for the given input simulation scenario and simulate human motions based on alternative movement techniques. Since root motions do not exactly satisfy but only closely match the input simulation scenario, a motion modification (MoM) algorithm adapts them to fit the scenario by systematically deforming them in the joint angle-time domain. The MoM algorithm retains the root motions' fundamental spatial-temporal structure and minimizes deviations from the root motions during such deformations. The MBMS model overcomes limitations of existing simulation models and achieves the following: 1) simulation of categorically different motions based on a single unified model; 2) simple and efficient learning of new motion behaviors; and 3) representation and simulation of human motion variability.","[{'authorId': '8034229', 'name': 'W.

Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS) ratings are commonly used during exposure tasks in cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) for anxiety.


AIMS
The present study examined patterns and predictors of SUDS in a sample of anxiety-disordered youth.


METHOD
Youth (N = 99) aged 7 to 14 (M = 10.4, SD = 1.8) were treated with CBT for social phobia (SP), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and/or separation anxiety disorder (SAD). Analyses were conducted using hierarchical linear modeling.


RESULTS
Child's peak SUDS and magnitude of change in SUDS significantly increased between sessions. Higher child self-reported pretreatment total Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) score predicted greater change in SUDS within the first exposure session. Primary GAD diagnosis predicted less increase in change in SUDS between sessions.


CONCLUSIONS
Results suggest that higher pretreatment total MASC scores are associated with increased first exposure within-session habituation. Additionally, youth with a principal diagnosis of GAD experienced less between-session habituation, perhaps because they may have required more imaginal than in-vivo exposures.","[{'authorId': '6139388', 'name': 'Courtney L.

Without deterrence incentives in place, in a variant of the dictator game, players with pro-social emotions steal less. When players face expected punishment, pro-social emotions are deactivated and do not decrease stealing; in this case, self-centered emotions get activated and motivate greater stealing.

In the first experiment, dogs' owners feigned a heart attack in an open field, and in the second experiment, dogs' owners experienced an accident in which a bookcase fell on them and pinned them to the floor. In these experiments, one or two bystanders were available to which dogs could go for help. The dogs' behavior was taped for 6 min after the owner had fallen and was later scored for the frequency and time the dogs spent performing different behaviors.

9620d66e06c372a054435708b08bd78b4539acda,"Background and Objectives: Anabolic androgenic steroids (AASs) are a complex group of molecules that include both steroidal androgens and synthetic compounds, derived from testosterone. AASs are commonly used to support pharmacological therapy in cases of primary or secondary hypogonadism, major burns, and neoplastic cachexia. Their prolonged and supra-physiological consumption can provoke several adverse effects on various organs and systems. Among these, the physiopathological mechanisms that induce neuropsychiatric disorders related to AAS abuse are poorly known. For this reason, the proposed review aims to retrace the pathway of action of testosterone to focus on the effects on the central nervous system and specifically highlight the effects of AASs on neuropsychiatric and behavioral functions, as well as on lifestyle. Materials and Methods: This review was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar databases. On these database websites, we searched for articles from 1 January 1980 to March 2019 using the key terms: “AAS,” “Anabolic Androgenic Steroids,” “brain,” and “neurology.” Results: The use of AASs through self-administration yields circulating androgens levels, inducing neuron apoptosis, which is linked to thinner cortex and, in general, less cortical volume. The same alterations affect the putamen. These differences were more evident when correlated with longer use. From a functional point of view, prolonged AAS consumption seemed to be related to lower connectivity between amygdala and frontal, striatal, limbic, hippocampal and visual cortical areas. On the other hand, AAS use seems to negatively condition the positive effects of the sport exercise, reducing its important anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative functions on the hippocampus, implicated in anxiolytic control. Conclusion: This review clarifies the major aspects of the side effects related to AAS use/abuse highlighting the complex mechanisms on neuropsychiatric and cognitive pathological alterations and also the emotional and behavioral dysfunctions.","[{'authorId': '11928964', 'name': 'G.

For example, groups of fish can either be ‘shoals’ or ‘schools’: shoals are simply aggregations of individuals; schools are shoals exhibiting polarized, synchronized motion. Here we demonstrate that polarization distributions of groups of zebrafish (Danio rerio) are bimodal, showing two distinct modes of collective motion corresponding to the definitions of shoaling and schooling. Other features of the group's motion also vary consistently between the two modes: zebrafish schools are faster and less dense than zebrafish shoals. Habituation to an environment can also alter the proportion of time zebrafish groups spend schooling or shoaling. Models of collective motion suggest that the degree and stability of group polarization increases with the group's density. Examining zebrafish groups of different sizes from 5 to 50, we show that larger groups are less polarized than smaller groups. Decreased fearfulness in larger groups may function similarly to habituation, causing them to spend more time shoaling than schooling, contrary to most models' predictions.","[{'authorId': '2051997', 'name': 'Noam Y.

To contain its spread, China adopted unprecedented nationwide interventions on January 23 2020. These policies included large-scale quarantine, strict controls on travel and extensive monitoring of suspected cases. However, it is unknown whether these policies have had an impact on the epidemic. We sought to show how these control measures impacted the containment of the epidemic. Methods We integrated population migration data before and after January 23 and most updated COVID-19 epidemiological data into the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model to derive the epidemic curve. We also used an artificial intelligence (AI) approach, trained on the 2003 SARS data, to predict the epidemic. Results We found that the epidemic of China should peak by late February, showing gradual decline by end of April. A five-day delay in implementation would have increased epidemic size in mainland China three-fold. Lifting the Hubei quarantine would lead to a second epidemic peak in Hubei province in mid-March and extend the epidemic to late April, a result corroborated by the machine learning prediction. Conclusions Our dynamic SEIR model was effective in predicting the COVID-19 epidemic peaks and sizes. The implementation of control measures on January 23 2020 was indispensable in reducing the eventual COVID-19 epidemic size.","[{'authorId': '48598873', 'name': 'Zi-feng Yang'}, {'authorId': '30489614', 'name': 'Zhiqi Zeng'}, {'authorId': '1753652328', 'name': 'Ke Wang'}, {'authorId': '113837271', 'name': 'Sook-san Wong'}, {'authorId': '2340666', 'name': 'W.

970c5aaf59253594e82c299a884aead0bba56ff0,"Collective team collapse occurs when multiple players of a sport team experience a sudden and extreme underperformance within a game. To date, minimal research has been conducted on the causes of collective team collapse. Thus, goals of this study were to explore perceived causes of collective team collapse in different sports and to define team collapse in contrast to negative momentum. To investigate factors causing and maintaining collective sport team collapse, an inductive, exploratory qualitative analysis of individual interviews was conducted. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 10 athletes of professional German teams of various sports playing in between first and fourth division. Participants were interviewed about a team collapse event they had experienced with their team during the past year. Data were collected and analyzed using a grounded theory methodology. Collective team collapse appeared to be induced by a temporal cascade of causes rather than by single triggers. This cascade included antecedents, which represent factors that make the occurrence of a team collapse more likely; critical events, which include specific events within the game that trigger a team collapse; as well as affective, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes that foster a maintenance of the collapse. Within this theoretical framework, social factors, such as decreased performance contagion or emotional contagion, played crucial roles in causing a team collapse. These results illustrate that collective team collapse is more than the sum of individual choking of multiple players at the same time. In conclusion, a new definition, differentiating team collapse from negative momentum, is introduced. Furthermore, a process model of causes of collective team collapse is proposed. The results provide first insights into causes of collective collapse in a variety of team sports. The developed model is supposed to help future research to better connect to practice and to support athletes, coaches, and sport psychologists.","[{'authorId': '2094785077', 'name': 'V. V.

We recruited mothers and their 12- to 14-month-old infants (Ndyads = 98) to complete a lab study in which mothers were initially separated from their infants and assigned to either a low-arousal positive/relaxation condition, intended to elicit parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) reactivity, or a high-arousal negative/stress task, intended to elicit sympathetic nervous system (SNS) reactivity. Upon reunion, infants were placed either on their mothers’ laps (touch condition) or in a high chair next to the mother (no-touch condition). We then examined if the babies SNS and/or PNS responses changed from their baseline levels and how the dyads’ physiological responses—both PNS and SNS responses—synchronized over time as a function of mothers’ affect manipulation and touch condition. Three noteworthy findings were observed. First, infants of mothers assigned to the relaxation task showed greater PNS increases and PNS covariation. Second, infants of mothers assigned to the stress task showed stronger SNS covariation with their mothers over time. Finally, infants who sat on their mothers’ laps (i.e., touch condition) showed stronger SNS covariation than those in the no-touch condition. Taken together, these results suggest that mothers’ affective states—low-arousal positive states as well as high-arousal negative states—can be “caught” by their infants, and that touch can play a critical role in stress contagion.","[{'authorId': '12127092', 'name': 'S.

Social exchange theorists argue that informal working relationships with non-line management provides an additional power source alongside traditional management relationships to foster proactive and innovative behaviour even when resources are scarce. About 272 Australian engineers, asset managers and technical employees were surveyed from public and private sector organisations, and data was examined using structural equation modelling. The findings depict that formal and informal leader–employee, organisational–employee relationships explained almost 53% of resource adequacy and resource adequacy explained 60.5% of the proactive engineering asset management organisational culture and 28.1% of innovative behaviour.

For return-benefits to play a motivational role, however, they need to be experienced by the organism. Motivational analyses should restrict themselves, therefore, to the altruistic impulse and its knowable consequences. Empathy is an ideal candidate mechanism to underlie so-called directed altruism, i.e., altruism in response to anothers's pain, need, or distress. Evidence is accumulating that this mechanism is phylogenetically ancient, probably as old as mammals and birds. Perception of the emotional state of another automatically activates shared representations causing a matching emotional state in the observer. With increasing cognition, state-matching evolved into more complex forms, including concern for the other and perspective-taking. Empathy-induced altruism derives its strength from the emotional stake it offers the self in the other's welfare. The dynamics of the empathy mechanism agree with predictions from kin selection and reciprocal altruism theory.","[{'authorId': '3533326', 'name': 'F.

Cameron and Freeman’s (1991) model of organizational cultures comprising of clan, adhocracy, hierarchy, and market was utilized as the conceptual framework for analysis. The results indicate that job satisfaction levels varied across corporate cultural typology. Within the study conceptual framework, job satisfaction invoked an alignment of cultures on the vertical axis that represents a continuum of organic processes (with an emphasis on flexibility and spontaneity) to mechanistic processes (which emphasize control, stability, and order).

Affective states (cheerfulness, anxiety, sadness, anger, and neutral mood) were experimentally induced by short ""emotionally contagious films."" Findings confirmed that the newly developed films were suitable to effectively elicit the expected affective states and to differentially change the dimensions of interest. Changes in verbal versus figural fluency performance were examined as a function of positive versus negative valence, approach versus withdrawal motivation, and low versus high emotional arousal. Level of interest was evaluated as a control. Both the tendency to withdraw and emotional arousal seemed to produce relative advantages for cognitive processes that are more strongly represented in the right than left prefrontal cortex. Findings suggest that changes in cognitive performance might be best explained by an additive combination of motivational direction and arousal.","[{'authorId': '5844135', 'name': 'I.

9857e817e4e5393f870fe7837b0a064f6fe6a9e3,"Human computer intelligent interaction is an emerging field aimed at providing natural ways for humans to use computers as aids. It is argued that for a computer to be able to interact with humans it needs to have the communication skills of humans. One of these skills is the affective aspect of communication, which is recognized to be a crucial part of human intelligence and has been argued to be more fundamental in human behaviour and success in social life than intellect (Vesterinen, 2001; Pantic, 2005). Embodied conversational agents, ECAs (Casell et al., 2000), are graphical interfaces capable of using verbal and non-verbal modes of communication to interact with users in computerbased environments. These agents are sometimes just as an animated talking face, may be displaying simple facial expressions and, when using speech synthesis, with some kind of lip synchronization, and sometimes they have sophisticated 3D graphical representation, with complex body movements and facial expressions. An important strand of emotion-related research in human-computer interaction is the simulation of emotional expressions made by embodied computer agents (Creed & Beale, 2005). The basic requirement for a computer to express emotions is to have channels of communication such as voice, image and an ability to communicate affection over those channels. Therefore, interface designers often emulate multimodal human-human communication by including emotional expressions and statements in their interfaces through the use of textual content, speech (synthetic and recorded) and synthetic facial expressions, making the agents truly “social actors” (Reeves & Nass, 1996). Several studies have illustrated that our ability to recognise the emotional facial expressions of embodied computer agents is very similar to that of identifying human facial expressions (Bartneck, 2001). Related to agent’s voice, experiments have demonstrated that subjects can recognize the emotional expressions of an agent (Creed & Beale, 2006) whose voice varies widely in pitch, tempo and loudness and its facial expressions match the emotion it is expressing. But, what about the impact of these social actors? Recent research focuses on the psychological impact of affective agents endowed with the ability to behave empathically with the user (Brave et al., 2005; Isbister, 2006; Yee et al., 2007; Prendinger & Ishizuka, 2004; Picard, 2003).

985b481e9edab12396423dc231ef5a7d0ac53103,"Since September 11, 2001, and the anthrax attacks that followed, a substantial federal investment—totaling well in excess of $5 billion—has been made to increase our nation’s ability to prepare for, and respond to, public health emergencies. Yet despite anecdotal reports suggesting that progress has been made, it is unclear whether these investments have left the nation better prepared to respond to a bioterrorist attack, pandemic influenza, or any other large-scale public health emergency. 
 
This situation is not because of a shortage of measures of preparedness. Over the past 5 years, federal agencies, state health departments, and various nongovernmental organizations have proposed and implemented myriad measures of public health emergency preparedness. But these efforts have not resulted in a clear picture of the nation’s preparedness owing to ambiguous and uncertain preparedness goals, a lack of agreement about what the measures should aim at and how they should be interpreted, and a weak system of accountability for producing results.1 Measures often vary considerably across agencies and shift dramatically from year to year, leaving state and local health officials, businesses, nonprofits, and citizens confused and perplexed by a maze of overlapping and sometimes contradictory requirements, checklists, and ideas about what constitutes preparedness.2–4 
 
What our nation needs in order to bring coherence to the debate is a clear definition of public health emergency preparedness and an articulation of the key elements that characterize a well-prepared community. In this editorial, we propose a candidate definition of public health emergency preparedness and describe its key elements. Both the definition and the elements were developed by a diverse panel of experts convened by RAND in February 2007. 
 
We propose the following definition: public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) is the capability of the public health and health care systems, communities, and individuals, to prevent, protect against, quickly respond to, and recover from health emergencies, particularly those whose scale, timing, or unpredictability threatens to overwhelm routine capabilities. Preparedness involves a coordinated and continuous process of planning and implementation that relies on measuring performance and taking corrective action. 
 
In developing the definition, we considered what constitutes a public health emergency, what public health emergency preparedness requires, and who is involved in it.","[{'authorId': '46384109', 'name': 'Christopher D.

This research assesses the extent to which social media participants exhibit homophily versus heterophily in a unique context-virtual investment communities VICs. We study the propensity of investors in seeking interactions with others with similar sentiments in VICs and identify theoretically important and meaningful conditions under which homophily is attenuated. To address this question, we used a discrete choice model to analyze 682,781 messages on Yahoo!

Our results revealed that, despite the benefits from heterophily, investors are not immune to the allure of homophily in interactions in VICs.

Several studies have reported that affect contingent judgement biases can also be produced in animals. The animals, however, cannot self-report; therefore, the valence of their emotions, to date, could only be assumed. Here we present the results of an experiment where the affect-contingent judgement bias has been produced by objectively measured positive emotions. We trained rats in operant Skinner boxes to press one lever in response to one tone to receive a food reward and to press another lever in response to a different tone to avoid punishment by electric foot shock. After attaining a stable level of discrimination performance, the animals were subjected to either handling or playful, experimenter-administered manual stimulation – tickling. This procedure has been confirmed to induce a positive affective state in rats, and the 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalisations (rat laughter) emitted by animals in response to tickling have been postulated to index positive emotions akin to human joy. During the tickling and handling sessions, the numbers of emitted high-frequency 50-kHz calls were scored. Immediately after tickling or handling, the animals were tested for their responses to a tone of intermediate frequency, and the pattern of their responses to this ambiguous cue was taken as an indicator of the animals' optimism. Our findings indicate that tickling induced positive emotions which are directly indexed in rats by laughter, can make animals more optimistic. We demonstrate for the first time a link between the directly measured positive affective state and decision making under uncertainty in an animal model. We also introduce innovative tandem-approach for studying emotional-cognitive interplay in animals, which may be of great value for understanding the emotional-cognitive changes associated with mood disorders.","[{'authorId': '3964335', 'name': 'R.

To that end, CQC has developed statistical surveillance tools that periodically aggregate large numbers of quantitative performance measures to identify risks to the quality of care and prioritise its limited inspection resource. These tools have, however, failed to successfully identify poor-quality providers. Facing continued budget cuts, CQC is now further reliant on an ‘intelligence-driven’, risk-based approach to prioritising inspections and a new effective tool is required. Objective To determine whether the near real-time, automated collection and aggregation of multiple sources of patient feedback can provide a collective judgement that effectively identifies risks to the quality of care, and hence can be used to help prioritise inspections. Methods Our Patient Voice Tracking System combines patient feedback from NHS Choices, Patient Opinion, Facebook and Twitter to form a near real-time collective judgement score for acute hospitals and trusts on any given date. The predictive ability of the collective judgement score is evaluated through a logistic regression analysis of the relationship between the collective judgement score on the start date of 456 hospital and trust-level inspections, and the subsequent inspection outcomes. Results Aggregating patient feedback increases the volume and diversity of patient-centred insights into the quality of care. There is a positive association between the resulting collective judgement score and subsequent inspection outcomes (OR for being rated ‘Inadequate’ compared with ‘Requires improvement’ 0.35 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.76), Requires improvement/Good OR 0.23 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.44), and Good/Outstanding OR 0.13 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.84), with p<0.05 for all). Conclusions The collective judgement score can successfully identify a high-risk group of organisations for inspection, is available in near real time and is available at a more granular level than the majority of existing data sets. The collective judgement score could therefore be used to help prioritise inspections.","[{'authorId': '145669742', 'name': 'A. Griffiths'}, {'authorId': '26406999', 'name': 'M.

First, a semantic-based layered structure is designed to represent knowledge about the unfamiliar environment. Second, to capture important influential factors for knowledge transmission, such as personal influential radius and personal abilities of expressing and assimilating knowledge, we construct a model of personalized knowledge transmission. Third, a probability-based knowledge-guided wayfinding model is presented to produce diverse actions and allow the individuals to adapt to knowledge changes in an unfamiliar environment. Finally, a crowd simulation system is implemented to visualize the analysis in a graphical manner. The proposed method is expected to provide guidance for emergency management especially when the crowd has incomplete knowledge of the environment.","[{'authorId': '3172102', 'name': 'Guijuan Zhang'}, {'authorId': '7382513', 'name': 'Dianjie Lu'}, {'authorId': '2054672421', 'name': 'Lei Lv'}, {'authorId': '2118681994', 'name': 'Hui Yu'}, {'authorId': '2118902760', 'name': 'Hong Liu'}]",16.0,,31.0,Knowledge-Based Crowd Motion for the Unfamiliar Environment,2018.0

This process with its persistent organizational effects has been called ‘programming’. The brain is a key target for such effects. This review focuses on the effects of adverse early environments, notably exposure to stress or glucocorticoids, upon subsequent adult hypothalamus‐pituitary‐adrenal axis activity, behaviour and cognition. We discuss the effects observed, the proposed underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms and the consequences for pathophysiology. The data suggest that key targets for programming include glucocorticoid receptor gene expression and the corticotrophin‐releasing hormone system. Increasing evidence for analogous processes in humans is also reviewed. Early life programming of neuroendocrine systems and behaviour by stress and exogenous or endogenous glucocorticoids appears to be a fundamental process underpinning common disorders. Approaches to minimize or reverse the consequences of such early life events may have therapeutic importance.","[{'authorId': '46912002', 'name': 'L. Welberg'}, {'authorId': '4120609', 'name': 'J.

9a1768e05ba383bd8589e1378ced4e9625762f1e,"It is an ancient, and very pervasive, idea that music expresses emotion. Apart from the copious literature to this effect contributed by composers, musicologists, and philosophers, there is also solid empirical evidence from psychological research, reviewed in chapters of this book (e.g. Gabrielsson & Lindstrom, this volume; Juslin, this volume), that listeners often agree rather strongly about what type of emotion is expressed in a particular piece. It is also a pervasive belief that music can, at times, actually produce emotion in listeners. The distinction between perception and production is related to the distinction between cognitivism and emotivism proposed by philosophers in their analysis of emotion in music (e.g. Kivy 1989). Whereas 'emotivists' hold that music elicits real emotional responses in listeners, 'cognitivists' argue that music simply expresses or represents emotions. Our view is that it would be premature to prejudge the issue and that both positions may be perfectly appropriate depending on a number of factors outlined below. Our purpose in this chapter is to provide a formalization of the processes whereby music produces emotional effects in the listener that go beyond the cognitive inference of what the music can be said to express. In addition, we review the pertinent evidence to date and suggest ways in which future research might investigate these processes in a systematic fashion. We state at the outset that our discussion and the review of the available evidence are largely based on Western classical music, thereby restricting the generalizability of our claims to other kinds of music and other cultures. Our attempt at a formalization of emotional effects of music will consist in defining the affective changes that music is supposed to produce in the listener and to identify the determinants of the listening situation (features such as the musical structure of the piece listened to, the interpretation by the performer, relevant state and trait characteristics of the listener, and the respective context). An important issue for discussion will be the relative weighting of the different determinants and the type of their interaction in producing the affective outcome. We follow the senior author's attempt to define the emotional meaning of music in analogy to Buhler's Organon model of language, postulating composition, expression, perception, and production rules to model the different facets of emotional meaning (Scherer, 2000d). In this context, the term rule is used to denote a certain regularity or lawfulness of the effects discussed that can be expressed in concrete predictions or hypotheses. It is not excluded that these rules can be integrated into attempts at computational modelling of the underlying mechanisms (in fact, we consider this a highly desirable option), but we do not feel that the current state of the","[{'authorId': '2462740', 'name': 'K.

Economic instability produced by financial crises can increase employment-related (i.e., job insecurity) and income-related (i.e., financial stress) economic stress. While the detrimental impact of job insecurity on safety outcomes has been extensively investigated, no study has examined the concurrent role of financial stress let alone their emotion-related predictors.


OBJECTIVE
The present cross-country research sought to identify the simultaneous effects of affective job insecurity and financial stress in predicting employee safety injuries and accidents under-reporting, and to examine the extent to which emotional contagion of positive/negative emotions at work contribute to the level of experienced economic stress.


METHODS
We performed multi-group measurement and structural invariance analyses.


RESULTS
Data from employees in the U.S. (N = 498) and Italy (N = 366) suggest that financial stress is the primary mediator between emotional contagion and poor safety outcomes. Moreover, greater anger-contagion predicted higher levels of financial strain and job insecurity whereas greater joy-contagion predicted reduced economic stress.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings support the relevance of considering the concurrent role of income-and employment-related stressors as predictors of safety-related outcomes. Theoretical and practical implications for safety are discussed in light of the globally increasing emotional pressure and concerns of income- and employment-related economic stress in today's workplace, particularly given the recent pandemic spread of Corona virus disease (COVID-19).","[{'authorId': '15933656', 'name': 'Laura Petitta'}, {'authorId': '6446132', 'name': 'T.

9a42b2936568389e80e2c96c3d01aa3aa06b1179,"Is Facebook utilization beneficial or detrimental for psychological well-being? I draw on outstanding research (e.g., Chou and Edge, 2012; Lin and Utz, 2015; Appel et al., 2016; Ehrenreich and Underwood, 2016; Vogel and Rose, 2016; Hu et al., 2017) to substantiate that examining other individuals’ positively presented material on Facebook may have detrimental consequences. Increasing comparisons on Facebook may generate feelings of envy, the latter being a significant process determining the effect of growing social comparison on psychological well-being. To date, there is an increasing body of literature investigating the psychological consequences of Facebook usage, the function of relationship closeness in producing the feelings of contentment and envy, the impacts of exposure to positive content on Facebook, the link between envy and depression on Facebook, and the function of tie strength in expecting the emotional results of browsing Facebook. I am specifically interested in how previous research explored the consequences of Facebook use on psychological outcomes, the moderating function of envy in the link between Facebook use and reduced affective wellbeing, the psychological results of non-interactive Facebook conduct, and the role of relationship closeness in anticipating user’s contentment and envy after inspecting a post. A synthesis of the extant literature suggests that inspecting other individuals’ positive news on Facebook brings about contentment through emotional contagion, whereas negative news causes discomfort as a consequence of mood contagion, the transmissible effect being more powerful when the news is associated with a strong tie. The outcomes of this research back the argument that self-confidence and dispositional envy are instrumental in producing Facebook envy. These findings highlight that the emotional results of browsing Facebook are considerably affected by the substance of the comment, the personal attributes of the Facebook user, and link between the reader and the poster. As limitations in the current review, more hypotheses need to be tested and future directions for subsequent multilevel research on the behavioral and cognitive outcomes of Facebook should illuminate why when individuals achieve belongingness demands on Facebook, they feel in a superior way about themselves and their reputation in social circles.","[{'authorId': '34568875', 'name': 'Aurel Pera'}]",39.0,,28.0,"Psychopathological Processes Involved in Social Comparison, Depression, and Envy on Facebook",2018.0

However, little is known about the mechanisms that underlie these sex-specific outcomes. In the current study we demonstrated that glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) exhibit sex differences in their temporal and spatial expression during fetal and early postnatal life. During development, we observed decreased GR mRNA in the paraventricular nucleus, decreased MR mRNA and MR protein in the hippocampus, and increased GR mRNA and GR protein in the hippocampus. We have also shown that on gestational d 50, maternally administered betamethasone (BETA) reduces fetal plasma ACTH and cortisol concentrations. BETA significantly affected hippocampal MR protein expression, and this effect was greatest in males. BETA was unable to autoregulate GR protein during fetal life, indicating that regulation of brain corticosteroid receptors is fundamentally different in fetal compared with adult life. The sex differences in the pattern of GR and MR expression during development may indicate different windows of vulnerability to prenatal glucocorticoid exposure in fetal life.","[{'authorId': '2056746636', 'name': 'D.

Across 59 countries and 12 personality (Big-5) and attitudinal variables we found that differences between students and general public were partly substantial, incoherent, and contradicted previous findings. Two often used cultural variables, embeddedness and intellectual autonomy, failed to explain the differences between both groups across countries. We further found that students vary as much as the general population both between and within countries.

 The authors introduce emotional ability similarity to explain consumer satisfaction in interactions with frontline sales and service employees and other consumers beyond the effects of traditional relational variables in the similarity–attraction paradigm. Four studies examine how and why similar abilities for using emotional information between two people promote relational success in marketplace exchanges. We find that, when interacting with others, consumers who exchange nonverbal information with their partners experience (dis)similarity in their emotional ability (EA). Similar dyads who rely on expressive (high–high EA pairs) or inexpressive (low–low EA pairs) emotion norms experience significantly greater satisfaction in their interactions than consumers with dissimilar norms (high–low EA pairs). Together, these findings advance the understanding of consumer relationships and satisfaction by establishing EA similarity as a new avenue for consumer research.","[{'authorId': '115025754', 'name': 'Blair Kidwell'}, {'authorId': '115231279', 'name': 'Christopher P.

We studied how voluntary health-protective behavior and vaccination willingness impact the long-term dynamics. We analyzed how different levels of mandatory NPIs determine how individuals use their leeway for voluntary actions. If mandatory NPIs are too weak, COVID-19 incidence will surge, implying high morbidity and mortality before individuals react; if they are too strong, one expects a rebound wave once restrictions are lifted, challenging the transition to endemicity. Conversely, moderate mandatory NPIs give individuals time and room to adapt their level of caution, mitigating disease spread effectively. When complemented with high vaccination rates, this also offers a robust way to limit the impacts of the Omicron variant of concern. Altogether, our work highlights the importance of appropriate mandatory NPIs to maximise the impact of individual voluntary actions in pandemic control.","[{'authorId': '103852994', 'name': 'Philipp Dönges'}, {'authorId': '23536875', 'name': 'Joël Wagner'}, {'authorId': '151198297', 'name': 'Sebastián Contreras'}, {'authorId': '2047703666', 'name': 'Emil N.

Benign envy is related to the motivation to move upward, whereas malicious envy is related to pulling superior others down. In four studies (N = 1,094)—using the newly developed Benign and Malicious Envy Scale (BeMaS)—we show that dispositional envy is also characterized by two independent dimensions related to distinct motivational dynamics and behavioral consequences. Dispositional benign and malicious envy uniquely predict envious responding following upward social comparisons. Furthermore, they are differentially connected to hope for success and fear of failure. Corresponding to these links, dispositional benign envy predicted faster race performance of marathon runners mediated via higher goal setting. In contrast, dispositional malicious envy predicted race goal disengagement.

9c9e4e8898c4acaa17f00710c1fef3e75923e480,"Empathy for pain is referred to as an evolutionary behavior of social animals and humans associated with the ability to feel, recognize, understand and share the other's distressing (pain, social rejection and catastrophe) states. Impairment of empathy can definitely lead to deficits in social communication and sociability (attachment, bond, reciprocity, altruism and morality) that may be fundamental to some psychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), psychopathy, misconduct, antisocial personality disorder and schizophrenia. So far, the underlying mechanisms of empathy are poorly known due to lack of animal models and scarce understanding of its biological basis. Recently, we have successfully identified and validated the behavioral identities of empathy for pain in rats that can be widely used as a rodent model for studying the underlying biological mechanisms of empathy. Priming dyadic social interaction between a naive cagemate observer (CO) and a cagemate demonstrator (CD), rather than a non-cagemate, in pain for 30 min in a testing box can repeatedly and constantly result in empathic responses of the CO toward the familiar CD's distressing condition, displaying as allo-licking at the injury site, allo-grooming at the body and social transfer of pain. The familiarity-based, distress-specific social consolation and subsequent social transfer of pain can be qualitatively and quantitatively rated as experimental biomarkers for empathy for pain. The rodent model of empathy for pain is state-of-the-art and has more advantages than the existing ones used for social neuroscience since it can reflect sensory, emotional and cognitive processes of the brain in running the prosocial and altruistic behaviors in animals who could not report verbally. Here we would like to provide and share the protocol of the model for wide use.","[{'authorId': '2152845139', 'name': 'Yang Yu'}, {'authorId': '2109497113', 'name': 'Chun-Li Li'}, {'authorId': '2061601948', 'name': 'Rui Du'}, {'authorId': '81677355', 'name': 'Jun Chen'}]",4.0,,30.0,Rat Model of Empathy for Pain.,2019.0

Can we learn without making mistakes? These questions apply in the classroom, in the military, and on the assembly line. Learning, Remembering, Believing addresses these and other key issues in learning and performance. The volume presents leading-edge theories and findings from a wide range of research settings: from pilots learning to fly to children learning about physics by throwing beanbags. Common folklore is explored, and promising research directions are identified. The authors also continue themes from their first two volumes: Enhancing Human Performance (1988) and In the Mind's Eye (1991). The result is a thorough and readable review of * Learning and remembering. The volume evaluates the effects of subjective experience on learning--why we often overestimate what we know, why we may not need a close match between training settings and real-world tasks, and why we experience such phenomena as illusory remembering and unconscious plagiarism. * Learning and performing in teams. The authors discuss cooperative learning in different age groups and contexts. Current views on team performance are presented, including how team-learning processes can be improved and whether team-building interventions are effective. * Mental and emotional states. This is a critical review of the evidence that learning is affected by state of mind. Topics include hypnosis, meditation, sleep learning, restricted environmental stimulation, and self-confidence and the self-efficacy theory of learning. * New directions. The volume looks at two new ideas for improving performance: emotions induced by another person--socially induced affect--and strategies for controlling one's thoughts. The committee also considers factors inherent in organizations--workplaces, educational facilities, and the military--that affect whether and how they implement training programs. Learning, Remembering, Believing offers an understanding of human learning that will be useful to training specialists, psychologists, educators, managers, and individuals interested in all dimensions of human performance.","[{'authorId': '2888911', 'name': 'D.

Students rated both types of aggressive expressions as highly intense and inappropriate (or nonnormative), but assertive displays as appropriate and less intense. Additionally, aggressive expressions were negatively related to students' affect, whereas assertive expressions were positively related to affect. Findings extend norm violation theory by identifying how teacher anger should be expressed and when during the semester anger is more likely to be perceived as inappropriate.

Here, through an empathy priming paradigm, situational empathy was shown to act as a causal mechanism in inducing emotion, although the way empathy was primed had low levels of ecological validity. We therefore conducted an online experiment to explore the extent to which information about a composer’s expressive intentions when writing a piece of music would significantly affect the degree to which participants reportedly empathise with the composer and in turn influence emotional responses to expressive music. A total of 229 participants were randomly assigned to three groups. The experimental group read short texts describing the emotions felt by the composer during the process of composition. To control for the effect of text regardless of its content, one control group read texts describing the characteristics of the music they were to hear, and a second control group was not given any textual information. Participants listened to 30-second excerpts of four pieces of music, selected to express emotions from the four quadrants of the circumplex theory of emotion. Having heard each music excerpt, participants rated the valence and arousal they experienced and completed a measure of situational empathy. Results show that situational empathy in response to music is significantly associated with trait empathy. As opposed to those in the control conditions, participants in the experimental group responded with significantly higher levels of situational empathy. Receiving this text significantly moderated the effect of the expressiveness of stimuli on induced emotion, indicating that it induced empathy. We conclude that empathy can be induced during music listening through the provision of information about the specific emotions of a person relating to the music. These findings contribute to an understanding of the psychological mechanisms that underlie emotional responses to music.","[{'authorId': '1416850009', 'name': 'Katherine O’Neill'}, {'authorId': '144461383', 'name': 'Hauke Egermann'}]",4.0,,52.0,Induced empathy moderates emotional responses to expressive qualities in music,2020.0

We identified the susceptible groups and analyzed their characteristics. The results confirmed the occurrence of emotional contagion in ODC, that is, the extent to which the user’s emotion was affected by the received emotion. Our study also found that when positive emotional contagion occurred, the replies contained more hopefulness, and when negative emotional contagion occurred, the replies contained more hopelessness and fear. Second, positive emotions were easier to spread, and people with higher activity in ODC were more susceptible. In addition, nighttime was an active period for user interaction. The results can help community managers and support groups take measures to promote the spread of positive emotions and reduce the spread of negative emotions.","[{'authorId': '32196793', 'name': 'Jingyun Tang'}, {'authorId': '2116616057', 'name': 'Guang Yu'}, {'authorId': '40913698', 'name': 'Xiaoxu Yao'}]",4.0,"{'name': 'Healthcare', 'volume': '9'}",67.0,Emotional Contagion in the Online Depression Community,2021.0

The purpose of this paper is to examine a moderated mediation model that investigated the moderating role of psychological detachment in the relationship between work intensity and life satisfaction via emotional exhaustion. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
Data were collected from 149 hospital-based nurses who completed a questionnaire about working conditions and individual outcomes. The data were analyzed using hierarchical moderated regression and bootstrapping techniques. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The results confirm that work intensity is negatively related to life satisfaction via emotional exhaustion. The results also demonstrate that psychological detachment diminishes the negative influence of emotional exhaustion on life satisfaction. The conditional indirect effect model shows that the indirect relationship between work intensity and life satisfaction is strongest at low psychological detachment. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
 
This research advances our understanding of the negative work and non-work implications associated with work intensity. The key limitation of this research was the cross-sectional data set. HRM researchers should seek to replicate and expand the results with multi-wave data to extend our understanding of the implications of work intensity. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
 
HRM practitioners need to begin implementing measures to address work intensity in order to thwart its negative effects. HRM practitioners need to implement policies and procedures that limit the intensity of work demands to promote positive employee work and non-work outcomes. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value

9d9e8880fa5a689476347a142f54a2f79a51e87b,"ABSTRACT Until recently, whether invertebrates might exhibit emotions was unknown. This possibility has traditionally been dismissed by many as emotions are frequently defined with reference to human subjective experience, and invertebrates are often not considered to have the neural requirements for such sophisticated abilities. However, emotions are understood in humans and other vertebrates to be multifaceted brain states, comprising dissociable subjective, cognitive, behavioural and physiological components. In addition, accumulating literature is providing evidence of the impressive cognitive capacities and behavioural flexibility of invertebrates. Alongside these, within the past few years, a number of studies have adapted methods for assessing emotions in humans and other animals, to invertebrates, with intriguing results. Sea slugs, bees, crayfish, snails, crabs, flies and ants have all been shown to display various cognitive, behavioural and/or physiological phenomena that indicate internal states reminiscent of what we consider to be emotions. Given the limited neural architecture of many invertebrates, and the powerful tools available within invertebrate research, these results provide new opportunities for unveiling the neural mechanisms behind emotions and open new avenues towards the pharmacological manipulation of emotion and its genetic dissection, with advantages for disease research and therapeutic drug discovery. Here, we review the increasing evidence that invertebrates display some form of emotion, discuss the various methods used for assessing emotions in invertebrates and consider what can be garnered from further emotion research on invertebrates in terms of the evolution and underlying neural basis of emotion in a comparative context. Summary: Recent work has adapted methods for assessing emotions in humans and other animals, to invertebrates, with intriguing results. This Review interprets and discusses their utility with respect to the evolution and neurobiology of emotion.","[{'authorId': '7402262', 'name': 'Clint J.

During the 2012 federal election cycle, we collected Twitter conversations about 10 controversial political topics and mapped their network ties. Using network analysis, we discovered clusters—subgroups of highly self-connected users—and coded messages in each cluster for their expressed positive-to-negative emotional valence, level of support or opposition, and political leaning. We found that valence-based homophily successfully explained the selection of user interactions on Twitter, in terms of expressed emotional valence in their tweets or support versus criticism to an issue. It also finds conservative voices to be associated with negatively valenced clusters and vice versa. This study expands the theory of homophily beyond its traditional conceptualization and provides a new understanding of political-issue interactions in a social media context.","[{'authorId': '2972136', 'name': 'Itai Himelboim'}, {'authorId': '2446434', 'name': 'Kaye D.

Recent advances in stochastic actor-based modeling, combined with self-reported data on a popular online social network site, allow us to address this question with a greater degree of precision than has heretofore been possible. Using data on the Facebook activity of a cohort of college students over 4 years, we find that students who share certain tastes in music and in movies, but not in books, are significantly likely to befriend one another. Meanwhile, we find little evidence for the diffusion of tastes among Facebook friends—except for tastes in classical/jazz music. These findings shed light on the mechanisms responsible for observed network homogeneity; provide a statistically rigorous assessment of the coevolution of cultural tastes and social relationships; and suggest important qualifications to our understanding of both homophily and contagion as generic social processes.","[{'authorId': '143760173', 'name': 'Kevin Lewis'}, {'authorId': '2115574589', 'name': 'Marco Gonzalez'}, {'authorId': '145304367', 'name': 'J.

Neural dynamics underlying these functions has been studied in humans using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) elicited in Go/NoGo tasks that require a speeded motor response to the Go stimuli and withholding a prepotent response when a NoGo stimulus is presented. However, averaged ERP waveforms provide only limited information about the neuronal mechanisms underlying stimulus processing, motor preparation, and response production or inhibition. In this study, we examine the cortical representation of conflict monitoring and response inhibition using time-frequency analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings during continuous performance Go/NoGo task in 50 young adult females. We hypothesized that response inhibition would be associated with a transient boost in both temporal and spatial synchronization of prefrontal cortical activity, consistent with the role of the anterior cingulate and lateral prefrontal cortices in cognitive control. Overall, phase synchronization across trials measured by Phase Locking Index and phase synchronization between electrode sites measured by Phase Coherence were the highest in the Go and NoGo conditions, intermediate in the Warning condition, and the lowest under Neutral condition. The NoGo condition was characterized by significantly higher fronto-central synchronization in the 300–600 ms window, whereas in the Go condition, delta- and theta-band synchronization was higher in centro-parietal regions in the first 300 ms after the stimulus onset. The present findings suggest that response production and inhibition is supported by dynamic functional networks characterized by distinct patterns of temporal and spatial synchronization of brain oscillations.","[{'authorId': '143984259', 'name': 'Viktor Müller'}, {'authorId': '5560389', 'name': 'A.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between stress due to mistreatment by patients and caregivers’ own well-being indicators (anxiety, depression, and behavioral stress indicators). Based on predictions consistent with the job demands-resources model, it is anticipated that satisfaction with job resources would moderate the relationship between mistreatment by patients and well-being indicators. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
Hypotheses were tested with a sample of 182 employees in a leading training and research university hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. Results were partially replicated for a separate sample of 122 healthcare workers. Data were collected using the survey methodology. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The findings suggest that patient injustice is positively related to depression and behavioral stress indicators when satisfaction with job resources is high. Results illustrate that satisfaction with job resources has a sensitizing, rather than a buffering, role on the relation between mistreatment by patients, depression, and behavioral stress indicators, negatively affecting employees with higher levels of satisfaction with job resources.

Existing works about pedestrian safety are mostly based on the sensing capabilities from a single device. The surrounding information that can be learned, however, is quite limited or incomplete. Therefore, in many cases the dangers cannot be detected and the pedestrians cannot be alerted. In this paper, a novel system called CrowdWatch is proposed, which leverages mobile crowd sensing and crowd intelligence aggregation to detect temporary obstacles and make effective alerts for distracted walkers. To detect obstacles, we first study the regular rules of pedestrians’ avoidance behaviors from the aspects of turn-making and visual contexts. The Dempster–Shafer evidence theory is then used to fuse the behavior and visual contexts, and further calculate the confidence of obstacle existence. Afterwards, we leverage the features of pedestrians’ traces to characterize an appropriate dangerous area, which is used to alert distracted walkers. The conducted experiments with 36 participants and different obstacle settings indicate that the crowd-intelligence-based obstacle detection method is effective and the accuracy of reminding attains 83.3%.","[{'authorId': '2606838', 'name': 'Qianru Wang'}, {'authorId': '145066132', 'name': 'Bin Guo'}, {'authorId': '1690696', 'name': 'Leye Wang'}, {'authorId': '49904265', 'name': 'Tong Xin'}, {'authorId': '145357410', 'name': 'He Du'}, {'authorId': '2155550083', 'name': 'Huihui Chen'}, {'authorId': '2256618', 'name': 'Zhiwen Yu'}]",31.0,,45.0,CrowdWatch: Dynamic Sidewalk Obstacle Detection Using Mobile Crowd Sensing,2017.0

A simulation under the two-group situation was used to examine changes in the GFIs (ΔGFIs) when invariance constraints were added. Based on the results, we recommend using Δcomparative fit index, ΔGamma hat, and ΔMcDonald's Noncentrality Index to evaluate measurement invariance.

JBTs provide a cognitive measure of optimism and/or pessimism by recording behavioral responses to ambiguous stimuli. For instance, a negative emotional state is expected to produce a negative or pessimistic judgment of an ambiguous stimulus, whereas a positive emotional state produces a positive or optimistic judgment of the same ambiguous stimulus. Measuring an animal’s emotional state or mood is relevant in both animal welfare research and biomedical research. This is reflected in the increasing use of JBTs in both research areas. We discuss the different implementations of JBTs with animals, with a focus on their potential as an accurate measure of emotional state. JBTs have been successfully applied to a very broad range of species, using many different types of testing equipment and experimental protocols. However, further validation of this test is deemed necessary. For example, the often extensive training period required for successful judgment bias testing remains a possible factor confounding results. Also, the issue of ambiguous stimuli losing their ambiguity with repeated testing requires additional attention. Possible improvements are suggested to further develop the JBTs in both animal welfare and biomedical research.","[{'authorId': '32144762', 'name': 'S. Roelofs'}, {'authorId': '5577164', 'name': 'H.

We introduce a class of estimating equations that give consistent estimates of the regression parameters and of their variance under mild assumptions about the time dependence. The estimating equations are derived without specifying the joint distribution of a subject's observations yet they reduce to the score equations for multivariate Gaussian outcomes. Asymptotic theory is presented for the general class of estimators. Specific cases in which we assume independence, m-dependence and exchangeable correlation structures from each subject are discussed. Efficiency of the proposed estimators in two simple situations is considered. The approach is closely related to quasi-likelih ood.

In addition, it seeks to discuss studies on the crossover of wellbeing from employees to their colleagues in the workplace. It aims to discuss possible moderators of the crossover effect and delineate a research agenda.Design/methodology/approach – The paper takes the form of a literature review.Findings – The review of the literature shows that strain may spillover from work to home, and consequently influence, the wellbeing of one's partner. Additionally, the paper discusses recent studies documenting that the enthusiasm for one's work may cross over to the partner as well. Furthermore, research has shown that employees influence one another in the workplace. Several conditions may facilitate such crossover, including the frequency of interactions, empathy, susceptibility to contagion, and similarity.

Results demonstrated that autonomic reactivity was moderated by the presence of a companion, the nature of whom was critical to the size and direction of the effect. Ss in the friend condition exhibited higher physiological reactivity and poorer performance than subjects in the control and pet conditions. Ss in the pet condition showed less physiological reactivity during stressful tasks than Ss in the other conditions. The results are interpreted in terms of the degree to which friends and pets are perceived as evaluative during stressful task performance.

Mental health support, in the form of formal or remote sessions, has been shown to be helpful to health care staff, despite the organizational difficulties in an emergency. During the first emergence of COVID-19 in Italy, the Scientific Institute for Research, Hospitalization and Health Care Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo Foundation (Pavia, Lombardy), the Italian hospital that treated “patient 1,” has activated an agreement with the Soleterre Foundation, an international Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) that manages health emergency projects, to provide psychological support. A task force of psychologists was created with the aim of designing and administering a Therapeutic Mental Health Assessment for COVID-19 Care Workers (TMHA COVID-19 CWs) to evaluate and support health care workers’ mental health. The assessment battery was developed to evaluate symptoms and behaviors associated with trauma and the corresponding maladaptive behaviors (the National Stressful Events Survey for PTSD-Short Scale “NSESSS” and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders “DSM-5” Self-Rated Level 1 transversal Symptom Measure—Adult). Once the TMHA COVID-19 CWs had been developed, the team of psychologists regularly visited healthcare staff in the ward to administer it. One hundred seven care workers (44 males, mean age 40 ± 15) across Intensive Care Units (ICUs), the emergency room and medical ward were administered the TMHA COVID-19 CWs. PTSD symptoms were reported as severe by 13% of the population. Depressive symptoms as severe for 7% and Anxiety symptoms as severe for 14%. Severe psychotic symptoms were experienced by 2% and severe suicidal thoughts by 1% of the population. The possibility of acting upon the results of the TMHA COVID-19 CWs allowed an early intervention through individual session beyond the cut-off level (moderate and severe symptoms) for PTSD in NSESSS. In fact, 280 individual support sessions were offered. Therefore, we considered our project a protective and support factor for healthcare workers’ mental well-being and we recommend implementing a mental health screening program in ward involved in COVID-19 patients’ care.","[{'authorId': '88115304', 'name': 'D.

We examined whether including basic abilities when training emotion regulation (mixed approach) leads to better outcomes than training emotion regulation directly (pure approach). Participants were students of business administration and management (n = 187 and n = 127 for different analyses) who received pure, mixed, or control training. Self-report and performance-based measures of ability-based EI were collected before and after training. Multiple group SEM found that the pure approach increased participants’ self-perceived ability to regulate emotions, whereas the mixed approach increased performance. These effects were stable for over 4 months. The results support the cascading model and suggest through training of more basic abilities can improve higher order abilities and that emotional abilities can improve even when they are not at the focus of a training.","[{'authorId': '148048981', 'name': 'S.

While significant advances have been made in identifying the neuronal structures and cells affected, a unifying theory that could explain the manifold autistic symptoms has still not emerged. Based on recent synaptic, cellular, molecular, microcircuit, and behavioral results obtained with the valproic acid (VPA) rat model of autism, we propose here a unifying hypothesis where the core pathology of the autistic brain is hyper-reactivity and hyper-plasticity of local neuronal circuits. Such excessive neuronal processing in circumscribed circuits is suggested to lead to hyper-perception, hyper-attention, and hyper-memory, which may lie at the heart of most autistic symptoms. In this view, the autistic spectrum are disorders of hyper-functionality, which turns debilitating, as opposed to disorders of hypo-functionality, as is often assumed. We discuss how excessive neuronal processing may render the world painfully intense when the neocortex is affected and even aversive when the amygdala is affected, leading to social and environmental withdrawal. Excessive neuronal learning is also hypothesized to rapidly lock down the individual into a small repertoire of secure behavioral routines that are obsessively repeated. We further discuss the key autistic neuropathologies and several of the main theories of autism and re-interpret them in the light of the hypothesized Intense World Syndrome.","[{'authorId': '1754307', 'name': 'H.

a18dee9bdbf77af4eb99106807b4dbcfdc4f8e75,"This paper presents an Emotion Network structure for modeling crowd emotions to simulate socially emotional crowds. The emotion model focuses on entire crowds, builds individual emotion spaces as network nodes, embodies psychological linkages with relationship arcs, and clusters emotionally homogeneous crowds into EmotionTrees. According to the maximum value of the emotion component and the psychological distance, crowds are initialized as different trees. With relational distributions of crowd changes, agents move between different subgroups. Then, we construct emotion-oriented commands with subgroup constraints according to intergroup emotion theory. For execution, motion variables are calculated from emotion commands (i.e., emotion source-oriented orientation, and velocity and emotion strength-based motion clip selection). Experiments on bystanders, football fans, violent protestors, and guided marching behaviors demonstrate that the Emotion Network can improve crowd behavior modeling with particular attention to the impacts of group constraints and emotional characteristics, which can reflect environment stimuli and changes. The model can be integrated into physical crowd simulators as a high-level emotion manager, providing intelligent emotional support in improving the realism of human-like crowds.","[{'authorId': '144522284', 'name': 'Lei Lyu'}, {'authorId': '49051568', 'name': 'Jinling Zhang'}]",5.0,,53.0,Toward Modeling Emotional Crowds,2018.0

Empathy most probably evolved to facilitate parental care, so the current study assessed whether birds responded to an aversive stimulus directed at their chicks. Domestic hens were exposed to two replicates of the following conditions in a counterbalanced order: control (C; hen and chicks undisturbed), air puff to chicks (APC; air puff directed at chicks at 30 s intervals), air puff to hen (APH; air puff directed at hen at 30 s intervals) and control with noise (CN; noise of air puff at 30 s intervals). During each test, the hens' behaviour and physiology were measured throughout a 10 min pre-treatment and a 10 min treatment period. Hens responded to APH and APC treatments with increased alertness, decreased preening behaviour and a reduction in eye temperature. No such changes occurred during any control period. Increased heart rate and maternal vocalization occurred exclusively during the APC treatment, even though chicks produced few distress vocalizations. The pronounced and specific reaction observed indicates that adult female birds possess at least one of the essential underpinning attributes of empathy.","[{'authorId': '47112158', 'name': 'J.

Yet, empirical evidence for backing up simulation is scarce. In this contribution, we present three new groups of experiments that we conducted in different geometries. We varied parameters such as the width of the doors, the initial location and number of pedestrians which in turn affected their perception of the environment. We extracted and analysed relevant indicators such as distance to the exits and density levels. The results put in evidence the fact that pedestrians use time-dependent information to optimize their exit choice, and that, in congested states, a load balancing over the exits occurs. We propose a minimal modelling approach that covers those situations, especially the cases where the geometry does not show a symmetrical configuration. Most of the models try to achieve the load balancing by simulating the system and solving optimization problems. We show statistically and by simulation that a linear model based on the distance to the exits and the density levels around the exit can be an efficient dynamical alternative.","[{'authorId': '7151619', 'name': 'A.

Emotion work is usually studied from one of two perspectives, a job or an individual perspective. In this study, we assessed the relative importance of these two perspectives in predicting emotional exhaustion. More than 200 teachers completed a questionnaire comprising the DISQ (Demand‐Induced Strain Compensation Questionnaire), the Dutch Questionnaire on Emotional Labour (D‐QEL), and the UBOS (Utrechtse Burnout Schaal [Utrecht Burnout Scale]). In line with previous studies, our findings indicated that emotional exhaustion is positively associated with emotional job demands and surface acting. The relative importance of the two operationalisations of emotion work was assessed by comparing the results of two regression analyses. Whereas the model with job demands explained 18% of the variance, the model with emotional labour explained only 5%. In understanding what might contribute to emotional exhaustion in teachers, the emotional job demands might be much more important than the self‐regulation perspective that is measured with emotional labour.","[{'authorId': '5012777', 'name': 'G.

When sprayed with oxytocin, subjects initiated play sessions more often and played for longer periods of time than when sprayed with saline. Furthermore, after oxytocin nasal intake dogs displayed play signals more often than after saline administration, suggesting that oxytocin enhances dogs' play motivation.

It was unresponsive to physical pain (emotion–pain = 92% discriminative accuracy), demonstrating that it is not a representation of generalized arousal or salience. The signature was comprised of mesoscale patterns spanning multiple cortical and subcortical systems, with no single system necessary or sufficient for predicting experience. Furthermore, it was not reducible to activity in traditional “emotion-related” regions (e.g., amygdala, insula) or resting-state networks (e.g., “salience,” “default mode”).

In addition, profound neuroendocrine and neurobiological adaptations have been described with respect to behavioural and neuroendocrine stress responsiveness in rodents and human mothers. Thus, the hormonal response of the hypothalamo‐pituitary‐adrenal (HPA) axis and the response of the sympathetic nervous system to emotional and physical stressors are severely attenuated. Moreover, anxiety‐related behaviour and emotional responsiveness to stressful stimuli are reduced with the result of general calmness. These complex adaptations of the maternal brain are likely to be a consequence of an increased activity of brain systems with inhibitory effects on the HPA axis (such as the oxytocin and prolactin systems) and of a reduced activity of excitatory pathways (noradrenaline (norepinephrine), corticotrophin‐releasing factor and opioids). Experimental manipulation of these systems using complementary approaches indeed demonstrates their importance in these maternal brain adaptations. Maternal stress adaptations are not only important for the healthy prenatal development of the offspring by preventing excessive glucocorticoid responses and in the promotion of postnatal maternal behaviour, but are also vital for the well‐being of the mother and her mental health.","[{'authorId': '3131148', 'name': 'D.

a2de57646e941e4a1c4e9c2a13ba1be716cf2a9f,"The present study used pleasant and unpleasant music to evoke emotion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine neural correlates of emotion processing. Unpleasant (permanently dissonant) music contrasted with pleasant (consonant) music showed activations of amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and temporal poles. These structures have previously been implicated in the emotional processing of stimuli with (negative) emotional valence; the present data show that a cerebral network comprising these structures can be activated during the perception of auditory (musical) information. Pleasant (contrasted to unpleasant) music showed activations of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, inferior Brodmann's area (BA) 44, BA 45, and BA 46), the anterior superior insula, the ventral striatum, Heschl's gyrus, and the Rolandic operculum. IFG activations appear to reflect processes of music–syntactic analysis and working memory operations. Activations of Rolandic opercular areas possibly reflect the activation of mirror‐function mechanisms during the perception of the pleasant tunes.

Although scientists overwhelmingly agree that valence is a basic psychological phenomenon, debate continues about how to best conceptualize it scientifically. We used a meta-analysis of 397 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography studies (containing 914 experimental contrasts and 6827 participants) to test 3 competing hypotheses about the brain basis of valence: the bipolarity hypothesis that positive and negative affect are supported by a brain system that monotonically increases and/or decreases along the valence dimension, the bivalent hypothesis that positive and negative affect are supported by independent brain systems, and the affective workspace hypothesis that positive and negative affect are supported by a flexible set of valence-general regions. We found little evidence for the bipolar or bivalent hypotheses. Findings instead supported the hypothesis that, at the level of brain activity measurable by fMRI, valence is flexibly implemented across instances by a set of valence-general limbic and paralimbic brain regions.","[{'authorId': '2593387', 'name': 'Kristen A.

To show that members of a preliterate culture who had minimal exposure to literate cultures would associate the same emotion concepts with the same facial behaviors as do members of Western and Eastern literate cultures, data were gathered in New Guinea by telling subjects a story, showing them a set of three faces, and asking them to select the face which showed the emotion appropriate to the story.

a3f99332afe645b3d04c7c73086d5996fa48c4a1,"The emotional power of music has been much examined and discussed. Based on new research, this book takes a close look at how music expresses and arouses emotions, and how it becomes an object of aesthetic judgments. It asks: can music really arouse emotions? If so, which emotions? How, exactly, does music arouse such emotions? Why do listeners often respond with different emotions to the same piece of music? Are emotions to music different from other emotions? Why do we respond to fictive events in art as if they were real, even though we know they are not? What is it that makes a performance of music emotionally expressive? Music is often regarded as consisting of abstract sequences of notes, which are devoid of meanings. This book argues that this is not true. Adopting an evolutionary perspective, the book shows how psychological mechanisms from our ancient past engage with meanings in music at multiple levels of the brain to evoke a broad variety of affective states — from startle responses to profound aesthetic emotions. Finally, it asks: but why do these mechanisms respond to music?","[{'authorId': '2663281', 'name': 'P. Juslin'}]",52.0,,0.0,Musical Emotions Explained,2019.0

Personality research indicates that life-satisfaction judgments are quite stable over extended periods of time and predicted by personality traits. The present article integrates these two research traditions. We propose that people rely on the same sources to form repeated life-satisfaction judgments over time. Some of these sources (e.g., memories of emotional experiences, academic performance) provide stable information that explains the stability in life-satisfaction judgments. Second, we propose that the influence of personality traits on life satisfaction is mediated by the use of chronically accessible sources because traits produce stability of these sources. Most important, the influence of extraversion and neuroticism is mediated by use of memories of past emotional experiences. To test this model, participants repeatedly judged life-satisfaction over the course of a semester. After each assessment, participants reported sources that they used for these judgments. Changes in reported sources were related to changes in life-satisfaction judgments. A path model demonstrated that chronically accessible and stable sources are related to stable individual differences in life-satisfaction. Furthermore, the model supported the hypothesis that personality effects were mediated by chronically accessible and stable sources. In sum, the results are consistent with our theory that life-satisfaction judgments are based on chronically accessible sources.","[{'authorId': '3888371', 'name': 'U.

a50b8219ccb29d6401c255be20cb8809269e3ad1,"It has been repeatedly shown that sad music induces mainly pleasant or mixed emotions, and is particularly relevant for self-regulation goals. However, this is not entirely compatible with the view that sadness is one of the basic emotions experienced in the face of an unpleasant event or a loss. Also, a distinction between grief and sadness is often drawn, which seemingly does not have relevance in relation to musical experiences. The discrepancy between the positive accounts of emotions associated with sad music and those present in ordinary sadness may be related to the previously unacknowledged spectrum of affects associated with music-related sadness. The present study aims to expose the underlying affective experiences of music-related sadness. To examine this, a large qualitative data, consisting of open-ended answers from 363 participants, was subjected to thematic content analysis. The analysis revealed a range of emotions experienced which were classified into three themes: Grief, Melancholia, and Sweet sorrow. These themes differed depending on the valence of the overall experience and the contextual aspects. In addition, emotion induction mechanisms distinguished the themes and several previously unidentified types of affect regulation were observed. Variations in the ways people conceptualise sadness and music lead to differences in the affect regulation processes. In contrast to past research, the results suggest that truly negative emotions are relevant in association with music-related sadness. Dividing the music-evoked sadness into different categories of affective experiences helps to explain the current discrepancies and paradoxes surrounding sadness and music.","[{'authorId': '3358478', 'name': 'Henna-Riikka Peltola'}, {'authorId': '2804198', 'name': 'T.

We provide experimental evidence that emotional contagion occurs without direct interaction between people (exposure to a friend expressing an emotion is sufficient), and in the complete absence of nonverbal cues. Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’ positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.","[{'authorId': '1845400', 'name': 'Adam D.

The effect of EI on improving business performance is widely acknowledged in business and management studies. However, there is limited research in the context of tourism and hospitality industries. The paper contributes to the literature through a qualitative study of the perceptions and experiences of middle-level managers. Data was collected through semi-structured in-depth interviews conducted in tourism and hospitality organisations in the UK. The findings of the study reveal that EI can have a positive contribution to improving staff satisfaction, motivation and overall business productivity. They highlight the importance of building quality relationships among staff and the critical role middle management has in an organisation. Based on the finding from the qualitative inquiry, the authors propose a model conceptualising the role of managers’ EI in creating a competitive advantage for the organisation. Practical implications are discussed and recommendations for further research are provided.","[{'authorId': '1418646236', 'name': 'S. Stoyanova-Bozhkova'}, {'authorId': '97826703', 'name': 'T.

After participating in this educational activity, the physician should be better able to 1. Identify the biological role of oxytocin in forming attachments. 2. Evaluate the relationship between various neuropsychiatric disorders and oxytocin. 3. Identify clinical implications of using oxytocin to treat various neuropsychiatric disorders. Oxytocin is a peptide hormone integral in parturition, milk letdown, and maternal behaviors that has been demonstrated in animal studies to be important in the formation of pair bonds and in social behaviors. This hormone is increasingly recognized as an important regulator of human social behaviors, including social decision making, evaluating and responding to social stimuli, mediating social interactions, and forming social memories. In addition, oxytocin is intricately involved in a broad array of neuropsychiatric functions and may be a common factor important in multiple psychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, and mood and anxiety disorders. This review article examines the extant literature on the evidence for oxytocin dysfunction in a variety of psychiatric disorders and highlights the need for further research to understand the complex role of the oxytocin system in psychiatric disease and thus pave the way for developing new therapeutic modalities. Articles were selected that involved human participants with various psychiatric disorders and that either compared oxytocin biology to healthy controls or examined the effects of exogenous oxytocin administration.","[{'authorId': '2060087291', 'name': 'David M.

Forebrain serotonin receptors and the response to serotonin drugs are altered in BTBR mice, yet it remains unknown if serotonin neurons themselves are abnormal. In this study, we found that serotonin tissue content and the density of serotonin axons is reduced in the hippocampus of BTBR mice in comparison to C57BL/6J (C57) mice. This was accompanied by possible compensatory changes in serotonin neurons that were most pronounced in regions known to provide innervation to the hippocampus: the caudal dorsal raphe (B6) and the median raphe. These changes included increased numbers of serotonin neurons and hyperactivation of Fos expression. Metrics of serotonin neurons in the rostral 2/3 of the dorsal raphe and serotonin content of the prefrontal cortex were less impacted.

Clinical, psychological, and neurobiological clues suggest a link between yawn contagion and empathy in humans (Homo sapiens). However, no behavioral evidence has been provided so far. We tested the effect of different variables (e.g., country of origin, sex, yawn characteristics) on yawn contagion by running mixed models applied to observational data collected over 1 year on adult (>16 years old) human subjects. Only social bonding predicted the occurrence, frequency, and latency of yawn contagion. As with other measures of empathy, the rate of contagion was greatest in response to kin, then friends, then acquaintances, and lastly strangers. Related individuals (r≥0.25) showed the greatest contagion, in terms of both occurrence of yawning and frequency of yawns. Strangers and acquaintances showed a longer delay in the yawn response (latency) compared to friends and kin. This outcome suggests that the neuronal activation magnitude related to yawn contagion can differ as a function of subject familiarity. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that yawn contagion is primarily driven by the emotional closeness between individuals and not by other variables, such as gender and nationality.","[{'authorId': '3334949', 'name': 'I.

The main characteristic of the considered systems is that they can be viewed as a class of multi-input multioutput systems in the nonstrict feedback structure. The similar control problem of this class of systems has been addressed in the past, but it focused on the continuous-time systems. Due to the complicacies of the system structure, it will become more difficult for the controller design and the stability analysis. To stabilize this class of systems, a new recursive procedure is developed, and the effect caused by the noncausal problem in the nonstrict feedback DT structure can be solved using a semirecurrent neural approximation. Based on the Lyapunov difference approach, it is proved that all the signals of the closed-loop system are semiglobal, ultimately uniformly bounded, and a good tracking performance can be guaranteed. The feasibility of the proposed controllers can be validated by setting a simulation example.","[{'authorId': '49421161', 'name': 'Yanjun Liu'}, {'authorId': '2116725207', 'name': 'Shu Li'}, {'authorId': '144112964', 'name': 'Shaocheng Tong'}, {'authorId': '1697202', 'name': 'C.

Smart city applications focus on resolving issues facing people in everyday life, and have attracted a considerable amount of research interest. The typical issue encountered in such places of daily use, such as stations, shopping malls, and stadiums is crowd dynamics management. Therefore, we focus on crowd dynamics management to resolve the problem of congestion using IoT technologies. Real-time crowd dynamics management can be achieved by gathering information relating to congestion and propose less crowded places. Although many crowd dynamics management applications have been proposed in various scenarios and many models have been devised to this end, a general model for evaluating the control effectiveness of crowd dynamics management has not yet been developed in IoT research. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a model to evaluate the performance of crowd dynamics management applications. In other words, the objective of this paper is to present the proof-of-concept of control effectiveness of crowd dynamics management. Our model uses feedback control theory, and enables an integrated evaluation of the control effectiveness of crowd dynamics management methods under various scenarios.

This is consistent with the maximum of inverse TMR observed at 20.4 V for Co/STO/LSMO junctions (Fig. 3A). For a positive bias, the TMR is expected to change sign and become normal above 1 V when the Fermi level of LSMO goes down into the energy range of the majority spin d-band of Co. This is also observed in Fig. 3A. For ALO and ALO/STO barriers, a predominant tunneling of s-character electrons (see arrow in Fig. 2B) is the usual explanation of the positive polarization (6–8). The rapid drop with bias (Fig. 3B) is similar to what has been observed in most junctions with ALO barriers, and completely different from what is obtained when the tunneling is predominantly by d-character electrons (Fig. 3A). The origin of this rapid decrease of the TMR at relatively small bias has never been clearly explained. This is roughly consistent with the energy dependence of the DOS induced by sp-d bonding effects on the first atomic layer of ALO in the calculation of Nguyen-Mahn et al. (8) for the Co-ALO interface. But Zhang et al. (13) have also shown that a large part of the TMR drop can be attributed to the excitation of spin waves. The experiments reported here and in several recent publications (3, 4) demonstrate the important role of the electronic structure of the metal-oxide interface in determining the spin polarization of the tunneling electrons. The negative polarization for the Co-STO interface has been ascribed to d-d bonding effects between Al and Ti (4). This interpretation is similar to that proposed to explain, in terms of sp-d bonding, the positive polarization at the Co-ALO interface (8). However, there is no general theory predicting the trend of the experimental results for Co—that is, a negative polarization with oxides of d elements (STO, CLO, Ta2O5) and a positive one when there are only s and p states (ALO). It is likely that the spin polarization should also depend on the position of the Fermi level with respect to the electronic levels of each character above and below the gap of the insulator. In addition, as an evanescent wave in an insulator is a Bloch wave with an imaginary wave vector, one can expect different decay lengths for Bloch waves of different character. This means that the final polarization could also depend on the thickness of the barrier, as illustrated by the calculations of MacLaren et al. for Fe/ZnSe/Fe junctions (14). The influence of the barrier on the spin polarization opens new ways to shape and optimize the TMR. Interesting bias dependencies can be obtained with barriers selecting the d electrons and probing the fine structure of the d-DOS, as in Fig. 3A. The DOS of a d-band can also be easily tailored by alloying (for example, by introduction of virtual bound states) to produce specific bias dependencies. Although here we concentrated on the problem of the spin polarization of the Co electrode and regarded the strongly spin-polarized LSMO only as a useful spin analyzer, the large TMR ratios obtained by combining Co and LSMO electrodes (50% with a STO barrier) are also an interesting result. The drawback arising from the low Curie temperature of LSMO (;350 K) is the reduction of the TMR at room temperature, down to about 5% at 300 K in Co/STO/ LSMO (4). However, other types of oxides of the double-perovskite family (for example, Sr2FeMoO6) combine electronic properties similar to those of manganites with a definitely higher Curie temperature (15). Their use in magnetic tunnel junctions is promising for a new generation of tunnel junctions with very high magnetoresistance for room-temperature applications.","[{'authorId': '49460476', 'name': 'B.

The current study compared two perspectives of emotional labor as predictors of burnout beyond the effects of negative affectivity: job-focused emotional labor (work demands regarding emotion expression) and employee-focused emotional labor (regulation of feelings and emotional expression). Significant differences existed in the emotional demands reported by five occupational groupings. The use of surface-level emotional labor, or faking, predicted depersonalization beyond the work demands. Perceiving the demand to display positive emotions and using deep-level regulation were associated with a heightened sense of personal accomplishment, suggesting positive benefits to this aspect of work.

Two studies evaluated whether RFRs to faces are solely nonaffective motor responses or whether emotional processes are involved. Brow (corrugator, related to anger) and forehead (frontalis, related to fear) activity were recorded using facial electromyography (EMG) while undergraduates in two conditions (fear induction vs. neutral) viewed fear, anger, and neutral facial expressions. As predicted, fear induction increased fear expressions to angry faces within 1000 ms of exposure, demonstrating an emotional component of RFRs. This did not merely reflect increased fear from the induction, because responses to neutral faces were unaffected. Considering RFRs to be merely nonaffective automatic reactions is inaccurate. RFRs are not purely motor mimicry; emotion influences early facial responses to faces.

AutoTutor is an intelligent tutoring system that helps students compose explanations of difficult concepts in Newtonian physics and enhances computer literacy and critical thinking by interacting with them in natural language with adaptive dialog moves similar to those of human tutors. AutoTutor constructs a cognitive model of students' knowledge levels by analyzing the text of their typed or spoken responses to its questions. The model is used to dynamically tailor the interaction toward individual students' zones of proximal development. Affective AutoTutor takes the individualized instruction and human-like interactivity to a new level by automatically detecting and responding to students' emotional states in addition to their cognitive states. Over 20 controlled experiments comparing AutoTutor with ecological and experimental controls such reading a textbook have consistently yielded learning improvements of approximately one letter grade after brief 30--60-minute interactions. Furthermore, Affective AutoTutor shows even more dramatic improvements in learning than the original AutoTutor system, particularly for struggling students with low domain knowledge. In addition to providing a detailed description of the implementation and evaluation of AutoTutor and Affective AutoTutor, we also discuss new and exciting technologies motivated by AutoTutor such as AutoTutor-Lite, Operation ARIES, GuruTutor, DeepTutor, MetaTutor, and AutoMentor.

In this study, we aimed to identify a direct link between the vmPFC and conformity tendencies by means of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Conformity tendencies are measured by the probability that participants change their decisions when they observe the majority responses. In our experiment, subjects could make two decisions in each trial, once without social information and once with social information, which allowed us to directly observe the conformity tendency of subjects in different conditions. We found that cathodal stimulation of the vmPFC significantly increased conformity tendency and decreased response time when the initial decision of participants differs from the majority opinion. Based on the experimental results, our study suggests that the vmPFC mainly inhibits and regulates the informational conformity behavior. These findings complement investigations of the neural mechanism of conformity and the role of the vmPFC in the neural circuit behind conformity behavior.","[{'authorId': '2154568632', 'name': 'Yuzhen Li'}, {'authorId': '2110177342', 'name': 'Jinjin Wang'}, {'authorId': '47998857', 'name': 'Hang Ye'}, {'authorId': '48300235', 'name': 'Jun Luo'}]",8.0,,73.0,Modulating the Activity of vmPFC Regulates Informational Social Conformity: A tDCS Study,2020.0

After controlling demographic and human capital variables, such as, gender, age, marriage, educational level and organizational tenure, hierarchical linear modeling results revealed that work team leaders’ psychological capital was positively related to their direct followers’ organizational citizenship behavior, work team members’ psychological capital was a cross-level mediator between work team leaders’ psychological capital and their followers’ organizational citizenship behavior. However, this research didn’t support the hypothesis that the relationship between work team members’ psychological capital and organizational citizenship behavior was moderated by work team leaders’ psychological capital such that the relationship was stronger when work team leaders’ psychological capital was perceived to be high versus low. This finding was different from that of western organizational background. Our findings revealed that both work team leaders and members’ psychological capital were positively associated with work team members’ organizational citizenship behavior. The result suggested that psychological capital, especially work team leaders’ psychological capital, was a key element for constructing efficient work teams. Entrepreneurs could do everything possible to improve work team leaders and members’ psychological capital to enhance work team efficiency and organizational performance.","[{'authorId': '2054467909', 'name': 'Ren Hao'}, {'authorId': '72744394', 'name': 'Wen Zhonglin'}, {'authorId': '66148041', 'name': 'Chen Qi-shan'}, {'authorId': '73461964', 'name': 'Ye Bao-juan'}]",11.0,,68.0,The Impact Mechanism of Work Team Leaders’ Psychological Capital on Followers’ Organizational Citizenship Behavior: A Multilevel Model,2013.0

The theory provides tools for predicting both the sequences of emotional development and the ways emotions shape development. Emotions are characterised in terms of three component models: (a) the process of emotion generation from event appraisal, (b) a hierarchy of emotion categories organised around a handful of basic-emotion families, and (c) a characterisation of emotions in terms of prototypic event scripts. The basic emotions and the positive vs. negative hedonic components of emotions function as constraints or organisers that shape behaviour whenever an emotion is activated. Through these patterning effects, emotions shape both short-term behavioural organisation and long-term development. The skill-development component of the theory explains how, as children grow, they construct and control increasingly complex skills—which affect many aspects ...","[{'authorId': '29712860', 'name': 'K.

Fourteen restaurateurs and managers were interviewed, including two internationally renowned food and beverage entrepreneurs. The findings reveal that Peru's culinary potential is identified in various specific forms, including through the growing interest for local gastronomy among international visitors, the development of culinary neighbourhoods, the growing trend of pairing of foods and local beverages, and experimenting with lesser known local foods and dishes. Nonetheless, to maximise CT's potential, improved organisation within the industry, more knowledge dissemination of Peruvian cuisine domestically and internationally, and promoting other traditional products/dishes to maintain the momentum are vital. The usefulness of the proposed framework is presented, the implications of the findings discussed, and future research streams proposed.","[{'authorId': '1654676269', 'name': 'Abel Duarte Alonso'}, {'authorId': '101043530', 'name': 'S.

a93e0a41eaf609a9962ff61eb662ada0ce4fdf42,"IntroductionOrganizations operating in emerging competitive markets like Ghana must strive for service perfection consciously to win customers and to remain competitive. This can be achieved through improved service quality, as noted by leading proponents like Gronroos (2001), Kotler and Keller (2006), and Lovelock and Wirtz (2007). Corporate competitiveness, especially in current times, is anchored around service quality, customer loyalty and customer satisfaction (Parasuraman et al., 1988; Rust and Oliver, 1994; Zeithaml and Bitner, 2003; and Voss et al., 2004). However, service quality is intuitively evaluated through customers' perceived perspective measured through experience (Gronroos, 1982; and Nimako et al., 2012).The telecom sector (like other service sectors) plays a significant role in improving the living standards of people around the world by facilitating information flow among individuals and businesses, especially in the current information age. In the case of the telecom sector, good quality telecom network and strong consumer-oriented strategy are essential to win and retain customers. Ghana, currently classified as a middle income economy (Ghana Statistical Service, 2010), experienced serious economic instability during the 1970s and 1980s, compelling the country to subscribe to International Monetary Fund and the World Bank's economic reforms (Dzogbenuku, 2013). This was done with the aim of diversifying the economy by reducing state control of firms, since most state-owned enterprises were described as non-performing assets, including the state-run Postal and Telecom organization. In 1994, the Government of Ghana deregulated the telecom sector and allowed new private multi-national entrants into the country, which led to fierce competition among the service providers (Addy-Nayo, 2001; Frempong and Henten, 2004; Ghana NCA, 2010; and Nimako et al., 2012).One of the resultant effects was the advent of Vodafone, a multinational, venturing into Ghana to takeover Ghana Telecom. Ghana Telecom, which was initially managed by Malaysian Telecommunications Company in the early 1990s, provided fixed telephone lines for homes and businesses, where hitherto customers had to queue in front of post offices to access telephone service. To increase customer base, the regulator-National Communications Authority (NCA)-licensed Milicom Ghana (now Tigo and Spacefon MTN) to provide mobile telecommunication service.The new private telecom firms, including Vodafone, pioneered rapid distribution of the new innovation (mobile phone) to Ghanaians between 2001 and 2007. These firms relied on creative integrative marketing communications and competitive pricing with market oriented distribution strategies to increase the adoption of mobile phones by Ghanaians (Dzogbenuku, 2013). Currently, the sector seems very competitive, with three additional players-Airtel, Expresso and Glo-providing similar voice and data services supported by heavy promotional budgets. This study aims at investigating if service quality significantly affects customer satisfaction and brand loyalty.Literature ReviewDistinct Characteristics of ServicesA service is any activity or benefit that one party can offer to another, which is essentially intangible and does not result in transfer of ownership (Kotler et al., 2008). Service being an economic activity, creates value for customers and also for the service organization. Services are also distinct from physical products as they (i.e., services) are not standardized. As a result, customers of services can evaluate them only after consuming them, based on experience. According to Doyle and Stern (2006), services have five distinctive characteristics which differentiate them from tangible products. These are-intangibility, inseparability, heterogeneity, perishability and intransferability.IntangibilityServices (unlike physical goods) cannot be seen, touched, tasted or smelled (Hill, 1999; and Miller, 2000). …","[{'authorId': '79982391', 'name': 'G.

Therefore, in order to have a more realistic model of rumor spreading on online social networks, the influence of psycho-sociological factors particularly those which affect users’ reactions toward rumor/anti-rumor should be considered. To this aim, we present a new model that considers the influence of dissenting opinions on those users who have already believed in rumor/anti-rumor but have not spread the rumor/anti-rumor yet. We hypothesize that influence is a motive for the believers to spread their beliefs in rumor/anti-rumor. We derive the stochastic equations of the new model and evaluate it by using two real datasets of rumor spreading on Twitter. The evaluation results support the new hypothesis and show that the novel model which is relied on the new hypothesis is able to better represent rumor spreading.","[{'authorId': '66141662', 'name': 'A.

About 90% of ASD individuals have atypical sensory experiences, described as both hyper- and hypo-reactivity, with abnormal responses to tactile stimulation representing a very frequent finding. In this review, we will address the neurobiological bases of sensory processing in ASD, with a specific focus of tactile sensitivity. In the first part, we will review the most relevant sensory abnormalities detected in ASD, and then focus on tactile processing deficits through the discussion of recent clinical and experimental studies. In the search for the neurobiological bases of ASD, several mouse models have been generated with knockout and humanized knockin mutations in many ASD-associated genes. Here, we will therefore give a brief overview of the anatomical structure of the mouse somatosensory system, and describe the somatosensory abnormalities so far reported in different mouse models of ASD. Understanding the neurobiological bases of sensory processing in ASD mouse models may represent an opportunity for a better comprehension of the mechanisms underlying sensory abnormalities, and for the development of novel effective therapeutic strategies.","[{'authorId': '1396023937', 'name': 'Luigi Balasco'}, {'authorId': '50419846', 'name': 'G.

Thus, the pedestrian's motion has many more degrees of freedom compared with existing discrete models. Furthermore, the walking speed is determined by the available space ahead of the pedestrians in a multi-step way. Therefore, the model can precisely describe the pedestrians' motion. Then, we calibrate model parameters by comparing with the existing measured data. Finally, we employ this model to investigate normal evacuation from a room. The conclusions are as follows: 1) In the single-exit room, for a given exit width larger than 0.6 m, the average specific flow increases with the initial number of pedestrians. For a given initial number of pedestrians, the specific flow increases first and then decreases when the width of the exit increases. 2) The evacuation time of the two-exit room is less than that of the single-exit room only when the total width is greater than 1.6 m.","[{'authorId': '102599771', 'name': 'Y.

This paper presents an exploratory look at the folk theory formation process and the interplay between folk theories and self-presentation via a 28-participant interview study.

Purpose
As a service segment, the food and beverage industry has great potential for intensive interface between the consumer and the service provider and between the service provider and the back of the house staff. Given the significance of the perception of the provision of service to the consumer, it is important to study every aspect of the interaction. With this in mind, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between emotional labor, service quality, purpose of consumption, satisfaction and customer loyalty as seen through the perceptions of the consumer.


Design/methodology/approach
Survey data were collected from 400 respondents using an online market research firm in the USA. This research used three independent variables (emotional labor, service quality and purpose of consumption), each with two levels in a between-subjects 2 × 2 × 2 factorial experimental design. Eight scenarios were used to represent the eight different combinations of variables to test their effects.


Findings
Two very interesting findings emerged from this study. The first was that consumers’ purpose of consumption, whether dining for leisure or business, had no significant impact on their satisfaction or loyalty, either independently or in conjunction with emotional labor or service quality. The second most interesting finding was that the interaction of service quality and emotional labor did have a significant impact on satisfaction but not loyalty.


Practical implications
A restaurants’ standards of service should be the same, regardless of the business or leisure demographic being served. Authenticity matters, and therefore, employers should incorporate personality evaluation into the hiring process. Perhaps, focusing more on attitude and less on skill would lead to great customer satisfaction and loyalty.


Originality/value
This article furthers the relatively young research stream examining the impacts of emotional labor on the consumer.

To realistically simulate the process of crowd emotional contagion, the influences of virtual cyberspace and physical cyberspace should be considered comprehensively. In addition, control strategies significantly affect the speed and scale of emotional contagion in a crowd. However, control strategies described by existing studies are inaccurate since few of them consider both physical and virtual cyberspace to jointly study the influence of control strategies on crowd emotional contagion. To achieve more accurate control, we first establish a novel personalized emotional contagion computational (NP-ECC) model to study control strategies of crowd emotional contagion coupling the physical and virtual cyberspace. Second, we construct a personalized BA scale-free network to calculate the phase transition threshold of the proposed NP-ECC model more accurately. Finally, we propose two algorithms, control strategies-BA (CS-BA) and threshold-BA (T-BA), to verify the stability of the NP-ECC model and the accuracy of the phase transition threshold, respectively. The experimental results show that our method can better control the speed and scale of crowd emotional contagion and thus can provide guidance for a large-scale crowd evacuation.","[{'authorId': '2112811106', 'name': 'Xiao Hong'}, {'authorId': '3172102', 'name': 'Guijuan Zhang'}, {'authorId': '7382513', 'name': 'Dianjie Lu'}]",5.0,"{'name': 'IEEE Access', 'pages': '37712-37726', 'volume': '8'}",55.0,Control Strategies for Crowd Emotional Contagion Coupling the Virtual and Physical Cyberspace in Emergencies,2020.0

Recent research indicates that functional integration between multi‐sensory, somato‐motor, default‐mode (DMN), and salience (SN) networks of the brain differentiates musicians from non‐musicians during resting state. Here, we aimed at determining whether brain networks differentially exchange information in musicians as opposed to non‐musicians during naturalistic music listening. Whole‐brain graph‐theory analyses were performed on participants' fMRI responses. Group‐level differences revealed that musicians' primary hubs comprised cerebral and cerebellar sensorimotor regions whereas non‐musicians' dominant hubs encompassed DMN‐related regions. Community structure analyses of the key hubs revealed greater integration of motor and somatosensory homunculi representing the upper limbs and torso in musicians. Furthermore, musicians who started training at an earlier age exhibited greater centrality in the auditory cortex, and areas related to top‐down processes, attention, emotion, somatosensory processing, and non‐verbal processing of speech. We here reveal how brain networks organize themselves in a naturalistic music listening situation wherein musicians automatically engage neural networks that are action‐based while non‐musicians use those that are perception‐based to process an incoming auditory stream.

The major objective of this study is to propose a theoretical model integrating emotional solidarity, emotional well-being, and residents’ attitude. In order to test the proposed model, a survey of residents in China was undertaken. Structural relational and mediation analyses were applied to assess the relationships involving residents’ emotional solidarity with tourists, emotional well-being, and residents’ attitude. The construct of emotional solidarity had three dimensions in the study: welcoming nature, sympathetic understanding, and emotional closeness. Results indicate that welcoming nature, sympathetic understanding, and emotional closeness directly influence residents’ attitude and emotional well-being. Additionally, the relationships involving residents’ welcoming nature, sympathetic understanding and emotional closeness with tourists, and attitude were mediated by emotional well-being. Theoretical and practical implications as well as future research opportunities are provided.","[{'authorId': '2116430935', 'name': 'Sujie Wang'}, {'authorId': '1742330399', 'name': 'Adiyukh Berbekova'}, {'authorId': '144875443', 'name': 'M.

aaa9108d0cd06ce1adbd7bc3fb44b105434fef5a,"ABSTRACT Traditionally, tourists’ emotional responses to advertising and associated stimuli have been assessed using self-report questionnaires. Image recognition software, such as FaceReader™ provides a means to analyse emotional responses to stimuli, specifically the type of emotion, valence (positive/negative) and arousal (intensity) via facial expressions. This research note reports on the benefits and drawbacks of FaceReader™. Respondents from Iran (5) and Australia (5) were invited to a laboratory to watch a tourism advertisement (ski resort in Iran). A video camera was used to record the facial expressions of respondents while viewing the advertisement. Results provide an indication that participants had overall low arousal and positive emotions while watching the tourism video. FaceReader™ proved useful for collecting and analysing real time data concerning seven discrete emotions plus valence and arousal. Since FaceReader™ is sensitive to light and participants with thick frame glasses, it is recommended that future studies apply this software with additional physiological and self-report measures to advance understanding of the measurement of emotions in the tourism field.","[{'authorId': '90586366', 'name': 'A.

Instead of conceptualizing anticipation as something a brain is able to do when circumstances seem to require it, this study proposes that anticipation is continuous and ongoing because to anticipate is an inherent design characteristic of the brain. Correspondingly, there is no anticipation module in the brain, and no focal lesion selectively abolishes the brain's propensity to anticipate. Anticipation is a wager based on previous experience. It readies a response to an event that has yet to occur. First, the anticipation is “embrained” in terms of covert neural representations, and then it is embodied in terms of rudiments of the embrained actions and expressions of feeling. This study applies this concept to conversation and shows that nested anticipations precede the dynamics of the actual encounter and continue at each turn as long as the conversation lasts.","[{'authorId': '4491856', 'name': 'M.

Here, we investigated whether this function is underpinned by motor simulation, that is the capacity to represent a perceived action in terms of the neural resources required to execute it. This was tested in a music performance experiment wherein on-line brain stimulation (double-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation, dTMS) was employed to interfere with motor simulation. Pianists played the right-hand part of piano pieces in synchrony with a recording of the left-hand part, which had (Trained) or had not (Untrained) been practiced beforehand. Training was assumed to enhance motor simulation. The task required adaptation to tempo changes in the left-hand part that, in critical conditions, were preceded by dTMS delivered over the right primary motor cortex. Accuracy of tempo adaptation following dTMS or sham stimulations was compared across Trained and Untrained conditions. Results indicate that dTMS impaired tempo adaptation accuracy only during the perception of trained actions. The magnitude of this interference was greater in empathic individuals possessing a strong tendency to adopt others' perspectives. These findings suggest that motor simulation provides a functional resource for the temporal coordination of one's own behaviour with others in dynamic social contexts.","[{'authorId': '3003003', 'name': 'G.

ab7158539f67982e7e9cf414d1e959687154c6bf,"Fragile X mental retardation is caused by silencing of the gene (FMR1) that encodes the RNA-binding protein (FMRP) that influences translation in neurons. A prominent feature of the human disorder is self-injurious behavior, suggesting an abnormality in pain processing. Moreover, FMRP regulates group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1/5)-dependent plasticity, which is known to contribute to nociceptive sensitization. We demonstrate here, using the Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mouse, that FMRP plays an important role in pain processing because Fmr1 KO mice showed (1) decreased (∼50%) responses to ongoing nociception (phase 2, formalin test), (2) a 3 week delay in the development of peripheral nerve injury-induced allodynia, and (3) a near absence of wind-up responses in ascending sensory fibers after repetitive C-fiber stimulation. We provide evidence that the behavioral deficits are related to a mGluR1/5- and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-mediated mechanism because (1) spinal mGluR5 antagonism failed to inhibit the second phase of the formalin test, and we observed a marked reduction in nociceptive response to an intrathecal injection of an mGluR1/5 agonist (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) in Fmr1 KO mice; (2) peripheral DHPG injection had no effect in KO mice yet evoked thermal hyperalgesia in wild types; and (3) the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin inhibited formalin- and DHPG-induced nociception in wild-type but not Fmr1 KO mice. These experiments show that translation regulation via FMRP and mTOR is an important feature of nociceptive plasticity. These observations also support the hypothesis that the persistence of self-injurious behavior observed in fragile X mental retardation patients could be related to deficits in nociceptive sensitization.","[{'authorId': '144336540', 'name': 'Theodore John Price'}, {'authorId': '14312957', 'name': 'M.

aba77d4a96b2a9707f80ed73ae2f032461769532,"Social Transmission of pain and relief In mice, both pain and fear can be transferred by short social contact from one animal to a bystander. Neurons in a brain region called the anterior cingulate cortex in the bystander animal mediate these transfers. However, the specific anterior cingulate projections involved in such empathy-related behaviors are unknown. Smith et al. found that projections from the anterior cingulate cortex to the nucleus accumbens are necessary for the social transfer of pain in mice (see the Perspective by Klein and Gogolla). Fear, however, was mediated by projections from the anterior cingulate cortex to the basolateral amygdala. Interestingly, in animals with pain, analgesia can also be transferred socially. Science, this issue p. 153; see also p. 122 In mice, distinct neuronal circuits are involved in empathy for companion animals who are observed to be experiencing pain or pain relief versus fear. INTRODUCTION Empathy, the adoption of another’s sensory and emotional state, plays a critical role in social interactions. Although, historically, empathy was often considered to be an affective-cognitive process experienced solely by humans, it is now appreciated that many species, including rodents, display evolutionarily conserved behavioral antecedents of empathy such as observational fear. It is therefore possible to begin to define the neural mechanisms that mediate behavioral manifestations of empathy in species that are optimal for application of modern circuit neuroscience tools. RATIONALE In both humans and rodents, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) appears to encode information about the affective state of others. However, little is known about which downstream targets of the ACC contribute to empathy-related behaviors. To address this topic, we optimized a protocol for the social transfer of pain behavior in mice and compared the ACC-dependent neural circuitry responsible for this behavior with the ACC neural circuitry required for the social transfer of two related behavioral states: analgesia and fear. These behaviors exhibit a key component of empathy, the adoption of another’s sensory and affective state. RESULTS A 1-hour social interaction between a bystander mouse and a cagemate experiencing inflammatory pain led to mechanical hyperalgesia in the bystander mouse, which lasted 4 hours but not 24 hours. This social transfer of pain was also evident after thermal testing and led to affective changes that were detected by a conspecific. The social interaction led to activation of neurons in the ACC and several downstream targets, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which was revealed by monosynaptic rabies virus tracing to be directly connected to the ACC. Bidirectional manipulation of activity in ACC-to-NAc inputs influenced the acquisition of socially transferred pain but not the expression of the mechanical sensitivity used to assay pain thresholds. A behavioral protocol revealed the rapid social transfer of analgesia, which also required activity in ACC-to-NAc inputs. By contrast, ACC-to-NAc input activity was not required for the social transfer of fear, which instead required activity in ACC projections to the basolateral amygdala (BLA). CONCLUSION We established that mice rapidly adopt the sensory-affective state of a social partner, regardless of the valance of the information (that is, pain, fear, or pain relief). We find that the ACC generates specific and appropriate empathic behavioral responses through distinct downstream targets. Specifically, ACC-to-NAc input activity is necessary for the social transfer of pain and analgesia but not the social transfer of fear, which instead requires ACC-to-BLA input activity. Elucidating circuit-specific mechanisms that mediate various forms of empathy in experimentally accessible animal models is necessary for generating hypotheses that can be evaluated in human subjects using noninvasive assays. More sophisticated understanding of evolutionarily conserved brain mechanisms of empathy will also expedite the development of new therapies for the empathy-related deficits associated with a broad range of neuropsychiatric disorders. Distinct ACC neural circuits mediate social transfer of pain states and fear. Complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA)–induced pain is transferred from cagemates to bystanders after a 1-hour social interaction. Bystanders also exhibit pain relief after interacting with cagemates that are experiencing pain and morphine analgesia. The social transfer of pain and analgesia both require ACC-to-NAc projections, whereas the social transfer of fear requires ACC projections to the BLA. Data represent mean ± SEM; dashed line indicates mean baseline threshold for all groups; **P < 0.01 and ****P < 0.0001. Empathy is an essential component of social communication that involves experiencing others’ sensory and emotional states. We observed that a brief social interaction with a mouse experiencing pain or morphine analgesia resulted in the transfer of these experiences to its social partner. Optogenetic manipulations demonstrated that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and its projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) were selectively involved in the social transfer of both pain and analgesia. By contrast, the ACC→NAc circuit was not necessary for the social transfer of fear, which instead depended on ACC projections to the basolateral amygdala. These findings reveal that the ACC, a brain area strongly implicated in human empathic responses, mediates distinct forms of empathy in mice by influencing different downstream targets.","[{'authorId': '48533903', 'name': 'Monique L.

However, little attention has been paid to timbre as a possible mediator between musical embodiment and affect. In three experiments, we investigated the embodied dimensions of timbre perception by focusing on timbral qualities considered “noisy” and aversive. In Experiment 1, participants rated brief isolated natural timbres scaled into ordinal levels of “noisiness.” Experiment 2 employed the same design with a focus on polyphonic timbre, using brief (400 ms) excerpts from 6 popular music genres as stimuli. In Experiment 3, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to explore neural activations associated with perception of stimuli from Experiment 1. Converging results from behavioral, acoustical, and fMRI data suggest a motor component to timbre processing, particularly timbral qualities considered “noisy,” indicating a possible enactive mechanism in timbre processing. Activity in somatomotor areas, insula, and the limbic system increased the more participants disliked a timbre, and connectivity between the premotor cortex and insula relay decreased.

Participants reported their general preferences for emotional support before the interaction, and afterward they evaluated support adequacy and their partner's supportiveness during the interaction. Observers rated the emotional support provided, and salivary cortisol indexed changes in stress. As predicted, the positive association between a partner's provision of emotional support and rate of stress recovery was greater for people who reported a greater preference for emotional support, in general, and people who evaluated their partner's support during the interaction as more, compared to less, adequate.

ac2a900e4b32c2cdc717a29d33515652704f2b94,"In a crisis situation, negative emotions often spread among the crowd, and they have adverse impacts on human decisions, resulting in stampedes and crushes. Safety officers are often dispatched to scenes of emergencies because their positive emotions can calm the crowd down and avoid serious accidents. However, how to utilize the positive emotional contagion to maximize the “calm-down” effect remains a challenging problem in crowd evacuation. In this paper, we present an approach for optimizing positive emotional contagion in crowd evacuation. First, a computational model of positive emotional contagion is proposed to describe how safety officers calm a crowd down. To capture important influential factors for positive emotional contagion, such as the trust relationships among the individuals involved in a crisis situation and the variations of emotional contagion speed, we construct a trust-based emotional contagion network (Trust-ECN) and a heterogeneous emotional contagion speed computation model (HECS-CM). Based on these models, the emotional contagion process can be analyzed in a parametric way, and the infection probability for each individual in a given time window can be computed analytically with a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). Second, a maximization problem of emotional contagion is formulated. Since this optimization problem is NP-hard, an artificial bee colony optimized emotional contagion (ABCEC) algorithm is used to solve for the optimal positions of safety officers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both synthetic and real-world data at different scales. Finally, we implement a crowd simulation system to visualize the results of our theoretical analysis in a graphical manner. The proposed method can provide guidance for emergency response management.","[{'authorId': '3172102', 'name': 'Guijuan Zhang'}, {'authorId': '7382513', 'name': 'Dianjie Lu'}, {'authorId': '2118902760', 'name': 'Hong Liu'}]",45.0,"{'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing', 'pages': '708-721', 'volume': '11'}",48.0,Strategies to Utilize the Positive Emotional Contagion Optimally in Crowd Evacuation,2020.0
ac2feea12fd3bcf09d3cfd1655861f978deabb00,"Pro-social behaviors are defined as voluntary actions that benefit others. Comparative studies have mostly focused on investigating the presence of pro-sociality across species in an intraspecific context. Taken together, results on both primates and non-primate species indicate that reliance on cooperation may be at work in the selection and maintenance of pro-social sentiments. Dogs appear to be the ideal model when investigating a species’ propensity for pro-sociality in an interspecific context because it has been suggested that as a consequence of domestication, they evolved an underlying temperament encouraging greater propensity to cooperate with human partners. In a recent study, using a food delivery paradigm, dogs were shown to preferentially express pro-social choices toward familiar compared to unfamiliar conspecifics. Using the same set-up and methods in the current study, we investigated dogs’ pro-social preferences toward familiar and unfamiliar human partners. We found that dogs’ pro-social tendencies did not extend to humans and the identity of the human partners did not influence the rate of food delivery. Interestingly, dogs tested with their human partners spent more time gazing at humans, and did so for longer after food consumption had ended than dogs tested with conspecific partners in the initial study. To allow comparability between results from dogs tested with a conspecific and a human partner, the latter were asked not to communicate with dogs in any way. However, this lack of communication from the human may have been aversive to dogs, leading them to cease performing the task earlier compared to the dogs paired with familiar conspecifics in the prior study. This is in line with previous findings suggesting that human communication in such contexts highly affects dogs’ responses. Consequently, we encourage further studies to examine dogs’ pro-social behavior toward humans taking into consideration their potential responses both with and without human communication.","[{'authorId': '1401509134', 'name': 'M.

The greatest differences between the autistic and nonautistic children were in an unstructured situation where caregivers did not initiate interactions. In this situation, autistic children rarely looked to the partner or initiated social bids to the partner. They also were less focused on the toys available for play compared to nonautistic children. However, the autistic children were similar in their interactive responses to the partner in an adult-initiated social situation. Individual differences confirmed that more able autistic children in terms of cognitive and language abilities also engaged in greater social and communicative behavior with the partner. These findings suggest that the ways in which social deficits are manifested by autistic children are variable with respect to the context in which they are measured.","[{'authorId': '2592071', 'name': 'C.

Inspired by this field, this paper proposes a method for simulating group interactions during emergency evacuation. First, each individual is assigned with dynamic survival needs and psychological quality based on urgent event and the external influence. Second, the emotional interaction of the group is realized based on OCEAN (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) personality trait and the improved CA-SIRS (Cellular Automaton-Susceptible Infected Recovered Susceptible) model. Third, after the perception of the external environment changes, the accident experience and panic level are used as factors of emotion update. At last, the environmental familiarity and nearby flow factors are introduced to path planning process. Based on emotion contagion, this method explores individual’s emotional changes in different scenarios and situations. Combined with personality traits and emotional contagion, the experimental results show that the proposed method can simulate dynamic emotional changes in emergency situations in both efficient and reasonable way and provide guidance for emergency evacuation.","[{'authorId': '2068016746', 'name': 'Rui Zhou'}, {'authorId': '1646697180', 'name': 'Yi Ou'}, {'authorId': '2116723934', 'name': 'Wei Tang'}, {'authorId': '2183688578', 'name': 'Qian Wang'}, {'authorId': '2110431559', 'name': 'Bao Yu'}]",14.0,,57.0,An Emergency Evacuation Behavior Simulation Method Combines Personality Traits and Emotion Contagion,2020.0

 Emotional states of individuals, also known as moods, are central to the expression of thoughts, ideas and opinions, and in turn impact attitudes and behavior. As social media tools are increasingly used by individuals to broadcast their day-to-day happenings, or to report on an external event of interest, understanding the rich ‘landscape’ of moods will help us better interpret and make sense of the behavior of millions of individuals. Motivated by literature in psychology, we study a popular representation of human mood landscape, known as the ‘circumplex model’ that characterizes affective experience through two dimensions: valence and activation. We identify more than 200 moods frequent on Twitter, through mechanical turk studies and psychology literature sources, and report on four aspects of mood expression: the relationship between (1) moods and usage levels, including linguistic diversity of shared content (2) moods and the social ties individuals form, (3) moods and amount of network activity of individuals, and (4) moods and participatory patterns of individuals such as link sharing and conversational engagement. Our results provide at-scale naturalistic assessments and extensions of existing conceptualizations of human mood in social media contexts.

We included case reports, case series, retrospective and prospective studies, letters to the editor, and reviews. A total of 28 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, producing a pooled dataset of 407 full autopsies. Analyzing the medical history data, only 12 subjects had died without any comorbidities (for 15 cases the data were not available). The post-mortem investigation highlighted that acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure represent the main clinical features of COVID-19 disease, often leading to pulmonary thromboembolism and superimposed bronchopneumonia. The discussed data showed a strict relationship among the inflammatory processes, diffuse alveolar, and endothelial damage. In light of these results, the full autopsy can be considered as the gold standard to investigate unknown infections or pathogens resulting in death.","[{'authorId': '1400934838', 'name': 'S.

Consistent with previous research, WIF was related to job satisfaction cross-sectionally for men and women, and this effect existed beyond negative mood, job autonomy and monotony, and FIW. When predicting a change in job satisfaction a year later, and when using spouse rating of the target’s WIF, WIF was predictive of women’s job satisfaction but not men’s, which is consistent with gender role theory. The fact that WIF predicted job satisfaction for women beyond affective and job characteristic variables, over time, and with non-self reported measures, provides more confidence in this directional relationship than could previously be assumed.

As expected, surface acting was positively associated with negative mood, and this explained some of the association of surface acting with increased emotional exhaustion and decreased job satisfaction. Contrary to hypotheses, deep acting was unrelated to job satisfaction and was associated with lower positive affect. Extraversion moderated several emotional labor relationships such that, in general, surface and deep acting had more positive (or less negative) effects for extraverts (compared to introverts).

Unusual responses to sensory stimuli are seen in many children with autism. Their presence was highlighted both in early accounts of autism and in more recent first-person descriptions. There is a widespread belief that sensory symptoms characterize autism and differentiate it from other disorders. This paper examines the empirical evidence for this assumption.


METHOD
All controlled experimental laboratory investigations published since 1960 were identified through systematic searches using Medline/PubMed and PsycInfo search engines. A total of 48 empirical papers and 27 theoretical or conceptual papers were reviewed.


RESULTS
Sensory symptoms are more frequent and prominent in children with autism than in typically developing children, but there is not good evidence that these symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. Certain groups, including children with fragile X syndrome and those who are deaf-blind, appear to demonstrate higher rates of sensory symptoms than children with autism. In reviewing the evidence relevant to two theories of sensory dysfunction in autism, over- and under-arousal theory, we find that there is very little support for hyper-arousal and failure of habituation in autism. There is more evidence that children with autism, as a group, are hypo-responsive to sensory stimuli, but there are also multiple failures to replicate findings and studies that demonstrate lack of group differences.


CONCLUSIONS
The use of different methods, the study of different sensory modalities, and the changing scientific standards across decades complicate interpretation of this body of work. We close with suggestions for future research in this area.","[{'authorId': '34609115', 'name': 'S. Rogers'}, {'authorId': '6496222', 'name': 'S.

ad379ef04036ee7d47ffce1995b1f561303ba768,"Background Social alarm calls alert animals to potential danger and thereby promote group survival. Adult laboratory rats in distress emit 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalization (USV) calls, but the question of whether these USV calls directly elicit defensive behavior in conspecifics is unresolved. Methodology/Principal Findings The present study investigated, in pair-housed male rats, whether and how the conditioned fear-induced 22-kHz USVs emitted by the ‘sender’ animal affect the behavior of its partner, the ‘receiver’ animal, when both are placed together in a novel chamber. The sender rats’ conditioned fear responses evoked significant freezing (an overt evidence of fear) in receiver rats that had previously experienced an aversive event but not in naïve receiver rats. Permanent lesions and reversible inactivations of the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) of the thalamus effectively blocked the receivers’ freeezing response to the senders' conditioned fear responses, and this occurred in absence of lesions/inactivations impeding the receiver animals' ability to freeze and emit 22-kHz USVs to the aversive event per se. Conclusions/Significance These results—that prior experience of fear and intact auditory system are required for receiver rats to respond to their conspecifics' conditioned fear responses—indicate that the 22-kHz USV is the main factor for social transmission of fear and that learning plays a crucial role in the development of social signaling of danger by USVs.","[{'authorId': '2110112491', 'name': 'Eun Joo Kim'}, {'authorId': '5156210', 'name': 'Earnest S.

In this study, empathy is tested as a possible moderator between recognition and induction that is, on its own, moderated via music preference evaluations and other individual and situational features. Preference was also tested to determine whether it had an effect on measures of emotion independently from emotional expression. A web-based experiment gathered from 3,164 music listeners emotion, empathy, and preference ratings in a between-subjects design embedded in a music-personality test. Stimuli were a sample of 23 musical excerpts (each 30 seconds long, five randomly assigned to each participant) from various musical styles chosen to represent different emotions and preferences. Listeners in the recognition rating condition rated measures of valence and arousal significantly differently than listeners in the felt rating condition. Empathy ratings were shown to modulate this relationship: when empathy was present, the difference between the two rating types was reduced. Furthermore, we confirmed preference as one major predictor of empathy ratings. Emotional contagion was tested and confirmed as an additional direct effect of emotional expression on induced emotions.

We argue that a full understanding of the role of emotions in organizations requires a complementary focus on their interpersonal effects—that is, how one worker’s emotions influence the feelings, cognitions, attitudes, and behavior of others. We advance Emotions as Social Information (EASI) theory, which posits that emotional expressions exert interpersonal effects by triggering affective reactions and/or inferential processes in targets, depending on the target’s information processing and the perceived appropriateness of the emotional expression. We review evidence from four domains of organizational behavior: customer service, group decision making, negotiation, and leadership. We call for new research that examines emotions in greater detail (discrete emotions, intensity, authenticity), studies different settings (organizational change, personnel selection), and considers temporal dynamics (frequency, long-term outcomes).","[{'authorId': '5980688', 'name': 'Gerben A. van Kleef'}, {'authorId': '4392679', 'name': 'A.

adef4eacce1cd82bd210400fa3e391a616d5be97,"Although traditional economic and psychological theories imply that individual choice best scales to aggregate choice, primary components of choice reflected in neural activity may support even more generalizable forecasts. Crowdfunding represents a significant and growing platform for funding new and unique projects, causes, and products. To test whether neural activity could forecast market-level crowdfunding outcomes weeks later, 30 human subjects (14 female) decided whether to fund proposed projects described on an Internet crowdfunding website while undergoing scanning with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Although activity in both the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and medial prefrontal cortex predicted individual choices to fund on a trial-to-trial basis in the neuroimaging sample, only NAcc activity generalized to forecast market funding outcomes weeks later on the Internet. Behavioral measures from the neuroimaging sample, however, did not forecast market funding outcomes. This pattern of associations was replicated in a second study. These findings demonstrate that a subset of the neural predictors of individual choice can generalize to forecast market-level crowdfunding outcomes—even better than choice itself. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Forecasting aggregate behavior with individual neural data has proven elusive; even when successful, neural forecasts have not historically supplanted behavioral forecasts. In the current research, we find that neural responses can forecast market-level choice and outperform behavioral measures in a novel Internet crowdfunding context. Targeted as well as model-free analyses convergently indicated that nucleus accumbens activity can support aggregate forecasts. Beyond providing initial evidence for neuropsychological processes implicated in crowdfunding choices, these findings highlight the ability of neural features to forecast aggregate choice, which could inform applications relevant to business and policy.","[{'authorId': '4125662', 'name': 'A.

Consistent with the findings of previous research on the impact of positive affect, results indicated that several aspects of subjects' behavior were influenced by this variable. Participants exposed to pleasant scents set higher goals on a clerical coding task and were more likely to adopt an efficient strategy for performing this task than subjects not exposed to such conditions. In addition, males (but not females) reported higher self-efficacy in the presence of pleasant artificial scents than in their absence. Participants exposed to pleasant scents also set higher monetary goals and made more concessions during face-to-face negotiations with an accomplice. Finally, subjects exposed to pleasant scents reported weaker preferences for handling future conflicts with the accomplice through avoidance and competition. Analyses of covariance suggested that these differences stemmed largely from contrasting levels of positive affect among subjects in the neutral and pleasant scent conditions. Together, these results suggest that pleasant artificial scents may provide a potentially useful means for enhancing the environmental quality of work settings, and hence the performance and attitudes of persons in them.","[{'authorId': '1769979', 'name': 'R.

ae0bef0f22abdbf554eeccaf20312382dec191c8,"Sensory hypersensitivity is a common symptom in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), including fragile X syndrome (FXS), and frequently leads to tactile defensiveness. In mouse models of ASDs, there is mounting evidence of neuronal and circuit hyperexcitability in several brain regions, which could contribute to sensory hypersensitivity. However, it is not yet known whether or how sensory stimulation might trigger abnormal sensory processing at the circuit level or abnormal behavioral responses in ASD mouse models, especially during an early developmental time when experience-dependent plasticity shapes such circuits. Using a novel assay, we discovered exaggerated motor responses to whisker stimulation in young Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice (postnatal days 14–16), a model of FXS. Adult Fmr1 KO mice actively avoided a stimulus that was innocuous to wild-type controls, a sign of tactile defensiveness. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of layer 2/3 barrel cortex neurons expressing GCaMP6s, we found no differences between wild-type and Fmr1 KO mice in overall whisker-evoked activity, though 45% fewer neurons in young Fmr1 KO mice responded in a time-locked manner. Notably, we identified a pronounced deficit in neuronal adaptation to repetitive whisker stimulation in both young and adult Fmr1 KO mice. Thus, impaired adaptation in cortical sensory circuits is a potential cause of tactile defensiveness in autism. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We use a novel paradigm of repetitive whisker stimulation and in vivo calcium imaging to assess tactile defensiveness and barrel cortex activity in young and adult Fmr1 knock-out mice, the mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FXS). We describe evidence of tactile defensiveness, as well as a lack of L2/3 neuronal adaptation in barrel cortex, during whisker stimulation. We propose that a defect in sensory adaptation within local neuronal networks, beginning at a young age and continuing into adulthood, likely contributes to sensory overreactivity in FXS and perhaps other ASDs.","[{'authorId': '2140210077', 'name': 'Cynthia X.

Furthermore, the current study aimed to compare risk factors affecting different types of WPV in Chinese hospitals. A cross-sectional design was utilized. A total of 1899 healthcare workers from Heilongjiang, a province in Northeastern China, completed the questionnaire. Of the respondents, 83.3% reported exposure to workplace violence, and 68.9% reported non-physical violence. Gender, education, shift work, anxiety level, and occupation were significantly correlated with physical violence (p < 0.05 for all correlations). Additionally, age, professional title, and occupation were correlated with non-physical violence, which critically affected doctors. Thus, gender, age, profession, anxiety, and shift work were predictive of workplace violence toward healthcare workers. Doctors appeared to experience non-physical workplace violence with particularly higher frequency when compared to nurses and other workers in hospitals. For healthcare workers, interventions aimed at WPV reduction should be enacted according to the types of violence, profession, and other factors underlying the various types of WPV in hospitals.","[{'authorId': '8799045', 'name': 'P.

Study 2 extends those results by reporting a confirmatory factor analysis testing dimensionality of the scale; criterion and divergent validity evidence is also presented. Results of the two studies provide reliability and validity evidence for the CES, show that teachers' communication behaviors are related to students' reports of emotional experiences in classes, and document relationships between students' emotional experiences and various indicators of their motivation, affective, and cognitive learning.

These calls may provide information about the sender, such as its behaviour or motivation, and about the type of stimuli to which the caller is responding, such as the location, quality or quantity of a food source. We investigated whether yells convey information about different types and amounts of food. We experimentally exposed a group of free-ranging ravens foraging in a game park near Grunau, Austria to six feeding situations. Food of one of three types (meat, kitchen leftovers, wild boar chow) and either of two quantities (one or three buckets) was shown to the ravens 10 min before they could gain access to it during the feeding of wild boars, Sus scrofa. Ravens responded to the sight of food with one type of yell, the long haa call. Haa calling rates varied with the type but not with the amount of food, and decreased during feeding. Although juveniles produced long yells (chii calls) in response to food they changed the context of calling with increasing independence from their parents. Ravens gave short 'who' yells when approaching the food. Who calling was thus not affected by the sight of food but by the feeding situation in general. This is comparable to other calls given in a foraging context, such as appeasement and intimidation calls. The different use of long and short yells relative to food availability suggests that who calls provide information about the caller, such as its behaviour at food, whereas haa calls may also provide information about the food itself. Our data are consistent with the idea that haa calls are functionally referential.  2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","[{'authorId': '5637819', 'name': 'T.

Despite its promises, little is known about the nature of an individual's ideation efforts in such an online community. Studying Dell's IdeaStorm community, serial ideators are found to be more likely than consumers with only one idea to generate an idea the organization finds valuable enough to implement, but they are unlikely to repeat their early success once their ideas are implemented. As ideators with past success attempt to again come up with ideas that will excite the organization, they instead end up proposing ideas similar to their ideas that were already implemented i.e., they generate less diverse ideas. The negative effects of past success are somewhat mitigated for ideators with diverse commenting activity on others' ideas. These findings highlight some of the challenges in maintaining an ongoing supply of quality ideas from the crowd over time.

Different theories propose that mimicry of emotional expressions (facial or otherwise) mechanistically underlies, or at least facilitates, these swift adaptive reactions. When people unconsciously mimic their interaction partner’s expressions of emotion, they come to feel reflections of those companions’ emotions, which in turn influence the observer’s own emotional and empathic behavior. The majority of research has focused on facial actions as expressions of emotion. However, the fact that emotions are not just expressed by facial muscles alone is often still ignored in emotion perception research. In this article, I therefore argue for a broader exploration of emotion signals from sources beyond the face muscles that are more automatic and difficult to control. Specifically, I will focus on the perception of implicit sources such as gaze and tears and autonomic responses such as pupil-dilation, eyeblinks and blushing that are subtle yet visible to observers and because they can hardly be controlled or regulated by the sender, provide important “veridical” information. Recently, more research is emerging about the mimicry of these subtle affective signals including pupil-mimicry. I will here review this literature and suggest avenues for future research that will eventually lead to a better comprehension of how these signals help in making social judgments and understand each other’s emotions.","[{'authorId': '2512383', 'name': 'M.

However, to process the huge volumes of sensory data in real time also requires higher computational resources.

In this study, we employed social signal-processing techniques to investigate relationships between non-verbal features: infant and father vocalizations, infant-directed speech, speech turn-taking (STT) and hormonal dynamics (OT and CT). Thirty-five fathers were asked to interact with their infants following the fathers self-administration of OT or placebo. We consider the three episodes of the Still Face (SF) paradigm: (1) a baseline normal interaction episode, (2) the SF episode, in which the father becomes unresponsive and maintains a neutral facial expression, and (3) a reunion in which parents and their infants re-engage in interaction. This paradigm elicited stress in the infant. Statistical relationships are assessed by correlation analysis and linear mixed models (LMMs). The results indicate that (i) infant vocalization and STT are key social cues regulating interactions during the stress-inducing and reunion episodes, with infant vocalization leading the interaction dynamics; (ii) father empty pause was the main adaptive behavior of fathers after SF; (iii) OT did not modulate infant STT or father STT/fatherese; (iv) CT appeared to modulate the interaction.","[{'authorId': '3156545', 'name': 'O.

The authors tested susceptibility to contagious yawning and laughter in children with ASD (n = 60) and typically developing (TD) children (n = 60), ages 5–17 years, under various conditions, to elucidate factors that may affect emotional contagion in these populations. Although TD children showed equal amounts of emotional contagion across conditions, children with ASD were highly influenced by the familiarity of the target stimulus, as well as task instructions that encourage eye gaze to target. More specifically, children with ASD exhibited less contagious yawning and laughter than their TD peers except when their attention was explicitly directed to the eyes or (and even more so) when their parents served as the stimulus targets. The authors explore the implications of these findings for theories about the mechanisms underlying empathic deficits in ASD as well as the clinical implications of having parents involved in treatment.","[{'authorId': '6092751', 'name': 'M.

Methods: From December 2013 to April 2014, a total of 1404 healthcare workers were recruited by using the random cluster sampling method from Community Health Centers in Guangzhou and Shenzhen. The workplace violence scale, the job performance scale and the quality of life scale (SF-36) were self-administered. The structural equation model constructed by Amos 17.0 was employed to assess the relationship among these variables. Results: Our study found that 51.64% of the respondents had an experience of workplace violence. It was found that both job performance and quality of life had a negative correlation with workplace violence. A positive association was identified between job performance and quality of life. The path analysis showed the total effect (β = −0.243) of workplace violence on job performance consisted of a direct effect (β = −0.113) and an indirect effect (β = −0.130), which was mediated by quality of life. Conclusions: Workplace violence among community healthcare workers is prevalent in China. The workplace violence had negative effects on the job performance and quality of life of CHCs’ workers. The study suggests that improvement in the quality of life may lead to an effective reduction of the damages in job performance caused by workplace violence.","[{'authorId': '46639879', 'name': 'Wei-Quan Lin'}, {'authorId': '2115691827', 'name': 'Jiang Wu'}, {'authorId': '2144922535', 'name': 'Le-Xin Yuan'}, {'authorId': '7671073', 'name': 'Shengchao Zhang'}, {'authorId': '5153398', 'name': 'Meng-Juan Jing'}, {'authorId': '4811997', 'name': 'Hui-Shan Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2119195491', 'name': 'Jia-Li Luo'}, {'authorId': '49381272', 'name': 'Y.

b03299554c682bff4880145ba5f3f9ffeb03770d,"Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutation or deletion of the maternal UBE3A allele. The maternal UBE3A allele is expressed in nearly all neurons of the brain and spinal cord, whereas the paternal UBE3A allele is repressed by an extremely long antisense transcript (UBE3A-ATS). Little is known about expression of UBE3A in the peripheral nervous system, where loss of maternal UBE3A might contribute to AS phenotypes. Here we sought to examine maternal and paternal Ube3a expression in DRGs neurons and to evaluate whether nociceptive responses were affected in AS model mice (global deletion of maternal Ube3a allele; Ube3am−/p+). We found that most large-diameter proprioceptive and mechanosensitive DRG neurons expressed maternal Ube3a and paternal Ube3a-ATS. In contrast, most small-diameter neurons expressed Ube3a biallelically and had low to undetectable levels of Ube3a-ATS. Analysis of single-cell DRG transcriptomes further suggested that Ube3a is expressed monoallelically in myelinated large-diameter neurons and biallelically in unmyelinated small-diameter neurons. Behavioral responses to some noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli were enhanced in male and female AS model mice; however, nociceptive responses were not altered by the conditional deletion of maternal Ube3a in the DRG. These data suggest that the enhanced nociceptive responses in AS model mice are due to loss of maternal Ube3a in the central, but not peripheral, nervous system. Our study provides new insights into sensory processing deficits associated with AS. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss or mutation of the maternal UBE3A allele. While sensory processing deficits are frequently associated with AS, it is currently unknown whether Ube3a is expressed in peripheral sensory neurons or whether maternal deletion of Ube3a affects somatosensory responses. Here, we found that Ube3a is primarily expressed from the maternally inherited allele in myelinated large-diameter sensory neurons and biallelically expressed in unmyelinated small-diameter neurons. Nociceptive responses to select noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli were enhanced following global, but not sensory neuron-specific, deletion of maternal Ube3a in mice. These data suggest that maternal loss of Ube3a affects nociception via a central, but not peripheral mechanism, with implications for AS.","[{'authorId': '49084627', 'name': 'E.

b054784ecedf971bb970dba5172d739ef8606893,"Previously, morphine has been shown to influence social play behavior in rats on two levels. An increasing effect on social play was interpreted as an effect on the rewarding aspects of social play. A lower dose of morphine abolished the effects of an unfamiliar environment on social play, supposedly by affecting the integration of environmental stimuli. In the present study the effects of receptor-specific opioid drugs on social play and measures of social behavior unrelated to play were investigated. Fentanyl, a mu-opioid receptor agonist, seemingly mimicked both effects of morphine. The mu-opioid receptor antagonist, beta-funaltrexamine, decreased social play, although a low dose of this drug increased it. BUBUC (Tyr-D-Cys(StBu)-Gly-Phe-Leu-Thr(OtBu)) and naltrindole, a delta-opioid receptor agonist and delta-opioid receptor antagonist, respectively, had no effects on social behavior. The kappa-opioid receptor agonist, U50,488H (trans-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl]- benzeneacetamide), dose dependently suppressed all measures of social behavior. The kappa-opioid receptor antagonist, nor-binaltorphimine, abolished the effect of an unfamiliar environment on social play. These studies suggest that the opioidergic effect on social play is mediated through mu- and kappa-opioid receptor systems.","[{'authorId': '4550145', 'name': 'L.

This is manifested in 4 ways: (a) negative potency (negative entities are stronger than the equivalent positive entities), (b) steeper negative gradients (the negativity of negative events grows more rapidly with approach to them in space or time than does the positivity of positive events, (c) negativity dominance (combinations of negative and positive entities yield evaluations that are more negative than the algebraic sum of individual subjective valences would predict), and (d) negative differentiation (negative entities are more varied, yield more complex conceptual representations, and engage a wider response repertoire). We review evidence for this taxonomy, with emphasis on negativity dominance, including literary, historical, religious, and cultural sources, as well as the psychological literatures on learning, attention, impression formation, contagion, moral judgment, development, and memory. We then consider a variety of theoretical accounts for negativity bias. We suggest that 1 feature of negative events that make them dominant is that negative entities are more contagious than positive entities.","[{'authorId': '145983028', 'name': 'P.

b0794ca365eabcda112ea0d729f533d716e1579d,"Human empathy relies on the ability to share emotions as well as the ability to understand the other’s thoughts, desires, and feelings. Recent evidence points to 2 separate systems for empathy: an emotional system that supports our ability to empathize emotionally and a cognitive system that involves cognitive understanding of the other’s perspective. Converging evidence from neuroimaging and lesion studies shows that a neural network that includes the inferior frontal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule is necessary for emotion recognition and emotional contagion. On the other hand, the involvement of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction, and the medial temporal lobe in self-reflection and autobiographical memory places these key regions as necessary for cognitive empathy. The proposed dissociation between these systems is supported by recent neurochemical experiments involving administration of oxytocin as well as by ethological, psychiatric, and developmental studies. Finally, although the emotional and cognitive systems appear to work independently, every empathic response may still evoke both components to some extent, depending on the social context.","[{'authorId': '1397560295', 'name': 'S.

The analysis is framed in a sociological understanding of the customer as a key source of both pleasure and pain for service workers. Irate and abusive customers, who are systematically part of the social relations of the service workplace, may occasion real pain to service workers. The structure of workers' social situation means that they are likely to turn to each other to cope with this pain, forming informal communities of coping. Drawing on extensive research in four call centres in Australia and the USA, the article highlights this process in action. The communities of coping were an important social process in these workplaces, creating informal, dense cultures among the workforce. These cultures had important implications for how far the social relations of the workplace were open to management control.","[{'authorId': '31147388', 'name': 'Marek Korczynski'}]",425.0,,17.0,Communities of Coping: Collective Emotional Labour in Service Work,2003.0

To determine if this principle could be applied to the reduction of organizationa l conflict, male and female subjects played the role of executives and discussed important organizational issues with another person This individual was actually an accomplice who disagreed strongly with their views. Such disagreement was expressed either in a calm and reasonable manner or in an arrogant and condescending fashion. Subjects were then exposed either to one of three treatment conditions designed to induce positive states incompatible with anger (sympathy, gratitude, amusement) or to a no-treatment control. Finally, they rated their current mood, indicated then- impressions of the accomplice, and reported on their likelihood of handling future conflicts with him through collaboration, avoidance, competition, compromise, or accomodation. Results indicated that relative to the control condition, the three incompatible-response-generating treatments improved subjects' moods, enhanced their impressions of the accomplice, and increased then"" preference for constructive as opposed to destructive modes of dealing with conflict. In addition, disagreement expressed in a condescending manner produced significantly more negative effects on all dependent measures than disagreement expressed in a reasonable fashion These findings were interpreted as suggesting that useful techniques for the effective management of conflict can be derived from existing knowledge about the control of human aggression Conflict is a common part of life in modern organizations. Indeed, practicing managers report that dealing with conflict and its effects occupies fully 20% of their time (Thomas & Schmidt, 1976). In the past, it was widely assumed that the effects of such conflict are uniformly negative in scope and that it is best avoided under all circumstances. More recently, however, the fact that conflict can sometimes yield positive as well as negative effects has gained increasing recognition (Robbins, 1974).

Since emotions play such an important role in human decision making, how online networks modulate human collective mood states has become a matter of considerable interest. In spite of the increasing societal importance of online social networks, it is unknown whether assortative mixing of psychological states takes place in situations where social ties are mediated solely by online networking services in the absence of physical contact. Here, we show that the general happiness, or subjective well-being (SWB), of Twitter users, as measured from a 6-month record of their individual tweets, is indeed assortative across the Twitter social network. Our results imply that online social networks may be equally subject to the social mechanisms that cause assortative mixing in real social networks and that such assortative mixing takes place at the level of SWB. Given the increasing prevalence of online social networks, their propensity to connect users with similar levels of SWB may be an important factor in how positive and negative sentiments are maintained and spread through human society. Future research may focus on how event-specific mood states can propagate and influence user behavior in “real life.”","[{'authorId': '1756468', 'name': 'J.

By purposefully biasing the sampling distribution and re-using branches from previous planning iterations, MP-RRT combines the strengths of existing adaptations of RRT for dynamic motion planning. Experimental results show MP-RRT to be very effective for planning in dynamic environments with unknown moving obstacles, replanning in high-dimensional configuration spaces, and replanning for systems with space time constraints.","[{'authorId': '38746979', 'name': 'Matthew Zucker'}, {'authorId': '1722785', 'name': 'J.

b255474d62f082fa97f50ea1174bf339522f6c99,"In interpersonal encounters, individuals often exhibit changes in their own facial expressions in response to emotional expressions of another person. Such changes are often called facial mimicry. While this tendency first appeared to be an automatic tendency of the perceiver to show the same emotional expression as the sender, evidence is now accumulating that situation, person, and relationship jointly determine whether and for which emotions such congruent facial behavior is shown. We review the evidence regarding the moderating influence of such factors on facial mimicry with a focus on understanding the meaning of facial responses to emotional expressions in a particular constellation. From this, we derive recommendations for a research agenda with a stronger focus on the most common forms of encounters, actual interactions with known others, and on assessing potential mediators of facial mimicry. We conclude that facial mimicry is modulated by many factors: attention deployment and sensitivity, detection of valence, emotional feelings, and social motivations. We posit that these are the more proximal causes of changes in facial mimicry due to changes in its social setting.","[{'authorId': '2848483', 'name': 'Beate Seibt'}, {'authorId': '1684604', 'name': 'A.

Visitor data analyzed with SEM revealed that place dependence is a significant predictor of social distance given it affects affinity positively and avoidance negatively, both of which are mediated by the three dimensions of emotional solidarity. Furthermore, the mediated relationships (via emotional solidarity) between place attachment and social distance vary by level of visitors’ frequency of interaction with residents. This study expands current theorization by examining the merits of emotional solidarity as an affective link in a tourist cognitive-behavioral model. From a practical standpoint, DMOs need to understand these construct linkages and include residents in their marketing strategies to increase repeat visitation.","[{'authorId': '103770131', 'name': 'Kayode D.

Quality of life is the individuals' subjective evaluation of their general well-being, including physical and mental health, social relationships and everyday functionality. The aim of our study was to examine conduct disorder in terms of gender differences in prevalence, and relationship to quality of life domains in the presence or absence of comorbid oppositional defiant disorder.


METHODS
Altogether 392 adolescents, aged 13-18 years (M=14.5; SD= 1.37), participated in this study. The members of the clinical group were selected from Vadaskert Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Hospital, Budapest, Hungary with externalizing symptoms in their case history. The control group was selected from public schools in Budapest, Hungary. Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Kid was used to diagnose conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder, and parent and adolescent version of the Inventory of Quality of Life in Children and Adolescents (Inventar zur Erfassung der Lebensqualität bei Kindern und Jugendlichen) was used to measure the children's quality of life.


RESULTS
In this sample 8.5% of adolescents were diagnosed with conduct disorder, of which 52.9% had a comorbid oppositional defiant diagnosis. Conduct disorder diagnosis was only present in the clinical group, 9 of participants with such diagnosis were male and 24 were female. Girls with conduct disorder evaluated their family life domain (p<0.01) and their global quality of life (p<0.05) lower than the boys. Compared to adolescents without comorbid oppositional defiant disorder diagnosis, adolescents with conduct disorder and comorbid oppositional defiant disorder had significantly worse quality of life in the domain of time spent alone (p<0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
Conduct disorder is associated with decreased quality of life. The presence of comorbid oppositional defiant disorder correlates with lower quality of life in several domains. These findings are considerable for the clinical management of these externalizing disorders.","[{'authorId': '7650414', 'name': 'D. Szentivanyi'}, {'authorId': '5408501', 'name': 'J.

Twitter users tweet about any topic within the 140-character limit and follow others to receive their tweets. The goal of this paper is to study the topological characteristics of Twitter and its power as a new medium of information sharing.
 We have crawled the entire Twitter site and obtained 41.7 million user profiles, 1.47 billion social relations, 4,262 trending topics, and 106 million tweets. In its follower-following topology analysis we have found a non-power-law follower distribution, a short effective diameter, and low reciprocity, which all mark a deviation from known characteristics of human social networks [28]. In order to identify influentials on Twitter, we have ranked users by the number of followers and by PageRank and found two rankings to be similar. Ranking by retweets differs from the previous two rankings, indicating a gap in influence inferred from the number of followers and that from the popularity of one's tweets. We have analyzed the tweets of top trending topics and reported on their temporal behavior and user participation. We have classified the trending topics based on the active period and the tweets and show that the majority (over 85%) of topics are headline news or persistent news in nature. A closer look at retweets reveals that any retweeted tweet is to reach an average of 1,000 users no matter what the number of followers is of the original tweet. Once retweeted, a tweet gets retweeted almost instantly on next hops, signifying fast diffusion of information after the 1st retweet.

Thus, simulation of evacuation situations has been identified as an important tool for assessing design choices of urban areas, such as buildings, stadiums, etc., and Agent Based Modelling has been employed to tackle such problems. In this paper, we propose that formal modelling can rigorously define but also naturally lead to realistic simulations of such cases. Our main contribution is presenting how formal state based methods, namely X-machines, can be employed to model agents in emergency evacuation plans. We also discuss the role of emotions, model artificial emotions that change the behaviour of agents under emergency situations, and provide a formalism that models the role of emotions and personality traits in order to create a more realistic scenario. Finally, we demonstrate how the developed formal models can be refined to code, a combination of Net logo and Prolog in this case, that is able to simulate crowd behaviour with and without artificial emotions.","[{'authorId': '3145061', 'name': 'I.

b2eeedbcbc719269081505e48a2d4de4a9197dab,"The facial feedback hypothesis holds that emotional experiences are derived from facial expressions. Ten published studies indicating that manipulated facial expressions do produce corresponding emotional experience are contrasted with Tourangeau and Ellsworth's sole published failure to demonstrate this relation. Six other studies using a different but theoretically consistent paradigm also demonstrate facial feedback effects. Related results in many of these 16 studies effectively rule out experimental demand as an explanation and instead suggest similarities in process between facial feedback and hunger, attitude change and self-evaluation. Recently Tourangeau and Ellsworth (1979) failed in an attempt to show that subjects induced to adopt facial expressions of emotion, would then report feeling those emotions. The authors believed that they were testing a hypothesis related to, though not directly contained in the emotion theories of Tomkins (1962) and Izard (1977), namely, that the experience of emotion is derived from feedback from facial expressions. Tourangeau and Ellsworth (1979) concluded from their study that the ""facial feedback"" hypothesis was not tenable and that this cast some doubt on the larger theories as well. Subsequently, Tomkins (1981) and Izard (1981) both wrote replies to that article, in large measure disowning this empirical form of the facial feedback hypothesis on grounds that feeling required more than such simple facial movements. Hager and Ekman (1981), in the same issue, argue on methodologica l grounds that the experimental hypothesis would not be expected to be confirmed. Ellsworth and Tourangeau (1981) then found themselves defending their attack on ""this authorless hypothesis"" (p. 363) and their ""failure to disconfirm what nobody ever said"" (p. 363).

But James was more concerned with function than structure.

Similarly, LMX perceptions were negatively related to students’ hostility and revenge and mediated the relationships between students’ perceptions of distributive justice and these outcomes. LMX also moderated the relationships between students’ perceptions of classroom justice and indirect interpersonal aggression and deception.

b3434eceff25c9070cd150338620ac796ae8c3c5,"Social media are used as main discussion channels by millions of individuals every day. The content individuals produce in daily social-media-based micro-communications, and the emotions therein expressed, may impact the emotional states of others. A recent experiment performed on Facebook hypothesized that emotions spread online, even in absence of non-verbal cues typical of in-person interactions, and that individuals are more likely to adopt positive or negative emotions if these are over-expressed in their social network. Experiments of this type, however, raise ethical concerns, as they require massive-scale content manipulation with unknown consequences for the individuals therein involved. Here, we study the dynamics of emotional contagion using a random sample of Twitter users, whose activity (and the stimuli they were exposed to) was observed during a week of September 2014. Rather than manipulating content, we devise a null model that discounts some confounding factors (including the effect of emotional contagion). We measure the emotional valence of content the users are exposed to before posting their own tweets. We determine that on average a negative post follows an over-exposure to 4.34% more negative content than baseline, while positive posts occur after an average over-exposure to 4.50% more positive contents. We highlight the presence of a linear relationship between the average emotional valence of the stimuli users are exposed to, and that of the responses they produce. We also identify two different classes of individuals: highly and scarcely susceptible to emotional contagion. Highly susceptible users are significantly less inclined to adopt negative emotions than the scarcely susceptible ones, but equally likely to adopt positive emotions. In general, the likelihood of adopting positive emotions is much greater than that of negative emotions.","[{'authorId': '48898287', 'name': 'Emilio Ferrara'}, {'authorId': '121937545', 'name': 'Zeya Yang'}]",342.0,,64.0,Measuring Emotional Contagion in Social Media,2015.0

FaceReader scores were associated with self-reports of the advertisement’s effectiveness. Building on work describing the role of emotions in marketing research, we examined the relationship between the patterns of the FEBE and the perceived amusement of the advertisements, attitude toward the advertisement (AAD) and attitude toward the brand (AB). Differences were observed between FEH scores in response to high-, medium-, and low-amusing video advertisements (AVAs). Positive correlations were found between FEH and AAD and FEH and AB in high- and medium- but not in low-AVAs. As hypothesized, other basic emotions (sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust) did not predict advertisement amusement or advertisements’ effectiveness. FaceReader enabled a detailed analysis of more than 120,000 frames of video-recordings contributing to an identification of global patterns of facial reactions to amusing persuasive stimuli. For amusing commercials, context-specific FEH features were found to be the major indicators of advertisement effectiveness. The study used video-recordings of participants in their natural environments obtained through a crowd-sourcing platform. The naturalistic design of the study strengthened its ecological validity and demonstrated the robustness of the software algorithms even under austere conditions.

The approach taken is for pedestrians in a large open space such as a rail or bus terminal, shopping mall, or office lobby where conflicting movements at high volumes would tend to cause congestion and reduce overall flows of persons. A particular rule set is examined for emergent group behavior which is examined as a hypothetical model for actual pedestrian flow patterns in crowds.

The scores used were the maximum rise and maximum fall from the preceding resting level and the number of responses of a critical value per unit time. Of the 14 scores thus obtained, 7 showed significant discrimination between anger and fear. Diastolic blood pressure rises, heart rate falls, number of rises in skin conductance, and muscle potential increases, were greater for anger than for fear, whereas skin conductance increases, number of muscle potential increases, and respiration rate increases were greater for fear than for anger. Profile difference scores, computed from appropriate combinations of these differences, were found to be greater than zero in 42 of the 43 cases and to have a mean which deviated very significantly from zero, which rejects the null hypothesis that there is no difference in physiological reaction between anger and fear. The patterns obtained for anger and fear argue against the Arnold proposal that anger is a strong reaction of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous systems, whereas fear is but a sympathetic reaction. Another finding was the very low correlations among the physiological reactions and the significantly higher intercorrelations for anger than for fear, which was interpreted as indicating greater physiological integration during anger. Between‐subject variance was significantly greater than within‐subject variance, which supports the findings of Lacey and Malmo that there is considerable specificity in physiological response patterns. The physiological response patterns of anger were suggested as being similar to those produced by injections of epinephrine and nor‐epinephrine combined, and those of fear as being similar to injections of epinephrine.","[{'authorId': '3719848', 'name': 'A.

But is this actually the case? We conducted an experience-sampling study with 50 couples indicating their feelings 10 times a day for 7 days and modeled emotional interdependence for each couple separately taking a dyadographic approach. The majority of couples (64%) did not demonstrate strong signs of emotional interdependence, and couples that did, showed great inter-dyad differences in their specific patterns. Individuals from emotionally more interdependent couples reported higher individual well-being than individuals from more independent couples in terms of life satisfaction but not depression. Relational well-being was not (relationship satisfaction) or even negatively (empathic concern) related to the degree of emotional interdependence. Especially driving the emotions of the partner (i.e., sender effects) accounted for these associations, opposed to following the emotions of the partner (i.e., receiver effects). Additionally, assessing emotional interdependence for positive and negative emotions separately elucidated that primarily emotional interdependence for positive emotions predicted more self-reported life satisfaction and less empathic concern. These findings highlight the existence of large inter-dyad differences, explore relationships between emotional interdependence and key well-being variables, and demonstrate differential correlates for sending and receiving emotions.","[{'authorId': '5453606', 'name': 'L.

Far less attention has been devoted to the actual contents of the communicative process. The goal of this article is thus to consider what types of emotional content are possible to convey in music. I will argue that the content is mainly constrained by the type of coding involved, and that distinct types of content are related to different types of coding. Based on these premises, I suggest a conceptualization in terms of “multiple layers” of musical expression of emotions. The “core” layer is constituted by iconically-coded basic emotions. I attempt to clarify the meaning of this concept, dispel the myths that surround it, and provide examples of how it can be heuristic in explaining findings in this domain. However, I also propose that this “core” layer may be extended, qualified, and even modified by additional layers of expression that involve intrinsic and associative coding. These layers enable listeners to perceive more complex emotions—though the expressions are less cross-culturally invariant and more dependent on the social context and/or the individual listener. This multiple-layer conceptualization of expression in music can help to explain both similarities and differences between vocal and musical expression of emotions.","[{'authorId': '2663281', 'name': 'P.

Research has not directly examined rebrandings from the employee's perspective, nor has previous research considered the impacts of rebranding on service quality and customer outcomes. In this paper we discuss the role of service climate and employee identification in hospitality organizations and propose a conceptual model that links service climate and employee identification with customer service and related outcomes such as word of mouth communication behaviours. As part of a larger project, 228 employees in three hotels in Australia completed a self-report survey. At the time of the survey, the hotels were undergoing rebranding processes. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis investigated the relationships between the variables of interest. Preliminary findings demonstrate the significant role of customer-contact aspects of service climate and the role of employee identification with their department in predicting employee perceptions of customer outcomes. Future research is proposed.","[{'authorId': '69952873', 'name': 'David Solnet'}, {'authorId': '7566255', 'name': 'Neil Paulsen'}]",28.0,,87.0,"Service Climate, Employee Identification, and Customer Outcomes in Hotel Property Rebrandings",2006.0

b4eca340e32b38f31d56fb1be149ecdefc88bfef,"Over the years, researchers have enriched the postulation that hedonic products generate deeper emotional reactions and feelings in the consumer than functional products. However, recent research empirically proves that hedonic products are more affect-rich only for some consumer segments or for specific consumption contexts. We argue that such inconsistency may derive from the nature of the emotions assessed that is strictly dependent on their empirical measurement and not from the mere existence of emotions themselves. Self-reported methods of evaluating consumer experience, on which prior studies are grounded, only assess conscious emotions the consumer can recognize and report, but not unconscious feelings, happening without individual awareness. The present work takes this challenge by conducting a laboratory experiment in which subjects are exposed to both a utilitarian product and a hedonic product. Physiological measures have been adopted to investigate unconscious emotional responses and self-reported measures to assess conscious emotions toward the products. Specifically, physiological data regarding the subjects’ cardiac activity, respiratory activity, electrodermal activity, and cerebral activity have been collected and complemented with a survey. Results confirm that both functional and hedonic products generate emotional responses in consumers. Further, findings show that when a consumer is exposed to a functional product, the physiological emotional responses are disassociated from the self-reported ones. A diverse pattern is depicted for hedonic products. We suggest an alternative explanation for the apparent lack of affect-rich experiences elicited by functional products and the need to reconsider emotional responses for these products.","[{'authorId': '27031448', 'name': 'Debora Bettiga'}, {'authorId': '145691035', 'name': 'A.

b5b6d87f663fcc56cd7319ea49d6baaa653ecaae,"Zusammenfassung Die menschliche Mimik ist einzigartig in ihrer Fähigkeit unseren Emotionen Ausdruck zu verleihen und diese anderen Menschen zu übermitteln. Die mimische Expression grundlegender Emotionen ist über verschiedene Kulturen hinweg sehr ähnlich und du weist auch Gemeinsamkeiten zu anderen Säugetieren auf. Dies deutet auf einen gemeinsamen genetischen Ursprung des Zusammenhangs von Mimik und Emotion. Neuere Untersuchungen zeigen aber auch kulturelle Einflüsse und Unterschiede. Die Erkennung von Emotionen aus der Mimik und auch der Prozess des mimischen Ausdrucks der eigenen Emotionen erfolgt in einem äußerst komplexen zerebralen Netzwerk. Aufgrund der Komplexität des zerebralen Verarbeitungssystems gibt es eine Vielzahl von neurologischen und psychiatrischen Erkrankungen, welche die Kopplung von Mimik und Emotionen erheblich stören können. Auch durch das Tragen von Masken wird unsere Fähigkeit zur Übermittlung und zum Erkennen von Emotionen über die Mimik eingeschränkt. Durch die Mimik lassen sich aber nicht nur „echte“ Emotionen ausdrücken, sondern auch gespielte. Damit eröffnet die Mimik die Möglichkeit sozial erwünschten Ausdruck vorzuspielen und auch Emotionen bewusst vorzutäuschen. Diese Täuschungen sind jedoch zumeist nicht perfekt und können von kurzfristigen Gesichtsbewegungen begleitet sein, die auf die tatsächlich vorhandenen Emotionen hinweisen (Mikroexpressionen). Diese Mikroexpressionen sind von nur sehr kurzer Dauer und vom Menschen häufig kaum wahrnehmbar, jedoch das ideale Anwendungsgebiet für computergestützte Analysen. Diese automatische Identifikation von Mikroexpressionen hat in den letzten Jahren nicht nur wissenschaftliche Aufmerksamkeit erfahren, sondern ihr Einsatz wird auch in sicherheitsrelevanten Bereichen getestet. Der vorliegende Artikel fasst den aktuellen Wissensstand von Mimik und Emotionen zusammen. ABSTRACT Human facial expressions are unique in their ability to express our emotions and communicate them to others. The mimic expression of basic emotions is very similar across different cultures and has also many features in common with other mammals. This suggests a common genetic origin of the association between facial expressions and emotion. However, recent studies also show cultural influences and differences. The recognition of emotions from facial expressions, as well as the process of expressing one’s emotions facially, occurs within an extremely complex cerebral network. Due to the complexity of the cerebral processing system, there are a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders that can significantly disrupt the coupling of facial expressions and emotions. Wearing masks also limits our ability to convey and recognize emotions through facial expressions. Through facial expressions, however, not only “real” emotions can be expressed, but also acted ones. Thus, facial expressions open up the possibility of faking socially desired expressions and also of consciously faking emotions. However, these pretenses are mostly imperfect and can be accompanied by short-term facial movements that indicate the emotions that are actually present (microexpressions). These microexpressions are of very short duration and often barely perceptible by humans, but they are the ideal application area for computer-aided analysis. This automatic identification of microexpressions has not only received scientific attention in recent years, but its use is also being tested in security-related areas. This article summarizes the current state of knowledge of facial expressions and emotions.","[{'authorId': '47016130', 'name': 'C. Klingner'}, {'authorId': '2149403111', 'name': 'O.

b5c4f87c091104297c8ffd576899c5725bab3dd1,"ABSTRACT When people use humorous media content, their behavior and assessments of the content may depend on the emotional expressions (e.g., laughter) of those around them. In a laboratory experiment in which 80 participants watched a movie clip with a confederate who either laughed or remained silent, we identified two parallel processes. The confederate’s laughter induced behavioral responses in our participants (laughing or smiling). Through those responses, a corresponding appraisal of the media content was generated: The content was rated funnier in comparison to situations in which the confederate did not laugh. This effect corresponds to emotional contagion processes and was especially pronounced in introverts. Additionally, participants who were low in conscientiousness directly elevated their funniness ratings (more than their own emotional expressions would suggest) when the confederate laughed. Those who were high in conscientiousness, however, lowered their ratings of the content’s funniness in the presence of a laughing confederate. This finding suggests the existence of an additional cognitive process that links confederate’s laughter and participant’s content ratings beyond automatic contagion. Participants with low conscientiousness use the confederate’s laughter as a heuristic cue for the content’s funniness, while highly conscientious participants discount the confederate’s laughter as a cue for content funniness.","[{'authorId': '2110604342', 'name': 'Mathias Weber'}, {'authorId': '1797122', 'name': 'Oliver Quiring'}]",13.0,"{'name': 'Media Psychology', 'pages': '173 - 195', 'volume': '22'}",75.0,"Is It Really That Funny?

A drawback of the commonly applied chi square test, in addition to the known problems related to sample size and power, is that it may indicate an increasing correspondence between the hypothesized model and the observed data as both the measurement properties and the relationship between constructs decline. Further, and contrary to common assertion, the risk of making a Type II error can be substantial even when the sample size is large. Moreover, the present testing methods are unable to assess a model's explanatory power. To overcome these problems, the authors develop and apply a testing system based on measures of shared variance within the structural model, measurement model, and overall model.","[{'authorId': '3000657', 'name': 'C.

Results theoretically consolidated the dual-process mechanism underpinning automatic emotional contagion and empirically verified an Emotional Contagion Model (ECM) from tourists to hosts. The compelling effects of mimicry, interaction context and stereotypes explained the emotional convergence and divergence between hosts and tourists. The study extended the knowledge boundary of host-tourist interaction to micro-level interpersonal emotional connection.

In this study, we consider processes of both emotional labor and emotional work in the financial planning profession. Financial planners occupy a role requiring ongoing relationships with clients, conversations about the often emotional topic of money, and a need to manage emotion in a variety of interaction contexts. Thus, from extant theory and literature regarding emotion and communication, we proposed research questions regarding the roles of emotional labor and emotional work in the financial planning profession. These questions were investigated in a web-based survey study of almost 300 professional financial planners and supporting interviews with 14 financial planners.

Although socio‐emotional impairments are a defining feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), empirical evidence directly supporting the link between autonomic, cortical, and socio‐emotional abnormalities in ASD is still lacking. In this study, we examined autonomic arousal indexed by skin conductance responses (SCR), concurrent cortical responses measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging, and effective brain connectivity estimated by dynamic causal modeling in seventeen unmedicated high‐functioning adults with ASD and seventeen matched controls while they performed an empathy‐for‐pain task. Compared to controls, adults with ASD showed enhanced SCR related to empathetic pain, along with increased neural activity in the anterior insular cortex, although their behavioral empathetic pain discriminability was reduced and overall SCR was decreased. ASD individuals also showed enhanced correlation between SCR and neural activities in the anterior insular cortex. Importantly, significant group differences in effective brain connectivity were limited to greater reduction in the negative intrinsic connectivity of the anterior insular cortex in the ASD group, indicating a failure in attenuating anterior insular responses to empathetic pain. These results suggest that aberrant interoceptive precision, as indexed by abnormalities in autonomic activity and its central representations, may underlie empathy deficits in ASD.

b7e4781cb053d316171641c17cf96262380041ab,"Since the subject of traffic dynamics has captured the interest of physicists, many surprising effects have been revealed and explained. Some of the questions now understood are the following: Why are vehicles sometimes stopped by “phantom traffic jams” even though drivers all like to drive fast? What are the mechanisms behind stop-and-go traffic? Why are there several different kinds of congestion, and how are they related? Why do most traffic jams occur considerably before the road capacity is reached? Can a temporary reduction in the volume of traffic cause a lasting traffic jam? Under which conditions can speed limits speed up traffic? Why do pedestrians moving in opposite directions normally organize into lanes, while similar systems “freeze by heating”? All of these questions have been answered by applying and extending methods from statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics to self-driven many-particle systems. This article considers the empirical data and then reviews the main approaches to modeling pedestrian and vehicle traffic. These include microscopic (particle-based), mesoscopic (gas-kinetic), and macroscopic (fluid-dynamic) models. Attention is also paid to the formulation of a micro-macro link, to aspects of universality, and to other unifying concepts, such as a general modeling framework for self-driven many-particle systems, including spin systems. While the primary focus is upon vehicle and pedestrian traffic, applications to biological or socio-economic systems such as bacterial colonies, flocks of birds, panics, and stock market dynamics are touched upon as well.","[{'authorId': '1768825', 'name': 'D.

However, many of these studies report the activation of varying motor system areas that include the primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area, dorsal and ventral pre-motor areas and parietal regions. In order to examine what specific roles are played by various motor regions during music perception, we used activation likelihood estimation (ALE) to conduct a meta-analysis of neuroimaging literature on passive music listening. After extensive search of the literature, 42 studies were analyzed resulting in a total of 386 unique subjects contributing 694 activation foci in total. As suspected, auditory activations were found in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, transverse temporal gyrus, insula, pyramis, bilateral precentral gyrus, and bilateral medial frontal gyrus. We also saw the widespread activation of motor networks including left and right lateral premotor cortex, right primary motor cortex, and the left cerebellum.

Whereas the typical agonistic context of such contact is relatively rare within natural elephant families, other causes of distress may trigger similar, other-regarding responses. In a study carried out at an elephant camp in Thailand, we found that elephants affiliated significantly more with other individuals through directed, physical contact and vocal communication following a distress event than in control periods. In addition, bystanders affiliated with each other, and matched the behavior and emotional state of the first distressed individual, suggesting emotional contagion. The initial distress responses were overwhelmingly directed toward ambiguous stimuli, thus making it difficult to determine if bystanders reacted to the distressed individual or showed a delayed response to the same stimulus. Nonetheless, the directionality of the contacts and their nature strongly suggest attention toward the emotional states of conspecifics. The elephants’ behavior is therefore best classified with similar consolation responses by apes, possibly based on convergent evolution of empathic capacities.","[{'authorId': '5675701', 'name': 'Joshua M.

Analysis of these data suggested that not only is job insecurity related to the likelihood of experiencing an accident, but also perceptions of job insecurity may serve to inhibit the reporting of accidents to appropriate company officials. Overall, the rate of accidents was lower in Italy than the United States. Moreover, in both countries, when job insecurity was low, there was little difference between the total number of experienced accidents and the number that employees reported.

Here we delineated brain networks subserving social perception under naturalistic conditions in 19 healthy humans who watched, during 3-T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a set of 137 short (approximately 16 s each, total 27 min) audiovisual movie clips depicting pre-selected social signals. Two independent raters estimated how well each clip represented eight social features (faces, human bodies, biological motion, goal-oriented actions, emotion, social interaction, pain, and speech) and six filler features (places, objects, rigid motion, people not in social interaction, non-goal-oriented action, and non-human sounds) lacking social content. These ratings were used as predictors in the fMRI analysis. The posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) responded to all social features but not to any non-social features, and the anterior STS responded to all social features except bodies and biological motion. We also found four partially segregated, extended networks for processing of specific social signals: (1) a fronto-temporal network responding to multiple social categories, (2) a fronto-parietal network preferentially activated to bodies, motion, and pain, (3) a temporo-amygdalar network responding to faces, social interaction, and speech, and (4) a fronto-insular network responding to pain, emotions, social interactions, and speech.

Both manipulations affected empathic embarrassment. Study 2 further examined the effects of targets' embarrassment displays and observers' prior experience with the situation upon spontaneous perspective-taking, expressive mimicry, and empathic embarrassment. Embarrassment displays increased mimicry, but also spontaneous perspective-taking and subsequent empathy. Prior experience moderated the effects of embarrassment displays on perspective-taking and empathy.

While emotional contagion has been traditionally considered to be a prerogative of mammals and birds, recent findings are demonstrating otherwise. Here, we investigate emotional contagion in groups of zebrafish, a freshwater model species which is gaining momentum in preclinical studies. Zebrafish have high genetic homology to humans, and they exhibit a complex behavioral repertoire amenable to study social behavior. To investigate whether individual emotional states can be transmitted to group members, we pharmacologically modulated anxiety-related behaviors of a single fish through Citalopram administration and we assessed whether the altered emotional state spread to a group of four untreated conspecifics. By capitalizing upon our in-house developed tracking algorithm, we successfully preserved the identity of all the subjects and thoroughly described their individual and social behavioral phenotypes. In accordance with our predictions, we observed that Citalopram administration consistently reduced behavioral anxiety of the treated individual, in the form of reduced geotaxis, and that such a behavioral pattern readily generalized to the untreated subjects. A transfer entropy analysis of causal interactions within the group revealed that emotional contagion was directional, whereby the treated individual influenced untreated subjects, but not vice-versa. This study offers additional evidence that emotional contagion is biologically preserved in simpler living organisms amenable to preclinical investigations.","[{'authorId': '114749676', 'name': 'Daniel Alberto Burbano Lombana'}, {'authorId': '145838336', 'name': 'S.

The relation between mood or emotions and concurrent ambulatory blood pressure responses holds both fundamental and clinical interest.


METHODS
The primary sample consisted of 69 normotensive or borderline hypertensive but otherwise healthy adult males. The validation sample consisted of 85 healthy male undergraduate college students. Both samples underwent half-hourly 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements on four separate workdays, 1 week apart. At each ambulatory measurement, subjects recorded their behavior, environment, and mood. The circular mood scale, a circular visual analogue scale based on the circumplex model of mood, was used to reflect the totality of a participant's affective state space. Longitudinal random effects regression models were applied in the data analysis.


RESULTS
The results for both samples were quite similar. Sleep and posture had the greatest influence on ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate. The effects of the environmental setting, social setting, and consumption were modest but statistically significant. Independent of these covariates, mood exerted a significant effect on blood pressure and heart rate. Relative to the ""mellow"" default category, blood pressure increased both for ""anxious/annoyed"" and ""elated/happy"" and decreased during ""disengaged/sleepy"" mood. The range of mood-related blood pressure estimates was 6.0/3.7 mm Hg.


CONCLUSIONS
The pattern of blood pressure responses suggests that they were related to the degree of engagement of a mood rather than the degree of unpleasantness. The hypothesis that posits that negative affect-related cardiovascular reactivity mediates the observed correlation between negative affect and disease risk should be reconsidered.","[{'authorId': '3107542', 'name': 'R.

Finally, in Study 3, participants in Canada and South Africa randomly assigned to buy items for charity reported higher levels of positive affect than participants assigned to buy the same items for themselves, even when this prosocial spending did not provide an opportunity to build or strengthen social ties.

Whereas human pro-social behavior is often driven by empathic concern for another, it is unclear whether nonprimate mammals experience a similar motivational state. To test for empathically motivated pro-social behavior in rodents, we placed a free rat in an arena with a cagemate trapped in a restrainer. After several sessions, the free rat learned to intentionally and quickly open the restrainer and free the cagemate. Rats did not open empty or object-containing restrainers. They freed cagemates even when social contact was prevented. When liberating a cagemate was pitted against chocolate contained within a second restrainer, rats opened both restrainers and typically shared the chocolate.

We first discuss the hypothesis that emotion categories are abstract and conceptual, whose instances share a goal-based function in a particular context but are highly variable in their affective, physical, and perceptual features. Next, we discuss the possibility that emotional development is the process of developing emotion concepts, and that emotion words may be a critical part of this process. We hypothesize that infants and children learn emotion categories the way they learn other abstract conceptual categories-by observing others use the same emotion word to label highly variable events. Finally, we hypothesize that emotional development can be understood as a concept construction problem: a child becomes capable of experiencing and perceiving emotion only when her brain develops the capacity to assemble ad hoc, situated emotion concepts for the purposes of guiding behavior and giving meaning to sensory inputs.

ba1ef30429f0517fb3dbd965c951efc69c654c14,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 was identified for the first time in China, in December 2019. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported around the world; indeed, this infection has been declared a pandemic. Consequently, the scientific community is working hard to gain useful information about the history of this virus, its transmission, diagnosis, clinical features, radiological findings, research and development of candidate therapeutics as well as vaccines. This review aims to analyze the diagnostic techniques used to ascertain the COVID-19 infection, critically reviewing positive points and criticism for forensic implications, obviously including autopsy. Finally, this review proposes a practical workflow to be applied in the management of corpses during this outbreak of the COVID-19 infection, which could be useful in cases of future infectious disease emergencies. Analyzing the diagnostic methods, to date, virus nucleic acid RT-PCR represents the standard method used to ascertain the COVID-19 infection in living subjects and corpses, even if this technique has several criticisms: mainly, the staff should be highly specialized, working in high-throughput settings, able to handle high workloads and aware of health risks and the importance of the results. Thus, IgG/IgM serological tests have been developed, overcoming RT-qPCR duration, costs, and management, not requiring highly trained personnel. Nevertheless, serological tests present problems; the WHO recommends the use of these new point-of-care immunodiagnostic tests only in research settings. Furthermore, nothing has yet been published regarding the possibility of applying these methods during post-mortem investigations. In light of this scenario, in this review, we suggest a flow chart for the pathologist called on to ascertain the cause of death of a subject with historical and clinical findings of COVID-19 status or without any anamnestic, diagnostic, or exposure information. Indeed, the literature data confirmed the analytical vulnerabilities of the kits used for laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, particularly during postmortem examinations. For these reasons, autopsy remains the gold standard method to ascertain the exact cause of death (from or with COVID-19 infection, or other causes), to consequently provide real data for statistical evaluations and to take necessary measures to contain the risks of the infection. Moreover, performing autopsies could provide information on the pathogenesis of the COVID-19 infection with obvious therapeutic implications.","[{'authorId': '46538295', 'name': 'F.

Here, we tested for a correlation between exploration behaviour and response latency time to a simulated fish predator attack in a fish species, juvenile convict cichlids (Amatitlania nigrofasciata). Individual focal fish were subjected to a standardized attack by a robotic fish predator while foraging, and separately given two repeated trials of exploration of a novel environment.

Fish that were fast to explore the novel environment were slower to respond to the predator.

bbb9d5669ae86a67eda71de10c62b675641f3025,"PURPOSE
This study aimed to examine the associations among emotional labor strategies, stress from emotional labor, and burnout in nurses.


DESIGN
We employed a descriptive cross-sectional design. Data were collected from May to November 2018 in South Korea using structured questionnaires. Participants were 303 nurses from 27 hospitals, who were recruited by convenience sampling.


METHODS
Emotional labor strategies (surface acting, deep acting, and expression of naturally felt emotions), stress, and burnout were self-reported. A path analysis using structural equation modeling was performed to examine the associations among the study variables.


FINDINGS
Bivariate analyses revealed that surface acting was positively correlated with stress and burnout, deep acting was negatively correlated with burnout, and naturally felt emotions were negatively correlated with stress and burnout. The path analysis revealed that surface acting was positively associated with stress, naturally felt emotions were negatively associated with burnout, and the stress from emotional labor was positively associated with burnout. Although surface acting was not directly associated with burnout, it was indirectly associated through stress.


CONCLUSIONS
Surface acting involves regulation and suppression of one's felt emotions. The findings of this study suggest that hospitals need to reduce expectations for surface acting to reduce nurses' stress and burnout. Organizational efforts to provide interventions that improve nurses' ability to manage their emotions in interactions with patients might effectively foster nurses' well-being.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
Surface acting might contribute to nurses' burnout, and naturally felt emotions might reduce nurses' burnout. Nurse managers should thus provide opportunities to discuss the utilized emotional labor strategies and encourage appropriate responses depending on the patient context. Programs that promote emotional competence may reduce the adverse effects associated with nurses' emotional labor and foster effective coping strategies.","[{'authorId': '2001022670', 'name': 'Ji-Soo Kim'}]",47.0,,32.0,"Emotional Labor Strategies, Stress, and Burnout Among Hospital Nurses: A Path Analysis.",2019.0

Both academics and practitioners regard customer loyalty as being fundamental to a company's success. Developing customer loyalty is also a strategy that is well suited to the service industry precisely because services offer more opportunities for such development to take place. Yet despite the obvious importance of customer loyalty to all businesses, and in particular to services, there is still much to be learnt. The purpose of this study is to analyse the impact of service quality, satisfaction and trust on customer loyalty to the service provider by means of structural equation modelling. The results of the empirical research on travel agencies reveal how loyalty depends on the customer's degree of satisfaction and trust. In turn, satisfaction is influenced by service quality. Most previous studies have focused on quality and satisfaction but in this study, we extend the list of factors which predict loyalty by emphasising the importance of trust. The results also confirm that the SERVQUAL scale is applicable to the travel agency sector, and underline the existence of the five dimensions proposed by the original authors.

Our model accounts for permanent, stable disposition and the dynamic nature of human behaviors that change in response to the situation. The resulting approach accounts for changes in behavior in response to external stressors based on well-known theories in psychology. We combine this model with recent techniques on personality modeling for multi-agent simulations to capture a wide variety of behavioral changes and stressors. The overall formulation allows different stressors, expressed as functions of space and time, including time pressure, positional stressors, area stressors and inter-personal stressors. This model can be used to simulate dynamic crowd behaviors at interactive rates, including walking at variable speeds, breaking lane-formation over time, and cutting through a normal flow.

The groups are the most complex structure that can be controlled in different degrees of autonomy. This autonomy refers to the extent to which the virtual agents are independent of the user intervention and also the amount of information needed to simulate crowds. Thus, depending on the complexity of the simulation, simple behaviors can be sufficient to simulate crowds. Otherwise, more complicated behavioral rules can be necessary, and in this case, it can be included in the simulation data in order to improve the realism of the animation. We present three different ways for controlling crowd behaviors: i) by using innate and scripted behaviors; ii) by defining behavioral rules, using events and reactions, and, iii) by providing an external control to guide crowd behaviors in real time. The two main contributions of our approach are: the possibility of increasing the complexity of group/agent behaviors according to the problem to be simulated, and the hierarchical structure based on groups to compose a crowd.","[{'authorId': '1679516', 'name': 'S.

Like other neuropeptides, oxy can modulate a wide range of neurotransmitter and neuromodulator activities. Additionally, through the neurohypophysis, oxy is secreted into the systemic circulation to act as a hormone, thereby influencing several body functions. Oxy plays a pivotal role in parturition, milk let-down and maternal behavior and has been demonstrated to be important in the formation of pair bonding between mother and infants as well as in mating pairs. Furthermore, oxy has been proven to play a key role in the regulation of several behaviors associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, including social interactions, social memory response to social stimuli, decision-making in the context of social interactions, feeding behavior, emotional reactivity, etc. An increasing body of evidence suggests that deregulations of the oxytocinergic system might be involved in the pathophysiology of certain neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, eating disorders, schizophrenia, mood, and anxiety disorders. The potential use of oxy in these mental health disorders is attracting growing interest since numerous beneficial properties are ascribed to this neuropeptide. The present manuscript will review the existing findings on the role played by oxy in a variety of distinct physiological and behavioral functions (Figure 1) and on its role and impact in different psychiatric disorders.

 The inherent nature of social media content poses serious challenges to practical applications of sentiment analysis. We present VADER, a simple rule-based model for general sentiment analysis, and compare its effectiveness to eleven typical state-of-practice benchmarks including LIWC, ANEW, the General Inquirer, SentiWordNet, and machine learning oriented techniques relying on Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, we first construct and empirically validate a gold-standard list of lexical features (along with their associated sentiment intensity measures) which are specifically attuned to sentiment in microblog-like contexts. We then combine these lexical features with consideration for five general rules that embody grammatical and syntactical conventions for expressing and emphasizing sentiment intensity. Interestingly, using our parsimonious rule-based model to assess the sentiment of tweets, we find that VADER outperforms individual human raters (F1 Classification Accuracy = 0.96 and 0.84, respectively), and generalizes more favorably across contexts than any of our benchmarks.

To determine whether there are age differences in positive and negative repetitive thought (i.e., rumination).


METHOD
Young adults (ages 19-39; N = 114) and Older Adults (ages 60-85; N = 88) completed measures of negative and positive rumination. Bayesian analyses were used to determine whether age differences were present for both negative (young > old) and positive (old > young) rumination.


RESULTS
There was extremely strong evidence for age differences in negative rumination, with lower scores in older adults. In contrast, the evidence was in favor of the null hypothesis for positive rumination.


DISCUSSION
Age-related positivity is better characterized as decreased dwelling on the meaning of negative moods, rather than increased attention to positive ones.","[{'authorId': '40522950', 'name': 'Lisa J.

bd0c8720c8276053eefcf814008cbde389955a72,"Introduction Contemporary socio-demographic landscape, increased number of dual earner couples in the workforce, technological and market changes which demand 24/7 business hours and pressure on individuals for sufficient financial stability have squeezed the distinction between the work and family role domains of an individual. This has significant implications for work-family balance (Nair, 2013; Nayeem & Tripathy, 2012; Pandu, Balu & Poorani, 2013). Researchers have applied various frameworks to study the link between the two integral spheres of life, work and family. Among these, the conflict framework has occupied a respectable space in the literature of work-family balance/interaction. Conflict framework (Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985) assumes that work and family are two different role domains. They have different sets of demands and responsibilities. Investment of more time and energy in one role will make it difficult to perform efficiently in the other, leading to WFC. Studies on WFC have extensively used spillover and crossover models which suggest that demands or strains from one role domain are carried over to the other role domain (Bakker & Demerouti, 2013; Van Emmerik & Peeters, 2009; Westman, 2001, 2005; Zhang, Foley & Yang, 2013). Spillover is a within-person across domains transmission of strain from one area of life to another whereas crossover involves transmission across individuals, where the demands and their consequent strain crossover between closely related individuals (e.g., from one partner to another partner in a dyad) (Westman, 2001). Along with the conflict framework, 'role expansion' framework (Marks, 1977) has also received sufficient attention in the literature. The underlying assumption of role expansion framework is that work and family do not always interfere with each other; rather they may overshadow the negative effects and benefit of each other leading to work-family facilitation (WFF). Several synonymous terms are used to describe the positive interaction between work and family such as positive spillover, work-family facilitation, work-family synergy and work-family enrichment (Allis & O'Driscoll, 2008; Greenhaus & Powell, 2006; Masuda, McNall, Allen & Nicklin, 2012; Wayne, Musisca & Fleeson, 2004). WFF is defined as the extent to which an individual's engagement in one life domain (i.e., work/family) provides gains (i.e., developmental, affective, capital, or efficiency) which contribute to enhanced functioning of another life domain (i.e., family/work) (Carlson et al., 2006; Wayne, Grzywacz, Carlson & Kacmard, 2007). Impacts of WFF on individuals have been widely studied using the spillover model and application of cross over model in WFF research is scarce (Carlson et al., 2011). Studies using crossover models majorly have been conducted in the Western context which provides impetus to examine the same in the socio-cultural context of India. Also, studies have mostly focused on crossover of stress, strain, burnout and engagement. Rarely attempts have been made to integrate both WFC and WFF in a research model and examine the crossover of the same in supervisor and subordinate dyads in a workplace setting. Given the rise of jobs involving team work (Carlson et al., 2011; Van Emmerik & Peeters, 2009), examination of crossover of work-family experience between supervisors and subordinates requires attention from researchers. Work-Life Balance & Supervisor-subordinate Relationships Research has considerably highlighted the importance of work-life balance for organizational and individual performance (Chawla & Sondhi, 2011). With the increase in WFC, there is decrease in work-life balance (Chawla & Sondhi, 2011) and job satisfaction (Baral, 2016) and increase in turnover intention and burnout levels (Nayeem & Tripathy, 2012). Indians, being a part of a collectivist culture, give high priority to fulfill their family and social responsibilities (Hofstede, 2001; Rathi & Barath, 2013). …","[{'authorId': '2576307', 'name': 'P.

Here we present results on individuals' heart rate (HR) responses during various situations, which occur regularly in a flock of greylag geese (Anser anser, e.g. agonistic encounters, vehicles passing by). We recorded simultaneously HR and behaviour of 21 semi-tame free-roaming geese, equipped with fully implanted transmitters. We considered 304 social and 81 non-social events during which the focal individuals did not respond behaviourally. Independent of the spatial distance to the event, these HR responses were significantly greater in social contexts (e.g. departing or landing geese, agonistic interactions) than in non-social situations (e.g. vehicles passing by, thunder). Focal individuals showed a significantly higher maximum HR as well as a greater HR increase in response to agonistic interactions, in which the pair partner or a family member was involved, as compared with a non-affiliated goose. Also, HR was significantly higher when the bystander watched non-affiliated geese interacting, which were higher ranking than the focal. We conclude that these differences are due to different relevance of the recorded events for the focal individual, depending on the individuals involved in the observed interaction.","[{'authorId': '5486107', 'name': 'C.

This comprehensive review presents a synthesis and critique of the evolution of the existing WF literature from 1985 to the present, emphasizing papers since 2005 in order to highlight the gaps and limitations in current research. Our study classifies the current research into five broad themes: (1) definitions, (2) theories, (3) antecedents and outcomes of WF conflict and enrichment, (4) WF policies, and (5) methodological approaches. Future research opportunities in the field include a deeper understanding on how to cope effectively when WF conflict, how to achieve WF enrichment, how do different type of employees experience the WF interface, and how can researchers address methodological problems (causality, endogeneity, simultaneity, effect size and self-selection bias) to better handle the complexity of WF issues.","[{'authorId': '89795003', 'name': 'Katherina Kuschel'}]",7.0,,102.0,The evolution of the work-family field: Gaps and missing links as opportunities for future research,2014.0

Inspired by the visual field and movement characteristic of pedestrians, we developed a 2-D continuous model that integrates a self-slowing, local direction-changing mechanism, and visual hindrance information. The model allows for the movement in continuous space and time, only controlled by simple kinematic equations and visual hindrance distribution. In order to get the parameters of the kinematic equations, we conducted controlled experiments, collected empirical data, and obtained velocity-changing and direction-changing relations. We then validate the model by simulating three experimental scenarios, i.e., passage, bottleneck, and classroom evacuation. It is found that some typical phenomena such as the stop-and-go waves in the passage and lane formation in the bottleneck can be reproduced. The obtained fundamental diagram and specific flow agree with classic conclusions and experimental measures very well. It is hoped that the idea of this study may be helpful in promoting the modeling and simulation study of pedestrian flow.","[{'authorId': '143794921', 'name': 'W.

The method was used in one experiment, reported here. Participants who were induced to feel happiness, sadness, or neutral emotion, saw computerized 100-frame movies in which the first frame always showed a face expressing a specific emotion (e.g. happiness). The facial expression gradually became neutral over the course of the movie. Participants played the movie, changing the facial expression, and indicated the frame at which the initial expression was no longer present on the face. Emotion congruent expressions were perceived to persist longer than were emotion incongruent expressions. The findings are consistent with previous findings documenting enhanced perceptual processing of emotion congruent information. The value of the current technique, and the types of everyday situations that it might model are discussed. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[{'authorId': '1986858', 'name': 'P.

Whereas job satisfaction generally continues to be loosely but not carefully thought of and measured as an affective state, critical work in the 1990s has raised serious questions about the affective status of job satisfaction in terms of its causes as well as its definition and measurement. Recent research has focused on the production of moods and emotions at work, with an emphasis, at least conceptually, on stressful events, leaders, work groups, physical settings, and rewards/punishment. Other recent research has addressed the consequences of workers' feelings, in particular, a variety of performance outcomes (e.g., helping behaviors and creativity). Even though recent interest in affect in the workplace has been intense, many theoretical and methodological opportunities and challenges remain.","[{'authorId': '2164776', 'name': 'A.

The AIM, based on a multiprocess approach to social judgments, identifies 4 alternative judgmental strategies: (a) direct access, (b) motivated, (c) heuristic, and (d) substantive processing. The model predicts that the degree of affect infusion into judgments varies along a processing continuum, such that judgments requiring heuristic or substantive processing are more likely to be infused by affect than are direct access or motivated judgments. The role of target, judge, and situational variables in recruiting high- or low-infusion judgmental strategies is considered, and empirical support for the model is reviewed. The relationship between the AIM and other affect-cognition theories is discussed, and implications for future research are outlined.","[{'authorId': '1876002', 'name': 'J.

be2cda85c013d694a2636fcf0fae57755e5d544b,"Arguments swirl about explanations about the function of self-grooming in mammals. For instance, mammals self-groom to remove parasites that maybe transferred from a nearby opposite-sex conspecific during an encounter. Animals also self-groom when they encounter the odor of an opposite-sex conspecific because self-grooming is a re-directed behavior displayed by individuals that are torn between fleeing and fighting. Animals may self-groom to relieve stress and be a form of de-arousal. In other cases, animals may self-groom to indicate their response to conspecifics. The ubiquity of self-grooming in different contexts suggests that it serves multiple functions. Consequently, in this review, we do much to avoid arguments against these other roles for self-grooming. It is not our intent nor do we feel that it is constructive to label self-grooming as being solely a response to anxiety or stress, a mechanism to lower body temperature, or a behavior involved in care of the body surface. This limited view does not accept the possibility that self-grooming serves multiple domains. Rather, in this paper, we focus on a very specific context for self-grooming. That is, when an individual encounters the odors of a conspecific and self-grooms.","[{'authorId': '1416580750', 'name': 'H. Ferkin'}, {'authorId': '134795440', 'name': 'T.

Phase 1 of this project generated items for an exploratory questionnaire to which a broad sample of service workers responded (N = 358). Analysis revealed two dimensions of emotional labor: emotive effort, a construct never before identified in the emotional labor literature; and emotive dissonance, an acknowledged dimension that is further validated by this study. Several viable antecedent constructs of emotional labor also were identified and incorporated into an emerging model of emotional labor. In Phase 2, revised scales were administered to a second sample of service workers (N = 427) for reliability and validity purposes. Structural equation modeling also was used to establish relationships among emotional labor’s dimensions and various antecedent variables, facilitating development of a model of emotional labor.","[{'authorId': '116544550', 'name': 'Susan M.

We present numerical evidence that this model results in a kinetic phase transition from no transport (zero average velocity, $|{\mathbf{v}}_{a}|\phantom{\rule{0ex}{0ex}}=\phantom{\rule{0ex}{0ex}}0$) to finite net transport through spontaneous symmetry breaking of the rotational symmetry.

This model can simulate pedestrian movement with different walk velocities through update at different time-step intervals. Two kinds of boundary conditions including periodic and open boundary for pedestrian counter flow are considered, and their dynamical characteristics are discussed. Simulation results show that for periodic boundary condition there are three phases of pedestrian patterns, i.e., freely moving phase, lane formation phase, and perfectly stopped phase at some certain total density ranges. In the stage of lane formation, the phenomenon that pedestrians exceed those with lower walk velocity through a narrow walkway can be found. For open boundary condition, at some certain entrance densities, there are two steady states of pedestrian patterns; but the first is metastable. Spontaneous fluctuations can break the first steady state, i.e., freely moving phase, and run into the second steady state, i.e., perfectly stopped phase.","[{'authorId': '37687017', 'name': 'W.

Results were also frequently misinterpreted and not replicable, so claims that fish feel pain remain unsubstantiated. Comparable problems exist in studies of invertebrates. In contrast, an extensive literature involving surgeries with fishes shows normal feeding and activity immediately or soon after surgery. C fiber nociceptors, the most prevalent type in mammals and responsible for excruciating pain in humans, are rare in teleosts and absent in elasmobranchs studied to date. A-delta nociceptors, not yet found in elasmobranchs, but relatively common in teleosts, likely serve rapid, less noxious injury signaling, triggering escape and avoidance responses. Clearly, fishes have survived well without the full range of nociception typical of humans or other mammals, a circumstance according well with the absence of the specialized cortical regions necessary for pain in humans. We evaluate recent claims for consciousness in fishes, but find these claims lack adequate supporting evidence, neurological feasibility, or the likelihood that consciousness would be adaptive. Even if fishes were conscious, it is unwarranted to assume that they possess a human-like capacity for pain. Overall, the behavioral and neurobiological evidence reviewed shows fish responses to nociceptive stimuli are limited and fishes are unlikely to experience pain.","[{'authorId': '145628542', 'name': 'J.

In a visual cueing paradigm, observers responded faster to a target probe appearing in the location of a face cue than of a competing object cue (Experiments 1a and 2a). This effect could be reversed when faces were negatively predictive of the likely target location, making it beneficial to attend to the object cues (Experiments 1b and 2b). It was easier still to strategically shift attention to predictive face cues (Experiment 2c), indicating that the endogenous allocation of attention was augmented here by an additional effect. However, faces merely delayed the voluntary deployment of attention to object cues, but they could not prevent it, even at short cue-target intervals. This finding suggests that attention biases for faces can be rapidly countered by an observer's endogenous control.","[{'authorId': '3186314', 'name': 'M.

Although the main clinical manifestations are respiratory, an increase in neurological conditions, specifically acute cerebrovascular disease, has been detected. We present cerebrovascular disease case incidence in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients were confirmed by microbiological/serological testing, or on chest CT semiology. Available data on comorbidity, laboratory parameters, treatment administered, neuroimaging, neuropathological studies and clinical evolution during hospitalization, measured by the modified Rankin scale, were analysed. A bivariate study was also designed to identify differences between ischaemic and haemorrhagic subtypes. A statistical model of binary logistic regression and sensitivity analysis was designed to study the influence of independent variables over prognosis. In our centre, there were 1683 admissions of patients with COVID-19 over 50 days, of which 23 (1.4%) developed cerebrovascular disease. Within this group of patients, cerebral and chest CT scans were performed in all cases, and MRI in six (26.1%). Histological samples were obtained in 6/23 cases (two brain biopsies, and four arterial thrombi). Seventeen patients were classified as cerebral ischaemia (73.9%, with two arterial dissections), five as intracerebral haemorrhage (21.7%), and one leukoencephalopathy of posterior reversible encephalopathy type. Haemorrhagic patients had higher ferritin levels at the time of stroke (1554.3 versus 519.2, P = 0.004). Ischaemic strokes were unexpectedly frequent in the vertebrobasilar territory (6/17, 35.3%). In the haemorrhagic group, a characteristic radiological pattern was identified showing subarachnoid haemorrhage, parieto-occipital leukoencephalopathy, microbleeds and single or multiple focal haematomas. Brain biopsies performed showed signs of thrombotic microangiopathy and endothelial injury, with no evidence of vasculitis or necrotizing encephalitis. The functional prognosis during the hospital period was unfavourable in 73.9% (17/23 modified Rankin scale 4–6), and age was the main predictive variable (odds ratio = 1.5; 95% confidence interval 1.012–2.225; P = 0.043). Our series shows cerebrovascular disease incidence of 1.4% in patients with COVID-19 with high morbidity and mortality. We describe pathological and radiological data consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy caused by endotheliopathy with a haemorrhagic predisposition.","[{'authorId': '1429438122', 'name': 'F.

These states--called core affect--influence reflexes, perception, cognition, and behavior and are influenced by many causes internal and external, but people have no direct access to these causal connections. Core affect can therefore be experienced as free-floating (mood) or can be attributed to some cause (and thereby begin an emotional episode). These basic processes spawn a broad framework that includes perception of the core-affect-altering properties of stimuli, motives, empathy, emotional meta-experience, and affect versus emotion regulation; it accounts for prototypical emotional episodes, such as fear and anger, as core affect attributed to something plus various nonemotional processes.","[{'authorId': '46367714', 'name': 'J.

Recently objective physiological methods for measurement of emotion have been applied in the tourism field. However, there are few studies which explore the benefits and limitations of applying physiological and self-report methods to measure emotions. This research aims to compare and contrast physiological and self-report methods to assess emotional responses to tourism marketing stimuli where music was manipulated. This research assessed emotional responses from 37 participants to three tourism advertisements of Iran using four key methods; specifically, FaceReader™, skin conductance, self-report surveys and post hoc interviews. This research found that the light rhythmic music tends to evoke positive emotions and a higher level of emotional arousal in participants than does the traditional Iranian music or a video without music. Physiological and self-report measures of emotional arousal were inconsistent, but both techniques found similar results for assessing the valence of emotions. Thus, results highlight the importance of applying physiological techniques in combination with self-report surveys and post hoc interviews to provide a better and more accurate understanding of emotional experiences.","[{'authorId': '90586366', 'name': 'A.

Previous studies on mirror neurons concerned hand actions. Here, we describe the mirror responses of F5 neurons that motorically code mouth actions. The results showed that about one‐third of mouth motor neurons also discharge when the monkey observes another individual performing mouth actions. The majority of these ‘mouth mirror neurons’ become active during the execution and observation of mouth actions related to ingestive functions such as grasping, sucking or breaking food. Another population of mouth mirror neurons also discharges during the execution of ingestive actions, but the most effective visual stimuli in triggering them are communicative mouth gestures (e.g. lip smacking). Some also fire when the monkey makes communicative gestures. These findings extend the notion of mirror system from hand to mouth action and suggest that area F5, the area considered to be the homologue of human Broca's area, is also involved in communicative functions.","[{'authorId': '2995096', 'name': 'P.

In this study, we extend the proposed SOSa-SPSa model (susceptible-optimistic-susceptible and susceptible-pessimistic-susceptible) by considering the interaction between optimists and pessimists. Simulation results show that our model is reasonable and can better explain the entire contagion process by considering three groups of people. The recovery speed of pessimists has an obvious regulative effect on the number of pessimists and the possibility of optimists coming in contact with pessimists to be infected as pessimism plays a greater role than that of reverting to susceptibility. The number of pessimists is positively related to the possibility that optimists come in contact with pessimists to become pessimistic but is negatively related to the possibility of the other way around. When the speed of spontaneous generation is slow, the number of pessimists sharply increases.

 In this paper, we examine whether sentiment of political blog entries is associated with increased feedback in terms of the quantity of triggered comments and whether the diffusion of sentiment might take place in the political blogosphere. Based on a data set of approximately 17,000 blog entries from the 60 most important German political blogs, we find that blog entries with either more positive or more negative overall sentiment tend to receive significantly more comments compared to sentiment-neutral or mixed-sentiment entries. Furthermore, our results show that positive as well as negative emotions might diffuse in the subsequent comments to corresponding blog entries.

The aged rat has a specific deficit in hippocampal glucocorticoid receptors, owing in large part to a loss of corticoid-sensitive neurons. This deficit may be the cause for the failure of aged rats to terminate corticosterone secretion at the end of stress, because extensive lesion and electrical stimulation studies have shown that the hippocampus exerts an inhibitory influence over adrenocortical activity and participates in glucocorticoid feedback. We have studied whether it is the loss of hippocampal neurons or of hippocampal glucocorticoid receptors in the aged rat that contributes most to this syndrome of corticosterone hypersecretion. To do this, we used two model systems for producing reversible glucocorticoid receptor depletion in the hippocampus, and we found that depletion of receptors without inducing cell loss results in corticosterone hypersecretion. Furthermore, correction of the receptor deficit results in normalization of corticosterone secretion. These results focus attention on the hippocampus as an important glucocorticoid sensor in relation to the stress response. They also provide important new physiological correlates for the remarkable plasticity of the hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor system, which is under independent control by corticosterone and by vasopressin.","[{'authorId': '3483421', 'name': 'R.

Burnout is a familiar problem within nursing. This longitudinal study was designed to examine the roles that generic and occupational specific job demands (i.e. ""pain and death"", ""patient and relative needs"", ""threats and violence"", ""professional worries""), and various work-related sources of support play in association with burnout in a sample of registered nurses in Sweden.


METHODS AND PARTICIPANTS
A questionnaire was completed on two different occasions, by the same group of nurses from three hospitals and two primary health care centers. Nurses with initial low and moderate scores on emotional exhaustion (n=585) and depersonalization (n=631) were included in the logistic regression analyses. Initial scores, as well as four categories examining change over time in the predictors (unchanged low, improved, impaired, unchanged high), were associated with burnout approximately one year later.


RESULTS
In the multivariate analyses, quantitative job demands and professional worries were associated with emotional exhaustion. Poor co-worker support was associated with depersonalization over time.


CONCLUSION
This study suggests an association between generic as well as occupational specific job demands and emotional exhaustion. Furthermore, an association between poor co-worker support and depersonalization was suggested. Implications of these findings and recommended directions for future research are discussed.","[{'authorId': '2094953', 'name': 'Lisa Sundin'}, {'authorId': '2255229836', 'name': 'Jacek Hochwälder'}, {'authorId': '2255214871', 'name': 'Jan Lisspers'}]",64.0,,0.0,"A longitudinal examination of generic and occupational specific job demands, and work-related social support associated with burnout among nurses in Sweden.",2011.0

The test results showed that there are no statistically significant differences in model fits from the two data collection methods.

The purpose of this study was to understand the emotional intelligence level (EI) and negative emotional status of the front-line nurses in the epidemic situation and to further explore the relationship between them.


BACKGROUND
During the COVID-19 epidemic, under the influence of multiple factors, nurses were vulnerable to negative emotions. While previous studies have explored, the role of emotional intelligence in negative emotions, the relationship between the two has not been sufficiently discussed in the context of COVID-19.


DESIGN
The study carried out a cross-sectional survey. The STROBE was selected as the checklist in this study.


METHODS
202 nurses from Wuhan makeshift hospital participated in the questionnaire survey. Data collection tools included a general data questionnaire designed by the researchers, Chinese version of EI scale (WLEIS-C) and Chinese version of depression-anxiety-stress scale (DASS-21). Descriptive statistics, single factor analysis, and correlation analysis were used to analyze the data.


RESULTS
The emotional intelligence of the front-line nurses was in the upper middle range. Among the negative emotions, anxiety was the most prominent symptom.


CONCLUSIONS
Managers should pay attention to the negative emotional problems of front-line nurses, improve their EI level and promote mental health and the progress of epidemic prevention.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
Improving the level of emotional intelligence can reduce the frequency and intensity of negative emotions. In clinical work, emotional intelligence can be used as a skill to carry out relevant training, which is conducive to playing a positive role in future emergencies.","[{'authorId': '122309061', 'name': 'Huili Sun'}, {'authorId': '2117018499', 'name': 'Shuling Wang'}, {'authorId': '2158624832', 'name': 'Wei Wang'}, {'authorId': '2007558118', 'name': 'Guanghong Han'}, {'authorId': '2109103965', 'name': 'Zhijian Liu'}, {'authorId': '2112227228', 'name': 'Qi Wu'}, {'authorId': '48988241', 'name': 'Xiaoli Pang'}]",36.0,,10.0,Correlation between emotional intelligence and negative emotions of front-line nurses during the COVID-19 epidemic: a cross-sectional study.,2020.0

However, neither process fully accounts for intragroup effects involving dynamic calibration of people’s orientations during communal activities. When group members are engaged in shared tasks, they simultaneously attend to the same unfolding events and arrive at mutually entrained movement patterns that facilitate emotional coordination. Entrainment may be further cultivated by interaction rituals involving rhythmic music that sets the pace for collective singing, dancing, or marching. These rituals also provide an emotionally meaningful focus for group activities and sometimes specifically encourage the experience of intense embodied states. Intragroup emotion convergence thus depends on interlocking processes of reciprocated and context-attuned orientational calibration and group-based social appraisal.","[{'authorId': '144603514', 'name': 'B.

Ingroup-outgroup bias extends to involuntary responses, such as empathy for pain. However, empathy biases have not been tested in our close primate relatives. Contagious yawning has been theoretically and empirically linked to empathy. If empathy underlies contagious yawning, we predict that subjects should show an ingroup-outgroup bias by yawning more in response to watching ingroup members yawn than outgroup. Twenty-three chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) from two separate groups watched videos of familiar and unfamiliar individuals yawning or at rest (control). The chimpanzees yawned more when watching the familiar yawns than the familiar control or the unfamiliar yawns, demonstrating an ingroup-outgroup bias in contagious yawning. These results provide further empirical support that contagious yawning is a measure of empathy, which may be useful for evolutionary biology and mental health.","[{'authorId': '40218119', 'name': 'M.

c0c4fdef92cb9a1183a07b44f34219f576fd23c2,"OBJECTIVE
Loneliness is an aversive response to a discrepancy between desired and actual social relationships and correlates with personality. We investigate the relationship of loneliness and personality in twin family and molecular genetic data.


METHOD
Phenotypic correlations between loneliness and the Big Five personality traits were estimated in 29,625 adults, and in a group with genome-wide genotype data (N = 4,222), genetic correlations were obtained. We explored whether genetic correlations may reflect causal relationships by investigating within monozygotic twin pair differences (Npairs  = 2,662), by longitudinal within-subject changes in personality and loneliness (N = 4,260-9,238 longitudinal comparisons), and by longitudinal cross-lagged panel analyses (N = 15,628). Finally, we tested whether genetic correlations were due to cross-trait assortative mating (Nspouse pairs  = 4,436).


RESULTS
The strongest correlations with loneliness were observed for Neuroticism (r = .55) and Extraversion (r = -.33). Only Neuroticism showed a high correlation with loneliness independent of other personality traits (r = .50), so follow-up analyses focused on Neuroticism. The genetic correlation between loneliness and Neuroticism from genotyped variants was .71; a significant reciprocal causal relationship and nonsignificant cross-trait assortative mating imply that this is at least partly due to mediated pleiotropy.


CONCLUSIONS
We show that the relationship between loneliness and personality is largely explained by its relationship with Neuroticism, which is substantially genetic in nature.","[{'authorId': '145634215', 'name': 'A.

Families enrolled in the Australian Rett Syndrome Database (ARSD) and InterRett database participated in this study. Cases with a known MECP2 pathogenic mutation, whose families had completed a questionnaire on registration and had answered questions on pain sensitivity were included (n = 646). Logistic regression was used to analyze relationships between the atypical pain responses and genotype. Descriptions of decreased pain sensitivity were content analyzed. The prevalence estimate of reporting an abnormal pain response was 75.2% and a decreased sensitivity to pain was 65.0% in the population‐based ARSD.

Early stressed males showed a behavioural infantilization that was accompanied by significantly decreased adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase activities and dehydroepiandrosterone levels. Furthermore, early stressed males showed a down‐regulation of androgen receptors in the medial preoptic area and the nucleus arcuatus of the hypothalamus, as well as of oestrogen receptor α in the hippocampus compared to control males.

Therefore, the analysis of crowd aggregation behavior has been a new research focus in the field of intelligent video surveillance. However, such public area scenes not only contain moving crowd but also contain other types of objects. The sizes of these objects are usually small, which make their appearances quite similar. Moreover, the individuals in a crowd move randomly and often occlude each other. All the above factors make the analysis of crowd aggregation very difficult. In this paper, the authors attempt to solve this problem in three aspects. First, a novel global feature is used to represent the moving crowd. This feature can well describe the spatial and the temporal motion information of points-of-interest. Second, a strategy is adopted to cluster the feature points first and then calculate the collectiveness. This makes the collectiveness computation of individual groups more consistent and effective. Finally, more comprehensive collective crowd descriptors are proposed to provide a detailed description of the crowd status. Based on the proposed descriptor, the authors realize the evolution analysis of the group movement and the crowd abnormal detection. The experiment results show that the proposed method is able to efficiently compute the crowd collectiveness in various public areas and provide a reliable reference for the public safety management.","[{'authorId': '2285442', 'name': 'Mingliang Xu'}, {'authorId': '2209785707', 'name': 'Chunxue Li'}, {'authorId': '144470801', 'name': 'Pei Lv'}, {'authorId': '2065999365', 'name': 'Nie Lin'}, {'authorId': '2073313412', 'name': 'Rui Hou'}, {'authorId': '2118868255', 'name': 'Bing Zhou'}]",78.0,,38.0,An Efficient Method of Crowd Aggregation Computation in Public Areas,2018.0
c23c263bedb8662ebc404f4e4a6b8c86a1acdef5,"As a new type of word-of-mouth information, online consumer product review is an emerging market phenomenon that is playing an increasingly important role in consumers' purchase decisions. This paper argues that online consumer review, a type of product information created by users based on personal usage experience, can serve as a new element in the marketing communications mix and work as free “sales assistants” to help consumers identify the products that best match their idiosyncratic usage conditions. 
 
This paper develops a normative model to address several important strategic issues related to consumer reviews. First, we show when and how the seller should adjust its own marketing communication strategy in response to consumer reviews. Our results reveal that if the review information is sufficiently informative, the two types of product information, i.e., the seller-created product attribute information and buyer-created review information, will interact with each other. For example, when the product cost is low and/or there are sufficient expert (more sophisticated) product users, the two types of information are complements, and the seller's best response is to increase the amount of product attribute information conveyed via its marketing communications after the reviews become available. However, when the product cost is high and there are sufficient novice (less sophisticated) product users, the two types of information are substitutes, and the seller's best response is to reduce the amount of product attribute information it offers, even if it is cost-free to provide such information. We also derive precise conditions under which the seller can increase its profit by adopting a proactive strategy, i.e., adjusting its marketing strategies even before consumer reviews become available. Second, we identify product/market conditions under which the seller benefits from facilitating such buyer-created information (e.g., by allowing consumers to post user-based product reviews on the seller's website). Finally, we illustrate the importance of the timing of the introduction of consumer reviews available as a strategic variable and show that delaying the availability of consumer reviews for a given product can be beneficial if the number of expert (more sophisticated) product users is relatively large and cost of the product is low.","[{'authorId': '1739358208', 'name': 'Yubo Chen'}, {'authorId': '2499458', 'name': 'Jinhong Xie'}]",1632.0,,34.0,Online Consumer Review: Word-of-Mouth as a New Element of Marketing Communication Mix,2004.0

Work-related stress is a significant health and safety concern.


OBJECTIVES
To assess the prevalence of burnout and occupational stress among emergency department (ED) professionals and to identify associated factors.


METHODS
A cross-sectional study included all ED professionals of a French university hospital. Data were collected using the French versions of the Maslach Burnout Inventory and the Karasek Job Content Questionnaire.


RESULTS
Of the 166 respondents (75.8%), 19.3% reported burnout and 27.1% job strain. Factors associated with burnout were work-related dissatisfaction, fear of making mistakes, lack of time to perform tasks, and being younger. Those factors associated with job strain were having at least one sick leave in the past year, being affected by hard work, interpersonal conflicts at workplace, and sleep disorders.


CONCLUSIONS
Compared to the literature, our results showed a lower prevalence of burnout among physicians but similar among paramedics. The proportion of professionals with job strain was higher than that of the whole French working population. Organizational factors and the work environment were the primary causes of burnout and job strain, while being younger was the only associated sociodemographic factor. The identification of professionals experiencing difficulty is essential to ensure patient safety, particularly in the high-risk field of emergency medicine.","[{'authorId': '153831685', 'name': 'A.

We examined the motivations people described to listen to music they identified as sad, particularly when experiencing negative circumstances, and the self-reported effects of this activity. We asked adults to respond to an online survey and analyzed their narrative reports using a modified grounded theory approach. Responses were received from 65 adults across five countries. The process that underlies choosing to listen to sad music as well as the self-regulatory strategies and functions of sad music were identified. The music-selection strategies included: connection; selecting music based on memory triggers; high aesthetic value; and message communicated. The functions of these strategies were in the domains of (re-)experiencing affect, cognitive, social, retrieving memories, friend, distraction, and mood enhancement. We additionally modelled the underlying psychological process that guides sad music listening behaviour and the effects of listening.

Following a two-dimensional conceptualization of burnout, it is assumed that burnout is comprised of emotional exhaustion and negative attitudes (i.e., depersonalization and reduced personal accomplishment). We hypothesized that perceived burnout complaints among colleagues and susceptibility to emotional contagion would make an independent contribution to explaining variance in negative attitudes through their influence on emotional exhaustion. The findings of a series of LISREL-analyses support this burnout contagion model. In addition, susceptibility to the emotions expressed by others had a moderating effect on the relationship between perceived burnout complaints among colleagues and individual GPs' emotional exhaustion: Burnout contagion was most pronounced among those GPs who were, in general, highly susceptible to emotional stimuli.

Evidence suggests that features of autism are not restricted to individuals with ASD, and that autistic traits vary throughout the general population. To investigate the association between autistic traits and the responses to others’ pain in typically developing adults, we employed the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) to quantify autistic traits in a group of 1670 healthy adults and explored whether 60 participants (30 males and 30 females) with 10% highest AQ scores (High-AQ) would exhibit difficulties in the responses to others’ pain relative to 60 participants (30 males and 30 females) with 10% lowest AQ scores (Low-AQ). This study included a Visual Task and an Auditory Task to test behavioral differences between High-AQ and Low-AQ groups’ responses to others’ pain in both modalities. For the Visual Task, participants were instructed to respond to pictures depicting others’ pain. They were instructed to judge the stimuli type (painful or not), judge others’ pain intensity, and indicate the unpleasantness they personally felt. For the Auditory Task, experimental procedures were identical to the Visual Task except that painful voices were added. Results showed the High-AQ group was less accurate than the Low-AQ group in judging others’ pain.

The first study was a daily diary study using a sample of Dutch waiters and taxi-drivers and assessed the link of employees' daily self-reported levels of deep acting and automatic regulation with the amount of tips provided by customers (N = 166 measurement occasions nested in 34 persons). Whereas deep acting refers to deliberate attempts to modify felt emotions and involves conscious effort, automatic regulation refers to automated emotion regulatory processes that result in the natural experience of desired emotions and do not involve deliberate control and effort. Multilevel analyses revealed that both types of emotion regulation were positively associated with customer tips. The second study was an experimental field study using a sample of German hairdressers (N = 41). Emotion regulation in terms of both deep acting and automatic regulation was manipulated using a brief self-training intervention and daily instructions to use cognitive change and attentional deployment.

In primates, playful facial expressions and mimicry can be performed to signal and share playful motivation. Here we compare play facial expressions (play face [PF]: lower teeth exposed; full play face [FPF]: upper and lower teeth exposed) and their mimicry in captive chimpanzees and lowland gorillas, during play fighting. These two species have different social dynamics, with social cohesion being lower-and play possibly riskier-in gorillas than in chimpanzees. Thus, we hypothesized that gorillas would perform redundant PFs more often to avoid misunderstanding (Prediction 1). However, the two species are phylogenetically very close and possess a similar biology. Thus, we hypothesized that both species could perform rapid facial mimicry (RFM: response within 1 s) and delayed facial mimicry (DFM: response occurring between 1 s and 5 s), which may have different roles in play modulation (Prediction 2). Gorillas performed more FPF than chimpanzees and FPFs lasted longer than the less intense PF (Prediction 1 supported). RFM was present in both species, whereas DFM was present only in chimpanzees (Prediction 2 not fully supported). DFM may be performed by chimpanzees to modulate the session at a later stage of the interaction and favor interindividual cohesion. RFM prolonged play sessions and may be performed to communicate playful motivation to the playmate thus demonstrating that animals integrate contextual information into their understanding of others' states and intentions.

For this purpose, a grid of particles is placed over the image and it is advected with the space-time average of optical flow. By treating the moving particles as individuals, their interaction forces are estimated using social force model. The interaction force is then mapped into the image plane to obtain Force Flow for every pixel in every frame. Randomly selected spatio-temporal volumes of Force Flow are used to model the normal behavior of the crowd. We classify frames as normal and abnormal by using a bag of words approach. The regions of anomalies in the abnormal frames are localized using interaction forces. The experiments are conducted on a publicly available dataset from University of Minnesota for escape panic scenarios and a challenging dataset of crowd videos taken from the web. The experiments show that the proposed method captures the dynamics of the crowd behavior successfully. In addition, we have shown that the social force approach outperforms similar approaches based on pure optical flow.","[{'authorId': '35422941', 'name': 'Ramin Mehran'}, {'authorId': '2064015218', 'name': 'Alexis Oyama'}, {'authorId': '145103012', 'name': 'M.

Structural equation modeling was used to examine the universality and cultural specificity in the relations among emotional contagion, emotion regulation, and mood state. The results revealed that emotion regulation mediated the relation between emotional contagion and mood state: positive emotional contagion increased positive mood state and decreased negative mood state by the mediated role of reappraisal, negative emotional contagion decreased positive contagion and increased negative mood state by the inconsistent mediated role of reappraisal; negative contagion increased negative mood state by the mediated role of suppression. We found both universality and cultural specificity in the relations among emotional contagion, emotion regulation, and mood state. Regarding cultural specificity, among Dai and Jingpo participants, negative contagion positively predicted reappraisal, while for Han participants, it did not; Jingpo participants demonstrated a weaker negative relation between reappraisal and negative mood state, and a stronger positive relation between negative contagion and suppression; and Dai participants were the only ethnic group that showed a negative connection between negative contagion and positive mood state. Regarding emotion universality, the three ethnic groups all showed positive relations between negative contagion and negative mood, and between suppression and negative mood; additionally, positive contagion positively predicted positive mood state, mediated by reappraisal. Thus, some emotion processes are universal and others more specific. In this paper, we discuss universal emotion processes and ethnic cultural differences in these emotion processes.","[{'authorId': '68974805', 'name': 'Beibei Kuang'}, {'authorId': '117519702', 'name': 'Shenli Peng'}, {'authorId': '3485003', 'name': 'Xiaochun Xie'}, {'authorId': '3275763', 'name': 'Ping Hu'}]",11.0,"{'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology', 'volume': '10'}",69.0,"Universality vs. Cultural Specificity in the Relations Among Emotional Contagion, Emotion Regulation, and Mood State: An Emotion Process Perspective",2019.0

This is not only manifested in individual physiology (heart rate, glucocorticoids), but also in how individuals behave directly after a conflict. Certain ‘stress-related behaviors’ such as autopreening, body shaking, scratching and vigilance have been suggested to indicate an individual's emotional state. Such behaviors may also alleviate stress, but the behavioral context and physiological basis of those behaviors is still poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings We recorded beat-to-beat heart rates (HR) of 22 greylag geese in response to agonistic encounters using fully implanted sensor-transmitter packages. Additionally, for 143 major events we analyzed the behavior shown by our focal animals in the first two minutes after an interaction. Our results show that the HR during encounters and characteristics of the interaction predicted the frequency and duration of behaviors shown after a conflict. Conclusions/Significance To our knowledge this is the first study to quantify the physiological and behavioral responses to single agonistic encounters and to link this to post conflict behavior. Our results demonstrate that ‘stress-related behaviors’ are flexibly modulated by the characteristics of the preceding aggressive interaction and reflect the individual's emotional strain, which is linked to autonomic arousal. We found no support for the stress-alleviating hypothesis, but we propose that stress-related behaviors may play a role in communication with other group members, particularly with pair-partners.","[{'authorId': '5486107', 'name': 'C.

However, in recent years, the need to go beyond traditional ToM accounts for understanding real life social interactions has become all the more pressing. At the same time it remains unclear whether alternative accounts, such as interactionism, can yield a sufficient description and explanation of social interactions. We argue that instead of considering ToM and interactionism as mutually exclusive opponents, they should be integrated into a more comprehensive account of social cognition. We draw on dual process models of social cognition that contrast two different types of social cognitive processing. The first type (labeled Type 1) refers to processes that are fast, efficient, stimulus-driven, and relatively inflexible. The second type (labeled Type 2) refers to processes that are relatively slow, cognitively laborious, flexible, and may involve conscious control. We argue that while interactionism captures aspects of social cognition mostly related to Type 1 processes, ToM is more focused on those based on Type 2 processes. We suggest that real life social interactions are rarely based on either Type 1 or Type 2 processes alone. On the contrary, we propose that in most cases both types of processes are simultaneously involved and that social behavior may be sustained by the interplay between these two types of processes. Finally, we discuss how the new integrative framework can guide experimental research on social interaction.","[{'authorId': '8261771', 'name': 'Vivian Bohl'}, {'authorId': '7335494', 'name': 'W. van den Bos'}]",141.0,,130.0,Toward an integrative account of social cognition: marrying theory of mind and interactionism to study the interplay of Type 1 and Type 2 processes,2012.0

Assessing and characterizing the temporal dynamics of synchrony during an interaction is essential for fully understanding the human communication mechanisms. In this work, we focus on uncovering the temporal variability patterns of synchrony in visual gesture and vocal behavior in affectively rich interactions. We propose a statistical scheme to robustly quantify the turnwise interpersonal synchrony. The analysis of the synchrony dynamics measure relies heavily on functional data analysis techniques. Our analysis results reveal that: 1) the dynamical patterns of interpersonal synchrony differ depending on the global emotions of an interaction dyad; 2) there generally exists a tight dynamical emotion-synchrony coupling over the interaction. These observations corroborate that interpersonal behavioral synchrony is a critical manifestation of the underlying affective processes, shedding light toward improved affective interaction modeling and automatic emotion recognition.","[{'authorId': '3161887', 'name': 'Zhaojun Yang'}, {'authorId': '145254843', 'name': 'Shrikanth S.

The infamous Milgram (1963) and Zimbardo (1973) experiments concerning the social psychology of obedience and aggression seemed in some ways obvious analogs to the Facebook experiment, at least inasmuch as all three violated norms about the treatment of human subjects in research. But besides that, what do they really have in common? In fact, a close reading of Milgram, Zimbardo, and the Facebook experiment reveals something about the way power—both as a subject of scholarly inquiry and as an element wielded by researchers—is conceptualized today. Although all three experiments were, in essence, measuring the researchers’ ability to induce an emotional or behavioral change in subjects, the Facebook experiment did much more than the others to hide such considerations and naturalize the exercise of power at work in that study. This paper thus argues that the invisibility of power in the discourse of the Facebook experiment demonstrates, in miniature, the more insidious elements of big data as a whole.","[{'authorId': '2601899', 'name': 'Timothy Recuber'}]",11.0,,29.0,"From obedience to contagion: Discourses of power in Milgram, Zimbardo, and the Facebook experiment",2016.0

This assumption influences legal judgments, policy decisions, national security protocols, and educational practices; guides the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric illness, as well as the development of commercial applications; and pervades everyday social interactions as well as research in other scientific fields such as artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and computer vision. In this article, we survey examples of this widespread assumption, which we refer to as the common view, and we then examine the scientific evidence that tests this view, focusing on the six most popular emotion categories used by consumers of emotion research: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. The available scientific evidence suggests that people do sometimes smile when happy, frown when sad, scowl when angry, and so on, as proposed by the common view, more than what would be expected by chance. Yet how people communicate anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise varies substantially across cultures, situations, and even across people within a single situation. Furthermore, similar configurations of facial movements variably express instances of more than one emotion category. In fact, a given configuration of facial movements, such as a scowl, often communicates something other than an emotional state. Scientists agree that facial movements convey a range of information and are important for social communication, emotional or otherwise. But our review suggests an urgent need for research that examines how people actually move their faces to express emotions and other social information in the variety of contexts that make up everyday life, as well as careful study of the mechanisms by which people perceive instances of emotion in one another. We make specific research recommendations that will yield a more valid picture of how people move their faces to express emotions and how they infer emotional meaning from facial movements in situations of everyday life.

Even though many children tracking systems have been proposed, the high cost and energy limitation of locators are the stumbling blocks which limit the application of those systems. To address this challenge, we design a children tracking system based on RFID technology, where children carry RFID tags and the system is responsible for locating the children by aggregating the readings from the deployed readers. Noting the importance of localized processing for efficient children tracking, we further study how the locally available computing resource, such as the mobile devices carried by the park employees and visitors, can be utilized for service provisioning.

This paper presents our work on designing behavior model for virtual humans in a crowd simulation under normal‐life and emergency situations. Our model adopts an agent‐based approach and employs a layered framework to reflect the natural pattern of human‐like decision making process, which generally involves a person's awareness of the situation and consequent changes on the internal attributes. The social group and crowd‐related behaviors are modeled according to the findings and theories observed from social psychology (e.g., social attachment theory). By integrating our model into an agent execution process, each individual agent can response differently to the perceived environment and make realistic behavioral decisions based on various physiological, emotional, and social group attributes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, a case study has been conducted, which shows that realistic human behaviors can be generated at both individual and group level.

Emotions have a direct influence on human decision-making processes. Non-deterministic behavior in humans can be partially explained by emotions. In this sense, an artificial emotion can be implemented as a synthetic abstraction derived from the observation of human emotions. This paper presents studies related to emotional stability and emotional regulation. However, to the best of our knowledge, it is not possible to identify studies that define a relationship between the regulation of artificial emotions and the decision effectiveness of autonomous decision-making systems, specifically for the stock market domain. With the aim to improve investment results in the stock market domain, a mechanism based on artificial emotions is presented that was designed as a single layer of decision criteria defined by both rational and emotional perspectives. Along with the proposal of an emotional stabilizer mechanism, different values of emotional bandwidths and emotional update rates were tested, aiming to explore the degree of influence of these parameters on the effectiveness of investment decisions made by artificial investors. Our proposal considers the definition of an experimental scenario based on official data from the New York Stock Exchange. The results are promising and include a linear regression analysis. The test results suggest that the use of autonomous affective decision-making systems with emotional stabilization can improve the effectiveness of the decision made.","[{'authorId': '143746932', 'name': 'D.

We have previously developed an observational fear learning (OFL) behavioral assay to measure empathic fear in mice. In the OFL task, a mouse is conditioned for context‐dependent fear when it observes a conspecific demonstrator receiving aversive stimuli. In the present study, by comparing 11 different inbred mouse strains that are commonly used in the laboratory, we found that empathic fear response was highly variable between different strains. Five strains – C57BL/6J, C57BL/6NTac, 129S1/SvImJ, 129S4/SvJae and BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J – showed observational fear (OF) responses, whereas AKR/J, BALB/cByJ, C3H/HeJ, DBA/2J, FVB/NJ and NOD/ShiLtJ mice exhibited low empathic fear response. Importantly, day 2 OF memory was significantly correlated with contextual memory in the classical fear conditioning among the 11 strains. Innate differences in anxiety, locomotor activity, sociability and preference for social novelty were not significantly correlated with OFL. Interestingly, early adolescent C57BL/6J mice exhibited an increase in acquisition of OF. The level of OFL in C57BL/6J strain was not affected by sex or strains of the demonstrator. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that there are naturally occurring OFL‐specific genetic variations modulating empathic fear behaviors in mice. The identification of causal genes may uncover novel genetic pathways and underlying neural mechanisms that modulate empathic fear and, ultimately, provide new targets for therapeutic intervention in human mental disorders associated with impaired empathy.","[{'authorId': '112991589', 'name': 'S.

c55e7fbc18c4816cc4e73e7877a0ca20a0577922,"Abstract Background The initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP. Methods We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions. In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number. Results Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male. The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9). Conclusions On the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere. Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.

We show that these social defects are not only pronounced in the animals directly subjected to stress, but are also transmitted to their offspring across two generations. The defects are associated with impaired serotonergic signaling, in particular, reduced 5HT1A receptor expression in the dorsal raphe nucleus, and increased serotonin level in a dorsal raphe projection area.

A secondary aim was to introduce a new, improved set of stimuli for the study of music-mediated emotions. A large pilot study established a set of 110 film music excerpts, half were moderately and highly representative examples of five discrete emotions (anger, fear, sadness, happiness and tenderness), and the other half moderate and high examples of the six extremes of three bipolar dimensions (valence, energy arousal and tension arousal). These excerpts were rated in a listening experiment by 116 non-musicians. All target emotions of highly representative examples in both conceptual sets were discriminated by self-ratings. Linear mapping techniques between the discrete and dimensional models revealed a high correspondence along two central dimensions that can be labelled as valence and arousal, and the three dimensions could be reduced to two without significantly reducing the goodness of fit. The major difference between the discrete and categorical models concerned the poorer resolution of the discrete model in characterizing emotionally ambiguous examples. The study offers systematically structured and rich stimulus material for exploring emotional processing.","[{'authorId': '2804198', 'name': 'T. Eerola'}, {'authorId': '6178537', 'name': 'J.

In this contribution, we discuss various self-organization phenomena in animal swarms and human crowds from the point of view of information exchange among individuals. In particular, we provide a general description of collective dynamics across species and introduce a classification of these dynamics not only with respect to the way information is transferred among individuals but also with regard to the knowledge processing at the collective level.

In comparison, students who describe more of a surface approach to learning are more likely to report an experience of lower positive emotions and higher negative emotions. Both the experience of more positive emotions and the adoption of a deeper approach are associated with higher achievement scores.

In a juxtaposition of different industries it aims at: investigating whether both communication instruments have an impact on consumer-based brand equity; comparing the effect sizes of these two communication instruments; and separating the effects of firm-created and user-generated social media communication. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 393 data sets from three different industries, namely tourism, telecommunications, and pharmaceuticals, were generated using a standardized online-survey. Structural equation modeling was used in the analysis of the data obtained to investigate the interplay of social media and traditional media in general, as well as in an examination of industry-specific differences. Findings - The results of the empirical study show that both traditional communications and social media communications have a significant impact on brand equity. While traditional media has a stronger impact on brand awareness, social media communications strongly influence brand image. Firm-created social media communication is shown to have an important impact on functional brand image, while user-generated social media communication exerts a major influence on hedonic brand image. Furthermore, the present study highlights significant differences between the industries under investigation. Originality/value - The research described in this paper is pioneering in that it juxtaposes the impacts of social media and traditional media on brand equity – a topic of increasing interest to firms in the era of Facebook and Twitter but so far largely uninvestigated. Moreover, the differentiation between firm-created and user-generated social media communication, which is gaining increasingly in importance, as companies see their brand marketing power devolve to the consumer through social media platforms, offers valuable insights to marketing practitioners and academics.","[{'authorId': '72494962', 'name': 'M.

c5f45b15f82b1ea2d43e3c7efaa18220cd7e10ed,"Simple Summary Recently, an increasing number of studies have investigated the expression and perception of emotions by non-human animals. In particular, it is of interest to determine whether animals can link emotion stimuli of different modalities (e.g., visual and oral) based on the emotions that are expressed (i.e., to recognize emotions cross-modally). For domestic species that share a close relationship with humans, we might even wonder whether this ability extends to human emotions. Here, we investigated whether domestic horses recognize human emotions cross-modally. We simultaneously presented two animated pictures of human facial expressions, one typical of joy and the other of anger; simultaneously, a speaker played a human non-verbal vocalization expressing joy or anger. Horses looked at the picture that did not match the emotion of the vocalization more (probably because they were intrigued by the paradoxical combination). Moreover, their behavior and heart rate differed depending on the vocalization: they reacted more negatively to the anger vocalization and more positively to the joy vocalization. These results suggest that horses can match visual and vocal cues for the same emotion and can perceive the emotional valence of human non-verbal vocalizations. Abstract Over the last few years, an increasing number of studies have aimed to gain more insight into the field of animal emotions. In particular, it is of interest to determine whether animals can cross-modally categorize the emotions of others. For domestic animals that share a close relationship with humans, we might wonder whether this cross-modal recognition of emotions extends to humans, as well. In this study, we tested whether horses could recognize human emotions and attribute the emotional valence of visual (facial expression) and vocal (non-verbal vocalization) stimuli to the same perceptual category. Two animated pictures of different facial expressions (anger and joy) were simultaneously presented to the horses, while a speaker played an emotional human non-verbal vocalization matching one of the two facial expressions. Horses looked at the picture that was incongruent with the vocalization more, probably because they were intrigued by the paradoxical combination. Moreover, horses reacted in accordance with the valence of the vocalization, both behaviorally and physiologically (heart rate). These results show that horses can cross-modally recognize human emotions and react emotionally to the emotional states of humans, assessed by non-verbal vocalizations.","[{'authorId': '51922686', 'name': 'Miléna Trösch'}, {'authorId': '1388884247', 'name': 'Florent Cuzol'}, {'authorId': '51070623', 'name': 'C.

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to use conservation of resources (COR) theory as a lens for comparing the impact of line management on Bangladeshi public and private nurses’ perception of work harassment, well-being and turnover intentions where Anglo-American and European management models have been super-imposed on an existing different culture.


Design/methodology/approach
Survey data were collected from 317 Bangladeshi nurses’ (131 from the public sector and 186 from the private sector). Structural equation modelling was used for analysis.


Findings
High work harassment was associated with low-being, and together with management practices, it explained approximately a quarter of private sector nurses’ well-being. In total, management, work harassment and employee well-being explained approximately a third of the turnover intentions of public sector nurses, whereas only work harassment explained approximately a third of private sector nurses’ turnover intentions. The findings suggest a differential impact of management on work harassment across the public and private sector.


Research limitations/implications
Cross-sectional data are susceptible to common method bias. A common latent factor was included, and several items that were explained by common method variance were controlled. Further, the findings are limited by the sample size from one sector and the use of only one developing country.


Practical implications
It is a waste of resources to transplant Anglo-American and European management models to developing countries without understanding the impact on nurses’ outcomes.


Originality/value
Anglo-American and European management models are not easily transferable to the Bangladesh context probably because of the impact of ties and corruption. Line management is a positive resource that builds employee well-being for public sector employees only.

c63e4c60f7597f9561469d9209c12e87fb9bce24,"Acute pain has an evolutionary role for the detection of and response to physical harm. In some cases, however, acute pain can impair function and lead to other morbidities. Chronic pain, meanwhile, can present as a psychopathological condition that significantly interferes with daily living. Most basic and translational pain research has focused on the molecular and cellular mechanisms in the spinal and peripheral nervous systems. In contrast, the brain plays a key role in the affective manifestation and cognitive control of pain. In particular, several cortical regions, such as the somatosensory cortex, prefrontal cortex, insular, and anterior cingulate cortex, are well-known to be activated by acute pain signals, and neurons in these regions have been demonstrated to undergo changes in response to chronic pain. Furthermore, these cortical regions can project to a number of forebrain and limbic structures to exert powerful top-down control of not only sensory pain transmission but also affective pain expression, and such cortical regulatory mechanisms are particularly relevant in chronic pain states. Newer techniques have emerged that allow detailed studies of central pain circuits in animal models, as well as how such circuits are modified by the presence of chronic pain and other predisposing psychosomatic factors. These mechanistic approaches can complement imaging in human studies. At the therapeutic level, a number of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have recently been shown to engage these top-down control systems to provide analgesia. In this review, we will discuss how pain signals reach important cortical regions, and how these regions in turn project to sub-cortical areas of the brain to exert profound modulation of the pain experience. In addition, we will discuss the clinical relevance of such top-down pain regulation mechanisms.","[{'authorId': '6213409', 'name': 'Louise Urien'}, {'authorId': '2152441884', 'name': 'Jing Wang'}]",19.0,,160.0,Top-down cortical control of acute and chronic pain.,2019.0

Selection studies offering 2 options (up or down) showed a strong preference (and no evidence of publication bias) for upward choices when there was no threat; there was no evidence for downward comparison as a dominant choice even when threatened. Selections became less differentiable when a lateral choice was also provided. For reaction studies, contrast was, by far, the dominant response to social comparison, with ability estimates most strongly affected. Moderator analyses, tests and adjustments for publication bias showed that contrast is stronger when the comparison involves varying participants’ standing for ability (effect estimates, −0.75 to −0.65) and affect (−0.83 to −0.65). Novel personal attributes were subject to strong contrast for ability (−0.5 to −0.6) and affect (−0.6 to −0.7). Dissimilarity priming was associated with contrast (−0.44 to −0.27; no publication bias), consistent with Mussweiler (2003). Similarity priming provided modest support for Collins (1996) and Mussweiler (2003), with very weak assimilation effects, depending on the publication bias estimator. Studies including control groups indicated effects in response to upward and downward targets were comparable in size and contrastive. Limitations of the literature (e.g., small number of studies including no-comparison control conditions), unresolved issues, and why people choose to compare upward when the most likely result is self-deflating contrast are discussed.","[{'authorId': '2067217', 'name': 'J.

The findings indicated that some Facebook activities, such as chatting, were linked to aspects of empathic concern, such as higher levels of Perspective Taking in males. The Photo feature in Facebook was also linked to better ability to place themselves in fictional situations. For only the females, viewing videos was associated with the extent to which they could identify with someone’s distress.

This conceptual paper explores the idea of interpretive conversations that is largely unexplored and untapped particularly at nature-based tourism sites. The potential benefits for initiating, encouraging and engaging in interpretive conversations between tourists and staff are discussed. Interpretive conversations have the potential to result in individualised learning experiences, and enhanced connections between tourists, staff and the site, as well as between tourists and the relevant organisations. Examples are drawn from a range of natural and cultural heritage tourism organisations that encourage and support interpretive conversations between tourists and staff and the results of their efforts. Three key strategies to implement interpretive conversations are presented and how they need to be supported by organisational culture and management.","[{'authorId': '40561271', 'name': 'R.

This two-part study investigated covert laryngeal activations among singers during the perception and imagination of music and text. In the first part, 155 singers responded to an online survey investigating their self-perceived corporal activation when listening to live or recorded singing. Respondents reported frequent corporal activation in their larynx and other body parts in response to live singing and, to a lesser extent, recordings. In the second part, an exploratory experiment was conducted to investigate physiological correlates of subvocalization in singers during the perception and imagery of melody and text stimuli, using simultaneous measurements of laryngeal activation both externally, with surface electromyography, and internally, with nasolaryngoscopy. Experimental results indicate the occurrence of subvocalization during imagination—but not during listening—of both stimuli and suggest that laryngoscopy is more sensitive to detection of subvocalization in singers. The results may point to vocal resonance or empathy in the perception of singers.","[{'authorId': '2050390075', 'name': 'Camila Bruder'}, {'authorId': '6407183', 'name': 'Clemens Wöllner'}]",7.0,,42.0,Subvocalization in singers: Laryngoscopy and surface EMG effects when imagining and listening to song and text,2019.0
c717eb4e913c3249eac18d0fba13a1aa02d60dad,"The development of a multidimensional individual difference measure of empathy is described. The final version of the instrument consists of four seven-item subscales, each of which taps a separate aspect of the global concept ""empathy."" One scale, the perspective-taking scale, contains items which assess spontaneous attempts to adopt the perspectives of other people and see things from their point of view. Items on the fantasy scale measure the tendency to identify with characters in movies, novels, plays and other fictional situations. The other two subscales explicitly tap respondents' chronic emotional reactions to the negative experiences of others. The empathic concern scale inquires about respondents' feelings of warmth, compassion, and concern for others, while the personal distress scale measures the personal feelings of anxiety and discomfort that result from observing another's negative experience. The factor structure underlying these scales is the same for both sexes, and emerged in two independent samples. Test-retest and internal reliabilities of all four scales were substantial. The pattern of sex differences and the intercorrelations of these four scales are discussed in terms of recent theoretical treatments of the development of empathy (Hoffman, 1976). It is concluded that the new measure has considerable potential for investigations of the multidimensional nature of empathy.","[{'authorId': '47994338', 'name': 'Mark H.

Face‐to‐face household surveys were carried out in four areas (two urban cities and two rural municipalities), and a total of 1663 persons participated (overall response rate: 56.4%). For data collection, the structured psychiatric interview, World Mental Health version of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH‐CIDI) was used, allowing DSM‐IV diagnoses, severity, and service utilization. It was found that 7.3% of total respondents had received any service, either professional or non‐professional, in the past 12 months, including 20.0% of those with 12‐month DSM‐IV disorders and 6.2% of those without. Thirty‐three percent of those with any mood disorder used any service, and 26.8% of those used some type of health care. The probability of people with 13–15 years of education receiving mental health treatment was fourfold higher than those with ≥16 years of education. Gender, age, or income were not found to contribute to utilization of mental health services. The results confirm that the majority of people with a recent psychiatric disorder have not used mental health care or other support systems. The mental health care system in Japan has improved over the past decade, but not enough for people suffering from mental disturbances.","[{'authorId': '2229328', 'name': 'Yoichi Naganuma'}, {'authorId': '5976339', 'name': 'H.

Maternal deprivation (MD) during this period can disrupt the quiescence of the HPA-axis. The present study examined the influence of strain (outbred CD1 vs. inbred C57BL/6J mice) on some central and peripheral components of the HPA-axis in neonatal mice (5-day-old) in the presence of their mother or after 24 h MD (on postnatal day 4) under basal or mild stressful conditions. In the presence of the dam, adrenal corticosterone (CORT) secretion was low in both mouse strains. Compared to CD1 mice, C57BL/6J had lower CORT levels associated with higher ACTH levels and ACTH/CORT ratio (i.e., lower adrenal sensitivity to ACTH), and higher glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA expression in the paraventricular nucleus. Although MD disinhibited the HPA-axis in both strains as reflected by increased basal CORT and ACTH, we found a strain-dependent pattern. MD increased CORT more in C57BL/6J compared to CD1 mice together with a lower ACTH/CORT ratio (i.e., higher adrenal sensitivity to ACTH), while GR mRNA was no longer different in the two strains. However, this increased adrenal sensitivity in maternally deprived C57BL/6J mice was not reflected in their CORT response to a subsequent novelty stressor, possibly due to an MD-induced ceiling effect in their steroidogenic capacity. In conclusion, the immediate outcome of MD depends on the genetic background of the mother–infant dyad, suggesting that maybe also the outcome in later-life cannot be generalized.","[{'authorId': '5134757', 'name': 'N.

An obstacle to ER research during these periods is the paucity of valid age-appropriate measures. This study reports on the psychometric evaluation of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents (ERQ-CA), a revision of the adult measure. The ERQ-CA was evaluated with a sample of 827 participants aged between 10 and 18 years. Results indicate sound internal consistency as well as stability over a 12-month period. Sound construct and convergent validity are also demonstrated. It is concluded that the ERQ-CA is a valid age-appropriate measure for investigating the use of 2 specific strategies of ER during the childhood and adolescence developmental periods.","[{'authorId': '6482031', 'name': 'E.

To complement the currently cold behavioral assays and allow further studies of these mechanisms, we have developed a new technique to measure the cold response threshold, the cold plantar assay. In this assay, animals are acclimated on a glass plate and a cold stimulus is applied to the hindpaw through the glass using a pellet of compressed dry ice. The latency to withdrawal from the cooled glass is used as a measure of the cold response threshold of the rodents, and the dry ice pellet provides a ramping cold stimulus on the glass that allows the correlation of withdrawal latency values to rough estimates of the cold response threshold temperature. The assay is highly sensitive to manipulations including morphine-induced analgesia, Complete Freund's Adjuvant-induced inflammatory allodynia, and Spinal Nerve Ligation-induced neuropathic allodynia.","[{'authorId': '14715359', 'name': 'D.

c9c30972a4fd4236ac81ceded5e5d93196d0c1b6,"Purpose – Open source software (OSS) products have rapidly acquired a notable importance in the last years among consumers and firms all over the world. They are mostly developed and distributed through online social networks thanks to the voluntary and collaborative actions of their members. However, their innovation and development has to face up the existence of free-riders which can benefit from the knowledge developed in the online social network. This paper aims to understand the factors that moderate the opportunistic behaviour in OSS development and distribution, which will help to correctly manage the OSS innovations. Design/methodology/approach – The influence of reputation on members’ satisfaction and participation intentions in OSS online social networks are measured. Additionally, the impact of being an active and satisfied member on his/her commitment and intention to use the OSS products are studied. After the validation of measurement scales the hypotheses are contrasted with structural modelling. Findings – This research show that perceived reputation acts as a deterrent factor of free-riders. More specifically, reputation exerts a positive and significant effect on member’s satisfaction with previous interactions and an indirect effect on participation intentions in the social network through satisfaction. Besides, these two outcomes of reputation boost the members’ affective commitment to the OSS and, as a consequence, the intention to use OSS products is also increased. Practical implications – Reputation and satisfaction are two crucial aspects in explaining the success of an online social network since they serve to guarantee the interaction among its members. In addition, participation continuance intentions in an online network may help to increase the levels of affective commitment and loyalty to the mutual interest of the network (the OSS in this case). This result may be especially relevant for commercial networks, which are based on the admiration to a brand, firm or product. Originality/value – The analysis of online social networks as a development and distribution channel and the role of reputation in promoting members’ participation (that is, avoiding opportunistic behaviour) represent a new contribution to the analysis of online social networks. This research field has acquired a notable popularity in recent years.","[{'authorId': '3277583', 'name': 'L. V.

Emotion-related textual indicators, including emoticon use, were extracted form users’ Facebook posts via automated text analysis. Correlation analyses revealed that individuals with higher levels of depression, anxiety expressed negative emotions on Facebook more frequently. In addition, use of emoticons expressing positive emotions correlated negatively with stress level. When comparing age groups, younger users reported higher frequency of both emotion-related words and emoticon use in their posts.

These measures are shown to possess desirable properties. The asymptotic distributions of the measures for samples from a multivariate normal population are derived and a test of multivariate normality is proposed. The effect of nonnormality on the size of the one-sample Hotelling's T2 test is studied empirically with the help of these measures, and it is found that Hotelling's T2 test is more sensitive to the measure of skewness than to the measure of kurtosis. measures have proved useful (i) in selecting a member of a family such as from the Karl Pearson family, (ii) in developing a test of normality, and (iii) in investigating the robustness of the standard normal theory procedures. The role of the tests of normality in modern statistics has recently been summarized by Shapiro & Wilk (1965). With these applications in mind for the multivariate situations, we propose measures of multivariate skewness and kurtosis. These measures of skewness and kurtosis are developed naturally by extending certain aspects of some robustness studies for the t statistic which involve I1 and 32. It should be noted that measures of multivariate dispersion have been available for quite some time (Wilks, 1932, 1960; Hotelling, 1951). We deal with the measure of skewness in ? 2 and with the measure of kurtosis in ? 3. In ? 4 we give two important applications of these measures, namely, a test of multivariate normality and a study of the effect of nonnormality on the size of the one-sample Hotelling's T2 test. Both of these problems have attracted attention recently. The first problem has been treated by Wagle (1968) and Day (1969) and the second by Arnold (1964), but our approach differs from theirs.","[{'authorId': '3209910', 'name': 'K.

The present research investigated the mechanisms underlying accessibility effects of self-generated information on implicit measures.

However, it is not clear whether these two systems are part of a single interacting empathy system or whether they are independent. Additionally, the neuroanatomical bases of these systems are largely unknown. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that emotional empathic abilities (involving the mirror neuron system) are distinct from those related to cognitive empathy and that the two depend on separate anatomical substrates. Subjects with lesions in the ventromedial prefrontal (VM) or inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) cortices and two control groups were assessed with measures of empathy that incorporate both cognitive and affective dimensions. The findings reveal a remarkable behavioural and anatomic double dissociation between deficits in cognitive empathy (VM) and emotional empathy (IFG). Furthermore, precise anatomical mapping of lesions revealed Brodmann area 44 to be critical for emotional empathy while areas 11 and 10 were found necessary for cognitive empathy. These findings are consistent with these cortices being different in terms of synaptic hierarchy and phylogenetic age.

Reduced emotional and neuroendocrine stress responses have been described in lactation, a time of high blood PRL levels. Here we tested brain PRL‐receptor (PRL‐R)‐mediated effects on anxiety, maternal behaviour, HPA axis and oxytocin stress responses in lactating rats. Chronic intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of antisense oligonucleotides against the long form of the PRL‐R (AS; osmotic minipump, 0.5 µg/0.5 µL/h) in order to downregulate brain PRL‐R expression increased the anxiety‐related behaviour on the elevated plus maze (P < 0.01) compared with mixed bases‐ and vehicle‐treated rats. Also, PRL‐R AS treatment impaired maternal behaviour (P < 0.05), whereas physiological parameters of lactation (weight gain of the litter, number of milk ejection reflexes during a 20‐min suckling period) were not affected. PRL‐R AS treatment further evoked an increase (P < 0.05) in the stress‐induced adrenocorticotropin release, demonstrating an inhibitory role of PRL on HPA axis responses in lactation. Inhibition of stress responses of the oxytocin system by brain PRL was evidenced by higher stress‐induced (P < 0.05) plasma oxytocin concentration in PRL‐R AS‐treated lactating rats and, in contrast, decreased stress‐induced oxytocin release (P < 0.01) in chronic i.c.v. ovine PRL‐treated (1 µg/0.5 µL/h) virgin rats. Finally, an increased expression of the hypothalamic PRL gene was seen by RT‐PCR in pregnancy and lactation, suggesting an activated state of the brain PRL system during the peripartum period. In summary, activation of the brain PRL system in the peripartum period significantly contributes to emotional and neuroendocrine adaptations, including downregulation of the responsiveness of the HPA axis and oxytocin systems to stressors seen at this time.","[{'authorId': '114124664', 'name': 'L.

He focuses on the act of communication - between adults, between parents and children, among non-human animals, even among cells and genes - to create an original model of human development. Fogel weaves together theory and empirical findings from a variety of disciplines - linguistics, biology, literature, cognitive and neural science, ethology, anthropology, and psychology - to demonstrate the continuous process model of communication. He contends that the human mind and sense of self must be seen as developing out of the processes of communication and relationship-formation between the subject and other individuals. Rarely has a work of scholarship so elegantly and so persuasively presented a complex psychological theory and its practical application. Developing through Relationships not only makes a substantial contribution to developmental psychology but also to the fields of communication, cognitive science, linguistics, and biology.","[{'authorId': '143809739', 'name': 'A.

However, the mechanisms underlying how visual mental images unfold during music listening have remained largely neglected. Here, we review the existing literature on the relation between music-evoked emotions and images, and we draw attention to how visual mental imagery has been previously conceptualized in the music domain. We also propose to adopt a conceptual framework from research on spontaneous cognition, which will promote a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the different types of music-evoked visual mental imagery. Finally, we highlight how music’s capability to trigger images can be harnessed in daily life as well as in therapeutic practices to foster the benefits and minimize the costs of visual mental imagery.","[{'authorId': '5438002', 'name': 'Liila Taruffi'}, {'authorId': '2066743', 'name': 'M.

It could also provide general sentiment models that are applicable to any ad hoc topics. With a specifically designed HMM structure, the sentiment models and topic models estimated with TSM can be utilized to extract topic life cycles and sentiment dynamics. Empirical experiments on different Weblog datasets show that this approach is effective for modeling the topic facets and sentiments and extracting their dynamics from Weblog collections. The TSM model is quite general; it can be applied to any text collections with a mixture of topics and sentiments, thus has many potential applications, such as search result summarization, opinion tracking, and user behavior prediction.","[{'authorId': '1743469', 'name': 'Q.

However, the applicability of this method to consumer marketing research remains uncertain, partly because of the expense required. In this article, the authors demonstrate that neural measurements made with a relatively low-cost and widely available measurement method—electroencephalography (EEG)—can predict future choices of consumer products. In the experiment, participants viewed individual consumer products in isolation, without making any actual choices, while their neural activity was measured with EEG. At the end of the experiment, participants were offered choices between pairs of the same products. The authors find that neural activity measured from a midfrontal electrode displays an increase in the N200 component and a weaker theta band power that correlates with a more preferred product. Using recent techniques for relating neural measurements to choice prediction, they demonstrate that these measures predict subsequent choices. Moreover, the accuracy of prediction depends on both the ordinal and cardinal distance of the EEG data; the larger the difference in EEG activity between two products, the better the predictive accuracy.","[{'authorId': '3202488', 'name': 'Ariel Telpaz'}, {'authorId': '145598074', 'name': 'Ryan Webb'}, {'authorId': '46459569', 'name': 'Dino J.

To understand how travel and quarantine influence the dynamics of the spread of this novel human virus, Chinazzi et al. applied a global metapopulation disease transmission model to epidemiological data from China. They concluded that the travel quarantine introduced in Wuhan on 23 January 2020 only delayed epidemic progression by 3 to 5 days within China, but international travel restrictions did help to slow spread elsewhere in the world until mid-February. Their results suggest that early detection, hand washing, self-isolation, and household quarantine will likely be more effective than travel restrictions at mitigating this pandemic. Science, this issue p. 395 A SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological model reveals the effects of travel restrictions and transmission reduction efforts on the spread of this novel virus. Motivated by the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China, we use a global metapopulation disease transmission model to project the impact of travel limitations on the national and international spread of the epidemic. The model is calibrated on the basis of internationally reported cases and shows that, at the start of the travel ban from Wuhan on 23 January 2020, most Chinese cities had already received many infected travelers. The travel quarantine of Wuhan delayed the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days in mainland China but had a more marked effect on the international scale, where case importations were reduced by nearly 80% until mid-February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.","[{'authorId': '1851304', 'name': 'Matteo Chinazzi'}, {'authorId': '1557302037', 'name': 'Jessica T.

Using measured brain-activity patterns to evaluate computational network models is complicated by the need to define the correspondency between the units of the model and the channels of the brain-activity data, e.g., single-cell recordings or voxels from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Similar correspondency problems complicate relating activity patterns between different modalities of brain-activity measurement (e.g., fMRI and invasive or scalp electrophysiology), and between subjects and species. In order to bridge these divides, we suggest abstracting from the activity patterns themselves and computing representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs), which characterize the information carried by a given representation in a brain or model. Building on a rich psychological and mathematical literature on similarity analysis, we propose a new experimental and data-analytical framework called representational similarity analysis (RSA), in which multi-channel measures of neural activity are quantitatively related to each other and to computational theory and behavior by comparing RDMs. We demonstrate RSA by relating representations of visual objects as measured with fMRI in early visual cortex and the fusiform face area to computational models spanning a wide range of complexities. The RDMs are simultaneously related via second-level application of multidimensional scaling and tested using randomization and bootstrap techniques. We discuss the broad potential of RSA, including novel approaches to experimental design, and argue that these ideas, which have deep roots in psychology and neuroscience, will allow the integrated quantitative analysis of data from all three branches, thus contributing to a more unified systems neuroscience.","[{'authorId': '3351205', 'name': 'N.

Ambivalence is seen as an important mediator in the link between emotional styles and psychological and physical well-being. Using the ""personal striving"" framework, a questionnaire measure of ambivalent emotional strivings (AEQ) was designed. In Study 1, 292 Ss completed this measure along with questionnaire measures of expressiveness, social desirability, and intense ambivalence. Women scored significantly higher than men on both the AEQ and expressiveness. In Study 2, scores on the AEQ were found to be negatively correlated with self-reported and peer-rated expressiveness. In Study 3, 48 Ss participated in a 21-day study of mood and health. Expressiveness was positively correlated with some measures of well-being and with daily negative affect. Ambivalence was positively correlated with several indices of psychological distress. Although the AEQ correlated with questionnaire measures of physical symptomatology, neither the AEQ nor the expressiveness measures correlated with daily symptom reports. Results support the contention that conflict over emotional expressiveness is a variable worthy of study in its own right, having implications for research on personality and health.","[{'authorId': '144496329', 'name': 'L.

cc7fc030b0738e9fda4c4176a3909768035e50a8,"The existence of so-called ‘basic emotions’ and their defining attributes represents a long lasting and yet unsettled issue in psychology. Recently, neuroimaging evidence, especially related to the advent of neuroimaging meta-analytic methods, has revitalized this debate in the endeavor of systems and human neuroscience. The core theme focuses on the existence of unique neural bases that are specific and characteristic for each instance of basic emotion. Here we review this evidence, outlining contradictory findings, strengths and limits of different approaches. Constructionism dismisses the existence of dedicated neural structures for basic emotions, considering that the assumption of a one-to-one relationship between neural structures and their functions is central to basic emotion theories. While these critiques are useful to pinpoint current limitations of basic emotions theories, we argue that they do not always appear equally generative in fostering new testable accounts on how the brain relates to affective functions. We then consider evidence beyond PET and fMRI, including results concerning the relation between basic emotions and awareness and data from neuropsychology on patients with focal brain damage. Evidence from lesion studies are indeed particularly informative, as they are able to bring correlational evidence typical of neuroimaging studies to causation, thereby characterizing which brain structures are necessary for, rather than simply related to, basic emotion processing. These other studies shed light on attributes often ascribed to basic emotions, such as automaticity of perception, quick onset, and brief duration. Overall, we consider that evidence in favor of the neurobiological underpinnings of basic emotions outweighs dismissive approaches. In fact, the concept of basic emotions can still be fruitful, if updated to current neurobiological knowledge that overcomes traditional one-to-one localization of functions in the brain. In particular, we propose that the structure-function relationship between brain and emotions is better described in terms of pluripotentiality, which refers to the fact that one neural structure can fulfill multiple functions, depending on the functional network and pattern of co-activations displayed at any given moment.","[{'authorId': '4248404', 'name': 'A.

cc82bfc39af84b7cbdbe82421b56b2412ce321be,"The last decade has seen significant advances in clarifying the links among the achievement motivational profiles of adolescents from different ethnic backgrounds and their home and school environments. The purpose of the present study was to begin to address the following four questions with respect to college students: (1) To what degree, and by what measures, do Southeast-Asian-American, Hispanic and White college students differ in their academic adjustment and success? (2) To what degree do college students from these backgrounds report differences in their parents' values, beliefs and practices? (3) To what degree do they differ in their comfort level with peers and instructors on campus? and (4) Do the sorts of patterns linking parenting practices and academic adjustment and success observed in studies of adolescents persist in college students from each of these three ethnic groups? Understanding ethnic group differences in college success The literature documenting ethnic group differences among college students in academic adjustment and achievement is extensive. Against a backdrop of changing demographics and large increases in the minority population of most areas of the United States, college entrance, retention and graduation rates for students of color remain low and relatively unchanged (Astin, 1982; Duran, 1994; Irvine, 1990, Justiz, 1994; Pascarella & Terenzini, 1991; Suzuki, 1994; Tinto, 1993). By the end of the 1980's, researchers had compiled a fairly clear picture of the formulas of success for ""traditional"" college students, that is 18-22 year old non-minority students from middle-class backgrounds whose parents had attended college. This formula included consideration of the adequacy of students' academic preparation, the appropriateness of their educational expectations and career goals, the ""anticipatory socialization"" (Weidman, 1989) they had received from parents, peers and others prior to entering college, and their assimilation into their new milieu upon matriculation. (See, for example, Pascarella and Terenzini's 1991 encyclopedic volume.) Recently, however, several scholars have called into question the universality of some of these patterns and urged that more research be conducted so as to better understand the dynamics at play among the less ""traditional"" and more diverse populations now making their way to and through college (Astin, 1998; Kraemer, 1997; Pascarella & Terenzini, 1998; Rendon, 1994; Stage, 1993; Tierney, 1992). The hypotheses they have proposed span the gamut. Some researchers have focused on elements in the broader community backgrounds and experiences of minority youth which place them at a relative educational disadvantage. Such elements include the absence of role models, the perception that educational achievement will not guarantee economic advantage down the road, and financial pressures and family responsibilities that make pursuing college impossible (e.g., Ogbu, 1992; Ogbu & Matute-Bianchi, 1986). Other researchers focus on the more elusive macrosystem values (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) that obtain in different communities. Such values include the degree to which academic education is prioritized (as opposed to moral or religious education, or knowledge of one's cultural heritage), as well as the degree to which community youth are encouraged to pursue formal education (e.g., Goldenberg & Gallimore, 1995). Still others examine family attitudes and daily practices relating to children's education and schoolwork (e.g., Dornbusch, Ritter, Leiderman, Roberts & Fraleigh, 1987; and Steinberg, Lamborn, Darling, Mounts & Dornbusch, 1994). A more recent tac has been to focus on the specific knowledge and resources contained in the social and academic ""capital"" parents invest in their children (Connor & DeVos, 1989; Cooper, Azmitia, Garcia, Ittel, Lopez, Rivera & Martinez-Chavez, 1994; Duran, 1994; Goldenberg & Gallimore, 1995; Mehan, 1992; and Phelan, Davidson & Cao, 1991). …","[{'authorId': '5425502', 'name': 'A.

To determine the relationship between ethical leadership, organisational commitment of nurses and their perception of patient safety culture.


BACKGROUND
Patient safety, organisational commitment and ethical leadership styles are very important for improving the quality of nursing care.


METHODS
In this descriptive-correlational study, 340 nurses were selected using random sampling from the hospitals in Tehran in 2016. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics in SPSS v.20.


RESULTS
There was a significant positive relationship between the ethical leadership of nursing managers, perception of patient safety culture and organisational commitment. The regression analysis showed that nursing managers' ethical leadership and nurses' organisational commitment is a predictor of patient safety culture and confirms the relationship between the variables.


CONCLUSION
Regarding the relationship between the nurses' safety performance, ethical leadership and organisational commitment, it seems that the optimisation of the organisational commitment and adherence to ethical leadership by administrators and managers in hospitals could improve the nurses' performance in terms of patient safety.


IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT
Implementing ethical leadership seems to be one feasible strategy to improve nurses' organisational commitment and perception of patient safety culture. Efforts by nurse managers to develop ethical leadership reinforce organisational commitment to improve patient outcomes. Nurse managers' engagement and performance in this process is vital for a successful result.","[{'authorId': '2370426', 'name': 'Z. Lotfi'}, {'authorId': '1402649624', 'name': 'F.

ccc61c75c0ddca33d787d1f5ab57cf3b0049f3b0,"Abstract We aimed to investigate (1) the association between job insecurity and workplace bullying from the perspective of both targets and perpetrators and (2) perceived employability as a moderator of these relationships. We argue that job insecurity is associated with social or interpersonal strain as in the case of workplace bullying. Furthermore, workers who feel that they have alternative opportunities for employment may find it easier to cope with insecurity. Stated differently, we aimed to investigate whether the relationship between job insecurity and workplace bullying depended on the level of perceived employability. Hypotheses were tested among 693 workers who participated in a survey on the quality of working life. They were employed at establishments of two Belgian organizations from the textile industry (N=189) and financial services (N=505). We found that that job insecurity was associated with targets' and perpetrators' reports of workplace bullying. The interaction between job insecurity and perceived employability did not contribute to targets' reports of workplace bullying. However, it was related to perpetrators' reports of workplace bullying. Interestingly, the relationship between job insecurity and workplace bullying was stronger under the condition of high versus low employability. This hints at the idea that there could be a “dark side” to employability.","[{'authorId': '7158028', 'name': 'Nele de Cuyper'}, {'authorId': '3939647', 'name': 'Elfi Baillien'}, {'authorId': '4515797', 'name': 'H.

ccfa7e011aa23b2477d11f6c4f779f998db382ac,"Successful human interaction commonly involves prototypical exchanges where interactors are engaged, synchronized, and harmonious in their behaviors. The copying of aspects of the other's behavior, at different levels, seems central to establishing and maintaining such empathic connections. Yet, many questions remain unanswered, particularly how it is possible to reflect the same affective content back to the other when the actual motion itself is not exactly the same as theirs. This paper presents a perceptual study in which emotional gestures conducted by an actor were mapped onto synthesized versions generated by an embodied virtual agent. Copying is at the expressive level, where qualities such as the fluidity or expansiveness of gestures are considered, rather than exact low-level motion matching. Participants were later asked to rate the emotional content of video recordings of both the original and the synthesized gestures. A statistical analysis shows that, in most cases, participants associated the emotional content of the agent's gestures with that intended to be expressed by the original actor. The results suggest that a combination of the type of movement performed and its quality is important for successfully communicating emotions.","[{'authorId': '39540970', 'name': 'Ginevra Castellano'}, {'authorId': '2169958', 'name': 'M.

cda1675ac2aa58d5fd1b0e58c57e3b7675c6dad2,"ABSTRACT Background: Recently, the news media have reported on the discovery of covert awareness and the establishment of limited communication using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neuroimaging technique with several brain-injured patients thought to have been in a vegetative state. This discovery has raised many ethical, legal, and social questions related to quality of life, end-of-life decision making, diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in disorders of consciousness, resource allocation, and other issues. This project inquires into the public responses to these discoveries. Methods: We conducted a thematic analysis of online comments (n = 779) posted in response to 15 news articles and blog posts regarding the case of a Canadian patient diagnosed for 12 years as in a vegetative state, but who was reported in 2012 as having been able to communicate via fMRI. The online comments were coded using an iteratively refined codebook structured around 14 main themes. Results: Among the most frequent public reactions revealed in the online comments were discussions of the quality of life of patients with disorders of consciousness, whether life-sustaining treatment should be withdrawn (and whether the fMRI communication technique should be used to ask patients about this), and misgivings about the accuracy of diagnosis in disorders of consciousness and brain death. Conclusions: These public perspectives are relevant to the obligations of clinicians, lawyers, and public policymakers to patients, families, and the public. Future work should consider how best to alleviate families' concerns as this type of research shakes their faith in diagnostic accuracy, to clarify the legal rules relating to advance directives in this context, and to address the manner in which public messaging might help to alleviate any indirect impact on confidence in the organ donation system.","[{'authorId': '38878415', 'name': 'J.

Existing emergencies have shown that individuals are easy to be influenced by others' emotion during the evacuation. This will make it easier for people to aggregate together and increase security risks. Some of the existing evacuation models without considering emotion are therefore not suitable for describing crowd behaviors in emergencies. We propose a perception‐based emotion contagion model and use multiagent technology to simulate crowd behaviors. Navigation points are introduced to guide the movement of the agents. Based on the proposed model, a prototype simulation system for crowd emotion contagion is developed. The comparative simulation experiments verify that the model can effectively deduct the evacuation time and crowd emotion contagion. The proposed model could be an assistant analysis method for crowd management in emergencies.","[{'authorId': '2109341502', 'name': 'Zhen Liu'}, {'authorId': '91436120', 'name': 'Tingting Liu'}, {'authorId': '145877966', 'name': 'M.

ce06a185ecfa7e420372273525d776726da6264a,"The adoption of passenger leaders could make crowd evacuation in urban railway transit (URT) stations more efficient. The number, location, and the actions of the leaders are the most important elements in an evacuation strategy and have a great impact on evacuation efficiency. This paper proposes a hybrid bi-level model to optimize the number and initial locations of leaders as well as the routes of leaders during the evacuation, which explicitly incorporates the passengers’ guidance demand and multi-leader coordination mechanism. The leaders’ initial locations are generated by solving the maximal covering location problem (upper level model) and their evacuation routes are determined by a co-simulation heuristic approach (lower level model). The social force model and its modifications are used to model the dynamics of common evacuees, leaders, and followers in simulation models. The convergence performance of the proposed co-simulation heuristic approach and the effectiveness of the optimal evacuation strategy have been investigated and demonstrated using a case study of a typical island platform of Beijing’s URT station. Three other evacuation strategies are considered for comparison purposes in order to show the influence of the number and initial locations of leaders as well as the multi-leader coordination mechanism during the evacuation process. Our analysis supported by simulations shows the following: 1) the optimal number of leaders exists for a given human cost and guidance demand constraints; 2) the distribution of leaders for maximal covering makes the evacuation of the followers more efficient; and 3) the proposed optimal evacuation strategy has better performance in terms of shorter evacuation time and higher utilization of exits compared with other considered strategies.","[{'authorId': '51508619', 'name': 'Min Zhou'}, {'authorId': '3046943', 'name': 'Hai-rong Dong'}, {'authorId': '2109706353', 'name': 'Yanbo Zhao'}, {'authorId': '2663035', 'name': 'Petros A.

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to study the applicability of a crossover model of work–family conflict (WFC) in the work setting among supervisor–subordinate dyads. It examines the positive association between supervisor’s WFC and subordinate’s WFC and analyses the moderating effect of subordinate’s susceptibility to emotional contagion (SEC).


Design/methodology/approach
Data were gathered using a questionnaire survey method and tested in 193 matched supervisor–subordinate dyads from select organisations representing the services sector in India.


Findings
The authors found a significant direct crossover path from the supervisor to his/her subordinate’s WFC. The effect of supervisor reported WFC on subordinate reported WFC was found to be strong when the subordinate displayed higher SEC with his/her supervisor.


Research limitations/implications
Examining the crossover of WFC contributes to theory by broadening crossover research to include transmission of negative experiences in the work context. This study significantly adds to emotional contagion theory by substantiating the existence of WFC contagion in supervisor–subordinate dyads. Given the constraints of cross-sectional research design, future research should replicate these findings using a larger sample in other cultural contexts as well to generalise the results. Future research should consider using longitudinal data and including information from both the supervisor and the subordinates collected at different points in time. Crossover of positive work–family experiences (e.g. work–family enrichment) and the role of other individual difference variables such as the personality of the subordinates, empathy, etc., could also be considered.


Practical implications
Supervisors should be advised of the potential adverse effects of their WFC and organisations should be made cognizance of the impact that the WFC of employees can have on their job outcomes. Organisations should provide the required formal and informal support to their employees to deal with their WFC efficiently.


Originality/value
This study has attempted to examine the crossover of WFC in supervisor–subordinate dyads and the potential effect of one of the individual difference variables namely SEC. To the best of the authors knowledge, it has rarely been examined earlier.

Among the important findings is that teachers practice emotion regulation because they believe it makes them more effective in management, discipline, and their relationships with students. Further, teachers are much more confident that they can communicate their positive emotions than reduce their negative emotions, and they use a variety of emotion regulation strategies, including preventive and reactive methods. These results stand in contrast to the fact that most pre-service programs give little emphasis to relationships among teachers' emotions, classroom management, and teaching practice.","[{'authorId': '47549535', 'name': 'Rosemary E.

The focus is on two major aspects of affective social interaction: the synchronization of the affective behavior within a small group and the emergence of functional roles, such as leadership. A small group of users is modeled as a complex system consisting of single interacting components that can auto-organize and show global properties. Techniques are developed for computing quantitative measures of both synchronization and leadership. Music is selected as experimental test-bed since it is a clear example of interactive and social activity, where affective nonverbal communication plays a fundamental role. The system has been implemented as software modules for the EyesWeb XMI platform (http://www.eyesweb.org). It has been used in experimental frameworks (a violin duo and a string quartet) and in real-world applications (in user-centric applications for active music listening).

A survey design was used involving 250 local government employees working in Australia and 265 working in the USA. The overall findings identify significant paths from management practice, through to resource adequacy and in turn, employee engagement. Additionally, the findings identify a significant difference in perceptions of the work environment for US local government employees compared with those in Australia. In particular, employees in the US perceive a significantly higher level of satisfaction with management (both perceived organisational support and leader-member exchange), perceive significantly lower levels of resource inadequacy and are much more engaged than their local government counterparts in Australia. The implications are that the way management is conceptualised and practised in Australian local government is negatively impacting on employee engagement and therefore must change.","[{'authorId': '9155680', 'name': 'Y.

Which type of interaction dogs prefer and which might produce the most social behavior from a dog has not been investigated. In the current study, we assessed how dogs allocated their responding in a concurrent choice between food and petting. Dogs received five 5-min sessions each. In Session 1, both food and petting were continuously delivered contingent on the dog being near the person providing the respective consequence. Across the next three sessions, we thinned the food schedule to a Fixed Interval (FI) 15-s, FI 1-min, and finally extinction. The fifth session reversed back to the original food contingency. We tested owned dogs in familiar (daycare) and unfamiliar (laboratory room) environments, and with their owner or a stranger as the person providing petting. In general, dogs preferred food to petting when food was readily available and all groups showed sensitivity to the thinning food schedule by decreasing their time allocation to food, although there were group and individual differences in the level of sensitivity. How dogs allocated their time with the petting alternative also varied. We found effects of context, familiarity of the person providing petting, and relative deprivation from social interaction on the amount of time dogs allocated to the petting alternative.","[{'authorId': '5059848', 'name': 'E.

Meanwhile, emotional contagion, the spread of vigilance or panic, serves as a negative feedback to the epidemic, but few existing models take it into consideration. In this study, we proposed an innovative multi-layer hybrid modelling and simulation approach to simulate disease transmission and emotional contagion together. In each layer, we used a hybrid simulation method combining agent-based modelling (ABM) with system dynamics modelling (SDM), keeping spatial heterogeneity while reducing computation costs. We designed a new emotion dynamics model IWAN (indifferent, worried, afraid and numb) to simulate emotional contagion inside a community during an epidemic. Our model was well fit to the data of China, the UK and the US during the COVID-19 pandemic. If there weren’t emotional contagion, our experiments showed that the confirmed cases would increase rapidly, for instance, the total confirmed cases during simulation in Guangzhou, China would grow from 334 to 2096, which increased by 528%. We compared the calibrated emotional contagion parameters of different countries and found that the suppression effect of emotional contagion in China is relatively more visible than that in the US and the UK. Due to the experiment results, the proposed multi-layer network model with hybrid simulation is valid and can be applied to the quantitative analysis of the epidemic trends and the suppression effect of emotional contagion in different countries. Our model can be modified for further research to study other social factors and intervention policies in the COVID-19 pandemic or future epidemics.","[{'authorId': '2124466167', 'name': 'Xudong Guo'}, {'authorId': '150165151', 'name': 'Junbo Tong'}, {'authorId': '47978509', 'name': 'Peiyu Chen'}, {'authorId': '2113532692', 'name': 'Wenhui Fan'}]",6.0,"{'name': 'PLoS ONE', 'volume': '16'}",34.0,The suppression effect of emotional contagion in the COVID-19 pandemic: A multi-layer hybrid modelling and simulation approach,2021.0

This correlation persisted after controlling for the effect of spatial association. Thus, emotional proximity rather than spatial proximity best predicts yawn contagion. Adult females showed precise matching of different yawning types, which suggests a mirroring mechanism that activates shared representations. The present study also suggests that females have an enhanced sensitivity and emotional tuning toward companions. These findings are consistent with the view that contagious yawning reveals an emotional connection between individuals.

The model draws upon social exchange theory , which depicts social interactions in terms of the relative influence of actors, and upon categorization theory , which considers how information relating to social interaction is cognitively organized and processed. While the social arena can be categorized along any number of dimensions, the core proposal of the model is that, in the interest of reducing the complexity of the organizational world, people employ a schema (i.e., cognitive map) in which social interactions are categorized according to the relative influence of actors. The schema for participation is posited to be an individual-level knowledge structure with a strong shared component. The consensual aspect of the participation schema varies across cultures and subcultures, accounting for the wide cross-cultural variation in attitudes, norms, and values about participation. The model further proposes that the participation schema resembles the structure of much other world knowledge in that it organizes social situations into increasingly abstract and inclusive categories. Finally, the participation schema is posited to link to both emotion or affective information, as well as to action-oriented knowledge. Schema-based processing reduces the cognitive complexity of a workplace interaction because it enables individuals to 1) efficiently determine their relative influence in a workplace situation; 2) respond efficiently to the situation on an emotional level; and 3) call upon scripted sequences of appropriate behavior. Implications of the model for research are proposed.","[{'authorId': '5415088', 'name': 'Larry I. Shetzer'}]",78.0,,67.0,A Social Information Processing Model of Employee Participation,1993.0

The detrimental effects of anthropomorphic thinking and the importance of an evolutionary perspective for understanding the neurobehavioral differences between fishes and humans are discussed. The differences in central nervous system structure that underlie basic neurobehavioral differences between fishes and humans are described. The literature on the neural basis of consciousness and of pain is reviewed, showing that: (1) behavioral responses to noxious stimuli are separate from the psychological experience of pain, (2) awareness of pain in humans depends on functions of specific regions of cerebral cortex, and (3) fishes lack these essential brain regions or any functional equivalent, making it untenable that they can experience pain. Because the experience of fear, similar to pain, depends on cerebral cortical structures that are absent from fish brains, it is concluded that awareness of fear is impossible for fishes.

Thus, avoidance of potentially injurious stress responses is an important issue in considerations about the welfare of fishes.","[{'authorId': '145628542', 'name': 'J. D.

Risk as feelings refers to individuals’ instinctive and intuitive reactions to danger.Risk as analysis brings logic, reason, and scientific deliberation to bear on risk management. Reliance on risk as feelings is described as ‘‘the affect heuristic.’’ This article traces the development of this heuristic and discusses some of the important ways that it impacts how people perceive and evaluate risk. KEYWORDS—risk perception; risk analysis; the affect heuristic Risk in the modern world is perceived and acted upon in two fundamental ways. Risk as feelings refers to our instinctive and intuitive reactions to danger. Risk as analysis brings logic, reason, and scientific deliberation to bear on risk assessment and decision making. This article discusses what recent research reveals about risk as feelings, an important vestige of humans’ evolutionary journey. That intuitive feelings are still the predominant method by which human beings evaluate risk is cleverly illustrated in a cartoon by Doonesbury creator, Garry Trudeau. Two characters decide whether it is safe to greet one another on a city street by systematically tabulating a list of risk and risk-mitigating factors to determine which are more numerous. The reader instantly recognizes that people in such a situation would never be this analytical, even if their lives were at stake. Most risk analysis in daily life is handled quickly and automatically by feelings arising from what is known as the ‘‘experiential’’ mode of thinking. BACKGROUND AND THEORY: THE IMPORTANCE OF SPECIFIC EMOTIONS AND AFFECT Strong visceral emotions such as fear and anger sometimes play a role in risk as feelings. These two emotions appear to have opposite effects—fear amplifies risk estimates, and anger attenuates them (Lerner, Gonzalez, Small, & Fischhoff, 2003; Lerner & Keltner, 2000). Lerner and colleagues have explained these differences by proposing that fear arises from appraisals of uncertainty and situational control, whereas anger arises from appraisals of certainty and individual control. Fortunately, most of the time people are in a calmer state, being guided by much subtler feelings. We shall focus this review on a ‘‘faint whisper of emotion’’ called affect. We use the term affect to mean the specific quality of ‘‘goodness’’ or ‘‘badness’’ (a) experienced as a feeling state (with or without consciousness) and (b) demarcating a positive or negative quality of a stimulus. We have used the term ‘‘the affect heuristic’’ to characterize reliance on such feelings (Slovic, Finucane, Peters, & MacGregor, 2002); the experienced feelings are used as information to guide judgment and decision making (Schwarz & Clore, 1988). Affect plays a central role in what are known as dual-process theories of thinking. According to these theories, people apprehend reality in two fundamentally different ways, one labeled intuitive, automatic, natural, nonverbal, narrative, and experiential, and the other analytical, deliberative, and verbal (see, e.g., Epstein, 1994). One of the main characteristics of the intuitive, experiential system is its affective basis. Although analysis is certainly important in some decision-making circumstances, reliance on affect is generally a quicker, easier, and more efficient way to navigate in a complex, uncertain, and sometimes dangerous world. Many theorists have given affect a direct and primary role in motivating behavior. Pleasant feelings motivate actions that people anticipate will reproduce those feelings. Unpleasant feelings motivate actions that people anticipate will avoid those feelings. There are strong elements of rationality in both systems of thinking. The experiential system enabled human beings to survive as they evolved. Intuition, instinct, and gut feeling were relied upon to determine whether an animal was safe to approach or the water was safe to drink. As life becamemore complex and humans gained more control over their environment, analytic tools such as probability theory, risk assessment, and decision analysis were invented to ‘‘boost’’ the rationality of experiential thinking. THE AFFECT HEURISTIC Evidence of risk as feelings was present in early studies of risk perception (Fischhoff, Slovic, Lichtenstein, Read, & Combs, 1978). Those studies showed that feelings of dread were the major deterAddress correspondence to Paul Slovic, Decision Research, 1201 Oak Street, Suite 200, Eugene, OR 97401; e-mail: pslovic@darkwing. uoregon.edu. CURRENT DIRECTIONS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE 322 Volume 15—Number 6 Copyright r 2006 Association for Psychological Science at UCLA on September 29, 2014 cdp.sagepub.com Downloaded from miner of public perception and acceptance of risk for awide range of hazards. This explained, for example, why the public judges radiation exposure from nuclear power plants (highly dreaded) as far riskier than radiation from medical X-rays—an assessment not shared by risk experts. In today’s world, terrorism has replaced nuclear power at the top of the list of widely dreaded risks. Risk and Benefit Judgments Research has found that, whereas risk and benefit tend to be positively correlated across hazardous activities in theworld (i.e., high-risk activities tend to have greater benefits than do low-risk activities), they are negatively correlated in people’s minds and judgments (i.e., high risk is associated with low benefit, and vice versa). The significance of this finding was not realized until a study by Alhakami and Slovic (1994) found that the inverse relationship between perceived risk and perceived benefit of an activity (e.g., using pesticides) was linked to the strength of positive or negative affect associated with that activity as measured by rating the activity on bipolar scales such as good/bad, nice/awful, and so forth. This finding implies that people judge a risk not only by what they think about it but also by how they feel about it. If their feelings toward an activity are favorable, they tend to judge the risks as low and the benefits as high; if their feelings toward the activity are unfavorable, they tend to make the opposite judgment—high risk and low benefit (i.e., the affect heuristic; Finucane, Alhakami, Slovic, & Johnson, 2000). If affect guides perceptions of risk and benefit, then providing information about benefit should change people’s perception of risk and vice versa (see Fig. 1). For example, information stating that benefit is high for a technology such as nuclear power should lead to more positive overall affect, which should, in turn, decrease perceived risk (Fig. 1A). Finucane et al. (2000) tested this hypothesis for various technologies, providing information designed to manipulate affect by increasing or decreasing perceived benefit for the technology or by increasing or decreasing its perceived risk. Their predictions were confirmed. Further support for the affect heuristic came from a second experiment by Finucane et al. showing that the inverse relationship between perceived risks and benefits increased greatly under time pressure, when opportunity for analytic deliberation was reduced. Coupled with the findings of Alhakami and Slovic (1994), these experiments indicate that affect influences judgment directly and is not simply a response to a prior analytic evaluation. As a key element of experiential thinking, the affect heuristic was essential to risk assessment and survival during the evolution of the human species. But, as we describe below, affect can also mislead people. Judgments of Probability, Relative Frequency, and Risk The experiential system of thinking encodes reality in images, metaphors, and narratives to which affective feelings have become attached. To demonstrate this, Denes-Raj and Epstein (1994) showed that, when offered a chance to win $1 by drawing a red jelly bean from an urn, individuals often elected to draw from a bowl containing a greater absolute number of red beans but a smaller proportion of them (e.g., 7 in 100) rather than from a bowl with fewer red beans but a better probability of winning (e.g., 1 in 10). These individuals reported that, although they knew the probabilities were against them, they felt they had a better chance when there were more red beans. We can characterize Denes-Raj and Epstein’s subjects as following a mental strategy of ‘‘imaging the numerator’’ (i.e., the number of red beans) and neglecting the denominator (the number of beans in the bowl). Consistent with the affect heuristic, images of winning beans convey positive affect that motivates choice. Although the jelly-bean experiment may seem frivolous, imaging the numerator brings affect to bear on judgments in ways that can be both nonintuitive and consequential. Slovic, Monahan, and MacGregor (2000) demonstrated this by asking experienced forensic psychologists and psychiatrists to judge the likelihood that a hospitalized mental patient, ‘‘Mr. Jones,’’ would commit an act of violence within 6months after being discharged from the facility. An important finding was that clinicians who were given another expert’s assessment of the patient’s risk of violent behavior framed in terms of relative frequency subsequently labeled him as more dangerous than did clinicians who were shown a statistically ‘‘equivalent’’ risk expressed as a probability. For example, when clinicians were told that ‘‘20 out C A","[{'authorId': '2403553', 'name': 'P. Slovic'}, {'authorId': '2241229675', 'name': 'E.

We accordingly think that only the individual bearers of these brains can have emotions. Of course, some of these emotions are directed at the individual’s social concerns. It is also common for individuals to influence each other’s emotions, sometimes in a very rapid and reciprocal manner. But it is commonly presumed that this is as far as we need to go to explain all instances of emotion. On the other hand, there are a range of social phenomena that encourage us to look at things rather differently. As the authors of this volume variously observe, protest movements, religious rituals, joint musical performances, large sporting events, mass celebrations and intractable decades-long conflicts display emotional characteristics that are hard to reduce to the individuals involved. Moreover, participants may well report a sense of being carried away by the mood of the occasion, or the ‘emotional atmosphere’. Perhaps the best way to make sense of these phenomena is to allow for ‘collective emotions’. And if one is willing to admit collective emotions in such large scale cases, one may well return to ordinary interpersonal interactions with a different perspective, recognizing that some of these, too, may qualify as cases of collective emotion. After all, the small group is often capable of more intensive forms of interaction than large scale social movements.

Despite significant efforts in studying various aspects of COVID-19, there is a dearth of evidence on how negative emotions are associated with behaviors. A comparison across associated factors to different negative emotions by means of a unified model is especially missing from the literature. This study was conducted by using the results of a survey conducted across 2,534 students enrolled in 7 states in the US. Various feelings such as sad, irritable, stress and guilt were analyzed in a unified model by means of seemingly unrelated regression (SUR). Questions were asked related to rationally limiting the spread of virus, and questions related to behaviors that seem to be extreme. Irrational behaviors, such as limiting exercise at home due to COVID-19 could be due to experiencing negative emotions, which distort the meaning of events for the students. That behavior, for instance, was found to be positively associated with various negative feelings. In addition, the results highlighted significant differences across emotions in terms of demographic characteristics such as gender and age, and various precautionary actions that students take, such as limiting outdoor activities or limiting social gathering. For instance, it was highlighted while avoiding a large group of people, in spite of its importance in curbing the spread of virus, is negatively associated with various negative emotions, taking a possible nonconsequential precaution of completely limiting all people outside the immediate family result in a higher level of negative emotions. Also, it was found that having a higher body mass index (BMI), self-rated worse health conditions, and limiting outdoor activities have detrimental effects on the mental health of students.","[{'authorId': '84345663', 'name': 'Mahdi Rezapour'}, {'authorId': '48656517', 'name': 'A.

An egoistic alternative account of this evidence was proposed and tested in our work. We hypothesized that an observer's heightened empathy for a sufferer brings with it increased personal sadness in the observer and that it is the egoistic desire to relieve the sadness, rather than the selfless desire to relieve the sufferer, that motivates helping. Two experiments contrasted predictions from the selfless and egoistic alternatives in the paradigm typically used by Batson and his associates. In the first, an emphatic orientation to a victim increased personal sadness, as expected. Furthermore, when sadness and empathic emotion were separated experimentally, helping was predicted by the levels of sadness subjects were experiencing but not by their empathy scores. In the second experiment, enhanced sadness was again associated with empathy for a victim. However, subjects who were led to perceive that their moods could not be altered through helping (because of the temporary action of a ""mood-fixing"" placebo drug) were not helpful, despite high levels of empathic emotion.

This study investigated nurse perceptions of the incidence and nature of verbal and physical assault or abuse by patients and their family members or visitors.


METHODS
A survey was given to ED, ICU, and general floor nurses in a 770-bed acute care north Florida medical center.


RESULTS
The response rate was 68.8% (86 out of 125). Large percentages of nurses reported being victims of verbal assault or abuse and physical assault by patients and family members or visitors; 88% reported being verbally assaulted and 74% reported being physically assaulted while at work in the past year. ED nurses reported the highest rates of these incidences, with 100% reporting verbal assault and 82.1% reporting physical assault within the past year. Assaults were most commonly perpetrated by patients with cognitive dysfunction (79.1%), patients with substance abuse (60.5%), and persons who were angry because of the patient's condition (55.8%). Surprising information: the most common causes of assault by family members and visitors were anger related to enforcement of hospital policies (58.1%), anger related to the patient's condition/situation (57%), anger related to long wait times (47.7%), and anger related to the health care system in general (46.5%).


DISCUSSION
Nurses were confused about what legally constitutes ""assault"" and ""abuse""; nurse rights versus patient rights; and policies and procedures for reporting assault or abuse incidences. Our results indicate that nurses are experiencing abusive and assaultive behavior from family members and visitors just as often as they are from patients, and ED nurses are at higher risk. Nurses perceive a lack of institutional support and an institutional emphasis on patient rights and satisfaction and do not feel safe in the workplace.","[{'authorId': '49107629', 'name': 'Deborah D May'}, {'authorId': '47955222', 'name': 'L.

However, different single-factor measures usually lead to conflicting results. This study proposes an overall participation performance measure, VBC participation performance, which follows a holistic-view definition of customer values, including frequency of customer visit, purchase frequency, purchase expenditure, and word-of-mouth frequency, obtain from the overall community activities, and it is evaluated through data envelopment analysis (DEA). We further determine the effect of the customer’s gender, age, tenure, and interactions on VBC participation performance by using Tobit regression models. The results show that our proposed measure outperforms either single-factor measures or measures based on other multicriteria decision analyses. Our findings also reveal that VBC is less efficient for females and customers with long tenure, and the effect of gender difference on VBC participation performance will be more (less) significant with increasing age (tenure). The findings extend existing research by suggesting an overall participation performance measure in VBC and providing insights on customer heterogeneity in the efficacy of VBC participation. This study also offers actionable recommendations for managers in term of customer segmentation and VBC design.","[{'authorId': '2115565480', 'name': 'Ji Wu'}, {'authorId': '143765203', 'name': 'Kang Xie'}, {'authorId': '49874393', 'name': 'Jinghua Xiao'}, {'authorId': '46576827', 'name': 'Jianhui Xie'}]",14.0,,69.0,Effects of Customer Heterogeneity on Participation Performance in Virtual Brand Community: A Two-Stage Semiparametric Approach,2018.0

Under emotional contagion, individual emotions gradually generalized into group emotions. At the same time, the public could not regulate their emotions and lacked access to release them rationally. This study explores the factors influencing the negative emotions' communication among social media users during the COVID-19 epidemic from the perspective of emotion contagion theory to discover the psychological mechanisms among the public. The questionnaire was tested for reliability and validity and then distributed online on Chinese social media platforms, and the data collected were statistically analyzed. The findings show that there are significant differences in negative emotional communication in social media among different age groups; the seven dimensions of deindividuation, risk perception, group identity, group efficacy, event stimulation, event publicness, and emotion contagion all have significant positive effects on users' negative emotional communication. This study aims to raise public awareness of negative emotions and promote the reconstruction and recovery of public mental health in the epidemic era.","[{'authorId': '2111831898', 'name': 'D.

Using functional imaging, we assessed brain activity while volunteers experienced a painful stimulus and compared it to that elicited when they observed a signal indicating that their loved one—present in the same room—was receiving a similar pain stimulus. Bilateral anterior insula (AI), rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), brainstem, and cerebellum were activated when subjects received pain and also by a signal that a loved one experienced pain. AIand ACC activation correlated with individual empathy scores. Activity in the posterior insula/secondary somatosensory cortex, the sensorimotor cortex (SI/MI), and the caudal ACC was specific to receiving pain. Thus, a neural response in AIand rostral ACC, activated in common for “self” and “other” conditions, suggests that the neural substrate for empathic experience does not involve the entire “pain matrix.” We conclude that only that part of the pain network associated with its affective qualities, but not its sensory qualities, mediates empathy.","[{'authorId': '47272511', 'name': 'T.

The theories suggest that perceiving and thinking about emotion involve perceptual, somatovisceral, and motoric reexperiencing (collectively referred to as “embodiment”) of the relevant emotion in one's self. The embodiment of emotion, when induced in human participants by manipulations of facial expression and posture in the laboratory, causally affects how emotional information is processed. Congruence between the recipient's bodily expression of emotion and the sender's emotional tone of language, for instance, facilitates comprehension of the communication, whereas incongruence can impair comprehension.

Participants received cTBS over the hand and lip areas of left PMC, in separate sessions, before completing a pantomime-recognition task in which half of the trials contained pantomimed hand actions, and half contained pantomimed mouth actions. The results reveal a double dissociation: Participants were less accurate in recognizing pantomimed hand actions after receiving cTBS over the hand area than over the lip area and less accurate in recognizing pantomimed mouth actions after receiving cTBS over the lip area than over the hand area. This finding constrains theories of action understanding by showing that somatotopically organized regions of PMC contribute causally to action understanding and, thus, that the mechanisms underpinning action understanding and action performance overlap.","[{'authorId': '143917088', 'name': 'J.

The performance of steering approaches, both in terms of quality of results and computational efficiency, depends on internal parameters that are manually tuned to satisfy application-specific requirements. This paper investigates the effect that these parameters have on an algorithm's performance. Using three representative steering algorithms and a set of established performance criteria, we perform a number of large scale optimization experiments that optimize an algorithm's parameters for a range of objectives. For example, our method automatically finds optimal parameters to minimize turbulence at bottlenecks, reduce building evacuation times, produce emergent patterns, and increase the computational efficiency of an algorithm. We also propose using the Pareto Optimal front as an efficient way of modelling optimal relationships between multiple objectives, and demonstrate its effectiveness by estimating optimal parameters for interactively defined combinations of the associated objectives. The proposed methodologies are general and can be applied to any steering algorithm using any set of performance criteria.","[{'authorId': '2994035', 'name': 'G.

d34a317cac2b5f0ef2ac1f3c2ab48f806fcf4293,"Past functional MRI (FMRI) studies of autism have reported reduced activation in response to the faces of strangers primarily in the 'fusiform face area' (FFA). An alternative and potentially stronger test of FFA function in autism is one that attempts to affect levels of FFA activity using factors believed to modulate function in this brain region, such as face familiarity and the perception of face identity. The current study presented personally meaningful faces, such as mother and co-worker, as well as stranger faces in a rapid event-related FMRI design. Seven autistic and nine normal control adults participated and pressed a button in response to all female faces. A deconvolution analysis revealed significant FFA activity in response to familiar and stranger faces in both autism and normal control groups. Individuals with autism also showed greater fusiform activity in response to familiar faces than stranger faces, as well as the prototypical right hemisphere dominance in response to both types of faces. Normal subjects showed additional activation to familiar faces in the posterior cingulate, amygdala and medial frontal lobes, including the anterior cingulate. Subjects with autism showed a similar, but more limited, network in response to familiar faces. This network included the amygdala and implies that this structure, involved in multiple socio-emotional functions, can be responsive in autism in the presence of stimuli that represent high reward value, such as mother's face. Furthermore, the presence of a distinct network to process familiar faces in autism, one that included limbic structures and was not found in response to the faces of strangers, suggests socio-emotional processing in autism. A potentially noteworthy trend, however, was evidence for a reduction in medial frontal lobe function in the autism group. The main finding of FFA activity in autism stands in contrast to most past FMRI studies of face processing in this disorder. This positive result may reflect the use of personally significant faces that enhanced attention and motivation in the autistic participants. Furthermore, given the proposed role of the FFA in establishing person identity, the use of almost a dozen different personally familiar faces for each participant (totalling 32 non-repeating faces) may have additionally maximized FFA involvement. Therefore, dysfunction in the FFA found in other studies of autism may reflect defects in systems that modulate the FFA, rather than the FFA itself.","[{'authorId': '39821072', 'name': 'K.

The congestion at exits may slow down the egress rate due to the effect of “faster-is-slower”. This inspires us to study how human behavior dynamically changes over time at an emergency in a complex indoor environment. In this paper, we refer the panic of evacuees to their perception of the threat and propose a panic propagation model to model how crowd panic changes during evacuation at an emergency. Combined with the existing social force model, our panic model interprets the self-driven force and interactive forces with others in human mobility. To improve evacuation efficiency, robots are introduced to guide evacuees to escape. Using dynamic environment information, we design an evacuation exit selection algorithm where the optimal exit is automatically selected by the robot with the minimum escape time. In our experiments, a real shopping mall is examined, and the dynamic behavior of panicked evacuees is simulated with the proposed panic model. The evacuation performance of using emergency evacuation robots is evaluated. The improvement of evacuation efficiency validates the effectiveness of our robot-assisted evacuation system.","[{'authorId': '37078378', 'name': 'Bo Tang'}, {'authorId': '2115484380', 'name': 'Chao Jiang'}, {'authorId': '2198278', 'name': 'Haibo He'}, {'authorId': '144979422', 'name': 'Yi Guo'}]",41.0,,48.0,Human Mobility Modeling for Robot-Assisted Evacuation in Complex Indoor Environments,2016.0

Either experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event during adolescence can increase the risk of psychiatric disorders, such as PTSD. The present study attempted to establish an improved social stress model to better distinguish the effects of physical and emotional social stress on the behavior and physiology of adolescent mice. In addition, we investigated how social support affected these stress-induced changes in social behavior. On PND 28, male littermates were exposed to either physical stress (PS) or emotional stress (ES), afterwards, half of them were paired-housed and the others were singly housed. The PS exposed mice were directly confronted with a violent aggressor using the social defeat stress (SDS) paradigm for 15 min/trial (with the total of 10 trials randomly administered over a week), while the ES exposed mice were placed in a neighboring compartment to witness the PS procedure. Our results indicate that both stressors induced an effective stress response in adolescent mice, but PS and ES had differential influence in the context of relevant social anxiety/fear and social interaction with peers. Additionally, social support following stress exposure exerted beneficial effects on the social anxiety/fear in ES exposed mice, but not on PS exposed mice, suggesting that the type of stressor may affect the intervention efficacy of social support. These findings provide extensive evidence that physical and emotional stressors induce different effects. Moreover, ES exposed mice, rather than PS exposed mice, seemed to benefit from social support. In summary, the study suggests that this paradigm will be helpful in investigating the effects of psychological intervention for the treatment of stress-related psychiatric disorders.","[{'authorId': '2118481226', 'name': 'Man Li'}, {'authorId': '120178437', 'name': 'Hang Xu'}, {'authorId': '1933758', 'name': 'Weiwen Wang'}]",12.0,,43.0,An Improved Model of Physical and Emotional Social Defeat: Different Effects on Social Behavior and Body Weight of Adolescent Mice by Interaction With Social Support,2018.0

The results showed that the proposed one-dimensional structure of the ECS was not tenable. Instead a multi-facet model based on a differential emotions model and a hierarchal valence/differential emotions model was supported.

In an effort to distill the complexity of affective experience, psychologists routinely focus on a simplified subset of subjective rating scales (i.e., dimensions) that capture considerable variability in reported affect: reported valence (i.e., how good or bad?) and reported arousal (e.g., how strong is the emotion you are feeling?). Still, existing theoretical approaches address the basic organization and measurement of these affective dimensions differently. Some approaches organize affect around the dimensions of bipolar valence and arousal (e.g., the circumplex model), whereas alternative approaches organize affect around the dimensions of unipolar positivity and unipolar negativity (e.g., the bivariate evaluative model). In this report, we (a) replicate the data structure observed when collected according to the two approaches described above, and reinterpret these data to suggest that the relationship between each pair of affective dimensions is conditional on valence ambiguity, and (b) formalize this structure with a mathematical model depicting a valence ambiguity dimension that decreases in range as arousal decreases (a triangle). This model captures variability in affective ratings better than alternative approaches, increasing variance explained from ~60% to over 90% without adding parameters.","[{'authorId': '2257418', 'name': 'Alison Mattek'}, {'authorId': '1972046', 'name': 'G.

This experiment determines whether these nonverbal behaviors can be increased through message planning. Participants were randomly assigned to either a planning condition or a distraction task condition before recording emotional support messages for a friend hypothetically diagnosed with cancer. Results showed that planners spoke with significantly more vocal fluency and conveyed significantly more nonverbal concern than nonplanners. Planners also used more eye contact and pitch variety than nonplanners, but these differences were not statistically significant.

We provide, in addition, a geometric interpretation of the transitions between phases.

It has evolved in the context of parental care for offspring, as well as within kinship bonds, to help facilitate group living. In this paper, we integrate the perspectives of evolution, animal behaviour, developmental psychology, and social and clinical neuroscience to elucidate our understanding of the proximate mechanisms underlying empathy. We focus, in particular, on processing of signals of distress and need, and their relation to prosocial behaviour. The ability to empathize, both in animals and humans, mediates prosocial behaviour when sensitivity to others' distress is paired with a drive towards their welfare. Disruption or atypical development of the neural circuits that process distress cues and integrate them with decision value leads to callous disregard for others, as is the case in psychopathy. The realization that basic forms of empathy exist in non-human animals is crucial for gaining new insights into the underlying neurobiological and genetic mechanisms of empathy, enabling translation towards therapeutic and pharmacological interventions.","[{'authorId': '3235030', 'name': 'J.

During the past few years, systematic observations have showed that a primal form of empathy also exists in rodents, indicating that empathy has an evolutionary continuity. Now, using rodents exhibiting emotional empathy, the molecular and cellular study of empathy in animals has begun in earnest. In this article, we will review recent reports that indicate that rodents can share states of fear with others, and will try to highlight new understandings of the neural circuitry, biochemistry and genetics of empathic fear. We hope that the use of rodent models will enhance understanding of the mechanisms of human empathy and provide insights into how to treat social deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by empathy impairment.","[{'authorId': '117648449', 'name': 'A.

N = 56 participants watched video-clips of two operatic compositions performed in concerts, with low or high empathy instructions. Heart rate and heart rate variability, skin conductance level (SCL), and respiration rate (RR) were measured during music listening, and music-induced emotions were quantified using the Geneva Emotional Music Scale immediately after music listening. Listening to the aria with sad content in a high empathy condition facilitated the emotion of nostalgia and decreased SCL, in comparison to the low empathy condition. Listening to the song with happy content in a high empathy condition also facilitated the emotion of power and increased RR, in comparison to the low empathy condition. To our knowledge, this study offers the first experimental evidence that cognitive empathy influences emotion psychophysiology during music listening.","[{'authorId': '143981469', 'name': 'A.

Data were collected from 639 employees in six different companies. As predicted by COR theory, results suggest that high job insecurity is related to lower job satisfaction, more workplace accidents, and more health complaints. However, employees who perceived higher levels of positive organizational communication practices reported fewer negative consequences of job insecurity compared with employees who reported lower levels of organizational communication. Taken together, it is suggested organizations that make a greater effort to communicate with employees may effectively buffer the potentially negative consequences of job insecurity.","[{'authorId': '1737158', 'name': 'Lixin Jiang'}, {'authorId': '6446132', 'name': 'T.

Offering a scientifically informed perspective on canines and their relations with humans, the Coppingers take a close look at eight different types of dogs - household, village, livestock guarding, herding, sled-pulling, pointing, retrieving, and hound. They argue that dogs did not evolve directly from wolves, nor were they trained by early humans; instead, dogs domesticated themselves to exploit a new ecological niche: Mesolithic village dumps. Tracing the evolution of today's breeds from these village dogs, the Coppingers show how characteristic shapes and behaviors - from pointing and baying to the sleek shapes of running dogs - arise from both genetic heritage and the environments in which pups are raised. For both dogs and humans to get the most out of each other, we need to understand and adapt to the biological needs and dispositions of our canine companions, just as they have to ours.","[{'authorId': '88361883', 'name': 'L.

Yet, previous research has exclusively focused on the negative side of social comparison and envy on SNS. Thereby, it has neglected two important aspects: (a) comparison processes can also elicit a beneficial emotional reaction to other users' online self-presentations (i.e., benign envy) and, thus, (b) comparisons can be motivating, with positive outcomes for well-being. The present study aims at closing this research gap by investigating how social comparisons and envy on SNS are related to inspiration, a complex motivational state. Due to its specific characteristics of a creative and aesthetic visual culture, we focus our investigation on Instagram. A structural equation modeling mediation analysis with data from N = 385 Instagram users reveals that the intensity of social comparisons on Instagram was positively related to inspiration and that this relationship was fully mediated by benign envy. Furthermore, inspiration on Instagram was related to increased positive affect. Results of this study underline that to understand the effects of SNS on well-being, we also need to consider the positive motivational side of social comparison and envy.","[{'authorId': '32906609', 'name': 'Adrian Meier'}, {'authorId': '28870662', 'name': 'Svenja Schäfer'}]",122.0,,34.0,The Positive Side of Social Comparison on Social Network Sites: How Envy Can Drive Inspiration on Instagram,2018.0

While real- world observations of collective violence are difficult and rare, simulation models can help us to explore its evolution process. We propose an Agent-Based Emotion Contagion (ABEC) model that simulates the spread of group violence when the mechanism of contagious grievance is at work. The model is motivated by related social psychological theories of group behavior and is implemented by incorporating the epidemiological emotion contagion mechanism with crowd's game-theoretic behaviors with an agent-based approach. Our simulation model generates some crowd patterns, including local outbursts of collective violence with grievance contagion, dynamic spatial clustering of violent civilians and the nonlinear evolution of collective violence. We also explore the variations of violence evolution by varying some parameters of our model. Results show that the high-density crowds and the widespread of grievance promote violence outburst. These results suggest opportunities to curb collective violence through dispersing crowds and allaying the grievance.","[{'authorId': '1761143', 'name': 'Lida Huang'}, {'authorId': '34523959', 'name': 'Guoray Cai'}, {'authorId': '2605401', 'name': 'Hongyong Yuan'}, {'authorId': '2108311315', 'name': 'Jianguo Chen'}]",4.0,,18.0,From Public Gatherings to the Burst of Collective Violence: An Agent-based Emotion Contagion Model,2018.0

However, little is known about the consequences of emotional stress (ES) or physical stress (PS) on neurobiology. Therefore, the following set of experiments was designed to assess changes in transcription and translation of key proteins within the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Male adolescent (postnatal day 35) or adult (8-week-old) mice were exposed to ES or PS using a witness social defeat paradigm. Then, 24 h after the last stress session, we measured levels of specific mRNAs and proteins within the NAc. Spine density was also assessed in separate groups of mice. Exposure to ES or PS disrupted extracellular signal-related kinase 2 (ERK2), reduced transcription of ΔFosB and had no effect on cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) mRNA. Western blots revealed that exposure to ES or PS decreased ERK2 phosphorylation in adolescents, whereas the same stress regimen increased ERK2 phosphorylation in adults. Exposure to ES or PS had no effect on ΔFosB or CREB phosphorylation. ES and PS increased spine density in the NAc of adolescent exposed mice, but only exposure to PS increased spine density in adults. Together, these findings demonstrate that exposure to ES or PS is a potent stressor in adolescent and adult mice and can disturb the integrity of the NAc by altering transcription and translation of important signaling molecules in an age-dependent manner. Furthermore, exposure to ES and PS induces substantial synaptic plasticity of the NAc.","[{'authorId': '5223175', 'name': 'Brandon L Warren'}, {'authorId': '5596517', 'name': 'Omar K.

Contrary to expectation, the effect was independent of the similarity between the report arid the estimated risk. An account of a fatal stabbing did not increase the frequency estimate of a closely related risk, homicide, more than the estimates of unrelated risks such as natural hazards. An account of a happy event that created positive affect produced a comparable global decrease in judged frequency of risks. As a society, we have never been more concerned with the assessment, the management, and the regulation of risk. Because public reaction to hazards from pesticides, nuclear power, or food additives appears to influence the regulation and management of these technologies, it is important to understand how the lay person perceives and evaluates risks. This is particularly true for hazards such as terrorism, nuclear power, or genetic engineering for which the available statistical data are very limited and where the assessments of the risks are based on subjective and intuitive judgments. Indeed, psychologists and other researchers have shown increasing interest in the manner in which people perceive and estimate the severity of various risks. Lichtenstein, Slovic, Fischhoff, Layman, and Combs (1978) asked lay people to estimate the number of deaths per year that are due to various hazards.

The results suggest that diverse, seemingly unrelated judgmental phenomena--such as the vividness effect, the perseverance effect, and the negativity effect--can be explained through the accessibility-diagnosticity model.

The aim of the present systematic PRIMSA review was twofold: first, to see what evidence there is for the widely held belief that individuals with ASD are insensitive to pain or have a high pain threshold in the peer-reviewed literature and, second, to examine whether individuals with ASD react or express pain differently. Fifteen studies investigating pain in individuals with ASD were identified. The case studies all reported pain insensitivity in individuals with ASD. However, the majority of the ten experimental studies reviewed indicate that the idea that individuals with ASD are pain insensitive needs to be challenged. The findings also highlight the strong possibility that not all children with ASD express their physical discomfort in the same way as a neurotypical child would (i.e., cry, moan, seek comfort, etc.) which may lead caregivers and the medical profession to interpret this as pain insensitivity or incorrectly lead them to believe that the child is in no pain. These results have important implications for the assessment and management of pain in children with ASD.","[{'authorId': '48263975', 'name': 'C.

Integrating EC into the job demands-resource model, we develop and test a conceptual model wherein multiple stakeholder sources of emotional exchanges (i.e., leaders, colleagues, patients) play a differential role in predicting caregivers' absorption of positive (i.e., joy) and negative (i.e., anger) emotions, and in turn, burnout. We tested this nomological network using structural equation modeling and invariance analyses on a sample of 252 nurses and 102 doctors from diverse healthcare wards in three Italian hospitals. Our findings show that not all emotional exchange sources contribute to the EC experience or likelihood of burnout. Specifically, we found that doctors absorbed joy and anger from their colleagues but not from their leaders or patients. In contrast, nurses absorbed joy and anger from leaders, colleagues, and patients. Surprisingly, we found that joy-absorbed and anger-absorbed were related to doctors' exhaustion and cynicism, but only to nurses' cynicism. We conclude with suggestions for advancing research and practice in the management of emotions for preventing burnout.","[{'authorId': '15933656', 'name': 'Laura Petitta'}, {'authorId': '1737158', 'name': 'Lixin Jiang'}, {'authorId': '33423842', 'name': 'Charmine E J Härtel'}]",43.0,,46.0,Emotional contagion and burnout among nurses and doctors: Do joy and anger from different sources of stakeholders matter?,2017.0

In the past two years, live streams of video games, on sites such as Twitch.tv, have become very popular. Live streams serve as meeting grounds for player communities. The Twitch streaming medium combines broadcast video with open IRC chat channels. In conjunction with gameplay, viewer participation and community building gain emphasis. Twitch streams range in size and nature, from intimate communities with fifty viewers, to massive broadcasts with tens of thousands. In this paper, we present an ethnographic investigation of the live streaming of video games on Twitch. We find that Twitch streams act as virtual third places, in which informal communities emerge, socialize, and participate. Over time, stream communities form around shared identities drawn from streams? contents and participants? shared experiences. We describe processes through which stream communities form, the motivations of members, and emergent issues in the medium. Finally, we draw from our findings to derive implications for design of live mixed-media environments to support participatory online communities.","[{'authorId': '144296190', 'name': 'William A.

To fill these gaps we first conducted a pilot test of the PsyCap intervention (PCI) model with a randomized control group design. Next, we conducted a follow-up study with a cross section of practicing managers to determine if following the training guidelines of the PCI caused the participants' performance to improve. Results provide beginning empirical evidence that short training interventions such as PCI not only may be used to develop participants' psychological capital, but can also lead to an improvement in their on-the-job performance.

In this study, we were interested in testing whether specific brain activation—the asymmetry in engagement of the prefrontal cortex—would be related to consumer choice. Subjects saw products and subsequently decided how much they were willing to pay for each product, while undergoing neuroimaging using electroencephalography. Our results demonstrate that prefrontal asymmetry in the gamma frequency band, and a trend in the beta frequency band that was recorded during product viewing was significantly related to subsequent WTP responses. Frontal asymmetry in the alpha band was not related to WTP decisions. Besides suggesting separate neuropsychological mechanisms of consumer choice, we find that one specific measure—the prefrontal gamma asymmetry—was most strongly related to WTP responses, and was most coupled to the actual decision phase.

dbbf0ce922eafb598c7e28f68da443bcdceb9e97,"Significance To successfully and efficiently live in social groups, we need information about each other’s emotions. Emotional contagion has been suggested to facilitate such information transmission, yet it remains difficult to measure this in animals. Previous research has often focused on overt behavior but lacked additional methods for investigating emotional valence. This study provides a solution by integrating data on behavior and responses to a cognitive bias test, which is designed to infer a subject’s underlying emotional state. We demonstrate that after witnessing a conspecific in a negative state, ravens perform in a negatively biased manner on a judgment task. Our findings thus suggest negative emotional contagion in ravens, and in turn advance our understanding of the evolution of empathy. Emotional contagion is described as an emotional state matching between subjects, and has been suggested to facilitate communication and coordination in complex social groups. Empirical studies typically focus on the measurement of behavioral contagion and emotional arousal, yet, while highly important, such an approach often disregards an additional evaluation of the underlying emotional valence. Here, we studied emotional contagion in ravens by applying a judgment bias paradigm to assess emotional valence. We experimentally manipulated positive and negative affective states in demonstrator ravens, to which they responded with increased attention and interest in the positive condition, as well as increased redirected behavior and a left-eye lateralization in the negative condition. During this emotion manipulation, another raven observed the demonstrator’s behavior, and we used a bias paradigm to assess the emotional valence of the observer to determine whether emotional contagion had occurred. Observers showed a pessimism bias toward the presented ambiguous stimuli after perceiving demonstrators in a negative state, indicating emotional state matching based on the demonstrators’ behavioral cues and confirming our prediction of negative emotional contagion. We did not find any judgment bias in the positive condition. This result critically expands upon observational studies of contagious play in ravens, providing experimental evidence that emotional contagion is present not only in mammalian but also in avian species. Importantly, this finding also acts as a stepping stone toward understanding the evolution of empathy, as this essential social skill may have emerged across these taxa in response to similar socioecological challenges.","[{'authorId': '117783530', 'name': 'J.

Here we review evidence for the proposal from both ultimate and proximate perspectives. While we show that many of the proposed hypotheses for the evolutionary origin of great ape intelligence also apply to corvids, further study is needed to reveal the selective pressures that resulted in the evolution of intelligent behaviour in both corvids and apes. For comparative proximate analyses we emphasize the need to be explicit about the level of analysis to reveal the type of convergence that has taken place. Although there is evidence that corvids and apes solve social and physical problems with similar speed and flexibility, there is a great deal more to be learned about the representations and algorithms underpinning these computations in both groups.

dd1dbd4494eb82c97033b50e36ff1b2e17fdef7d,"Empathy is an essential component of our social lives, allowing us to understand and share other people's affective and sensory states, including pain. Evidence suggests a core neural network—including anterior insula (AI) and mid-cingulate cortex (MCC)—is involved in empathy for pain. However, a similar network is associated to empathy for non-pain affective states, raising the question whether empathy for pain is unique in its neural correlates. Furthermore, it is yet unclear whether neural correlates converge across different stimuli and paradigms that evoke pain-empathy. We performed a coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis to identify neural correlates of empathy, assess commonalities and differences between empathy for pain and for non-pain negative affective states, and differences between pain-empathy evoking stimuli (i.e., facial pain expressions vs. acute pain inflictions) and paradigms (i.e., perceptual/affective vs. cognitive/evaluative paradigms). Following a systematic search, data from 128 functional brain imaging studies presenting whole-brain results of an empathy condition vs. baseline/neutral condition were extracted. Synthesizing neural correlates of empathy confirmed a core network comprising AI, MCC, postcentral gyrus, inferior parietal lobe, thalamus, amygdala, and brainstem. There was considerable overlap in networks for empathy for pain and empathy for non-pain negative affective states. Important differences also arose: empathy for pain uniquely activated bilateral mid-insula and more extensive MCC. Regarding stimuli, painful faces and acute pain inflictions both evoked the core empathy regions, although acute pain inflictions activated additional regions including medial frontal and parietal cortex. Regarding paradigms, both perceptual/affective and cognitive/evaluative paradigms recruited similar neural circuitry, although cognitive/evaluative paradigms activated more left MCC regions while perceptual/affective paradigms activated more right AI. Taken together, our findings reveal that empathy for pain and empathy for non-pain negative affective states share considerable neural correlates, particularly in core empathy regions AI and MCC. Beyond these regions, important differences emerged, limiting generalizability of findings across different affective/sensory states. Within pain-empathy studies, the core regions were recruited robustly irrespective of stimuli or instructions, allowing one to tailor designs according to specific needs to some extent, while ensuring activation of core regions.","[{'authorId': '4791548', 'name': 'I.

This review addresses these questions from the perspective of embodied simulation: observing the actions and tactile sensations of others activates premotor, posterior parietal and somatosensory regions in the brain of the observer which are also active when performing similar movements and feeling similar sensations. We will show that seeing the emotions of others also recruits regions involved in experiencing similar emotions, although there does not seem to be a reliable mapping of particular emotions onto particular brain regions. Instead, emotion simulation seems to involve a mosaic of affective, motor and somatosensory components. The relative contributions of these components to a particular emotion and their interrelationship are largely unknown, although recent experimental evidence suggests that motor simulation may be a trigger for the simulation of associated feeling states. This mosaic of simulations may be necessary for generating the compelling insights we have into the feelings of others. Through their integration with, and modulation by, higher cognitive functions, they could be at the core of important social functions, including empathy, mind reading and social learning.","[{'authorId': '144239878', 'name': 'J.

This facilitation is made possible through changing the reward value of social stimuli; for example, we like and affiliate more with people who mimic us. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are marked by difficulties in forming social bonds. In this study, we investigate whether the reward‐related neural response to being mimicked is altered in individuals with ASD, using a simple conditioning paradigm. Multiple studies in humans and nonhuman primates have established a crucial role for the ventral striatal (VS) region in responding to rewards. In this study, adults with ASD and matched controls first underwent a conditioning task outside the scanner, where they were mimicked by one face and ‘anti‐mimicked’ by another. In the second part, participants passively viewed the conditioned faces in a 3T MRI scanner using a multi‐echo sequence. The differential neural response towards mimicking vs. anti‐mimicking faces in the VS was tested for group differences as well as an association with self‐reported autistic traits. Multiple regression analysis revealed lower left VS response to mimicry (mimicking > anti‐mimicking faces) in the ASD group compared to controls. The VS response to mimicry was negatively correlated with autistic traits across the whole sample. Our results suggest that for individuals with ASD and high autistic traits, being mimicked is associated with lower reward‐related neural response. This result points to a potential mechanism underlying the difficulties reported by many of individuals with ASD in building social rapport.","[{'authorId': '145465270', 'name': 'Chun-Ting Hsu'}, {'authorId': '50377075', 'name': 'J.

Mu opioid receptors (MORs), which are located in parvalbumin (PARV)‐containing GABAergic interneurons and are trafficked in response to changes in the hormonal environment, play a critical role in promoting principal cell excitability and long‐term potentiation. Here, we compared the effects of acute and chronic immobilization stress (AIS and CIS) on MOR trafficking in PARV‐containing neurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus in female and male rats using dual label immunoelectron microscopy. Following AIS, the density of MOR silver‐intensified gold particles (SIGs) in the cytoplasm of PARV‐labeled dendrites was significantly reduced in females (estrus stage). Conversely, AIS significantly increased the proportion of cytoplasmic MOR SIGs in PARV‐labeled dendrites in male rats. CIS significantly reduced the number of PARV‐labeled neurons in the dentate hilus of males but not females. However, MOR/PARV‐labeled dendrites and terminals were significantly smaller in CIS females, but not males, compared with controls. Following CIS, the density of cytoplasmic MOR SIGs increased in PARV‐labeled dendrites and terminals in females. Moreover, the proportion of near‐plasmalemmal MOR SIGs relative to total decreased in large PARV‐labeled dendrites in females. After CIS, no changes in the density or trafficking of MOR SIGs were seen in PARV‐labeled dendrites or terminals in males. These data show that AIS and CIS differentially affect available MOR pools in PARV‐containing interneurons in female and male rats. Furthermore, they suggest that CIS could affect principal cell excitability in a manner that maintains learning processes in females but not males.

With newspapers going online and television becoming increasingly digital, the current generation of youth has little reason to consume analog media. Music, movies, and all other forms of mass-mediated content can be obtained via a wide array of digital devices, ranging from CDs to DVDs, from iPods to PDAs. Even their nonmedia experiences are often characterized by a reliance on digital devices. Most young people communicate with most of their acquaintances through cell phones and computer-mediated communication tools such as instant messengers and e-mail systems. 1 And, with the arrival of personal broadcasting technologies such as blogs and social networking sites, many youngsters experience the world through their own self-expression and the expressions of their peers. This serves to blur the traditional boundary between interpersonal and mass communication, leading to an idiosyncratic construction of one's media world. Customization in the digital age—be it in the form of Web sites such as cus-tomizable portals that allow users to shape content or devices such as iPods that allow for customized playlists—enables the user to serve as the gatekeeper of content. As media get highly interactive, multimodal, and navigable, the receiver tends to become the source of communication. 2 While this leads naturally to egocentric construals of one's information environment, it also raises questions about the veracity of all the material that is consumed. The ease of digital publishing has made authors out of us all, leading to a dramatic profusion of information available for personal as well as public consumption. Much of this information, however, is free-floating and does not follow any universally accepted gatekeeping standards, let alone a professional process of writing and editing. Therefore, the veridicality of information accessed on the Web and other digital media is often suspect. 3 This makes credibility a supremely key concern in the new media environment, necessitating the constant need to critically assess information while consuming it. Credibility is classically ascertained by considering the source of information. If the attributed source of a piece of information is a credible person or organization, then, according to conventional wisdom, that information is probably reliable. However, in Internet-based media, source is a murky entity because there are often multiple layers of sources in online transmission of information (e.g., e-mail from a friend giving you a piece of information that he or she found on a newsgroup, posted …","[{'authorId': '47493614', 'name': 'S.

To address this question, I draw on research on the interpersonal effects of emotions on behavior in personal relationships, parent–child interactions, conflict, negotiation, and leadership, and propose a new framework that can account for existing findings and guide future research: the emotions as social information (EASI) model. I demonstrate that emotional expressions affect observers' behavior by triggering inferential processes and/or affective reactions in them. The predictive strength of these two processes—which may inspire different behaviors—depends on the observer's information processing and on social-relational factors. Examples of moderators that determine the relative predictive strength of inferences and affective reactions include power, need for cognitive closure, time pressure, display rules, and the appropriateness and target of the emotional expression, which are all discussed.","[{'authorId': '5980688', 'name': 'Gerben A. van Kleef'}]",995.0,,25.0,How Emotions Regulate Social Life,2009.0

The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of job crafting behaviors in predicting work-family enrichment. It is hypothesized that employees who are able to adjust their work environment proactively by increasing structural and social job resources, increasing challenging job demands and decreasing hindering job demands would be more engaged and experience work-family enrichment. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
The sample for the study consisted of 496 employees working in diverse nature of organizations in India. Structural equation modeling with the help of SPSS AMOS 20 was used for testing the study hypotheses. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The results reveal a strong relationship between job crafting and work-family enrichment experiences among employees. The study also established the role of work engagement as a mediator of the relationship between job crafting and work-family enrichment. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
 
The study significantly advances the underdeveloped literature on work-family enrichment by establishing job crafting as a predictor and illuminating the underlying psychological processes in a non-western collectivist culture. The study also contributes to theory building around the construct of job crafting which is still in its infancy.

Preadolescent boys viewed a film in which a male model was portrayed as being either similar or dissimilar to S in terms of background and interests. The model being observed received either reward, punishment, or no consequences for performing a series of instrumental actions. High perceived similarity to the model resulted in greater imitation than low perceived similarity. High perceived similarity to the model appeared to facilitate acquisition of imitative responses as well as performance. The effects of response consequences to the model on imitation were not as widely generalized as the effects of perceived similarity. Previous research has shown that one determinant of matching behavior is the degree to which the subject perceives himself as similar to the model. It has been hypothesized, for example, that the perception of similarities existing between persons leads to perceiving or creating still further similarities. Stotland and his associates have tested this hypothesis using several different procedures. Stotland and Patchen (1961) found that perceived similarity to a model in background and personal characteristics produced a shift in attitudes of prejudice and authoritarianism toward those of the model. In a similar study (Burnstein, Stotland, & Zander, 1961), it was found that sixth-, seventh-, and eighthgrade boys adopted more of the sea-diving preferences of a deep-sea diver portrayed as being similar to them in background and other characteristics than of a deep-sea diver described as dissimilar.

The fragmentary nature of privacy policy in the United States reflects not only the oppositional pulls of diverse vested interests, but also the ambivalence of unsettled intuitions on mundane phenomena such as shopper cards, closed-circuit television, and biometrics. This Article, which extends earlier work on the problem of privacy in public, explains why some of the prominent theoretical approaches to privacy, which were developed over time to meet traditional privacy challenges, yield unsatisfactory conclusions in the case of public surveillance. It posits a new construct, “contextual integrity,” as an alternative benchmark for privacy, to capture the nature of challenges posed by information technologies. Contextual integrity ties adequate protection for privacy to norms of specific contexts, demanding that information gathering and dissemination be appropriate to that context and obey the governing norms of distribution within it. Building on the idea of “spheres of justice,” developed by political philosopher Michael Walzer, this Article argues that public surveillance violates a right to privacy because it violates contextual integrity; as such, it constitutes injustice and even tyranny.","[{'authorId': '2994505', 'name': 'H.

Standard methods to study emotions in interpersonal interaction are limited because stationarity is assumed. This means that the dynamics, for example, time-lagged relations, are invariant across time periods. However, this is generally an unrealistic assumption. Whether caused by an external (e.g., divorce) or an internal (e.g., rumination) event, emotion dynamics are prone to change. The semi-parametric time-varying vector-autoregressive (TV-VAR) model is based on well-studied generalized additive models, implemented in the software R. The TV-VAR can explicitly model changes in temporal dependency without pre-existing knowledge about the nature of change. A simulation study is presented, showing that the TV-VAR model is superior to the standard time-invariant VAR model when the dynamics change over time. The TV-VAR model is applied to empirical data on daily feelings of positive affect (PA) from a single couple. Our analyses indicate reliable changes in the male’s emotion dynamics over time, but not in the female’s—which were not predicted by her own affect or that of her partner. This application illustrates the usefulness of using a TV-VAR model to detect changes in the dynamics in a system.","[{'authorId': '1935592', 'name': 'L.

Participants were shown faces at fixation that concurrently displayed dynamic gaze shifts and expression changes from neutral to fearful or happy emotions. Emotionally-salient target objects subsequently appeared in the periphery and were spatially congruent or incongruent with the gaze direction. ERPs were time-locked to target presentation. Three sequential ERP components were modulated by happy emotion, indicating a progression from an expression effect to a gaze-by-expression interaction to a target emotion effect. These effects included larger P1 amplitude over contralateral occipital sites for targets following happy faces, larger centrally distributed N1 amplitude for targets following happy faces with leftward gaze, and faster P3 latency for positive targets. In addition, parietally distributed P3 amplitude was reduced for validly cued targets following fearful expressions. Results are consistent with accounts of attentional broadening and motivational approach by happy emotion, and facilitation of spatially directed attention in the presence of fearful cues. The findings have implications for understanding how socioemotional signals in faces interact with each other and with emotional features of objects in the environment to alter attentional processes.","[{'authorId': '3029555', 'name': 'H.

An online survey received 1,000 usable responses from Hong Kong residents to validate this construct in a nomological network. The results not only indicate the reliability and validity of the refined scales, but also provide support for resident sentiment as a better indicator of residents’ behavioral responses than attitude.

 How does sentiment flow through hyperlink networks? Earlier work on hyperlink networks has focused on the structure of the network, often modeling posts as nodes in a directed graph in which edges represent hyperlinks. At the same time, sentiment analysis has largely focused on classifying texts in isolation. Here we analyze a large hyperlinked network of mass media and weblog posts to determine how sentiment features of a post affect the sentiment of connected posts and the structure of the network itself. We explore the phenomena of sentiment flow through experiments on a graph containing nearly 8 million nodes and 15 million edges. Our analysis indicates that (1) nodes are strongly influenced by their immediate neighbors, (2) deep cascades lead complex but predictable lives, (3) shallow cascades tend to be objective, and (4) sentiment becomes more polarized as depth increases.

We do without such annotations by using label propagation to incorporate labels from a maximum entropy classifier trained on noisy labels and knowledge about word types encoded in a lexicon, in combination with the Twitter follower graph.

We tested whether the sight of a distressed conspecific elicited fear in zebrafish, and whether this was modulated by familiarity. Groups of six zebrafish were housed together in the same tanks for 7 days to create familiar conditions. The behaviour of individual fish was then recorded in paired tanks within sight of either a familiar or an unfamiliar individual, before and after distilled water or an alarm substance was added to the demonstrator, but not to the observer. As expected, addition of distilled water did not elicit any behavioural change in either the demonstrator or the observer. However, addition of an alarm cue triggered anti-predatory behaviours in the demonstrator which caused the expression of anti-predatory behaviours in the observer, suggesting the existence of fear contagion. Furthermore, the extent of fear contagion was affected by familiarity, and observers were more active, swam closer to the bottom and further away from the demonstrator when they watched a distressed familiar neighbour than when they watched an unfamiliar fish. Our results have implications for fish welfare because they show that fish can become stressed by simply watching others become stressed. They also have implications for experimental design because fish housed in separate tanks cannot be assumed to be statistically independent if they can eavesdrop on their neighbours.","[{'authorId': '118389015', 'name': 'P.

In order to test the internal consistency reliability, the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was used and was found satisfactory at 0.72. The sample was randomly split and an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted in the even subsample, justifying the one-factor solution, with the only discrepancy of the low loading of an item. In the odd subsample a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to confirm the one-factor model identified by the EFA. The chi square test (χ2) of the model was significant (p < 0.05), while the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), the comparative fit index (CFI) and the goodness of fit index (GFI) values were 0.078, 0.969 and 0.960, respectively, further supporting the model’s fit. Student’s t-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that women, teachers with children of their own, those working full-time in public schools, those with students who needed special education, and those who had received mental health promotion training, scored higher. Additionally, multiple linear regression analysis revealed that sex, working status, having students who needed special education, and having attended mental health training courses were independently associated with TEQ score. The analyses confirmed that the Greek version of TEQ could be used for researches in Greek educators as a valid and reliable measure of teachers’ empathy.","[{'authorId': '5481819', 'name': 'N.

Our type-and-effect system is structured as an arrow metalanguage that exposes creation and erasure of information as explicit effect operations.

Since December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.


METHODS
We extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.


RESULTS
The median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female. The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died. Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife. Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city. The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%). Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%). The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%). No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease. Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.


CONCLUSIONS
During the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness. Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings. (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.).","[{'authorId': '40527353', 'name': 'W.

Yet, hardly anything is known about the role of different connections in observation and learning. To address the relationships between social connections, observation and learning, we investigated transmission of information in two raven (Corvus corax) groups. First, we quantified social connections in each group by constructing networks on affiliative interactions, aggressive interactions and proximity. We then seeded novel information by training one group member on a novel task and allowing others to observe. In each group, an observation network based on who observed whose task-solving behaviour was strongly correlated with networks based on affiliative interactions and proximity. Ravens with high social centrality (strength, eigenvector, information centrality) in the affiliative interaction network were also central in the observation network, possibly as a result of solving the task sooner. Network-based diffusion analysis revealed that the order that ravens first solved the task was best predicted by connections in the affiliative interaction network in a group of subadult ravens, and by social rank and kinship (which influenced affiliative interactions) in a group of juvenile ravens. Our results demonstrate that not all social connections are equally effective at predicting the patterns of selective observation and information transmission.","[{'authorId': '4056732', 'name': 'I.

e22bf1f2d2d5b6f78a1bf9a16825584b2418541a,"PURPOSE
To determine the factors associated with the clinical competence of registered nurses.


METHODS
Systematic review and meta-analysis was used. The search strategy was limited to 10 years, ranging from January 2009 to December 2019, in Science Direct, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, ProQuest, and Google Scholar. A meta-analysis was performed using R Studio with the metafor package (Boston, MA, USA; https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/older-versions/).


RESULTS
A total of 22 studies were included, representing 33,961 nurses. There were 28 factors associated with clinical competence. Of those, 13 factors were significantly supported and included for meta-analysis, grouped into (a) individual-related factors, (b) job satisfaction, (c) bullying, (d) burnout, and (d) specific knowledge. The effect size of those factors ranged from -0.14 to 0.50.


CONCLUSIONS
Among individual-related factors, salary has the largest effect size on competence and is considered important. Clinical competence is positively affected by job satisfaction, but negatively influenced by bullying and burnout. Although specific knowledge has a large effect size, it does not significantly affect the clinical competence of registered nurses.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
It is critical to understand factors related to the clinical competence of registered nurses to maintain quality care and patient outcomes in clinical settings.

e22f472e8e23bdb8ee755f888eb1267653813fce,"Prevalence estimates for fragile X syndrome vary considerably. This systematic review and meta‐analysis was conducted to provide an accurate prevalence estimate for this disorder using primary publications in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library. Data were pooled using Bayesian fixed‐effects and random‐effects models. Primary analyses assessed the frequency of the full mutation and premutation in males and females in the total population (no bias against individuals with intellectual disability) and in female carriers of the premutation in normal populations (biased against individuals with intellectual disability), based on diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction or Southern blotting. A sensitivity analysis included studies using any diagnostic testing method and conference abstracts. Sixty‐eight recorded observations provided data for the primary (56 observations) and sensitivity (12 observations) analysis. Using the random‐effects model, frequency of the full mutation was 1.4 (95% CI: 0.1–3.1) per 10,000 males and 0.9 (95% CI: 0.0–2.9) per 10,000 females (1:7,143 and 1:11,111, respectively) in the total population. The premutation frequency was 11.7 (95% CI: 6.0–18.7) per 10,000 males and 34.4 (95% CI: 6.3–83.3) per 10,000 for females (1:855 and 1:291, respectively) in the total population. The prevalence of female carriers of the premutation in the normal population was 34.4 (95% CI: 8.9–60.3) per 10,000, or 1:291. Sensitivity analyses resulted in similar prevalence estimates but with wider heterogeneity. Prevalence estimates for the full mutation from this meta‐analysis are lower than those in previous reviews of fragile X syndrome epidemiological data. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","[{'authorId': '5555680', 'name': 'J.

Also, up to now, no research has investigated the direct effect of expertise on loyalty and the moderating effect of expertise on the link between satisfaction and loyalty. This paper seeks to fill these gaps in the literature and to investigate the effects of individual dimensions of service quality in creating and enhancing customer loyalty via customer satisfaction. It also aims to investigate the direct and indirect effects of customer expertise on customer loyalty.Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses a causal modelling approach and proposes a conceptual model after an extensive review of the literature. The paper is based on a sample of 200 bank users in Greece who completed a self‐administered questionnaire.

e27778775d438fa279ac23c94df41dce671df611,"Deficits in empathy have been proposed to constitute a hallmark of several psychiatric disturbances like conduct disorder, antisocial and narcissistic personality disorders. Limited sensitivity to punishment, shallow or deficient affect and reduced physiological reactivity to environmental stressors have been often reported to co-occur with limited empathy and contribute to the onset of antisocial phenotypes. Empathy in its simplest form (i.e. emotional contagion) is addressed in preclinical models through the evaluation of the social transmission of emotional states: mice exposed to a painful stimulus display a higher response if in the presence of a familiar individual experiencing a higher degree of discomfort, than in isolation. In the present study, we investigated whether a reduction of emotional contagion can be considered a predictor of reduced sociality, sensitivity to punishment and physiological stress reactivity. To this aim, we first evaluated emotional contagion in a group of Balb/cJ mice and then discretised their values in four quartiles. The upper (i.e. Emotional Contagion Prone, ECP) and the lower (i.e. Emotional Contagion Resistant, ECR) quartiles constituted the experimental groups. Our results indicate that mice in the lower quartile are characterized by reduced sociability, impaired memory of negative events and dampened hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical reactivity to external stressors. Furthermore, in the absence of changes in oxytocin receptor density, we show that these mice exhibit elevated concentrations of oxytocin and vasopressin and reduced density of BDNF receptors in behaviourally-relevant brain areas. Thus, not only do present results translate to the preclinical investigation of psychiatric disturbances, but also they can contribute to the study of emotional contagion in terms of its adaptive significance.","[{'authorId': '1837749', 'name': 'G.

The system is based on a supervised statistical text classification approach leveraging a variety of surface-form, semantic, and sentiment features. The sentiment features are primarily derived from novel high-coverage tweet-specific sentiment lexicons. These lexicons are automatically generated from tweets with sentiment-word hashtags and from tweets with emoticons. To adequately capture the sentiment of words in negated contexts, a separate sentiment lexicon is generated for negated words. 
 
The system ranked first in the SemEval-2013 shared task 'Sentiment Analysis in Twitter' (Task 2), obtaining an F-score of 69.02 in the message-level task and 88.93 in the term-level task. Post-competition improvements boost the performance to an F-score of 70.45 (message-level task) and 89.50 (term-level task). The system also obtains state-of-the-art performance on two additional datasets: the SemEval-2013 SMS test set and a corpus of movie review excerpts. The ablation experiments demonstrate that the use of the automatically generated lexicons results in performance gains of up to 6.5 absolute percentage points.","[{'authorId': '2886725', 'name': 'Svetlana Kiritchenko'}, {'authorId': '1854999', 'name': 'Xiao-Dan Zhu'}, {'authorId': '143880621', 'name': 'Saif M.

e2ba528a606f693e2655d9c990145b84eb80f9aa,"This essay proposes an emotion-management perspective as a lens through which to inspect the self, interaction, and structure. Emotion, it is argued, can be and ofter is subject to acts of management. The individual often works on inducing or inhibiting feelings so as to render them ""appropriate"" to a situation. The emotion-management perspective draws on an interactive account of emotion. It differs from the dramaturgical perspective on the one hand and the psychoanalytic perspective on the other. It allows us to inspect at closer range than either of those perspectives the relation among emotive experience, emotion management, feeling rules, and ideology. Feeling rules are seen as the side of ideology that deals with emotion and feeling. Emotion management is the type of work it takes to cope with feeling rules. Meaning-making jobs, more common in the middle class, put more premium on the individual's capacity to do emotion work. A reexamination of class differences in child rearing suggest that middle-class families prepare their children for emotion management more and working-class families prepare them less. In this way each prepares its children to psychologically reproduce the class structure.","[{'authorId': '65887305', 'name': 'A.

e2c0fd58addff3cf1b0cba6288b01ee3c1a9c82f,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are complex heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders of an unclear etiology, and no cure currently exists. Prior studies have demonstrated that the black and tan, brachyury (BTBR) T+ Itpr3tf/J mouse strain displays a behavioral phenotype with ASD-like features. BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J mice (referred to simply as BTBR) display deficits in social functioning, lack of communication ability, and engagement in stereotyped behavior. Despite extensive behavioral phenotypic characterization, little is known about the genes and proteins responsible for the presentation of the ASD-like phenotype in the BTBR mouse model. In this study, we employed bioinformatics techniques to gain a wide-scale understanding of the transcriptomic and proteomic changes associated with the ASD-like phenotype in BTBR mice. We found a number of genes and proteins to be significantly altered in BTBR mice compared to C57BL/6J (B6) control mice controls such as BDNF, Shank3, and ERK1, which are highly relevant to prior investigations of ASD. Furthermore, we identified distinct functional pathways altered in BTBR mice compared to B6 controls that have been previously shown to be altered in both mouse models of ASD, some human clinical populations, and have been suggested as a possible etiological mechanism of ASD, including “axon guidance” and “regulation of actin cytoskeleton.” In addition, our wide-scale bioinformatics approach also discovered several previously unidentified genes and proteins associated with the ASD phenotype in BTBR mice, such as Caskin1, suggesting that bioinformatics could be an avenue by which novel therapeutic targets for ASD are uncovered. As a result, we believe that informed use of synergistic bioinformatics applications represents an invaluable tool for elucidating the etiology of complex disorders like ASD.","[{'authorId': '5835633', 'name': 'Caitlin M Daimon'}, {'authorId': '5964772', 'name': 'J.

As we are in the midst of an ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, scientists are struggling to understand how it resembles and differs from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) at the genomic and transcriptomic level. In a short time following the outbreak, it has been shown that, similar to SARS-CoV, COVID-19 virus exploits the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry inside the cells. This finding raises the curiosity of investigating the expression of ACE2 in neurological tissue and determining the possible contribution of neurological tissue damage to the morbidity and mortality caused by COIVD-19. Here, we investigate the density of the expression levels of ACE2 in the CNS, the host–virus interaction and relate it to the pathogenesis and complications seen in the recent cases resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak.

In particular, it is assumed that social behavior is controlled by 2 interacting systems that follow different operating principles. The reflective system generates behavioral decisions that are based on knowledge about facts and values, whereas the impulsive system elicits behavior through associative links and motivational orientations. The proposed model describes how the 2 systems interact at various stages of processing, and how their outputs may determine behavior in a synergistic or antagonistic fashion. It extends previous models by integrating motivational components that allow more precise predictions of behavior. The implications of this reflective-impulsive model are applied to various phenomena from social psychology and beyond. Extending previous dual-process accounts, this model is not limited to specific domains of mental functioning and attempts to integrate cognitive, motivational, and behavioral mechanisms.","[{'authorId': '4574442', 'name': 'F.

e3cf090e9ab06846bf7b0581ccd71fa1d7e570dc,"ABSTRACT This article reflects the kinds of situations and spaces where people and algorithms meet. In what situations do people become aware of algorithms? How do they experience and make sense of these algorithms, given their often hidden and invisible nature? To what extent does an awareness of algorithms affect people's use of these platforms, if at all? To help answer these questions, this article examines people's personal stories about the Facebook algorithm through tweets and interviews with 25 ordinary users. To understand the spaces where people and algorithms meet, this article develops the notion of the algorithmic imaginary. It is argued that the algorithmic imaginary – ways of thinking about what algorithms are, what they should be and how they function – is not just productive of different moods and sensations but plays a generative role in moulding the Facebook algorithm itself. Examining how algorithms make people feel, then, seems crucial if we want to understand their social power.","[{'authorId': '38516982', 'name': 'Taina Bucher'}]",551.0,,37.0,The algorithmic imaginary: exploring the ordinary affects of Facebook algorithms,2017.0

Through a prosodic analysis of the acoustic signal, we perform an analysis for stress and pitch, relate it to the spoken words and identify the agitation state.

Based on these analyses, the system generates facial expressions and behaviors including head movements, eye saccades, gestures, blinks and gazes. Our technique is able to synthesize the performance and generate novel gesture animations based on coarticulation with other closely scheduled animations. Because our method utilizes semantics in addition to prosody, we are able to generate virtual character performances that are more appropriate than methods that use only prosody.

Although fish schools have been traditionally considered egalitarian superorganisms, a number of empirical observations suggest the emergence of leadership in gregarious groups. Detecting and classifying leader-follower relationships is central to elucidate the behavioral and physiological causes of leadership and understand its consequences. Here, we demonstrate an information-theoretic approach to infer leadership from positional data of fish swimming. In this framework, we measure social interactions between fish pairs through the mathematical construct of transfer entropy, which quantifies the predictive power of a time series to anticipate another, possibly coupled, time series. We focus on the zebrafish model organism, which is rapidly emerging as a species of choice in preclinical research for its genetic similarity to humans and reduced neurobiological complexity with respect to mammals. To overcome experimental confounds and generate test data sets on which we can thoroughly assess our approach, we adapt and calibrate a data-driven stochastic model of zebrafish motion for the simulation of a coupled dynamical system of zebrafish pairs. In this synthetic data set, the extent and direction of the coupling between the fish are systematically varied across a wide parameter range to demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of transfer entropy in inferring leadership. Our approach is expected to aid in the analysis of collective behavior, providing a data-driven perspective to understand social interactions.","[{'authorId': '3245894', 'name': 'S.

They provide interlocutors with resources to express and interpret verbal messages, which may affect their cognitive and emotional processing. Contrarily, computer-mediated communication (CMC), particularly text-based communication, is limited to the use of symbols to convey a message, where facial expressions cannot be transmitted naturally. In this scenario, people use emoticons as paralinguistic cues to convey emotional meaning. Research has shown that emoticons contribute to a greater social presence as a result of the enrichment of text-based communication channels. Additionally, emoticons constitute a valuable resource for language comprehension by providing expressivity to text messages. The latter findings have been supported by studies in neuroscience showing that particular brain regions involved in emotional processing are also activated when people are exposed to emoticons. To reach an integrated understanding of the influence of emoticons in human communication on both socio-cognitive and neural levels, we review the literature on emoticons in three different areas. First, we present relevant literature on emoticons in CMC. Second, we study the influence of emoticons in language comprehension. Finally, we show the incipient research in neuroscience on this topic. This mini review reveals that, while there are plenty of studies on the influence of emoticons in communication from a social psychology perspective, little is known about the neurocognitive basis of the effects of emoticons on communication dynamics.","[{'authorId': '6786243', 'name': 'N.

Recognition of individual faces is an integral part of both interpersonal interactions and successful functioning within a social group. Therefore, it is of considerable interest that individuals with autism and related conditions have selective deficits in face recognition (sparing nonface object recognition).


METHOD
We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study face and subordinate-level object perception in 14 high-functioning individuals with autism or Asperger syndrome (the autism group), in comparison with 2 groups of matched normal controls (normal control group ] [NC1] and normal control group 2 [NC2]) (n = 14 for each). Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined in NC1 and then applied in comparisons between NC2 and the autism group. Regions of interest were also defined in NC2 and then applied to comparisons between NC1 and the autism group as a replication study.


RESULTS
In the first set of comparisons, we found significant task x group interactions for the size of activation in the right fusiform gyrus (FG) and right inferior temporal gyri (ITG). Post hoc analyses showed that during face (but not object) discrimination, the autism group had significantly greater activation than controls in the right ITG and less activation of the right FG. The replication study showed again that the autism group used the ITG significantly more for processing faces than the control groups, but for these analyses, the effect was now on the left side. Greater ITG activation was the pattern found in both control groups during object processing.


CONCLUSIONS
Individuals with autism spectrum disorders demonstrate a pattern of brain activity during face discrimination that is consistent with feature-based strategies that are more typical of nonface object perception.","[{'authorId': '2173014644', 'name': 'Robert T.

However, the cellular and physiological consequences of these mutations in neurons remain unknown. We have analyzed the functional impact caused by two inherited and one de novo SHANK2 mutations from ASD individuals (L1008_P1009dup, T1127M, R462X). Although all three variants affect spine volume and have smaller SHANK2 cluster sizes, T1127M additionally fails to rescue spine volume in Shank2 knock-down neurons. R462X is not able to rescue spine volume and dendritic branching and lacks postsynaptic clustering, indicating the most severe dysfunction. To demonstrate that R462X when expressed in mouse can be linked to physiological effects, we analyzed synaptic transmission and behavior. Principal neurons of mice expressing rAAV-transduced SHANK2-R462X present a specific, long-lasting reduction in miniature postsynaptic AMPA receptor currents. This dominant negative effect translates into dose-dependent altered cognitive behavior of SHANK2-R462X-expressing mice, with an impact on the penetrance of ASD.","[{'authorId': '2321993', 'name': 'S.

While behavioural responses to the spread of a disease have often been reported anecdotally, there has been relatively little systematic investigation into how behavioural changes can affect disease dynamics. Mathematical models for the spread of infectious diseases are an important tool for investigating and quantifying such effects, not least because the spread of a disease among humans is not amenable to direct experimental study. Here, we review recent efforts to incorporate human behaviour into disease models, and propose that such models can be broadly classified according to the type and source of information which individuals are assumed to base their behaviour on, and according to the assumed effects of such behaviour. We highlight recent advances as well as gaps in our understanding of the interplay between infectious disease dynamics and human behaviour, and suggest what kind of data taking efforts would be helpful in filling these gaps.","[{'authorId': '2262177', 'name': 'S.

For return-benefits to play a motivational role, however, they need to be experienced by the organism. Motivational analyses should restrict themselves, therefore, to the altruistic impulse and its knowable consequences. Empathy is an ideal candidate mechanism to underlie so-called directed altruism, i.e., altruism in response to anothers's pain, need, or distress. Evidence is accumulating that this mechanism is phylogenetically ancient, probably as old as mammals and birds. Perception of the emotional state of another automatically activates shared representations causing a matching emotional state in the observer. With increasing cognition, state-matching evolved into more complex forms, including concern for the other and perspective-taking. Empathy-induced altruism derives its strength from the emotional stake it offers the self in the other's welfare.

The authors show that if there are reasonable nonzero priors for expected coefficients, then these can be used to generate more statistically efficient choice designs, because the alternatives in their choice sets are balanced in utility—they have more similar choice probabilities. The authors demonstrate that the appropriate measure of choice design efficiency requires probability centering and weighting of the rows of the design matrix, and they illustrate how this criterion enables the analyst to appropriately trade off utility balance against three other principles: orthogonality, level balance, and minimal overlap. Two methods, swapping and relabeling attribute levels, provide complementary ways to increase the utility balance of choice designs. The authors apply a process for generating utility-balanced designs to five different choice designs and show that it reduces by 10–50% the number of respondents needed to achieve a specific error level around the parameters. A sensitivity analysis reveals that these gains are diminished, but still substantial, despite strong misspecifications of prior parameter estimates.","[{'authorId': '47688333', 'name': 'Joel Huber'}, {'authorId': '69545445', 'name': 'Klaus Zwerina'}]",1110.0,,20.0,The Importance of Utility Balance in Efficient Choice Designs,1996.0

 Social media is continually emerging as a platform of information exchange around health challenges. We study mental health discourse on the popular social media:reddit. Building on findings about health information seeking and sharing practices in online forums, and social media like Twitter, we address three research challenges. First, we present a characterization of self-disclosure inmental illness communities on reddit. We observe individuals discussing a variety of concerns ranging from the daily grind to specific queries about diagnosis and treatment. Second, we build a statistical model to examine the factors that drive social support on mental health reddit communities. We also develop language models to characterize mental health social support, which are observed to bear emotional, informational, instrumental, and prescriptive information. Finally, we study disinhibition in the light of the dissociative anonymity that reddit’s throwaway accounts provide. Apart from promoting open conversations,such anonymity surprisingly is found to gather feedback that is more involving and emotionally engaging. Our findings reveal, for the first time, the kind of unique information needs that a social media like reddit might be fulfilling when it comes to a stigmatic illness. They also expand our understanding of the role of the social web in behavioral therapy.

In 26 the current study, we aimed to examine the flow and content of tweets, exploring the role of 27 COVID-19 key events on the popular Twitter platform. 28 Methods : Using representative freely available data, we performed a focused, social media-based 29 analysis to capture COVID-19 discussions on Twitter, considering sentiment and longitudinal 30 trends between January 19 and March 3, 2020. Different populations of users were considered. Core 31 discussions were explored measuring tweets' sentiment, by both computing a polarity compound 32 score with 95% Confidence Interval and using a transformer-based model, pretrained on a large 33 corpus of COVID-19-related Tweets. Context-dependent meaning and emotion-specific features 34 were considered. 35 Results : We gathered 3,308,476 tweets written in English. Since the first World Health 36 Organization report (January 21), negative sentiment proportion of tweets gradually increased as 37 expected, with amplifications following key events. Sentiment scores were increasingly negative 38 among most active users. Tweets content and flow revealed an ongoing scenario in which the global 39 emergency seems difficult to be emotionally managed, as shown by sentiment trajectories. 40 Conclusions : Integrating social media like Twitter as essential surveillance tools in the management 41 of the pandemic and its waves might actually represent a novel preventive approach to hinder 42 emotional contagion, disseminating reliable information and nurturing trust.

e58ff757471935efc068974f7535092969509dfc,"Objective Atopy is defined by the individual predisposition to develop a group of inflammatory disorders in response to certain food or environmental substances that are otherwise innocuous for the host. In previous studies we could demonstrate a reduced responsiveness of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to psychosocial stress in young and adult patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), a chronic atopic skin disorder. With respect to the important immunoregulatory role of the HPA axis, especially under stress, this observation could be of clinical relevance and may at least partly explain stress-induced exacerbation of AD. The present study was designed to investigate whether attenuated responsiveness of the HPA axis to stress represents a characteristic feature of AD or whether it can also be found in other chronic manifestations of atopy. Methods Children (aged 7–12) with allergic asthma (AA; N = 17) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (N = 18) were exposed to the “Trier Social Stress Test for Children”(TSST-C), which mainly consists of a free speech and mental arithmetic tasks in front of an audience. Salivary cortisol was measured in ten-minute intervals before and after the TSST-C, while heart rate was monitored continuously. In addition, early morning cortisol levels (after awakening, +10, +20, +30 minutes) were assessed on three consecutive days. Results Data analysis yielded a significant increase of cortisol concentrations (F (9297)= 16.79; p < .001) and heart rates (F (32,992)= 9.16; p < .001) after the stressor with no between-group difference in heart rate responses. However, AA children showed a significantly blunted cortisol response to the TSST-C when compared with the control group (F (9297)= 2.95; p < .01). Awakening in the morning was accompanied by a significant rise of cortisol levels on all three experimental days in AA and control subjects (all p < .001) that was not different between the two groups. Conclusions These findings suggest that a blunted adrenocortical response to stress may represent a common feature of chronic allergic inflammatory processes that may be relevant in different forms of chronic manifestation of atopy.","[{'authorId': '1401582936', 'name': 'A.

This question has been the topic of many research studies over the previous 35 years, and there has been little consensus. The present meta-analysis examined the effect sizes from 63 samples in which listeners' understanding of a message was compared when speech was presented alone with when speech was presented with gestures. It was found that across samples, gestures do provide a significant, moderate benefit to communication. Furthermore, the magnitude of this effect is moderated by 3 factors. First, effects of gesture differ as a function of gesture topic, such that gestures that depict motor actions are more communicative than those that depict abstract topics. Second, effects of gesture on communication are larger when the gestures are not completely redundant with the accompanying speech; effects are smaller when there is more overlap between the information conveyed in the 2 modalities. Third, the size of the effect of gesture is dependent on the age of the listeners, such that children benefit more from gestures than do adults.

Human/COVID-19 interactions cause different outcomes ranging from minor health consequences to death. Since social interaction is the default mode by which individuals communicate with their surroundings, different modes of contagion can play a role in determining the long-term consequences for mental health and emotional well-being. We examined some basic aspects of human social interaction, emphasizing some particular features of the emotional contagion. Moreover, we analyzed the main report that described brain damage related to the COVID-19 infection. Indeed, the goal of this review is to suggest a possible explanation for the relationships among emotionally impaired people, brain damage, and COVID-19 infection. Results: COVID-19 can cause several significant neurological disorders and the pandemic has been linked to a rise in people reporting mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety. Neurocognitive symptoms associated with COVID-19 include delirium, both acute and chronic attention and memory impairment related to hippocampal and cortical damage, as well as learning deficits in both adults and children. Conclusions: Although our knowledge on the biology and long-term clinical outcomes of the COVID-19 infection is largely limited, approaching the pandemic based on lessons learnt from previous outbreaks of infectious diseases and the biology of other coronaviruses will provide a suitable pathway for developing public mental health strategies, which could be positively translated into therapeutic approaches, attempting to improve stress coping responses, thus contributing to alleviate the burden driven by the pandemic.","[{'authorId': '145688645', 'name': 'A.

Suicide is a leading cause of death in China, and so suicide intervention on social media is an important issue in the field of public health. Sina Weibo (Weibo) is an emerging surveillance tool that may provide online assistance for users at the risk of suicide.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Keyword-based methods and supervised classifiers were employed to conduct this research. A control group was established to explore the differences between Weibo users with suicidal ideation (USI) and the general population.


RESULTS
A total of 114 USI were detected from 1 million active Weibo users. By studying the negative postings of these USI, disclosure of the reasons for their bad moods was the most common theme. The emotions of USI tend to be particularly down between 05:00 pm and midnight. Use of the first-person pronoun by Weibo USI is significantly frequent.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings may help to identify individuals with suicidal ideation who are not identified by the traditional clinical approach. Consequently, detecting and helping individuals who may be at risk of committing suicide may become more efficient.","[{'authorId': '37023869', 'name': 'Zheng Wang'}, {'authorId': '49568414', 'name': 'Guang Yu'}, {'authorId': '3427061', 'name': 'Xianyun Tian'}, {'authorId': '32196793', 'name': 'Jingyun Tang'}, {'authorId': '2997714', 'name': 'Xiangbin Yan'}]",16.0,,32.0,A Study of Users with Suicidal Ideation on Sina Weibo.,2018.0

Purpose
This study aims to propose that providers should tailor recovery responses to consumers’ emotional states to improve evaluations and behavioral intentions.


Design/methodology/approach
A multi-study approach comprising field and lab data was used. The field study, conducted on the Boston public transport network during a weather crisis, sought to determine how a provider should deliver their recovery response to match the consumer’s affective state. In the lab studies, the importance of tailoring a recovery message to the consumer’s state is experimentally demonstrated while controlling for factors such as consumer brand involvement.


Findings
This study finds that an emotion-focused recovery emphasizing empathy should be given to those in an avoidance affective state (i.e. focused on the avoidance of negative outcomes) such as worry. A problem-focused recovery, in which the focus is on the process that led to the failure and the steps that will be taken to correct it, should be provided to those in an approach state (i.e. concerned with advancement and accomplishment) such as anger. This study also finds this effect is more salient under low involvement conditions.


Research limitations/implications
Future research should examine how nonverbal behavior during recovery can be tailored to a consumer’s state.


Practical implications
Service providers are encouraged to tailor recovery messages to consumers’ affective states.


Originality/value
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to examine matching recovery messages to affective states, an important contribution as service failures can elicit a wide variety of affective states that influence how consumers react to recovery messages.

To describe relations among health, job satisfaction, work engagement and job features in Spanish nurses working in a public hospital.


BACKGROUND
It has been established that nursing staff health affects the quality of their work and is associated with job satisfaction, work engagement and different job features. Understanding the relationships among these variables could provide useful information to improve staff performance and prevent work-related illnesses.


DESIGN
A descriptive, cross-sectional, correlational and comparative study was performed between January-April 2016. This research adheres to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guideline.


METHODS
A total of 926 nurses were requested to complete an online questionnaire. Nurses on sick leave or in period of unpaid leave during data collection were excluded. The final study population reached 392 nurses. The online survey was fully completed by 373 nurses. General health, job satisfaction and work engagement were measured. Tools used were as follows: sociodemographic questions, the General Health Questionnaire, the Overall Job Satisfaction Scale and the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale.


RESULTS
Significant correlations among general health, job satisfaction and work engagement were found. Specifically, general health levels were negatively correlated with job satisfaction and work engagement subscales. Job features with influence on these constructs were the type of shift, type of contract, type of service, salary, type of continuous formation and having a specialty/profile.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results indicate that job-related features affect job satisfaction, general health and work engagement. The organisation should make interventions over these features to increase job satisfaction and work engagement levels, since they are relevant for nursing staff health and patient security.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
The analysis of the relationships among general health, job satisfaction, work engagement and job features in nurses could offer a basis to design preventive programmes to improve staff performance and prevent work-related illnesses.","[{'authorId': '1435455684', 'name': 'J.

Purpose
This paper aims to contribute to the literature that discusses consumer tipping behaviour in eating establishments. Because there is no detailed research into this issue with regard to consumers in Central and East European countries, the authors conducted research aimed at learning about the tipping behaviour of the Poles.


Design/methodology/approach
This study was carried out in 2018, using the computer-assisted web interviewing method, for a sample of 1,000 people. Six research questions were asked: How often the Poles give tips in eating establishments? What is an average size of a tip? What determinants influence the frequency and magnitude of tips? Who is likely to give a tip every one to two visits? Who is likely to tip more than the standard 10%? What influences the reasons why Polish consumers tend to tip?


Findings
The findings show the strong relationships between both a consumers’ tipping frequency and magnitude and the frequency at which these consumers eat out. This study also implicates income and education as essential factors influencing tipping behaviour and the lack of gender effect on consumers’ decision to tip. It was also noticed that such reasons as the quality of service, a taste of the dishes and a belief that it is proper to tip have a significant impact on the frequency of giving the tips. A significant diversity of the reasons’ meaning for tipping among Polish consumers depending upon their age was also stated.


Research limitations/implications
It would be interesting to compare the results of the current study with studies concerning consumer tipping behaviours in other Central and Eastern European countries historically and culturally similar to Poland to investigate whether the specifics of tipping behaviour noticed in Poland apply elsewhere.


Originality/value
This study shows the specifics of Polish people’s tipping behaviour and partially fulfills the gap in the knowledge of this aspect of consumers’ from Central and Eastern Europe behaviour. The obtained results suggest that with the increasing incomes and the widespread use of food services, tipping is likely to become more common in Poland. Furthermore, the pragmatic reasons for tipping will become more important than social and psychological motivators.

This study provides a comparative test of two psychological theories concerning the relationship between affect and performance. Managerial simulations are used to test whether people who are positive in disposition perform better or worse on both decisional and interpersonal tasks. Results are consistent in supporting the happier-and-smarter as opposed to the sadder-but-wiser hypothesis, since they show positive relationships between dispositional affect and performance. The results are discussed in terms of their relevance to both the older literature on links between satisfaction and performance and the more recent controversy over the dispositional approach to job attitudes.'","[{'authorId': '6663741', 'name': 'Barry M.

e7b22f0d8c6d786a0db93905171a70181f655e12,"We recently showed that blunt chest trauma reduced the expression of the myocardial oxytocin receptor (Oxtr), which was further aggravated by genetic deletion of the H2S-producing enzyme cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE). Exogenous H2S supplementation restored myocardial Oxtr expression under these conditions. Early life stress (ELS) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease by affecting vascular and heart structures. Therefore, we tested the hypotheses that (i) ELS affects cardiac Oxtr and CSE expressions and (ii) Oxtr and CSE expression patterns depend on the duration of stress exposure. Thus, two stress paradigms were compared: long- and short-term separation stress (LTSS and STSS, respectively). Cardiac Oxtr expression was differentially affected by the two stress paradigms with a significant reduction after LTSS and a significant increase after STSS. CSE expression, which was significantly reduced in Oxtr−/− knockout hearts, was downregulated and directly related to Oxtr expression in LTSS hearts (r = 0.657, p = 0.012). In contrast, CSE expression was not related to Oxtr upregulation in STSS. Plasma Oxt levels were not affected by either ELS paradigm. The coincidence of LTSS-induced reduction of cardiac Oxtr and reduced CSE expression may suggest a novel pathophysiological link between early life adversities and increased risk for the development of cardiovascular disorders in adulthood.","[{'authorId': '1388340472', 'name': 'Daniela C Wigger'}, {'authorId': '3580328', 'name': 'Nicole Gröger'}, {'authorId': '6626715', 'name': 'A.

In vitro studies using hippocampal neurons indicate that MRs and GRs translocate to the nucleus after binding to the stress hormone corticosterone, yet the in vivo temporal dynamics of MR and GR levels in other limbic regions critical for the stress response, however, are largely unknown. Rats underwent an elevated platform (EP) stress procedure and brain tissue was sampled from the amygdala (AMY), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), dorsal hippocampus and ventral hippocampus. By measuring MR and GR levels in the nuclear fraction from the tissue sampled, we observed striking shifts in the protein levels that varied by receptor, brain region and by the time after EP stress. These findings indicate that the subcellular trafficking of corticosteroid receptors display distinct temporal dynamics in different limbic regions after behavioral stress. These heterogeneous effects could underlie contrasting regional responses to stress within the brain, and they highlight the importance for systems-level analysis of stress responsivity.","[{'authorId': '3794698', 'name': 'D.

(1999) have demonstrated that Karasek's operationalization of job demands in his well-known Job Demands-Control (JD-C) Model (Karasek, 1979), i.e. quantitative demands, cannot capture the complexities of working with patients or clients in health care work. In the current study on burnout among 816 Dutch oncology care providers, the “traditional” JD-C Model was extended by including two types of emotional job demands. Moreover, “susceptibility to emotional contagion” was included as a potential moderator of the relationship between emotional job demands and burnout. Emotional job demands significantly contributed to the prediction of burnout, after controlling for quantitative job demands and job control. In addition, care providers' susceptibility to emotional contagion moderated the relationship between “confrontation with death and dying” and burnout. Care providers high in susceptibility to emotional contagion were more “vulnerable” to the stress associated with high emotional demands than their counterparts.","[{'authorId': '117622057', 'name': 'P.

They found that incidental emotions significantly influence trust in unrelated settings. Happiness and gratitude—emotions with positive valence—increase trust, and anger—an emotion with negative va-lence—decreases trust. Specifically, they found that emotions characterized by other-person control (anger and gratitude) and weak control appraisals (happiness) influence trust significantly more than emotions characterized by personal control (pride and guilt) or situational control (sadness). These findings suggest that emotions are more likely to be misattributed when the appraisals of the emotion are consistent with the judgment task than when the appraisals of the emotion are inconsistent with the judgment task. Emotions do not influence trust when individuals are aware of the source of their emotions or when individuals are very familiar with the trustee.","[{'authorId': '49395952', 'name': 'Jennifer R Dunn'}, {'authorId': '1889202', 'name': 'M.

Significant positive direct relationships were obtained between need for cognition and the big-five domains of openness to experience and conscientiousness. These findings are consistent with the conceptualization of need for cognition as the tendency to enjoy and engage in effortful thought. There also was a significant first-order negative correlation between need for cognition and the neuroticism domain.

Specifically, voiced, songlike laughs were significantly more likely to elicit positive responses than were variants such as unvoiced grunts, pants, and snortlike sounds. Participants were also highly consistent in their relative dislike of these other sounds, especially those produced by females.

Such facial expressions do not simply mirror the speaker’s stance or display understanding of the speaker’s talk; rather, they perform systematic operations on the projected course of the talk. Moreover, these facial displays of stance are well-timed and coordinated reactions that (in our sample) lead the way to a more light-hearted mode of discussion. Facial expressions that modify the shared emotional stance can: (a) reenact a past, previously shared emotional stance; (b) evoke a new, emotionally appropriate response to the talk; (c) establish a stance that is withheld and/or ambiguous in the talk; or (d) offer an alternative emotion to frame the talk.

e81cf926fabfd3e5d8f82bbcdea5a27d523d8269,"ABSTRACT Teachers appreciate nonverbally responsive students, but what is missing is an understanding of the direct influence of teachers' self-perceptions on their perceptions of how engaged their students are in class. Using the emotional contagion theory as a lens, this study examines the premise that satisfied instructors expect students to mirror their own behaviors in the classroom through being nonverbally responsive. Results of the regression model confirm that teachers' perceptions of their own confirmation behaviors most strongly predict their perceptions of how nonverbally responsive students are in class. Thus, instructors who are more expressive will likely induce students to be more expressive, leading them to determine their students are being more nonverbally responsive. Further, expressive instructors will be more attuned to student interaction because they may subconsciously expect students to mirror their actions through nonverbal behaviors—they will look for it. Additionally, satisfied instructors view their students as satisfied and look for these feelings to be exposed via nonverbal response behaviors. Implications for teacher training and mentoring programs are discussed.","[{'authorId': '2571620', 'name': 'M.

e87d25a9a8a236c454b2ecce2f0447865a3d96e1,"Customers often experience intense emotions during service encounters. Their perceptions of how well contact employees demonstrate emotional competence in emotionally charged service encounters can affect their service evaluations and loyalty intentions. Previous studies examining employees’ potential to behave in emotionally competent ways (i.e., employee emotional intelligence [EEI]) have used self- or supervisor-reported scales to predict customer outcomes, presenting EEI as stable and independent of the context. However, service firms should be more concerned with the actual display of emotionally competent behaviors by employees (employee emotional competence [EEC]), because employee behaviors vary across encounters. Moreover, a customer perspective of EEC is useful, as customer perceptions of employee performance are crucial predictors of satisfaction and loyalty. Therefore, this study proposes a conceptualization and operationalization of EEC in a service encounter context. On the basis of a comprehensive literature review and in-depth interviews, the authors develop a scale to capture customer-perceived EEC, defined as an employee’s competence in perceiving, understanding, and regulating customer emotions during a discrete service encounter. The scale achieves good reliability and validity. Researchers can use it to explore the role of EEC in service contexts, and managers can employ the scale to diagnose EEC and improve the customers’ service encounter experiences.","[{'authorId': '152788044', 'name': 'Cécile Delcourt'}, {'authorId': '51980483', 'name': 'Dwayne D.

Collectiveness, which indicates the degree of individuals acting as a union in collective motion, is a fundamental and universal measurement for various crowd systems. By integrating path similarities among crowds on collective manifold, this paper proposes a descriptor of collectiveness and an efficient computation for the crowd and its constituent individuals. The algorithm of the Collective Merging is then proposed to detect collective motions from random motions. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed collectiveness descriptor on the system of self-driven particles. We then compare the collectiveness descriptor to human perception for collective motion and show high consistency.

However, which measures were most effective is uncertain. Tian et al. performed a quantitative analysis of the impact of control measures between 31 December 2019 and 19 February 2020, which encompasses the Lunar New Year period when millions of people traveled across China for family visits. Travel restrictions in and out of Wuhan were too late to prevent the spread of the virus to 262 cities within 28 days. However, the epidemic peaked in Hubei province on 4 February 2020, indicating that measures such as closing citywide public transport and entertainment venues and banning public gatherings combined to avert hundreds of thousands of cases of infection. It is unlikely that this decline happened because the supply of susceptible people was exhausted, so relaxing control measures could lead to a resurgence. Science, this issue p. 638 Travel restrictions and the national emergency response delayed the growth and limited the size of the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Responding to an outbreak of a novel coronavirus [agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] in December 2019, China banned travel to and from Wuhan city on 23 January 2020 and implemented a national emergency response. We investigated the spread and control of COVID-19 using a data set that included case reports, human movement, and public health interventions. The Wuhan shutdown was associated with the delayed arrival of COVID-19 in other cities by 2.91 days. Cities that implemented control measures preemptively reported fewer cases on average (13.0) in the first week of their outbreaks compared with cities that started control later (20.6).

These experiments suggest that rodents are capable of producing simplified versions of any number of social phenomena involving empathy, previously thought to be the sole province of human beings.

e9d9ed234542cda43d8989a9a79e6f514ba7bc04,"Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are rapidly gaining popularity in translational neuroscience and behavioral research. Physiological similarity to mammals, ease of genetic manipulations, sensitivity to pharmacological and genetic factors, robust behavior, low cost, and potential for high-throughput screening contribute to the growing utility of zebrafish models in this field. Understanding zebrafish behavioral phenotypes provides important insights into neural pathways, physiological biomarkers, and genetic underpinnings of normal and pathological brain function. Novel zebrafish paradigms continue to appear with an encouraging pace, thus necessitating a consistent terminology and improved understanding of the behavioral repertoire. What can zebrafish 'do', and how does their altered brain function translate into behavioral actions? To help address these questions, we have developed a detailed catalog of zebrafish behaviors (Zebrafish Behavior Catalog, ZBC) that covers both larval and adult models. Representing a beginning of creating a more comprehensive ethogram of zebrafish behavior, this effort will improve interpretation of published findings, foster cross-species behavioral modeling, and encourage new groups to apply zebrafish neurobehavioral paradigms in their research. In addition, this glossary creates a framework for developing a zebrafish neurobehavioral ontology, ultimately to become part of a unified animal neurobehavioral ontology, which collectively will contribute to better integration of biological data within and across species.","[{'authorId': '1851740', 'name': 'A.

In this study, we examined whether OT increases empathy by the way of blurring the distinction between self and other, or by enhancing the difference between self and other. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject crossover design, empathic responses of healthy participants were compared when imagining oneself (i.e., self-perspective empathy) versus when imagining the other (i.e., other-perspective empathy) in painful and nonpainful situations. Under OT treatment, participants expressed more empathy when imagining others than when imagining oneself in pain. This was in contrast to the placebo condition where there were no differences between the empathic responses during the self- and the other-perspective. We propose that the modulatory effect of OT on empathy when taking the other-perspective may be mediated by its role in self- and other-distinctiveness and corollary by its role in increasing salience to social agents and cues.","[{'authorId': '1401107688', 'name': 'A.

What is the single best node to immunize? Answering these questions is essential for devising network-wide strategies to counter viruses. In addition, viral propagation is very similar in principle to the spread of rumors, information, and “fads,” implying that the solutions for viral propagation would also offer insights into these other problem settings. We answer these questions by developing a nonlinear dynamical system (NLDS) that accurately models viral propagation in any arbitrary network, including real and synthesized network graphs. We propose a general epidemic threshold condition for the NLDS system: we prove that the epidemic threshold for a network is exactly the inverse of the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. Finally, we show that below the epidemic threshold, infections die out at an exponential rate. Our epidemic threshold model subsumes many known thresholds for special-case graphs (e.g., Erdös--Rényi, BA powerlaw, homogeneous). We demonstrate the predictive power of our model with extensive experiments on real and synthesized graphs, and show that our threshold condition holds for arbitrary graphs. Finally, we show how to utilize our threshold condition for practical uses: It can dictate which nodes to immunize; it can assess the effects of a throttling policy; it can help us design network topologies so that they are more resistant to viruses.","[{'authorId': '143856744', 'name': 'Deepayan Chakrabarti'}, {'authorId': '2155653113', 'name': 'Yang Wang'}, {'authorId': '2109436218', 'name': 'Chenxi Wang'}, {'authorId': '1702139', 'name': 'J.

We also asked whether emotional contagion, a primitive form of empathy, was altered in BTBR and Fmr1 KO mice when experiencing pain with a social partner. BTBR mice demonstrated mixed nociceptive responses with hyporesponsivity to mechanical/thermal stimuli and intraplantar injections of formalin and capsaicin while displaying hypersensitivity on the acetic acid test. Fmr1‐KO mice were hyposensitive to mechanical stimuli and intraplantar injections of capsaicin and formalin. BTBR and Fmr1‐KO mice developed significantly less mechanical allodynia following intraplantar injections of complete Freund's adjuvant, while BTBR mice developed slightly more thermal hyperalgesia. Finally, as measured by the formalin and acetic acid writhing tests, BTBR and Fmr1‐KO mice did not show emotional contagion of pain.

This study describes a new caregiver-report assessment, the Sensory Experiences Questionnaire (SEQ), and explicates the nature of sensory patterns of hyper- and hyporesponsiveness, their prevalence, and developmental correlates in autism relative to comparison groups.


METHOD
Caregivers of 258 children in five diagnostic groups (Autism, PDD, DD/MR, Other DD, Typical) ages 5-80 months completed the SEQ.


RESULTS
The SEQ's internal consistency was alpha' = .80. Prevalence of overall sensory symptoms for the Autism group was 69%. Sensory symptoms were inversely related to mental age. The Autism group had significantly higher symptoms than either the Typical or DD groups and presented with a unique pattern of response to sensory stimuli -hyporesponsiveness in both social and nonsocial contexts. A pattern of hyperresponsiveness was similar in the Autism and DD groups, but significantly greater in both clinical groups than in the Typical group.


CONCLUSION
The SEQ was able to characterize sensory features in young children with autism, and differentiate their sensory patterns from comparison groups. These unique sensory patterns have etiological implications, as well as relevance for assessment and intervention practices.","[{'authorId': '6318399', 'name': 'G.

This feature allows LMMs to address some of the problems identified by Speelman and McGann (2013) about the use of mean data, because they do not average across individual responses. However, recent guidelines for using LMM to analyse skewed reaction time (RT) data collected in many cognitive psychological studies recommend the application of non-linear transformations to satisfy assumptions of normality. Uncritical adoption of this recommendation has important theoretical implications which can yield misleading conclusions. For example, Balota et al. (2013) showed that analyses of raw RT produced additive effects of word frequency and stimulus quality on word identification, which conflicted with the interactive effects observed in analyses of transformed RT. Generalized linear mixed-effect models (GLMM) provide a solution to this problem by satisfying normality assumptions without the need for transformation. This allows differences between individuals to be properly assessed, using the metric most appropriate to the researcher's theoretical context. We outline the major theoretical decisions involved in specifying a GLMM, and illustrate them by reanalysing Balota et al.'s datasets. We then consider the broader benefits of using GLMM to investigate individual differences.","[{'authorId': '4951320', 'name': 'Steson Lo'}, {'authorId': '144767507', 'name': 'S.

The magnitude of this discrepancy is now being documented through newer techniques such as eye tracking, which allows us to see and measure how individuals with autism search for meaning when presented with naturalistic social scenes. This paper offers an approach to social cognitive development intended to address the above discrepancy, which is considered a key element for any understanding of the pathophysiology of autism. This approach, called the enactive mind (EM), originates from the emerging work on 'embodied cognitive science', a neuroscience framework that views cognition as bodily experiences accrued as a result of an organism's adaptive actions upon salient aspects of the surrounding environment. The EM approach offers a developmental hypothesis of autism in which the process of acquisition of embodied social cognition is derailed early on, as a result of reduced salience of social stimuli and concomitant enactment of socially irrelevant aspects of the environment.","[{'authorId': '6261339', 'name': 'A.

Within each display condition one excerpt was presented in image-only and one in sound-plus-image format. Emotional reactions were assessed by facial electromyography (EMG) from the brow and cheek regions and by skin resistance and heart rate. Following each excerpt, subjects also reported verbally the intensity of eight emotions. Self-reported emotions were influenced strongly by both the expressive displays and prior attitude toward Reagan as well as by media condition. Facial EMG indicated smiling during happiness/reassurance displays and frowning during anger/threat and fear/evasion displays, especially during image-only presentations. Display effects were also found for skin resistance responses when the media conditions were combined and for heart rate changes in the sound-plus-image condition. In contrast to the self-report measures, expressive and autonomic differences did not reveal an interaction between prior attitude and display condition.

This model had gained popularity because it can at the same time capture the short-run dynamic properties as well as the long-run equilibrium behaviour of many non-stationary time series. It also allows relevant economic questions to be formulated in a consistent statistical framework. Part I of the book is planned so that it can be used by those who want to apply the methods without going into too much detail about the probability theory. The main emphasis is on the derivation of estimators and test statistics through a consistent use of the Guassian likelihood function. It is shown that many different models can be formulated within the framework of the autoregressive model and the interpretation of these models is discussed in detail. In particular, models involving restrictions on the cointegration vectors and the adjustment coefficients are discussed, as well as the role of the constant and linear drift. In Part II, the asymptotic theory is given the slightly more general framework of stationary linear processes with i.i.d. innovations. Some useful mathematical tools are collected in Appendix A, and a brief summary of weak convergence in given in Appendix B. The book is intended to give a relatively self-contained presentation for graduate students and researchers with a good knowledge of multivariate regression analysis and likelihood methods. The asymptotic theory requires some familiarity with the theory of weak convergence of stochastic processes. The theory is treated in detail with the purpose of giving the reader a working knowledge of the techniques involved. Many exercises are provided. The theoretical analysis is illustrated with the empirical analysis of two sets of economic data.

 Psychological theories suggest that emotion represents the state of mind and instinctive responses of one’s cognitive system (Cannon 1927). Emotions are a complex state of feeling that results in physical and psychological changes that influence our behavior. In this paper, we study an interesting problem of emotion contagion in social networks. In particular, by employing an image social network (Flickr) as the basis of our study, we try to unveil how users’ emotional statuses influence each other and how users’ positions in the social network affect their influential strength on emotion. We develop a probabilistic framework to formalize the problem into a role-aware contagion model. The model is able to predict users’ emotional statuses based on their historical emotional statuses and social structures. Experiments on a large Flickr dataset show that the proposed model significantly outperforms (+31% in terms of F1-score) several alternative methods in predicting users’ emotional status. We also discover several intriguing phenomena. For example, the probability that a user feels happy is roughly linear to the number of friends who are also happy; but taking a closer look, the happiness probability is superlinear to the number of happy friends who act as opinion leaders (Page et al. 1999) in the network and sublinear in the number of happy friends who span structural holes (Burt 2001). This offers a new opportunity to understand the underlying mechanism of emotional contagion in online social networks.

It is very difficult and inappropriate to quantify the impact of these fuzzy factors by using the mathematical formula. Existing microscopic simulation models have made many efforts to use accurate mathematical method to model the fuzzy interaction behaviors between pedestrians under the view-limited condition. This study tries to fill this gap by establishing a microscopic simulation model which can represent the fuzzy behaviors of pedestrians under view-limited condition. The developed fuzzy social force model (FSFM) combines fuzzy logic into conventional social force model (SFM). Different from existing models and applications, FSFM adopts fuzzy sets and membership functions to describe the pedestrian evacuation process. Seven fuzzy sets are defined for this process, such as stop/go, moving direction, desired force, force from obstacles, force from pedestrian, force from indicators, and acceleration. Membership function of each input factor is calibrated based on the observed data. Model performance is verified by comparing speed distribution, velocity-density relationship, and results of simulation and observation evacuation time. Besides, the proposed model is applied to assess the number and space distribution of exit indicators and stickers. By comparing simulation results with existing models, the paper concludes that FSFM is able to well reproduce pedestrian movement dynamics in real world under view-limited condition.","[{'authorId': '32219150', 'name': 'Ningbo Cao'}, {'authorId': '49608463', 'name': 'Liying Zhao'}, {'authorId': '2107999391', 'name': 'Mingtao Chen'}, {'authorId': '2075340193', 'name': 'Ruiqing Luo'}]",6.0,,29.0,Fuzzy Social Force Model for Pedestrian Evacuation under View-Limited Condition,2020.0

Our findings suggest that faking positive emotions has no bearing on service satisfaction, but suppressing negative emotions interacts with contextual factors to predict customers' service satisfaction, in line with social-functional theories of emotions. Specifically, customers who know the employee well are less sensitive to the negative effects of suppressed negative emotions, and customers in highly personalized service encounters are more sensitive to the negative effects of suppressed negative emotions.

Observers of pain and distress commonly exhibit increases in reported distress, autonomic arousal, facial mimicry, and overlapping neural activity. An important, unstudied question is whether physiological stress can also resonate. Physiological stress is operationalized as activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) and sympatho-adrenomedullary (SAM) axes. People often report an aversive state resulting from the stress of another, but this could be conveyed through resonating arousal or distress, without activating the physiological stress response. Physiological stress is particularly important to examine since it commonly occurs chronically, with known negative effects on health. Salivary cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) were measured in both speakers and observers during a modified Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) to assess activation of the HPA and SAM axes (respectively). Cortisol (but not sAA) responses resonated between speakers and observers. The cortisol response of observers increased with trait empathy and was not related to the speaker's subjective fear or distress. This study provides a novel method for examining physiological resonance, and indicates that we can indeed catch another's physiological stress, suggesting a specific health risk for those in the social network of stressed individuals.","[{'authorId': '3299961', 'name': 'T.

ee0f0dd3ff7dd58b56ce15aa816bb446788367a5,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to study firms’ decisions of voluntary disclosure of high product quality by sending their products to intermediaries for review, and how the nature of the reviews subsequently substitutes the brand names in terms of affecting the price of the product. Design/methodology/approach – Using data on camcorders and point & shoot digital cameras collected from multiple intermediary sources, this paper empirically tests the relationships among brand equity, send for review decisions, the nature of reviews and pricing, controlling for endogeneity. Findings – This paper finds that firms are likely to send their high-quality products to the intermediaries for review, but such likelihood varies across different brands. Relatively weak brands are more likely to send their products for review than relatively strong brands. By doing so, weak brands receive two benefits: first, intermediary reviews help eliminate price differentials between weak brands and strong brands. The more positive is the review, the higher is the price. When intermediary reviews are not obtained, some strong brands effectively charge a price premium over weak brands. Second, intermediary reviews subsequently attract more consumer word of mouth (WOM). The more positive is the review, the more consumer WOM is attracted. Researchlimitations/implications – One limitation is that this paper does not account for the influence of intra-brand competition. The second limitation is related to the assumption that intermediary reviews are accurate. Practicalimplications – This paper offers managerial implications to brand managers concerning send-for-review and pricing decisions. It proposes how managers leverage third-party endorsement in launching a new product. Originality/value – This paper is one of the few papers empirically studying the interaction of two communication approaches: disclosure and brand signaling. It modifies the commonly assumed relationships among brand, quality and price by demonstrating the substitute effect of intermediary reviews and brand names on price. This paper is also the first research that empirically examines the impact of firms’ “send-for-review” decisions on generating consumer WOM. Managerially, this paper substantiates Godes et al.’s (2005) framework on how firms should manage social interactions upon the release of new products.","[{'authorId': '122385472', 'name': 'Chun Qiu'}, {'authorId': '41170924', 'name': 'P.

Thirteen infants were observed weekly from 1 to 6 months of age. Smiling alone--without cheek raising or mouth opening--was relatively more likely than periods without smiling both when mothers were smiling and when infants were gazing at their mothers' faces. Cheek-raise (Duchenne) smiling was relatively more likely than smiling alone only when mothers were smiling. Open-mouth (play) smiling was relatively more likely than smiling alone only when infants were gazing directly at mothers' faces. Smiling involving both cheek raising and mouth opening was relatively likely both when mothers were smiling and when infants were gazing at mothers' faces and became increasingly likely with age when both conditions co-occurred.

We predicted and found that the nature of the distractor stimuli was very important with overall better search performance when distractors were redundant (i.e., “familiar” because they were drawn from a small rather than large stimulus set). This effect interacted with target gender and target emotion. Female happy target faces were always more quickly detected than female angry target faces. Similarly, a happy target face advantage was obtained with male target faces when the distractors were non-redundant. However, more rapid detection of angry than happy target faces was observed with male targets and redundant distractors. Thus, our results demonstrate that claims of an anger superiority effect in visual search for faces are empirically valid, but only under circumscribed boundary conditions.","[{'authorId': '2276310', 'name': 'A.

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to provide an exhaustive review of emotional labor research from the hospitality and tourism literature by outlining the theories, the antecedents and the outcomes of emotional labor, as well as the underlying mechanisms (i.e. mediators and moderators) of emotional labor.


Design/methodology/approach
This study provides a qualitative and critical review of emotional labor research from the hospitality and tourism literature, providing insights into the trends and gaps in the literature.


Findings
The conservation of resources theory and affective event theory are the two most common theories in the reviewed literature. Emotional intelligence and personality are the most commonly investigated antecedents while burnout and job satisfaction are the most investigated outcomes of emotional labor. Stress and burnout are the most examined mediators of emotional labor and subsequent outcomes, such as commitment, turnover intentions and well-being. Moderators include leader-member exchange, job position, gender and climate of authenticity.


Practical implications
Four major gaps for research and practice are identified as follows: the lack of an overarching theoretical framework; inconsistency in how emotional labor is defined and measured; the vast majority of emotional labor studies are cross-sectional studies; and no research examines potential interventions to help service employees engage in effective emotional labor strategies.


Originality/value
This review offers a model providing a comprehensive framework that outlines the various antecedents, outcomes, mediators and moderators of emotional labor and corresponding theories for future research.

ef063184fbd024229a8b710f0ace9dd498adcc00,"Background Breast cancer cell lines have been used widely to investigate breast cancer pathobiology and new therapies. Breast cancer is a molecularly heterogeneous disease, and it is important to understand how well and which cell lines best model that diversity. In particular, microarray studies have identified molecular subtypes–luminal A, luminal B, ERBB2-associated, basal-like and normal-like–with characteristic gene-expression patterns and underlying DNA copy number alterations (CNAs). Here, we studied a collection of breast cancer cell lines to catalog molecular profiles and to assess their relation to breast cancer subtypes. Methods Whole-genome DNA microarrays were used to profile gene expression and CNAs in a collection of 52 widely-used breast cancer cell lines, and comparisons were made to existing profiles of primary breast tumors. Hierarchical clustering was used to identify gene-expression subtypes, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to discover biological features of those subtypes. Genomic and transcriptional profiles were integrated to discover within high-amplitude CNAs candidate cancer genes with coordinately altered gene copy number and expression. Findings Transcriptional profiling of breast cancer cell lines identified one luminal and two basal-like (A and B) subtypes. Luminal lines displayed an estrogen receptor (ER) signature and resembled luminal-A/B tumors, basal-A lines were associated with ETS-pathway and BRCA1 signatures and resembled basal-like tumors, and basal-B lines displayed mesenchymal and stem/progenitor-cell characteristics. Compared to tumors, cell lines exhibited similar patterns of CNA, but an overall higher complexity of CNA (genetically simple luminal-A tumors were not represented), and only partial conservation of subtype-specific CNAs. We identified 80 high-level DNA amplifications and 13 multi-copy deletions, and the resident genes with concomitantly altered gene-expression, highlighting known and novel candidate breast cancer genes. Conclusions Overall, breast cancer cell lines were genetically more complex than tumors, but retained expression patterns with relevance to the luminal-basal subtype distinction. The compendium of molecular profiles defines cell lines suitable for investigations of subtype-specific pathobiology, cancer stem cell biology, biomarkers and therapies, and provides a resource for discovery of new breast cancer genes.","[{'authorId': '49409029', 'name': 'Jessica Kao'}, {'authorId': '2210853', 'name': 'K.

ef1c32242debbd8b6dfd08cb59013f5f1e7bc292,"Emotional states displayed by an animal or a human can seriously affect behavior of their conspecifics. The amygdala plays a crucial role in the processing of emotions. In this study, we describe an experimental rat model of between-subject transfer of emotional information and its effects on activation of the amygdala. The rats were kept in pairs, and one animal (designated as ""demonstrator"") was treated to specific behavioral training of either foot-shock-reinforced context conditioning or just exposure to a novel context. We next examined the influence of the demonstrators on the exploratory behavior of their cagemates (called ""observers"") and the observers' performance of the acoustic startle response. We report that we can distinguish both groups of observers from the control animals (as shown by startle-response measure) and distinguish between observers (by means of indexing the exploration), with respect to whether they were paired with demonstrators treated to different experimental conditions. Furthermore, we show that the observers have most of their amygdala activated (as revealed by c-Fos mapping) to the same level as the demonstrators and, in the case of the central amygdala, to an even higher level. Moreover, the level of c-Fos expression in the observers reflected the specific behavioral treatment of the demonstrators with whom they were paired. Thus, in this study, we have shown that undefined emotional information transferred by a cohabitant rat can be evaluated and measured and that it evokes very strong and information-specific activation of the amygdala.","[{'authorId': '3765282', 'name': 'E.

This study examines how career barriers and supports (i.e., perceived discrimination, lack of advancement, human capital, and social capital) impact affective, normative, and continuance aspects of professional commitment and thus nurses' professional turnover intention.


BACKGROUND
Professional commitment is known to influence professional turnover intention. However, little is known about how career barriers and supports contribute to professional commitment and reduce professional turnover intention.


METHODS
This study adopted a cross-sectional design and a survey to collect representative data in a major hospital in northern Taiwan. We used proportionate random sampling to ensure sample representativeness and obtained 524 responses.


RESULTS
Perceived discrimination and lack of advancement were negatively related to affective professional commitment. Human capital was positively related to affective, normative, and continuance professional commitment. Social capital was positively related to normative professional commitment. All aspects of professional commitment were negatively related to professional turnover intention.


CONCLUSION
Career barriers and supports have an important influence on professional commitment. Reduced barriers and enhanced support may therefore help reduce nurses' professional turnover intentions.


IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT
Nursing managers could aim to lessen career barriers while increasing career support for nurses, helping strengthen nurses' professional commitment and retention.","[{'authorId': '49472618', 'name': 'Hao‐Yuan Chang'}, {'authorId': '4840853', 'name': 'Tsung-Lan Chu'}, {'authorId': '50881351', 'name': 'Yen-Ni Liao'}, {'authorId': '89280434', 'name': 'Yin-Tzu Chang'}, {'authorId': '1729786', 'name': 'Ching-I.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the association of supervisor support with organizational commitment, turnover intentions, and life satisfaction, while also examining the mediating role of quality of work life (QWL) in these associations.




Design/methodology/approach




For testing the research hypotheses, data were collected from 244 respondents working in organizations within the organized retail sector in India. Existing, established scales were used to measure the research constructs.




Findings




The results of this study indicate that supervisor support was positively related to QWL. Moreover, QWL was found to be positively related to organizational commitment and life satisfaction, whereas a negative association was observed between QWL and turnover intentions. Finally, the results show that QWL mediated the association of supervisor support with organizational commitment, turnover intentions, and life satisfaction.




Practical implications




The current study suggests that a supportive supervisor enhances employees’ emotional attachment to the organization and life satisfaction by augmenting their QWL. The findings of this study may be helpful for organizational leaders in designing human resource practices that focus on enhancing supervisor support. An enhanced level of supervisor support may further help in retaining employees and improving their lives in today’s highly competitive and stressful business environment.




Originality/value




Although the association of supervisor support with employee attitudes and behavior at work has been extensively investigated, previous research did not clarify how supervisor support is linked to these outcomes. By investigating the mediating role of QWL, this research elucidates the underlying mechanisms linking supervisor support with organizational commitment, turnover intentions, and life satisfaction. This research provides an important contribution not only to the workplace support literature, but also to the field of human resource management.","[{'authorId': '98890300', 'name': 'Neerpal Rathi'}, {'authorId': '89154244', 'name': 'Kidong Lee'}]",40.0,,44.0,Understanding the role of supervisor support in retaining employees and enhancing their satisfaction with life,2017.0

The automatic analysis of these online opinion videos is bringing new or understudied research challenges to the field of computational linguistics and multimodal analysis. Among these challenges is the fundamental question of exploiting the dynamics between visual gestures and verbal messages to be able to better model sentiment. This article addresses this question in four ways: introducing the first multimodal dataset with opinion-level sentiment intensity annotations; studying the prototypical interaction patterns between facial gestures and spoken words when inferring sentiment intensity; proposing a new computational representation, called multimodal dictionary, based on a language-gesture study; and evaluating the authors' proposed approach in a speaker-independent paradigm for sentiment intensity prediction. The authors' study identifies four interaction types between facial gestures and verbal content: neutral, emphasizer, positive, and negative interactions. Experiments show statistically significant improvement when using multimodal dictionary representation over the conventional early fusion representation (that is, feature concatenation).","[{'authorId': '144802290', 'name': 'Amir Zadeh'}, {'authorId': '2545335', 'name': 'Rowan Zellers'}, {'authorId': '3422920', 'name': 'Eli Pincus'}, {'authorId': '49933077', 'name': 'Louis-Philippe Morency'}]",321.0,,18.0,Multimodal Sentiment Intensity Analysis in Videos: Facial Gestures and Verbal Messages,2016.0

This research examines how consumers react to firms' active participation in consumer-to-consumer conversations in an online community setting. The authors develop a tailored community-matched measure of consumer reaction (consumer sentiment) and analyze more than 115,000 consumer posts from ten online forums with active firm participation. The results indicate that consumers show diminishing returns to active firm engagement, which, at very high levels, can undermine consumer sentiment. Further subgroup analyses by conversation type indicate that these relationships hold for conversations that address consumers' functional needs but do not hold for conversations that address social needs. Finally, the results show diminishing returns to firm engagement for consumers primarily interested in product-related support but show no relationship for consumers primarily interested in inspiration and entertainment. These findings provide insights for marketing performance measurement and resource allocation in online communities.","[{'authorId': '103099826', 'name': 'Christian Homburg'}, {'authorId': '123950931', 'name': 'Laura Ehm'}, {'authorId': '2050004213', 'name': 'M.

Using data from prior studies of college students, nurses, teachers, and the elderly, analyses of the reliability, validity, and factor structure of this new version of the UCLA Loneliness Scale were conducted. Results indicated that the measure was highly reliable, both in terms of internal consistency (coefficient alpha ranging from .89 to .94) and test-retest reliability over a 1-year period (r = .73). Convergent validity for the scale was indicated by significant correlations with other measures of loneliness. Construct validity was supported by significant relations with measures of the adequacy of the individual's interpersonal relationships, and by correlations between loneliness and measures of health and well-being. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that a model incorporating a global bipolar loneliness factor along with two method factor reflecting direction of item wording provided a very good fit to the data across samples.

Research in social neuroscience has consistently observed several brain regions that contribute ubiquitously to these abilities, including medial prefrontal cortex and aspects of lateral and medial parietal cortex. Interestingly, parallel work has suggested that this same network of regions subserves several seemingly distinct phenomena—notably, the abilities to remember the past, imagine the future and visualize spatial layouts—suggesting the existence of a common set of cognitive processes devoted to projecting oneself into worlds that differ mentally, temporally or physically from one's current experience. This use of self-projection to understand others' minds requires perceivers to solve three distinct cognitive challenges: (i) generating a simulated facsimile of one's own hypothetical mental states in a given situation, (ii) suppressing one's own current mental states, and (iii) deciding on the appropriateness of simulated states for understanding a particular other person. The present paper reviews recent psychology and neuroscience research aimed at understanding the underlying mechanisms that allow humans to solve each of these cognitive challenges to use self-projection to predict and understand the mental states of others.","[{'authorId': '6078023', 'name': 'Jason P.

In order to predict unique lifting motion trajectories, a motion simulation model based on fuzzy-logic control is presented. The human body was represented by a 2-D five-segment model, and the neural controller was specified by fuzzy logic. Fuzzy rules were defined with their antecedent part describing the fuzzy variables of scaled positional error and velocity, and with their consequent part describing scaled angular velocity. These rules were generated according to certain trends in the fuzzy variable trajectories observed from actual lifting motions. An optimization procedure was performed to specify the parameters of the membership functions by minimizing the differences between the simulated and actual final postures. Simulations were obtained for 14 novel lifting motions from seven participants. Overall, results indicated that the presented model simulated lifting motions with an accuracy that was at least comparable to some previous human motion simulation models. The accuracy of the simulations differed between joints and was highest near the beginning and end of the motions. Strengths and limitations of the modeling approach are discussed. The use of fuzzy-logic control appears to be a fruitful basis for future simulations of lifting and other human tasks.","[{'authorId': '2425084', 'name': 'Xingda Qu'}, {'authorId': '3221535', 'name': 'M.

Its core idea is to transform crowd formation shapes with a least effort pair assignment using the Kuhn–Munkres algorithm, discover clusters of agent subgroups using affinity propagation and Delaunay triangulation algorithms and apply subgroup‐based social force model (SFM) to the agent subgroups to achieve alignment, cohesion and collision avoidance. Meanwhile, mutual information of the dynamic crowd is used to guide agents' movement at runtime. This approach combines both macroscopic (involving least effort position assignment and clustering) and microscopic (involving SFM) controls of the crowd transformation to maximally maintain subgroups' local stability and dynamic collective behaviour, while minimizing the overall effort (i.e. travelling distance) of the agents during the transformation. Through simulation experiments and comparisons, we demonstrate that this approach is efficient and effective to generate visually pleasing and smooth transformations and outperform several existing crowd simulation approaches including reciprocal velocity avoidances, optimal reciprocal collision avoidance and OpenSteer.","[{'authorId': '2285442', 'name': 'Mingliang Xu'}, {'authorId': '3293279', 'name': 'Yunpeng Wu'}, {'authorId': '2382085', 'name': 'Yangdong Ye'}, {'authorId': '34014051', 'name': 'I.

Positron emission tomography was used to investigate the neural substrates of normal human emotional and their dependence on the types of emotional stimulus.


METHOD
Twelve healthy female subjects underwent 12 measurements of regional brain activity following the intravenous bolus administration of [15O]H2O as they alternated between emotion-generating and control film and recall tasks. Automated image analysis techniques were used to characterize and compare the increases in regional brain activity associated with the emotional response to complex visual (film) and cognitive (recall) stimuli.


RESULTS
Film- and recall-generated emotion were each associated with significantly increased activity in the vicinity of the medial prefrontal cortex and thalamus, suggesting that these regions participate in aspects of emotion that do not depend on the nature of the emotional stimulus. Film-generated emotion was associated with significantly greater increases in activity bilaterally in the occipitotemporparietal cortex, lateral cerebellum, hypothalamus, and a region that includes the anterior temporal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampal formation, suggesting that these regions participate in the emotional response to certain exteroceptive sensory stimuli. Recall-generated sadness was associated with significantly greater increases in activity in the vicinity of the anterior insular cortex, suggesting that this region participates in the emotional response to potentially distressing cognitive or interoceptive sensory stimuli.


CONCLUSIONS
While this study should be considered preliminary, it identified brain regions that participate in externally and internally generated human emotion.","[{'authorId': '2116983148', 'name': 'E.

The corresponding force concept is discussed in more detail and can also be applied to the description of other behaviors. In the presented model of pedestrian behavior several force terms are essential: first, a term describing the acceleration towards the desired velocity of motion; second, terms reflecting that a pedestrian keeps a certain distance from other pedestrians and borders; and third, a term modeling attractive effects. The resulting equations of motion of nonlinearly coupled Langevin equations.

This presents a significant challenge for Computer Graphics researchers who generate artificial entities that aim to replicate the movement and appearance of the human eye, which is so important in human–human interactions. This review article provides an overview of the efforts made on tackling this demanding task. As with many topics in computer graphics, a cross‐disciplinary approach is required to fully understand the workings of the eye in the transmission of information to the user. We begin with a discussion of the movement of the eyeballs, eyelids and the head from a physiological perspective and how these movements can be modelled, rendered and animated in computer graphics applications. Furthermore, we present recent research from psychology and sociology that seeks to understand higher level behaviours, such as attention and eye gaze, during the expression of emotion or during conversation. We discuss how these findings are synthesized in computer graphics and can be utilized in the domains of Human–Robot Interaction and Human–Computer Interaction for allowing humans to interact with virtual agents and other artificial entities. We conclude with a summary of guidelines for animating the eye and head from the perspective of a character animator.","[{'authorId': '38592832', 'name': 'K.

In a behavioural study using a property verification task, Kosslyn (1976) reported that there are both amodal and perceptual representations of concepts, but that amodal representations may be more easily accessed. However, Solomon (1997) argued that due to the nature of Kosslyn's stimuli, subjects may be able to bypass semantics entirely and perform this task using differences in the strength of association between words in true trials (e.g., cat-whiskers) and those in false trials (e.g., mouse-stinger). Solomon found no evidence for amodal representations when the task materials were altered to include associated false trials (e.g., cat-litter), which require semantic processing, as opposed to associative strategies. In the current study, we used fMRI to examine the response of regions of visual association cortex while subjects performed a property verification task with either associated or unassociated false trials. We found reliable activity across subjects within the left fusiform gyrus when true trials were intermixed with associated false trials but not when true trials were intermixed with unassociated false trials.

Learning from others includes imitation of actions and mirroring of emotions. Learning about others, such as their group membership and reputation, is crucial for social interactions that depend on trust. For accurate prediction of others' changeable dispositions, mentalizing is required, i.e., tracking of intentions, desires, and beliefs. Implicit mentalizing is present in infants less than one year old as well as in some nonhuman species. Explicit mentalizing is a meta-cognitive process and enhances the ability to learn about the world through self-monitoring and reflection, and may be uniquely human. Meta-cognitive processes can also exert control over automatic behavior, for instance, when short-term gains oppose long-term aims or when selfish and prosocial interests collide. We suggest that they also underlie the ability to explicitly share experiences with other agents, as in reflective discussion and teaching.

To explore the influences of clinical nurses' workplace violence and bystander behavior on patient safety.


BACKGROUND
Bystanders' role in social violence affects the consequences of said violence; however, few studies have explored the relationship between workplace violence and patient safety among nurses working in clinical settings.


METHODS
A cross-sectional survey design was conducted using a structured questionnaire pertaining to workplace violence, bystander behavior, patient safety culture, and nurse-assessed patient safety outcomes. The questionnaire was administered to 185 bedside nurses at a university hospital in a metropolitan city in Korea.


RESULTS
A regression model with department, patient safety culture, workplace bullying, incivility, and bystander behavior explained approximately 34.0% of patient safety. Further, two bystander behavior, defender and facilitating, work-related bullying, and coworker incivility influenced patient safety.


CONCLUSION
Being a facilitating bystander was a threat to patient safety, while being a defender bystander enhanced patient safety.


IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT
The negative consequences of workplace violence on patient safety may be mitigated by colleagues' reaction to violence; therefore, nursing policymakers should emphasize the role of positive bystanders as an organizational strategy against workplace violence.","[{'authorId': '31782203', 'name': 'K.

They argued that the so-called basic emotions were neither psychologically or biologically ""primitive"" nor ""irreducible building blocks"" for generating the ""great variety of emotional experiences."" In the biosocial theory tradition, researchers have identified multiple noncognitive activators of emotion and demonstrated the usefulness of defining the essential components of emotion as phenomena that do not require cognitive mediators or constituents. In this framework, emotions are seen as basic because their biological and social functions are essential in evolution and adaptation. Particular emotions are called basic because they are assumed to have innate neural substrates, innate and universal expressions, and unique feeling-motivational states. The great variety of emotional experiences is explained as a function of emotion-cognition interactions that result in affective-cognitive structures.","[{'authorId': '38430881', 'name': 'C.

Despite the apparent simplicity of this tripartite model, the structure of SWB remains in question. In the present review, the authors identify five prominent structural conceptualizations in which SWB is cast variously as three separate components, a hierarchical construct, a causal system, a composite, and as configurations of components. Supporting evidence for each of these models is reviewed, strengths and weaknesses are evaluated, and commonalities and discrepancies among approaches are described. The authors demonstrate how current ambiguities concerning the tripartite structure of SWB have fundamental implications for conceptualization, measurement, analysis, and synthesis. Given these ambiguities, it is premature to propose a definitive structure of SWB. Rather, the authors outline a research agenda comprising both short-term and longer-term steps toward resolving these foundational, yet largely unaddressed, issues concerning SWB.","[{'authorId': '4178337', 'name': 'M.

This article takes a psychological approach to understanding diffusion. Using a unique data set of all the New York Times articles published over a three-month period, the authors examine how emotion shapes virality. The results indicate that positive content is more viral than negative content, but the relationship between emotion and social transmission is more complex than valence alone. Virality is partially driven by physiological arousal. Content that evokes high-arousal positive (awe) or negative (anger or anxiety) emotions is more viral. Content that evokes low-arousal, or deactivating, emotions (e.g., sadness) is less viral. These results hold even when the authors control for how surprising, interesting, or practically useful content is (all of which are positively linked to virality), as well as external drivers of attention (e.g., how prominently content was featured). Experimental results further demonstrate the causal impact of specific emotion on transmission and illustrate that it is driven by the level of activation induced. Taken together, these findings shed light on why people share content and how to design more effective viral marketing campaigns.","[{'authorId': '40066064', 'name': 'Jonah A.

f4d4f828065b4f87b0b606829eb56eab78f07850,"This collection of articles brings together studies that examine the transmission of emotions between family members. All studies employ repeated diary or experience-sampling data to examine daily within-person and within-family variations in emotional experience. Emotional transmission is evaluated by assessing circumstances in which events or emotions in one family member's immediate experience show a consistent, predictive relationship to subsequent emotions or behaviors in another family member. This introduction places this empirical paradigm in the context of other approaches to research, discusses research methods and statistical procedures for studying emotional transmission, and reviews the major findings obtained thus far in this body of research. We argue that this empirical paradigm provides a promising tool for understanding emotional processes within the daily ecology of family and community life. Key Words: emotions, emotional transmission, family processes, family systems. The family is a nexus ot daily interchanges, both among household members and between these members and external settings, such as parents' places of work, children's schools, and other community institutions. Each day family members participate in semi-regular patterns of interaction with each other and with people and systems outside the family. In these interchanges, family members are affected by and affect others, sometimes in repeated ways. A hyperactive child, for example, may create repeated experiences of frustration for a parent that contribute to the parent's development of headaches. A parent experiencing sexual harassment at work may have frequent distress that is brought home and regularly affects her or his spouse and children in the evening. Some families may show repeated ""chain reactions"" in which stress enters the family through one member and is passed in a predictable sequence to others (Boss, 1987). Mapping the paths of transmission in these daily interchanges can reveal information about how the family system functions, as well as how the family affects individual health and well-being. In this collection of articles, we are concerned with daily patterns in which emotions or closely related phenomena are transmitted between family members and across settings. Emotions are an important medium to examine because they influence and can limit individuals' perceptions, thought processes, and behavior (Clore, Schwartz, & Conway, 1994; Frijda, 1986; Lazarus, 1991), as well as affect health via emotional physiology (Lovallo, 1997). Strong negative emotions, for example, dispose parents to view children's behavior with disapproval, block their recollection of constructive parenting strategies, and increase their rate of punitive parenting responses (Bradbury & Fincham, 1987; Dix, 1991). Adults' experiences of repeated negafive emotion are related to the development of heart disease (Sherwood & Turner, 1992) and to depression in their children (Downey & Coyne, 1990). Thus, chain reactions by which distress moves through a family have multiple effects. Secondhand emotions alter the thought, behavior, and physiology of individual family members. These, in turn, may have aggregate effects on the functioning of the family as a whole. This propagation of emotion within families is recognized by many areas of family scholarship. Research on marital relationships, work and family, family stress, parenting, and family therapy posits that family members have daily effects on each other's emotions. Until recently, however, researchers have lacked empirical models for directly examining these paths of influence during daily family life. The construct of emotional transmission provides a promising new empirical paradigm for understanding these daily paths of interchange. Emotional transmission occurs when events or emotions in one family member's immediate daily experience show a consistent predictive relationship to subsequent emotions or behaviors in another family member. …","[{'authorId': '47298884', 'name': 'R.

Employing a three-stage study design, this article explores how PP develops and how it affects turnover intentions among frontline employees. First, relying on affective events theory, a prestudy that employs a qualitative diary approach was performed to empirically identify work events that are the primary causes of PP. The prestudy was followed by Study 1, which applied a quantitative research design to determine which job characteristics promote these events. Finally, Study 2 utilized three-wave panel data of frontline employees to investigate the effects of PP on turnover intentions. The findings of the latter study confirm that PP triggers two processes that contrarily affect turnover intentions: (1) PP enhances job satisfaction, which decreases turnover intentions, and (2) PP increases self-efficacy, which enhances turnover intentions. However, further analyses reveal that the latter effect is not relevant for highly satisfied employees and that overall, increasing PP results in decreasing turnover intentions, suggesting that companies should foster PP to retain their frontline employees.","[{'authorId': '3228302', 'name': 'Tobias Kraemer'}, {'authorId': '2095695792', 'name': 'M.

They first show that racial homogeneity results not only from racial homophily proper but also from homophily among coethnics of the same racial background and from balancing mechanisms such as the tendency to reciprocate friendships or to befriend the friends of friends, which both amplify the homogeneity effects of homophily. Then, they put the importance of racial homophily further into perspective by comparing its effects to those of other mechanisms of tie formation. Balancing, propinquity based on coresidence, and homophily regarding nonracial categories (e.g., students from “elite” backgrounds or those from particular states) all influence the tie formation process more than does racial homophily.","[{'authorId': '51178962', 'name': 'A.

f5317ede66a443b5ed52fc27e84e2378fc0cebd3,"This article assesses the usefulness for social media research of controversy analysis, an approach developed in Science and Technology Studies (STS) and related fields. We propose that this approach can help to address an important methodological problem in social media research, namely, the tension between social media as resource for social research and as an empirical object in its own right. Initially developed for analyzing interactions between science, technology, and society, controversy analysis has in recent decades been implemented digitally to study public debates and issues dynamics online. A key feature of controversy analysis as a digital method, we argue, is that it enables a symmetrical approach to the study of media-technological dynamics and issue dynamics. It allows us to pay equal attention to the ways in which a digital platform like Twitter mediates public issues, and to how controversies mediate “social media” as an object of public attention. To sketch the contours of such a symmetrical approach, the article discusses examples from a recent social media research project in which we mapped issues of “privacy” and “surveillance” in the wake of the National Security Agency (NSA) data leak by Edward Snowden in June 2013. Through a discussion of social media research practice, we then outline a symmetrical approach to analyzing controversy with social media. We conclude that the digital implementation of such an approach requires further exchanges between social media researchers and controversy analysts.","[{'authorId': '3472302', 'name': 'N.

This review appraised and synthesized evidence relating to new nurses' stress experiences during the transition period.


BACKGROUND
Although stress among nursing professionals has been a subject of several systematic reviews in the recent years, there is still scarcity of systematic evidence examining job stress in new nurses.


METHODS
This is an integrative review of original studies conducted from 2002 onwards examining new nurses' stress experiences. Five databases were used to retrieve relevant articles such as CINAHL, SCOPUS, PubMed, PsycINFO and MEDLINE. Twenty-one articles were included in this review.


FINDINGS
New nurses perceived low to moderate levels of stress mainly from heavy workloads and lack of professional nursing competence. Individual and organizational factors that might contribute to their stress experiences were rarely explored.


CONCLUSION
This integrative review evaluated and synthesized available evidence examining stress in new nurses and contributed to the literature regarding stress in nursing professionals. The findings of this review may offer specific information to nurse administrators that can relate to the stress encountered by new nurses who enter into healthcare facilities.


IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY
Findings of this review may provide valuable input to assist nurse administrators in developing and implementing organizational measures to reduce stress in new nurses while maximizing and facilitating their integration into the nursing workforce. Such measures may include the following: establishment of a well-structured transition programme, provision of an adequate orientation and senior staff mentorship, stress management programmes, in-service educational programmes and exposure to clinical simulation scenarios.","[{'authorId': '15456442', 'name': 'L.

With at least one test performed for every voxel in an image, some correction of the thresholds is needed to control the error rates, but standard procedures for multiple hypothesis testing (e.g., Bonferroni) tend to not be sensitive enough to be useful in this context. This paper introduces to the neuroscience literature statistical procedures for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Recent theoretical work in statistics suggests that FDR-controlling procedures will be effective for the analysis of neuroimaging data. These procedures operate simultaneously on all voxelwise test statistics to determine which tests should be considered statistically significant. The innovation of the procedures is that they control the expected proportion of the rejected hypotheses that are falsely rejected.

f65249ab1c3984551fc4d3b76941789b1aed1a47,"This paper investigates the role of group identification in empathic emotion and its behavioral consequences. Our central idea is that group identification is the key to understanding the process in which empathic emotion causes helping behavior. Empathic emotion causes helping behavior because it involves group identification, which motivates helping behavior toward other members. This paper focuses on a hypothesis, which we call “self-other merging hypothesis (SMH),” according to which empathy-induced helping behavior is due to the “merging” between the helping agent and the helped agent. We argue that SMH should be interpreted in terms of group identification. The group identification interpretation of SMH is both behaviorally adequate (i.e., successfully predicts and explains the helping behavior in the experimental settings) and psychologically plausible (i.e., does not posit psychologically unrealistic beliefs, desires, etc.). Empathy-induced helping behavior, according to the group identification interpretation of the SMH, does not fit comfortably into the traditional egoism/altruism dichotomy. We thus propose a new taxonomy according to which empathy-induced helping behavior is both altruistic at the individual level and egoistic at the group level.","[{'authorId': '5932713', 'name': 'Kengo Miyazono'}, {'authorId': '2145193392', 'name': 'Kiichi Inarimori'}]",7.0,,48.0,"Empathy, Altruism, and Group Identification",2021.0

Findings: The results do not show support for a significant relationship linking HRPs with work harassment. However, a significant positive effect linking HRPs, positive contagion, well-being and innovative behaviour was noted, in addition to a significant negative link from harassment on positive contagion, well-being and innovation behaviour. 
Originality/value: The research highlights the limited role that HRPs (alone) play in mitigating harassment and their deleterious effects. Notwithstanding, HRPs can have a positive role in shaping the positive contagions and subsequent positive effects on employee and work outcomes.","[{'authorId': '12568823', 'name': 'Matthew J.

We assessed both between-person and within-person associations using a quasi-experiment (Study 1) and a 7-day diary study (Study 2). Results suggest that the mechanisms behind affect and life satisfaction differ. In terms of affect, the emotional contagion perspective was supported. Participants tended to report more positive affect and less negative affect when browsing more positive posts, irrespective of social comparison directionality. By contrast, life satisfaction was associated with both mechanisms. This study indicates that the emotional contagion and social comparison mechanisms may cancel out each other’s effect on how people evaluate their own lives.

f6d18d0dc91c83bcdc5b5b11a0ed6b46cbac8053,"When one observes some ""external"" object, as for instance sound, there are simultaneously present a number of other objects, which are intimately connected with the observing of sound, and which may not be themselves observed clearly. The muscular sensations from the tympanum, neck, breast, and other regions; the visual ""image""; the feelings; the visceral sensations; all these are definitely modified in the listening for sound, and yet may not be vivid. (Dunlap, 1912)From the sight of the conductor on first raising the baton to the sound of the final applause, a musical performance is a rich sensory experience for musicians and audience alike. It is the musicians who are the musical performers but all are musical listeners, and it is on ""musical listening"" that the spotlight falls here. The aim of this paper is to raise awareness of the kinesthetic dimension in musical listening and to investigate the nature and possible significance of subtle kinesthetic vocal sensations that I observe when listening to music. The importance of kinesthesis in musical performance (or musical action) is well-known but its role in musical perception, while suspected in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (e.g., Vernon, 1932), is little considered today. The terms kinesthesis and kinesthetic are used here to refer to the sense of muscular effort that accompanies bodily adjustments or movements. They are to be distinguished from their use in literature concerning auditory imagery where mental images of sound occur in the absence of peripheral adjustments or movements (Brodsky, Kessler, Rubinstein, Ginsborg, & Henik, 2008; Lotze, 2013).What do we mean by the term ""listening""? To hear is to perceive sound through the ear. Understanding how we listen, however, is not so straightforward because we can listen intently without focusing on the sound itself: it is possible to focus on a sound's qualities (reduced or focused listening), its source (causal listening), or its meaning (semantic listening) (Chion & Gorbman, 1994, pp. 25-34). We use focused listening when we try to identify the pitch of a note, or the interval between two notes. In causal listening, we listen beyond the sound and pay attention to ""things"" or ""auditory objects"" (Christison-Lagay, Gifford, & Cohen, 2015) that cause them rather than the qualities of the sounds themselves. In semantic listening, we listen ""past"" the sound to its meaning, which varies according to context (Ihde, 1976, p. 59). However, in addition to focusing on the sound, its source or its meaning, it is also possible to ""detach"" oneself from focusing on the sound, source or meaning, and become aware of subtle kinesthetic sensations that accompany the listening process. Petitmengin-Peugeot (in Varela & Shear, 1999, pp. 67-68) described this kind of attention as ""panoramic attention,"" attention that does not expect anything in particular or focus on any special object but that is relaxed and ""sensitive to the slightest detail.""By unintentionally adopting this kind of panoramic attention, I became aware that listening to music (through headphones) was accompanied by subtle movements that appeared to involve the ears, eustachian tubes, nasopharynx, vocal tract, and even muscles of facial expression (mimetic muscles). As my awareness of these kinesthetic (movement) sensations increased, it became apparent that the patterns of sensations varied according to incident sounds in a number of ways (see Table 1). The movements were fast and occurred in response to novelty, following voluntary switches of attention or, even more surprisingly, in anticipation of familiar sounds, suggesting their involvement as an integral part of the listening process. These observations posed a ""stimulating problem"" (Bekesy & Wever, 1960, p. 5), first, because they are not explained by traditional accounts of auditory perception devoid of motor contributions from peripheral vocal structures (Christison- Lagay et al. …","[{'authorId': '50512623', 'name': 'Nicola A Miller'}]",6.0,,0.0,Musical Listening and Kinesthesis: Is There an Audio-Vocal Tuning System?,2016.0

Subordinate perceptions of schedule control and family-supportive organization are used to operationalize a family-friendly work environment because immediate supervisors are frequently key gatekeepers in setting these organizational practices within a work unit. The authors test hypotheses based on this model using a sample of 161 subordinates and their immediate supervisors (N = 48) and find that work-to-family enrichment crosses over from the supervisor to the subordinate through the subordinate’s perceptions of greater schedule control. Crossover effects were not detected for family-to-work enrichment.

Combining functional neuroimaging with multivariate pattern analyses, we identified dissociable patterns that predicted somatic (high versus low: 100%) and vicarious (high versus low: 100%) pain intensity in out-of-sample individuals. Critically, each pattern was at chance in predicting the other experience, demonstrating separate modifiability of both patterns. Somatotopy (upper versus lower limb: 93% accuracy for both conditions) was also distinct, located in somatosensory versus mentalizing-related circuits for somatic and vicarious pain, respectively. Two additional studies demonstrated the generalizability of the somatic pain pattern (which was originally developed on thermal pain) to mechanical and electrical pain, and also demonstrated the replicability of the somatic/vicarious dissociation.

It projects a positive and realistic approach to issues confronting disabled people and their families. The lives and aspirations of the disabled are discussed in an easily readable style, which includes such topics as: labeling, accessibility, institutionalization, relationships with the medical field, and representation in the media and technology. Special People is not written for the professional who requires extensive information on a specific topic or exceptionality. Rather, it is a short book (172 pages) that brings together knowledge and thought from several disciplines to deal with the everyday problems of coping. Doctors, clergymen, parents, older students, relatives, and the general reader will find Special People useful and informative. One of the strongest aspects of this book is the author's ability to relate her personal experiences and feelings. She is sensitive to the adjustment problems of the nonhandicapped and helps them to understand their own reactions by sharing hers. For example, after realizing that a particular child had Downs' Syndrome, Ms. Cohen relates, ""The shock stayed with me all afternoon. Even though I had known that this was a program for retarded infants, I hadn't been prepared. I was still plagued by my stereotypes"" (p. 117). There are pertinent references throughout the text to professional articles, books for adults, and some for children that expound upon the topics discussed. Regular classroom teachers may be interested in reading, ""Don't Feel Sorry for Paul,"" which describes the life of a physically handicapped child. Parents may chose to read, ""About Handicaps,"" to children who are afraid of ""catching handicap germs."" There are also several accounts of innovative programs, such as Sweden's consideration of blind, physically, and mentally handicapped persons when traffic patterns were changed. This was done because ""they are passengers ... they are pedestrians ... they are part of the world around the driver .... "" There are several excerpts from autobiographies of disabled people, transcripts of conversations with parents, and reactions of children. Helen Jones describes inconsistencies in the airlines' willingness to accept disabled passengers: her statement is especially piognant for those who organize service companies for the public. The parent of a physically handicapped child expresses appreciation for a sequence on the ""Mr. Rogers"" television show, which included disabled children.

It remains difficult, however, to direct autonomous characters to perform specific tasks. This paper addresses the challenge by introducing cognitive modeling. Cognitive models go beyond behavioral models in that they govern what a character knows, how that knowledge is acquired, and how it can be used to plan actions. To help build cognitive models, we develop the cognitive modeling language CML. Using CML, we can imbue a character with domain knowledge, elegantly specified in terms of actions, their preconditions and their effects, and then direct the character’s behavior in terms of goals. Our approach allows behaviors to be specified more naturally and intuitively, more succinctly and at a much higher level of abstraction than would otherwise be possible. With cognitively empowered characters, the animator need only specify a behavior outline or “sketch plan” and, through reasoning, the character will automatically work out a detailed sequence of actions satisfying the specification. We exploit interval methods to integrate sensing into our underlying theoretical framework, thus enabling our autonomous characters to generate action plans even in highly complex, dynamic virtual worlds. We demonstrate cognitive modeling applications in advanced character animation and automated cinematography.","[{'authorId': '2198924', 'name': 'J.

Creating a positive emotional atmosphere is essential for such communities’ healthy development as its boosts the continuous involvement of each member. However, the dynamic cross-influences and evolution of emotions in OBCs have not been fully explored, which was the research gap this paper tried to fill. Based on emotional contagion theory, this study identifies three sources of textual sentiment through machine learning methods in OBCs: member’s posts, other members’ feedback, and the focal firm’s official feedback. This study further tested the dynamic emotional contagion process among these sources on valence (mean) and volatility (dispersion), namely how they affected each other. Data was collected from the MIUI forum, a large forum launched by Xiaomi corporate on August 1, 2011, which contained 17,622 posts and 99,426 feedback. Results showed that: (1) in the emotional contagion process, there existed differences in the influence of emotional valence and volatility from different sources; (2) all emotional interactions were temporary and mostly lasted no more than three days; (3) the most significant contributor of each sources’ emotion was itself, which could be explained by lagged effect; (4) the valence of focal firm’s emotion (focal firm’s official feedback) was the second contributor of the valence of member’s emotion (member’s posts) and other members’ emotion (other members’ feedback). Three sources of emotion in OBCs and emotional valence/volatility should be considered when firms try to guide the emotional changes in such communities. Furthermore, firms could proactively influence members’ emotions by carefully designing the feedback to members’ posts. Besides, since all interactions are temporary, firms need to engage in online communities frequently, like consistently offering feedback.","[{'authorId': '117203921', 'name': 'Dewen Liu'}, {'authorId': '2158335160', 'name': 'Sikang Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2146240519', 'name': 'Qi Li'}]",2.0,"{'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology', 'volume': '13'}",71.0,The analysis of dynamic emotional contagion in online brand community,2022.0

Understanding is sought by relating intra- and inter-individual levels of behaviour generation with behaviour pattern emergence at group level.

However, such an analysis ultimately fails to explain why emotions are aroused in the listener. In this article, we we explore an alternative approach, which seeks to explain musical emotions in terms of a set of psychological mechanisms that are activated by different types of information in a musical event. This approach was tested in four experiments that manipulated four mechanisms (Brain stem reflex, Contagion, Episodic memory, Musical expectancy), by selecting existing musical pieces that featured information relevant for each mechanism. The excerpts were played to 60 listeners, who were asked to rate their felt emotions on 15 scales. Skin conductance levels and facial expressions were measured and listeners reported subjective impressions of relevance to specific mechanisms. Results indicated that the target-mechanism conditions evoked emotions largely as predicted by a multi-mechanism framework and that mostly similar effects occurred across the experiments that included different pieces of music. We conclude that a satisfactory account of musical emotions requires consideration of how musical features and responses are mediated by a range of underlying mechanisms.","[{'authorId': '2663281', 'name': 'P.

fa890a987e1dce5f93aee32da93b65661453c683,"Abstract This study examines empirically the possible relationships between the emotional quality one can attribute to musical stimuli (expressed emotion, or external locus of emotion) and the subjective emotional response one can have as a result of listening to music (felt emotion, or internal locus). The relationship between the two loci of emotion is often assumed to be positive, that is, when listening to music, one feels the emotion that the music expresses. Gabrielsson has suggested, however, that this assumption is simplistic, and has proposed a model that describes other possible relationships. The present study quantitatively investigates Gabrielsson's proposal. Forty-five participants responded to questions about both expressed emotion and felt emotion for two familiar experimenter-selected pieces (Pachelbel's Canon and Advance Australia Fair, the Australian national anthem) and one or two pieces of their own selection. Participants were asked to “imagine” their self-selected pieces in the absence of recordings or a live performance. An experimenter-selected piece was both sounded and imagined, and no significant difference was observed in responses between the two conditions. Quantitative criteria were generated in order to compare the loci (internal and external) of each piece in geometric space. Results showed that the positive relationship, where the internal and external locus emotions are the same, occurred in 61% of cases. In general, these pieces were preferred more than those exhibiting non-positive relationships. Implications for practices that tacitly assume a 100% positive relationship, or are not specific about the locus of emotion, are discussed.","[{'authorId': '49031756', 'name': 'P.

The former revolves around the experience of group-based anger (based in appraised external blame for unfair collective disadvantage). The latter revolves around beliefs in the group’s efficacy (based in appraised instrumental coping potential for social change). The model is the first to make explicit the dynamic nature of collective action by explaining how undertaking collective action leads to the reappraisal of collective disadvantage, thus inspiring future collective action.

This study explores the constructs of stereotyped behaviors (e.g., repetitive motor patterns, object manipulations, behavioral rigidities) and tactile defensiveness as relevant to occupational therapy theory and practice and attempts to test their purported relationships in children with developmental disabilities.


METHOD
Twenty-eight children with developmental disabilities and autism were assessed on eight factors of stereotyped behavior via a questionnaire and by four measures of tactile defensiveness. The subjects' scores from the questionnaire were correlated with their scores on the tactile defensiveness measures to see what, if any, relationship among these behaviors exists.


RESULTS
Significant relationships emerged from the data, indicating that subjects with higher levels of tactile defensiveness were also more likely to evidence rigid or inflexible behaviors, repetitive verbalizations, visual stereotypes, and abnormal focused affections that are often associated with autism. No significant association was found between motor and object stereotypes and tactile defensiveness. These relationships could not be explained solely by maturational factors.


CONCLUSION
The results suggest that clinicians should include observations of stereotyped behaviors, particularly behavioral rigidities, in conjunction with assessments of sensory defensiveness because these are related phenomena that may pose unique challenges for children with developmental disabilities and autism. Further study is needed to determine the causal mechanisms responsible for these relationships.","[{'authorId': '6318399', 'name': 'G. Baranek'}, {'authorId': '117412056', 'name': 'L.

With the economic development of society, the traditional authoritative style of leadership can no longer adapt to the psychological characteristics of employees, who use new-era work concepts, techniques, and social rules (hereafter, new generation employees). Inclusive leadership is based on the concept of “fully inclusive and equitable” in traditional Chinese culture, and it can adapt to the independent needs of new generation employees. At present, the research on the relationship between the traditional leadership style and employee innovative behavior is relatively extensive, but there is little research on the relationship between inclusive leadership style and employee innovative behavior, and this needs further exploration. This paper takes new generation employees as the sample and uses psychological capital as an intermediary variable to explore the influence of inclusive leadership style on the innovative behaviors of new generation employees.

In contrast, chimpanzee laughter evoked notable cardiac acceleration. Laughter also evoked vocalizations from the infant subjects, which were reminiscent of adult threat-barks. Analysis of respiratory sinus arrhythmia suggested that the cardioacceleratory response likely resulted from sympathetic activation, and was not associated with an inhibition of parasympathetic activity. The autonomic and vocal responses to laughter emerged early in development, were minimally dependent on social contact with adults, and declined in magnitude with increasing age.

From the prior, we further devise a rich set of group property visual descriptors. These descriptors are scene-independent, and can be effectively applied to public-scene with variety of crowd densities and distributions.

fbf5faa377ac1b75964e2eb20ff7da34c10d6e6b,"Increasing evidence suggests that, similar to face-to-face communications, human emotions also spread in online social media. However, the mechanisms underlying this emotional contagion, for example, whether different feelings spread in unlikely ways or how the spread of emotions relates to the social network, is rarely investigated. Indeed, because of high costs and spatio-temporal limitations, explorations of this topic are challenging using conventional questionnaires or controlled experiments. Because they are collection points for natural affective responses of massive individuals, online social media sites offer an ideal proxy for tackling this issue from the perspective of computational social science. In this paper, based on the analysis of millions of tweets in Weibo, surprisingly, we find that anger is more contagious than joy, indicating that it can spark more angry follow-up tweets. Moreover, regarding dissemination in social networks, anger travels easily along weaker ties than joy, meaning that it can infiltrate different communities and break free of local traps because strangers share such content more often. Through a simple diffusion model, we reveal that greater contagion and weaker ties function cooperatively to speed up anger's spread. The diffusion of real-world events with different dominant emotions provides further testimony to the findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that quantitative long-term evidence has been presented that reveals a difference in the mechanism by which joy and anger are disseminated.

Emotional labor was conceptualized in the early 1980s by sociologist Arlie Hochschild (1983) as occupational requirements that alienate workers from their emotions. Almost 2 decades later, a model was published in Journal of Occupational Health Psychology (JOHP) that viewed emotional labor through a psychological lens, as emotion regulation strategies that differentially relate to performance and wellbeing. For this anniversary issue of JOHP, we review the emotional labor as emotion regulation model, its contributions, limitations, and the state of the evidence for its propositions. At the heart of our article, we present a revised model of emotional labor as emotion regulation, that incorporates recent findings and represents a multilevel and dynamic nature of emotional labor as emotion regulation.","[{'authorId': '5248218', 'name': 'Alicia A.

In the course of a computer-mediated negotiation, participants received information about the emotional state (anger, happiness, or none) of their opponent. Consistent with a strategic-choice perspective, Experiment 1 showed that participants conceded more to an angry opponent than to a happy one. Experiment 2 showed that this effect was caused by tracking--participants used the emotion information to infer the other's limit, and they adjusted their demands accordingly. However, this effect was absent when the other made large concessions. Experiment 3 examined the interplay between experienced and communicated emotion and showed that angry communications (unlike happy ones) induced fear and thereby mitigated the effect of the opponent's experienced emotion. These results suggest that negotiators are especially influenced by their opponent's emotions when they are motivated and able to consider them.","[{'authorId': '5980688', 'name': 'Gerben A. van Kleef'}, {'authorId': '8494133', 'name': 'C.

The study adopted a cross-sectional design and used an online survey methodology. Data were collected from 418 doctors and nurses from one hospital in China. The results showed that frequency of healthcare disturbance was positively related to surface acting and depressive symptoms, respectively; surface acting was also positively related to depression, while deep acting showed no effect on symptoms of depression. Furthermore, surface acting in response to emotional labour mediated the relationship between healthcare disturbance and depressive symptoms.

Grounding our arguments in psychological literature on the effects of mood on information processing, motivation, and decision heuristics, we develop hypotheses about how mood can significantly affect individuals' use of structured decision protocols. In support of our hypotheses, results from an experimental study of complex decision-making suggest that, in situations where a structured decision protocol is the usual method of decision-making, individuals in moderately negative moods are significantly more likely than those in moderately positive moods to: (1) carefully execute all the steps of a structured decision protocol, (2) execute the steps of a structured decision protocol in the correct order, and (3) rely on the outcome of the structured decision protocol as the primary basis for the decision. We discuss these findings in terms of their implications for both organizational decision models and psychological models of mood and decision-making. In general, our findings help establish mood as an important variable in models of organizational decision-making and help shed light on often conflicting findings about the benefits of positive vs. negative mood for individual decision-making.","[{'authorId': '2642401', 'name': 'Kimberly D.

Several relatively short-acting small molecule κ-receptor antagonists have been synthesized, and their behavioral profile has been examined under some conditions. The hypothesis of this study is that pharmacological manipulations of the κ-receptor system will result in changes in ethologically relevant anhedonic-like behaviors in mice. Adult male C57BL/6j mice (n = 6–8) were examined for self-grooming behavior in the splash test (in which robust self-grooming is elicited by spraying the dorsum of the mouse with a sucrose solution). The κ-agonist salvinorin A (0.56–1.8 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent decreases in self-grooming, a marker of anhedonia. The selectivity, potency, and duration of action of two relatively short-acting κ-antagonists, LY2444296 [(S)-3-fluoro-4-(4-((2-(3-fluorophenyl) pyrrolidin-1-yl)methyl)phenoxy)benzamide] and LY2795050 [3-chloro-4-(4-(((2S)-2-pyridin-3-ylpyrrolidin-1-yl)methyl) phenoxy)benzamide], were studied for their effectiveness in preventing grooming deficits caused by salvinorin A (1.8 mg/kg). κ-selective doses of both LY2444296 (0.032–1 mg/kg) and LY2795050 (0.032–0.32 mg/kg) dose- and time-dependently prevented the grooming deficits caused by salvinorin A (1.8 m/kg). We also found that a κ-selective dose of each of these antagonists decreased immobility in the forced swim test, a common test of anti-anhedonia effects. This study shows that the κ-receptor system is involved in an ethologically relevant measure of anhedonia, and that κ-selective doses of these antagonists can produce effects consistent with rapid anti-anhedonia. Significance Statement Activation of the κ-opioid receptor system results in grooming deficits in mice, an ethologically relevant marker of anhedonia.

However, such an analysis ultimately fails to explain why emotions are aroused in the listener. In this article, we propose an alternative approach, which seeks to explain musical emotions in terms of a set of underlying mechanisms that are activated by different types of information in musical events. We illustrate this approach by reporting a listening experiment, which manipulated a piece of music to activate four mechanisms: brain stem reflex; emotional contagion; episodic memory; and musical expectancy. The musical excerpts were played to 20 listeners, who were asked to rate their felt emotions on 12 scales. Pulse rate, skin conductance, and facial expressions were also measured. Results indicated that target mechanisms were activated and aroused emotions largely as predicted by a multi-mechanism framework.","[{'authorId': '2663281', 'name': 'P.

The results in the case in which awareness implies total immunization to the disease revealed the existence of a metacritical point at which the critical onset of the epidemics starts, depending on completion of the awareness process. Here we present a full analysis of these critical properties in the more general scenario where the awareness spreading does not imply total immunization, and where infection does not imply immediate awareness of it. We find the critical relation between the two competing processes for a wide spectrum of parameters representing the interaction between them. We also analyze the consequences of a massive broadcast of awareness (mass media) on the final outcome of the epidemic incidence. Importantly enough, the mass media make the metacritical point disappear.

This phenotype conceptually lies within the domain of empathy, a bio-psycho-social process through which individuals come to share each other's emotion. Using a model of cue-conditioned fear, we show here that the expression of vicarious fear varies with respect to whether mice are raised socially or in solitude during adolescence. The impact of the adolescent housing environment was selective: (a) vicarious fear was more influenced than directly acquired fear, (b) ""long-term"" (24-h postconditioning) vicarious fear memories were stronger than ""short-term"" (15-min postconditioning) memories in socially reared mice whereas the opposite was true for isolate mice, and (c) females were more fearful than males. Housing differences during adolescence did not alter the general mobility of mice or their vocal response to receiving the unconditioned stimulus. Previous work with this mouse model underscored a genetic influence on vicarious fear learning, and the present study complements these findings by elucidating an interaction between the adolescent social environment and vicarious experience. Collectively, these findings are relevant to developing models of empathy amenable to mechanistic exploitation in the laboratory. (PsycINFO Database Record","[{'authorId': '32542837', 'name': 'J. B.

In this study, we sought to (a) examine if health care workers intensely involved in the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are experiencing negative psychological and emotional outcomes, and (b) investigate if helping related factors (prosocial motivation and perceived prosocial impact) exacerbate and mitigate relationships to negative outcomes in a crisis situation. Using data collected from doctors and nurses before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, we examine the relationship between intensity of involvement in the COVID-19 pandemic response and emotional exhaustion and depression, as well as the moderating effects of prosocial motivation and perceived prosocial impact. Data was collected at three time points (T1 and T2 prepandemic, and T3 during COVID-19), with prosocial motivation and controls collected at T1/T2 and predictors and outcomes collected during the pandemic. We find that intensity of involvement does associate with emotional exhaustion at work and that higher prosocial motivation exacerbates this relationship. Supplemental analyses suggest that the exposure to self-dimension of involvement is positively associated with emotional exhaustion and depression. Understanding the roles of prosocial motivation and prosocial impact in managing regulatory resources has important ramifications for health care workers on the frontlines of health crises responses, as these resources are necessary to manage the associated trauma.

In humans, nonlinear features are processed early in the auditory system, and are used to efficiently detect alarm calls and other urgent signals. Yet, high-level emotional and semantic contextual factors likely guide the perception and evaluation of roughness features in vocal sounds. Here we examined the relationship between perceived vocal arousal and auditory context. We presented listeners with nonverbal vocalizations (yells of a single vowel) at varying levels of portrayed vocal arousal, in two musical contexts (clean guitar, distorted guitar) and one non-musical context (modulated noise). As predicted, vocalizations with higher levels of portrayed vocal arousal were judged as more negative and more emotionally aroused than the same voices produced with low vocal arousal. Moreover, both the perceived valence and emotional arousal of vocalizations were significantly affected by both musical and non-musical contexts. These results show the importance of auditory context in judging emotional arousal and valence in voices and music, and suggest that nonlinear features in music are processed similarly to communicative vocal signals.","[{'authorId': '1750480', 'name': 'M.

 Machine learning algorithms have been applied to predict agent behaviors in real-world dynamic systems, such as advertiser behaviors in sponsored search and worker behaviors in crowdsourcing. Behavior data in these systems are generated by live agents: once systems change due to adoption of prediction models learnt from behavior data, agents will observe and respond to these changes by changing their own behaviors accordingly. Therefore, the evolving behavior data will not be identically and independently distributed, posing great challenges to theoretical analysis. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose to use Markov Chain in Random Environments (MCRE) to describe the behavior data, and perform generalization analysis of machine learning algorithms on its basis. We propose a novel technique that transforms the original time-variant MCRE into a higher-dimensional time-homogeneous Markov chain, which is easier to deal with. We prove the convergence of the new Markov chain when time approaches infinity. Then we obtain a generalization bound for the machine learning algorithms on the behavior data generated by the new Markov chain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that performs the generalization analysis on data generated by complex processes in real-world dynamic systems.

In modern times the field has gained more attention during the last couple of decades, especially for sports grounds and stadiums. Through analysis of some well-known historical crowd disasters and through a literature survey the aim has been to compile the most important findings. The aim has also been to analyze problem areas, knowledge and development opportunities. Regarding the problems of mass evacuation, preventive measures like design and contingency plan is of high importance. In addition there is a need for good communication and to take proper actions when an accident occurs. Some phenomenon that may arise during crowded situations have been found. These phenomenon are an indication that a catastrophic situation might emerge. With knowledge and understanding of those the expectation is, with the help of live video recordings and simulation softwares, to get a warning about the elevated risk for the crowd.","[{'authorId': '3058936', 'name': 'Markus T.

Understanding different within and between effects is crucial when choosing modeling strategies. The downside of Random Effects (RE) modeling—correlated lower-level covariates and higher-level residuals—is omitted-variable bias, solvable with Mundlak's (1978a) formulation. Consequently, RE can provide everything that FE promises and more, as confirmed by Monte-Carlo simulations, which additionally show problems with Plümper and Troeger's FE Vector Decomposition method when data are unbalanced. As well as incorporating time-invariant variables, RE models are readily extendable, with random coefficients, cross-level interactions and complex variance functions. We argue not simply for technical solutions to endogeneity, but for the substantive importance of context/heterogeneity, modeled using RE. The implications extend beyond political science to all multilevel datasets. However, omitted variables could still bias estimated higher-level variable effects; as with any model, care is required in interpretation.","[{'authorId': '119524764', 'name': 'Andrew Bell'}, {'authorId': '33470699', 'name': 'K.

We have demonstrated in mice that male but not female offspring prenatally exposed to Cort (33 µg/kg/h for 60 h beginning at E12.5) develop cardiovascular/renal dysfunction at 12 months. At 6 months of age, renal function was normal but male offspring had increased plasma aldosterone concentrations, suggesting that altered adrenal function may precede disease. This study investigated the long-term impact of prenatal exposure to Cort on adrenal growth, morphology and steroidogenic capacity as well as plasma Cort concentrations in offspring at postnatal day 30 (PN30), 6 months and 12 months of age. Prenatal Cort exposure decreased adrenal volume, particularly of the zona fasciculata, in male offspring at PN30 but increased both relative and absolute adrenal weight at 6 months of age. By 12 months of age, male Cort-exposed offspring had reduced absolute adrenal weight in association with increased adrenal plaque deposition (lipogenic pigmentation). Plasma Cort concentrations were elevated in male 6-month offspring but not at other ages. mRNA expression of Mc2r (ACTH receptor) was increased in males at PN30, and Cyp11a1 expression was decreased at 6 and 12 months of age. There were no changes in the adrenals of female Cort-exposed offspring. This study demonstrates that prenatal Cort exposure induces offspring adrenal gland dysfunction in an age- and sex-specific manner, which may contribute to long-term programmed disease in male offspring after maternal stress.","[{'authorId': '5394797', 'name': 'J.

For the current study, emotional job demands were conceptualised as comprising three components: exposure to emotionally demanding situations, emotional labour (use of deep and surface acting) and work focused on the emotional well-being of others. Both emotional job demands and ‘non-emotional’ job demands (that is, general demands such as those pertaining to workload, time constraints and curriculum issues) were hypothesised to predict emotional exhaustion. Two resources, social support and confidence in one’s own teaching practices (teaching self-efficacy [TSE]), were expected to have main and buffering effects. Primary school teachers (N = 556) completed an electronic questionnaire measuring all study variables. Consistent with hypotheses, general (non-emotional) job demands, emotional demands, social support and TSE, each uniquely predicted exhaustion. In addition, TSE buffered the negative effect of deep acting on emotional exhaustion. Findings shed light on the complexity of the job factors that contribute to the emotionally exhausting nature of school teaching, and suggest avenues for intervention. In particular, they show that strategies for enhancing professional self-efficacy may help teachers manage some of the emotional demands associated with their role.","[{'authorId': '114987839', 'name': 'Linda Marie Tuxford'}, {'authorId': '9831362', 'name': 'G.

The theories that have been developed in recent decades have focused on the social structures created by repeated exchanges and the ways in which these structures both constrain and enable actors to exercise power and influence. Other related social processes addressed within the exchange tradition include interpersonal commitment, trust, fairness, procedural and distributive justice, coalition formation and collective action. Recent work also focuses on emotions and their role in social exchange. The methodological challenges of studying social exchange in the laboratory and in the world outside the lab are addressed as well as links between exchange theory and topics under study by economic sociologists and network scholars more broadly, including Internet-mediated exchanges and their growing significance.","[{'authorId': '3634969', 'name': 'K.

Moving beyond a single case study, the authors examine previously published research in conjunction with data collected in nine brand communities comprising a variety of product categories, and they identify a common set of value-creating practices. Practices have an “anatomy” consisting of (1) general procedural understandings and rules (explicit, discursive knowledge); (2) skills, abilities, and culturally appropriate consumption projects (tacit, embedded knowledge or how-to); and (3) emotional commitments expressed through actions and representations. The authors find that there are 12 common practices across brand communities, organized by four thematic aggregates, through which consumers realize value beyond that which the firm creates or anticipates. They also find that practices have a physiology, interact with one another, function like apprenticeships, endow participants with cultural capital, produce a repertoire for insider sharing, generate consumption opportunities, evince brand community vitality, and create value. Theoretical and managerial implications are offered with specific suggestions for building and nurturing brand community and enhancing collaborative value creation between and among consumers and firms.","[{'authorId': '46178342', 'name': 'H.

For social organisms travelling in groups, like the fish in a school or the birds in a flock, sharing information can further improve their situational awareness and reaction times. Data on the benefits and costs of social coordination, however, have largely allowed our understanding of why collective behaviours have evolved to outpace our mechanistic knowledge of how they arise. Recent studies have begun to correct this imbalance through fine-scale analyses of group movement data. One approach that has received renewed attention is the use of information theoretic (IT) tools like mutual information, transfer entropy and causation entropy, which can help identify causal interactions in the type of complex, dynamical patterns often on display when organisms act collectively. Yet, there is a communications gap between studies focused on the ecological constraints and solutions of collective action with those demonstrating the promise of IT tools in this arena. We attempt to bridge this divide through a series of ecologically motivated examples designed to illustrate the benefits and challenges of using IT tools to extract deeper insights into the interaction patterns governing group-level dynamics. We summarize some of the approaches taken thus far to circumvent existing challenges in this area and we conclude with an optimistic, yet cautionary perspective.","[{'authorId': '50033609', 'name': 'K.

Guided by social presence theory and rhetorical and relational goals theory, 329 participants were randomly assigned into one of three manipulated social presence online learning conditions to watch a short lecture. The student perceptions of social presence, instructor–student rapport, and perceptions of the instructor competence were examined as influential factors in learning (i.e., perceived and actual recall). Generally, students' rhetorical and relational goals were more likely to be met in online courses that included higher levels of social presence via auditory and text or auditory, text, and visual components when compared to a text-only format. Further, students demonstrated better quiz performance in conditions with higher social presence. However, only instructor competence, and not social presence or instructor rapport, predicted students' quiz performance. In 2011, approximately 6.7 million students in the United States were taking at least one online course, an increase of 570,000 students from 2010 (Allen & Seaman, 2013).

Despite the growing popularity of online courses, many instructors, students, and administrators are hesitant to believe that online learning and computer-mediated communication (CMC) can be as effective as a face-to-face (F2F) course with live interaction. Bejerano (2008) summarizes common concerns, maintaining ""that online education cannot possibly replicate the learning that occurs in traditional face-to-face classrooms"" (p. 411) because students miss out on important interpersonal connections, some students lack the self-discipline to learn on their own, instructors find it effortful, time consuming, and relationally unrewarding, and online courses do not always meet learning objectives. These challenges may continue to plague online education when there is a ""failure to place pedagogy prior to technology,"" which ""results in little or no net instructional gain"" (Lane & Shelton, 2001, p. 248). Sherblom (2010) asserts that ""the challenge for the CMC classroom instructor is to choose the appropriate CMC medium (media richness), develop social presence within it (social presence), [and] devote the time, effort, and communication strategies required for effective interaction"" (p. 511).

Its original version was developed by Sheehan and Lecrubier. We translated the MINI into Japanese, and investigated the reliability and validity of the Japanese version of MINI. Eighty‐two subjects participated in the validation of the MINI versus the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM‐III‐R (SCID‐P). One hundred and sixty‐nine subjects participated in the validation of the MINI versus an expert's professional opinion. Seventy‐seven subjects were interviewed by two investigators and subsequently readministered by a third interviewer blind to the results of initial evaluation 1–2 days later. In general, kappa values indicated good or excellent agreement between MINI and SCID‐P diagnoses. Kappa values indicated poor agreement between MINI and expert's diagnoses for most diagnoses. Interrater and test–retest reliabilities were good or excellent. The mean durations of the interview were 18.8 min for MINI and 45.4 min for corresponding sections of SCID‐P. Overall, the results suggest that the MINI Japanese version succeeds in reliably and validly eliciting symptom criteria used in making DSM‐III‐R diagnoses, and can be performed in less than half the time required for the SCID‐P.","[{'authorId': '2379612', 'name': 'T.

Inspired by the theory of ""the devoted actor"", our model determines the movement of each individual by modeling the physical influence from physical strength and emotion. In particular, human physical strength is efficiently computed with a physiology-based method. Inspired by James-Lange theory, the emotion is determined by means of an enhanced susceptible-infectious-recovered model that leverages the inherent relation between the physical strength and the psychological emotion. As far as we know, this is the first time that we integrate physiological, psychological, and physical factors together in a unified manner, and the relationship between each other is explicitly determined. The results and comparisons with real-world video sequences verify that the new model is capable of generating effects similar to real-world scenarios. It can also reliably predict the changes in the physical strength and emotion of individuals in an emergency situation.

User-generated responses to videos that directly oppose pro-anorexia communities have not yet been researched in depth. Objective The aim was to study emotional reactions to pro-anorexia and anti-pro-anorexia online content on YouTube using sentiment analysis. Methods Using the 50 most popular YouTube pro-anorexia and anti-pro-anorexia user channels as a starting point, we gathered data on users, their videos, and their commentators. A total of 395 anorexia videos and 12,161 comments were analyzed using positive and negative sentiments and ratings submitted by the viewers of the videos. The emotional information was automatically extracted with an automatic sentiment detection tool whose reliability was tested with human coders. Ordinary least squares regression models were used to estimate the strength of sentiments. The models controlled for the number of video views and comments, number of months the video had been on YouTube, duration of the video, uploader’s activity as a video commentator, and uploader’s physical location by country. Results The 395 videos had more than 6 million views and comments by almost 8000 users. Anti-pro-anorexia video comments expressed more positive sentiments on a scale of 1 to 5 (adjusted prediction [AP] 2.15, 95% CI 2.11-2.19) than did those of pro-anorexia videos (AP 2.02, 95% CI 1.98-2.06). Anti-pro-anorexia videos also received more likes (AP 181.02, 95% CI 155.19-206.85) than pro-anorexia videos (AP 31.22, 95% CI 31.22-37.81). Negative sentiments and video dislikes were equally distributed in responses to both pro-anorexia and anti-pro-anorexia videos. Conclusions Despite pro-anorexia content being widespread on YouTube, videos promoting help for anorexia and opposing the pro-anorexia community were more popular, gaining more positive feedback and comments than pro-anorexia videos. Thus, the anti-pro-anorexia content provided a user-generated counterforce against pro-anorexia content on YouTube.

In major depression, a significant emotion recognition impairment has been reported. It remains unclear whether the ability to recognize emotion from facial expressions is also impaired in anxiety disorders. There is a need to review and integrate the published literature on emotional expression recognition in anxiety disorders and major depression. Methodology/Principal Findings A detailed literature search was used to identify studies on explicit emotion recognition in patients with anxiety disorders and major depression compared to healthy participants. Eighteen studies provided sufficient information to be included. The differences on emotion recognition impairment between patients and controls (Cohen's d) with corresponding confidence intervals were computed for each study. Over all studies, adults with anxiety disorders had a significant impairment in emotion recognition (d = −0.35). In children with anxiety disorders no significant impairment of emotion recognition was found (d = −0.03). Major depression was associated with an even larger impairment in recognition of facial expressions of emotion (d = −0.58). Conclusions/Significance Results from the current analysis support the hypothesis that adults with anxiety disorders or major depression both have a deficit in recognizing facial expression of emotions, and that this deficit is more pronounced in major depression than in anxiety.","[{'authorId': '2661817', 'name': 'L.

Using the critical incident method, the authors collected 700 incidents from customers of airlines, hotels, and restaurants. The incidents were categorized to isolate the particular events and related behaviors of contact employees that cause customers to distinguish very satisfactory service encounters from very dissatisfactory ones. Key implications for managers and researchers are highlighted.","[{'authorId': '38997560', 'name': 'M. J. Bitner'}, {'authorId': '114436147', 'name': 'B.
