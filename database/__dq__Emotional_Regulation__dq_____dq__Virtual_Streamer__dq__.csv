0,38155bff1ff6c2ee9d21972f950b0ebfb2b9eaab,Teaching Emotional Regulation and Awareness Through a Virtual Reality Rhythm Game,"Programs designed to promote social-emotional learning (SEL) in high-school students are increasingly being used in schools to facilitate academic and life success, including teaching how to identify and manage emotions. This paper explores the use of VR and drumming in emotional regulation through the development of HeartTune, a VR rhythm game that complements self-awareness and self-management learning. The game is developed with the participation of Coschool, a program in Colombia that uses culturally-appropriate experiences to teach emotional-regulation skills to at-risk youth, and seeks to help students develop skills such as relaxation techniques, emotional expression, and emotional literacy through culturally-situated rhythm gaming.",2022,29,0,"{'name': '2022 IEEE Games, Entertainment, Media Conference (GEM)', 'pages': '1-6'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Jaramillo2022TeachingER,\n author = {Laura Montenegro Jaramillo and Maria Bohorquez Arevalo and R.

Anxiety leads to substantial long-term problems and may underlie disruptive behaviors in the classroom as a result of the individual’s inability to tolerate anxiety-provoking situations. Thus, interventions in special needs schools that help adolescents cope with anxiety and, in turn, diminish disruptive classroom behaviors are needed. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a virtual reality biofeedback game, DEEP, on daily levels of state-anxiety and disruptive classroom behavior in a clinical sample. In addition, the study also aimed to examine the duration of the calm or relaxed state after playing DEEP. Methods A total of 8 adolescents attending a special secondary school for students with behavioral and psychiatric problems participated in a single-case experimental ABAB study. Over a 4-week period, participants completed 6 DEEP sessions. In addition, momentary assessments (ie, 3 times a day) of self-reported state-anxiety and teacher-reported classroom behavior were collected throughout all A and B phases. Results From analyzing the individual profiles, it was found that 6 participants showed reductions in anxiety, and 5 participants showed reductions in disruptive classroom behaviors after the introduction of DEEP. On a group level, results showed a small but significant reduction of anxiety (d=–0.29) and a small, nonsignificant reduction of disruptive classroom behavior (d=−0.16) on days when participants played DEEP. Moreover, it was found that the calm or relaxed state of participants after playing DEEP lasted for about 2 hours on average. Conclusions This study demonstrates the potential of the game, DEEP, as an intervention for anxiety and disruptive classroom behavior in a special school setting. Future research is needed to fully optimize and personalize DEEP as an intervention for the heterogeneous special school population.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 85, 'citationCount': 37, 'journal': {'volume': '7', 'name': 'JMIR Mental Health'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Bossenbroek2020EfficacyOA,\n author = {Rineke Bossenbroek and A.

The aim of this study was to examine pre-service teachers’ (PST) perceptions about VR, inclusive of their beliefs about its capacity to be used as a teaching and learning tool. A case-study, conducted at an urban university in Australia involved a sample of n = 41. Participants’ positive perceptions of VR in their teaching relate to its potential to engage learners, the immersive potential of the platform and the scope of VR to offer students experiences they might otherwise not have with other learning tools. Concerns expressed by PSTs include their relatively low self-efficacy to use VR in their teaching, monitoring-related matters, financial cost and implementing the technology in a safe and supportive way. There was a significant difference in PSTs’ amount of self-efficacy to teach using VR when compared to their overall confidence to use digital technologies. PSTs typically had greater awareness of the immersive and engagement potential of VR and less awareness about its potential to foster and promote collaborative learning.

They're learning how to handle new demands in school and social life while dealing with new, intense emotions (both positive and negative), and they're increasingly feeling that they should do so without adult guidance. Social and emotional learning (SEL) programs are one way to help them navigate these difficulties.SEL programs try to help adolescents cope with their difficulties more successfully by improving skills and mindsets, and they try to create respectful school environments that young people want to be a part of by changing the school's climate. In this article, David Yeager defines those terms and explains the changes that adolescents experience with the onset of puberty. Then he reviews a variety of SEL programs to see what works best with this age group.On the positive side, Yeager finds that effective universal SEL can transform adolescents' lives for the better. Less encouragingly, typical SEL programs—which directly teach skills and invite participants to rehearse those skills over the course of many classroom lessons—have a poor track record with middle adolescents (roughly age 14 to 17), even though they work well with children.But some programs stand out for their effectiveness with adolescents. Rather than teaching them skills, Yeager finds, effective programs for adolescents focus on mindsets and climate. Harnessing adolescents' developmental motivations, such programs aim to make them feel respected by adults and peers and offer them the chance to gain status and admiration in the eyes of people whose opinions they value."", 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 74, 'citationCount': 118, 'journal': {'volume': '27', 'pages': '73 - 94', 'name': 'The Future of Children'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Yeager2017SocialAE,\n author = {D.

A randomized controlled trial (n = 138) was conducted to test the effectiveness of a biofeedback video game (Dojo) for adolescents with elevated levels of anxiety. Adolescents (11–15 years old) were randomly assigned to play Dojo or a control game (Rayman 2: The Great Escape). Initial screening for anxiety was done on 1,347 adolescents in five high schools; only adolescents who scored above the “at-risk” cut-off on the Spence Children Anxiety Survey were eligible. Adolescents’ anxiety levels were assessed at pre-test, post-test, and at three month follow-up to examine the extent to which playing Dojo decreased adolescents’ anxiety. The present study revealed equal improvements in anxiety symptoms in both conditions at follow-up and no differences between Dojo and the closely matched control game condition. Latent growth curve models did reveal a steeper decrease of personalized anxiety symptoms (not of total anxiety symptoms) in the Dojo condition compared to the control condition. Moderation analyses did not show any differences in outcomes between boys and girls nor did age differentiate outcomes. The present results are of importance for prevention science, as this was the first full-scale randomized controlled trial testing indicated prevention effects of a video game aimed at reducing anxiety.

To address this gap, we review existing approaches to social and emotions skills learning (SEL) in other fields, with a specific focus on SEL in education, in which a large number of evidence-based programs is widely deployed. In doing so, the primary aim of this article is to provide a foundation and set an agenda for future research on the design of technology that would support, and help teach, social and emotional skills. We identify the key challenges to successful learning shared by SEL programs in education—such as embedding skills learned in class also into everyday situations, promoting reflection, and providing additional opportunities for practice—and outline how these could be addressed by digital technology. Overall, our key argument is that much existing HCI work could be used in support of social and emotional skills learning in education, and possibly other domains, but that the topic has not been explored so far.

The schools workpackage carried out a systematic review of reviews of work on mental health in schools from which it identified evidence-based interventions and programmes and extracted the general principles from evidence-based work. A systematic search of the literature uncovered 52 systematic reviews and meta-analyses of mental health in schools. The interventions identified by the reviews had a wide range of beneficial effects on children, families and communities and on a range of mental health, social, emotional and educational outcomes. The effect sizes associated with most interventions were generally small to moderate in statistical terms, but large in terms of real-world impacts. The effects associated with interventions were variable and their effectiveness could not always be relied on. The characteristics of more effective interventions included: teaching skills, focusing on positive mental health; balancing universal and targeted approaches; starting early with the youngest children and continuing with older ones; operating for a lengthy period of time and embedding work within a multi-modal/whole-school approach which included such features as changes to the curriculum including teaching skills and linking with academic learning, improving school ethos, teacher education, liaison with parents, parenting education, community involvement and coordinated work with outside agencies. Interventions were only effective if they were completely and accurately implemented: this applied particularly to whole-school interventions which could be ineffective if not implemented with clarity, intensity and fidelity.

Our commentary adds to these discussions by considering COVID-19, lockdown and (disability) sport. This is especially pertinent given the positioning of disabled people as particularly “vulnerable” in relation to current political discourse. Four key points of discussion are focused upon. First, we explore how the media has attended to issues concerning (disability) sport during lockdown. Second, consideration is given to how sporting and physical activity opportunities have been promoted during lockdown. Third, we focus on the notion of inclusion and explore the ways in which this has thrived during lockdown. Fourth, attention is given to community (disability) sport post-lockdown and what this may mean for disability sport.

However, many clinicians feel ill equipped to deliver therapy via telehealth, while adhering to evidence‐based interventions. This article draws together clinician experiences of the issues that should be attended to, and how to address them within a telehealth framework. Method Seventy clinical colleagues of the authors were emailed and invited to share their concerns online about how to deliver cognitive‐behavioral therapy for eating disorders (CBT‐ED) via telehealth, and how to adapt clinical practice to deal with the problems that they and others had encountered. After 96\u2009hr, all the suggestions that had been shared by 22 clinicians were collated to provide timely advice for other clinicians. Results A range of themes emerged from the online discussion. A large proportion were general clinical and practical domains (patient and therapist concerns about telehealth; technical issues in implementing telehealth; changes in the environment), but there were also specific considerations and clinical recommendations about the delivery of CBT‐ED methods. Discussion Through interaction and sharing of ideas, clinicians across the world produced a substantial number of recommendations about how to use telehealth to work with people with eating disorders while remaining on track with evidence‐based practice. These are shared to assist clinicians over the period of changed practice.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 30, 'citationCount': 111, 'journal': {'volume': '53', 'pages': '1132 - 1141', 'name': 'The International Journal of Eating Disorders'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Waller2020CognitivebehavioralTI,\n author = {G.

However, there are barriers that constrain group attendance, such as mobility, time, and distance. Using videoconferencing may overcome known barriers and improve the accessibility of group-based interventions. Objective The aim of this study was to review the literature to determine the feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, and implementation of health professional–led group videoconferencing to provide education or social support or both, into the home setting. Methods Electronic databases were searched using predefined search terms for primary interventions for patient education and/or social support. The quality of studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. We developed an analysis framework using hierarchical terms feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, and implementation, which were informed by subheadings. Results Of the 1634 records identified, 17 were included in this review. Home-based groups by videoconferencing are feasible even for those with limited digital literacy. Overall acceptability was high with access from the home highly valued and little concern of privacy issues. Some participants reported preferring face-to-face groups. Good information technology (IT) support and training is required for facilitators and participants. Communication can be adapted for the Web environment and would be enhanced by clear communication strategies and protocols. A range of improved outcomes were reported but because of the heterogeneity of studies, comparison of these across studies was not possible. There was a trend for improvement in mental health outcomes. Benefits highlighted in the qualitative data included engaging with others with similar problems; improved accessibility to groups; and development of health knowledge, insights, and skills. Videoconference groups were able to replicate group processes such as bonding and cohesiveness. Similar outcomes were reported for those comparing face-to-face groups and videoconference groups. Conclusions Groups delivered by videoconference are feasible and potentially can improve the accessibility of group interventions. This may be particularly useful for those who live in rural areas, have limited mobility, are socially isolated, or fear meeting new people. Outcomes are similar to in-person groups, but future research on facilitation process in videoconferencing-mediated groups and large-scale studies are required to develop the evidence base.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 72, 'citationCount': 195, 'journal': {'volume': '20', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Banbury2018TelehealthID,\n author = {Annie Banbury and S.

However, what the added value is of client feedback specifically within cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), is not known. Therefore, the extent to which the outcome of CBT can be improved is investigated by providing feedback from clients to therapists using the Outcome Rating Scale (ORS) and Session Rating Scale (SRS). Method: Outpatients (n\u2009=\u20091006) of a Dutch mental health organization either participated in the “treatment as usual” (TAU) condition, or in Feedback condition of the study. Clients were invited to fill in the ORS and SRS and in the Feedback condition therapists were asked to frequently discuss client feedback. Results: Outcome on the SCL-90 was only improved specifically with mood disorders in the Feedback condition. Also, in the Feedback condition, in terms of process, the total number of required treatment sessions was on average two sessions fewer. Conclusion: Frequently asking feedback from clients using the ORS/SRS does not necessarily result in a better treatment outcome in CBT. However, for an equal treatment outcome significantly fewer sessions are needed within the Feedback condition, thus improving efficiency of CBT.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 62, 'citationCount': 58, 'journal': {'volume': '27', 'pages': '525 - 538', 'name': 'Psychotherapy Research'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Janse2017ImprovingTE,\n author = {P.

The present study extends this work with the development and evaluation of a trans-diagnostic treatment manual for CBT in people with ID.\n\n\nMETHOD\nA controlled treatment trial was conducted with 12 participants in treatment and waiting list control data. Each treatment participant was matched to a control on age, IQ, presenting problem, and Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) global severity index (GSI) score. The treatment group was also evaluated on the Glasgow anxiety and depression scales and was followed up for 3 to 6 months after treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were no significant differences between groups at baseline. Following treatment, the CBT group was significantly improved when compared with the control group on the GSI scale of the BSI.

Literature suggests that the issues that are important in psychological therapy with the nonlearning disabled population should not lose significance with individuals with learning disabilities. Despite this, there exists a poor empirical and theoretical understanding of the complexities of the therapeutic relationship, when the individual has a learning disability. As a discipline, Counselling Psychology has a particular interest and skill base in understanding the therapeutic relationship and is therefore in a position to offer a valuable contribution to understanding the therapeutic relationship when an individual has a learning disability. Through eight semi-structured interviews, counselling psychologists currently working with individuals with learning disabilities were asked to share their experiences and understanding of the nature and role of the therapeutic relationship. A qualitative methodology guided by interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) enabled detailed exploration of the counselling psychologists' perspective. Themes emerged identifying the therapeutic relationship as fundamental yet difficult due to variables such as the client's experience in relationships, the need for multiple relationships, the experience of needing to facilitate reassurance and the necessary skills for therapeutic approaches. Themes also emerged relating to therapist's motivations, values and needs when working with this client group and tensions concerning individualisation and the setting culture. The themes are discussed in relation to the existing literature and implications for theory and practice are explored."", 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 15, 'citationCount': 22, 'journal': {'volume': '42', 'pages': '193-203', 'name': 'British Journal of Learning Disabilities'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': ""@Article{Jones2014TherapeuticRW,\n author = {Rachel Jones},\n journal = {British Journal of Learning Disabilities},\n pages = {193-203},\n title = {Therapeutic relationships with individuals with learning disabilities: a qualitative study of the counselling psychologists' experience},\n volume = {42},\n year = {2014}\n}\n""}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2109213497', 'name': 'Rachel Jones'}]}, {'paperId': 'b4c5ad0b39091941951532450c1a7bc604a8387c', 'title': 'Modeling contextual influences on parents with intellectual disability and their children.', 'abstract': ""Many parents with intellectual disability experience living conditions associated with risk for children and parents.

The present authors sought to (i) estimate the risk of poorer mental health among British adults with and without intellectual impairments and (ii) estimate the extent to which any between-group differences in mental health may reflect between-group differences in rates of exposure to common social determinants of poorer health.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThe present authors undertook secondary analysis of confidentialized unit records collected in Wave 3 of Understanding Society.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBritish adults with intellectual impairments living in general households are at significantly increased risk of potential mental health problems than their non-disabled peers (e.g. GHQ Caseness OR\xa0=\xa01.77, 95% CI (1.25-2.52), P\xa0<\xa00.001).

Emotional regulation represents a significant hallmark of cognitive development and an important achievement associated with social, behavioral, and academic competence; therefore, people with intellectual disabilities need to learn how to regulate their emotions appropriately. An approach to support the emotional regulation interventions of this population is interactive technology such as video games, interactive floors, and virtual reality.

3,850ce84d97927da3180ebe99d511ed84b99520f8,A Virtual Hope Box: Randomized Controlled Trial of a Smartphone App for Emotional Regulation and Coping With Distress.,"OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the Virtual Hope Box (VHB), a smartphone app to improve stress coping skills, suicidal ideation, and perceived reasons for living among patients at elevated risk of suicide and self-harm.


METHODS
The authors conducted a parallel-group randomized controlled trial with two groups of U.S. service veterans in active mental health treatment who had recently expressed suicidal ideation. Between March 2014 and April 2015, 118 patients were enrolled in the study. Participants were assigned to use the VHB (N=58) or to a control group that received printed materials about coping with suicidality (N=60) to supplement treatment as usual over a 12-week period. Three measures-the Coping Self-Efficacy Scale, Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, and Brief Reasons for Living Inventory-were collected at baseline (before randomization) and three, six, and 12 weeks. Secondary measures-the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale, and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale-were collected at baseline and 12 weeks.


RESULTS
VHB users reported significantly greater ability to cope with unpleasant emotions and thoughts (Coping Self-Efficacy Scale) at three (b=2.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]=.29-4.55) and 12 weeks (b=2.99, 95% CI=.08-5.90) compared with the control group. No significant advantage was found on other outcome measures for treatment augmented by the VHB.


CONCLUSIONS
The VHB is a demonstrably useful accessory to treatment-an easily accessible tool that can increase stress coping skills. Because the app is easily disseminated across a large population, it is likely to have broad, positive utility in behavioral health care.",2017,26,85,"{'name': 'Psychiatric services', 'pages': '\n          330-336\n        ', 'volume': '68 4'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bush2017AVH,\n author = {N.

Information Technology can have an effect on quality and efficiency of care. Aims: The aim of this study is to gain the viewpoint of service users from a local mental health service in developing a mental health app. Method: A qualitative descriptive approach was used. Eight volunteers aged 18–49 years were interviewed with the aid of a semi-structured questionnaire. Results: Interviewees defined a good app by its ease of use. Common themes included availability of contact information, identifying triggers, the ability to rate mood/anxiety levels on a scale, guided relaxation techniques, and the option to personalise the app. The researchers will aim to produce an app that is easily accessible, highly personalisable and will include functions highlighted as important (i.e. contact information, etc.). Conclusions: This research will assist in the development of an easy-to-use app that could increase access to services, and allow service users to take an active role in their care. In previous studies, apps were developed without the involvement of service users.

We have introduced a state-of-the-art method for the current study for remote behavioral monitoring that transports assessment out of the clinic and into the environments in which individuals negotiate their daily lives. The objective of this study was to examine whether the information captured with multimodal smartphone sensors can serve as behavioral markers for one's mental health. We hypothesized that (a) unobtrusively collected smartphone sensor data would be associated with individuals' daily levels of stress, and (b) sensor data would be associated with changes in depression, stress, and subjective loneliness over time.\n\n\nMETHOD\nA total of 47 young adults (age range: 19-30 years) were recruited for the study. Individuals were enrolled as a single cohort and participated in the study over a 10-week period. Participants were provided with smartphones embedded with a range of sensors and software that enabled continuous tracking of their geospatial activity (using the Global Positioning System and wireless fidelity), kinesthetic activity (using multiaxial accelerometers), sleep duration (modeled using device-usage data, accelerometer inferences, ambient sound features, and ambient light levels), and time spent proximal to human speech (i.e., speech duration using microphone and speech detection algorithms). Participants completed daily ratings of stress, as well as pre- and postmeasures of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; Spitzer, Kroenke, & Williams, 1999), stress (Perceived Stress Scale; Cohen et al., 1983), and loneliness (Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale; Russell, Peplau, & Cutrona, 1980).\n\n\nRESULTS\nMixed-effects linear modeling showed that sensor-derived geospatial activity (p < .05), sleep duration (p < .05), and variability in geospatial activity (p < .05), were associated with daily stress levels. Penalized functional regression showed associations between changes in depression and sensor-derived speech duration (p < .05), geospatial activity (p < .05), and sleep duration (p < .05). Changes in loneliness were associated with sensor-derived kinesthetic activity (p < .01).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE\nSmartphones can be harnessed as instruments for unobtrusive monitoring of several behavioral indicators of mental health. Creative leveraging of smartphone sensing could provide novel opportunities for close-to-invisible psychiatric assessment at a scale and efficiency that far exceeds what is currently feasible with existing assessment technologies."", 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 48, 'citationCount': 314, 'journal': {'volume': '38 3', 'pages': '\n          218-226\n        ', 'name': 'Psychiatric rehabilitation journal'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Ben-Zeev2015NextgenerationPA,\n author = {Dror Ben-Zeev and E.

Assessment of incidence of suicide attempts during the follow-up period was conducted with the Suicide Attempt Self-Injury Interview. Inclusion criteria were the presence of suicidal ideation with intent to die during the past week and/or a suicide attempt within the past month. Soldiers were excluded if they had a medical or psychiatric condition that would prevent informed consent or participation in outpatient treatment, such as active psychosis or mania. To determine treatment efficacy with regard to incidence and time to suicide attempt, survival curve analyses were conducted. Differences in psychiatric symptoms were evaluated using longitudinal random-effects models.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFrom baseline to the 24-month follow-up assessment, eight participants in brief CBT (13.8%) and 18 participants in treatment as usual (40.2%) made at least one suicide attempt (hazard ratio=0.38, 95% CI=0.16-0.87, number needed to treat=3.88), suggesting that soldiers in brief CBT were approximately 60% less likely to make a suicide attempt during follow-up than soldiers in treatment as usual. There were no between-group differences in severity of psychiatric symptoms.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBrief CBT was effective in preventing follow-up suicide attempts among active-duty military service members with current suicidal ideation and/or a recent suicide attempt.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 25, 'citationCount': 256, 'journal': {'volume': '172 5', 'pages': '\n          441-9\n        ', 'name': 'The American journal of psychiatry'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{David2015BriefCT,\n author = {M.

To optimize online assessment of suicidal patients, there is a need for short, good-quality tools to assess elevated risk of future suicidal behavior. Computer adaptive testing (CAT) can be used to reduce response burden and improve accuracy, and make the available pencil-and-paper tools more appropriate for online administration. Objective The aim was to test whether an item response–based computer adaptive simulation can be used to reduce the length of the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS). Methods The data used for our simulation was obtained from a large multicenter trial from The Netherlands: the Professionals in Training to STOP suicide (PITSTOP suicide) study. We applied a principal components analysis (PCA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), a graded response model (GRM), and simulated a CAT. Results The scores of 505 patients were analyzed. Psychometric analyses showed the questionnaire to be unidimensional with good internal consistency. The computer adaptive simulation showed that for the estimation of elevation of risk of future suicidal behavior 4 items (instead of the full 19) were sufficient, on average. Conclusions This study demonstrated that CAT can be applied successfully to reduce the length of the Dutch version of the BSS. We argue that the use of CAT can improve the accuracy and the response burden when assessing the risk of future suicidal behavior online.

There are several software options, including the use of native smartphone applications and text messages (short message service, SMS). Little is known about the strengths and limitations of these two approaches in monitoring symptoms in individuals with serious mental illness. Objective The objective of this study was to compare two different delivery modalities of the same diagnostic assessment for individuals with non-affective psychosis—a native smartphone application employing a graphical, touch user interface against an SMS text-only implementation. The overall hypothesis of the study was that patient participants with sewrious mental illness would find both delivery modalities feasible and acceptable to use, measured by the quantitative post-assessment feedback questionnaire scores, the number of data points completed, and the time taken to complete the assessment. It was also predicted that a native smartphone application would (1) yield a greater number of data points, (2) take less time, and (3) be more positively appraised by patient participant users than the text-based system. Methods A randomized repeated measures crossover design was employed. Participants with currently treated Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (Fourth Edition) schizophrenia or related disorders (n=24) were randomly allocated to completing 6 days of assessment (four sets of questions per day) with a native smartphone application or the SMS text-only implementation. There was then a 1-week break before completing a further 6 days with the alternative delivery modality. Quantitative feedback questionnaires were administered at the end of each period of sampling. Results A greater proportion of data points were completed with the native smartphone application in comparison to the SMS text-only implementation (β = -.25, SE=.11, P=.02), which also took significantly less time to complete (β =.78, SE= .09, P<.001). Although there were no significant differences in participants’ quantitative feedback for the two delivery modalities, most participants reported preferring the native smartphone application (67%; n=16) and found it easier to use (71%; n=16). 33% of participants reported that they would be willing to complete mobile phone assessment for 5 weeks or longer. Conclusions Native smartphone applications and SMS text are both valuable methods of delivering real-time assessment in individuals with schizophrenia. However, a more streamlined graphical user interface may lead to better compliance and shorter entry times. Further research is needed to test the efficacy of this technology within clinical services, to assess validity over longer periods of time and when delivered on patients’ own phones.', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 26, 'citationCount': 152, 'journal': {'volume': '15', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Ainsworth2013ACO,\n author = {J.

Consequently they represent ideal vehicles for disseminating psychological and other health resources and interventions. However, almost nothing is known about personal technology use in the U.S. military. We conducted the most comprehensive survey to date of the use, availability, and need for personal technologies by U.S. military service members. Our survey asked detailed questions about computers and the Internet, phones and smartphones, other mobile or portable technologies, gaming devices, and TV and video media used during deployment and at permanent duty station or home.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWe collected data by paper-and-pencil survey in 2010 and 2011 from 331 active Army service members at a processing and registration center in a large military installation in the western United States. Two cohorts were surveyed: Soldiers who had previously been deployed to a warzone and soldiers who had never been deployed.\n\n\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSION\nWe measured high rates of personal technology use by service members at home across all popular electronic media. Soldiers at home essentially resembled civilian consumers in their use of popular technologies. Some technologies, including the Internet, gaming, and TV, were widespread on deployment. Others, most notably cellphones, were more restricted by availability, connectivity, opportunity, and military regulation in the warzone.

Effective face-to-face treatments are Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT) and Problem Solving Treatment (PST). However, about two-thirds of persons who die by suicide have not been in contact with mental health care services in the preceding year, and many have never been treated. Furthermore, many patients do not disclose their suicidal thoughts to their care provider. This may be out of shame, due to fear of stigma or due to lack of trust in (mental) health care. Since many suicidal individuals seek information online, the internet provides an opportunity to reach suicidal individuals who would not be contacted otherwise. By providing a self-help intervention online, persons can anonymously learn to gain control over their suicidal thoughts. There is convincing evidence that self-help is effective for a number of mental disorders. In this study the effectiveness for suicidal thoughts is examined.Methods/DesignIn this study, a recently developed self-help intervention will be evaluated in a Randomized Controlled Trial. The intervention is based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and is aimed at subjects who experience mild to moderate suicidal thoughts. This is defined as a score between 1 and 26 on the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSS). Higher and lower scores are excluded. In addition, severely depressed subjects are excluded. In total, 260 subjects will be randomly allocated to the intervention-condition (N = 130) or to the information-control condition (N = 130). Self-report questionnaires will be filled out at baseline, 6 weeks after baseline and 18 weeks after baseline. Primary outcome measure is the reduction in frequency and intensity of suicidal thoughts. Secondary outcome measures are the reduction of hopelessness, anxiety and depression, sleeplessness, worry and quality of life measures.DiscussionThis study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based self-help intervention for suicidal thoughts.

Finally, the article shows that the correct effect size for treatment efficacy in GMA--the difference between the estimated means of the 2 groups at end of study (determined from the coefficient for the slope difference and length of study) divided by the baseline standard deviation--is not reported in clinical trials.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 67, 'citationCount': 662, 'journal': {'volume': '14 1', 'pages': '\n          43-53\n        ', 'name': 'Psychological methods'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Feingold2009EffectSF,\n author = {A.

Suicide ideation (dichotomized), hopelessness, and depression severity at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFrom baseline to the 18-month assessment, 13 participants (24.1%) in the cognitive therapy group and 23 participants (41.6%) in the usual care group made at least 1 subsequent suicide attempt (asymptotic z score, 1.97; P = .049). Using the Kaplan-Meier method, the estimated 18-month reattempt-free probability in the cognitive therapy group was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62-0.85) and in the usual care group was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.44-0.70). Participants in the cognitive therapy group had a significantly lower reattempt rate (Wald chi2(1) = 3.9; P = .049) and were 50% less likely to reattempt suicide than participants in the usual care group (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.26-0.997). The severity of self-reported depression was significantly lower for the cognitive therapy group than for the usual care group at 6 months (P= .02), 12 months (P = .009), and 18 months (P = .046). The cognitive therapy group reported significantly less hopelessness than the usual care group at 6 months (P = .045). There were no significant differences between groups based on rates of suicide ideation at any assessment point.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCognitive therapy was effective in preventing suicide attempts for adults who recently attempted suicide.', 'year': 2005, 'referenceCount': 44, 'citationCount': 897, 'journal': {'volume': '294 5', 'pages': '\n          563-70\n        ', 'name': 'JAMA'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Brown2005CognitiveTF,\n author = {Gregory K Brown and T.

To answer this question, a meta-review was conducted to assess the meta-analyses and systematic and narrative reviews published in this field in the last twenty-two months. Twenty-five different articles demonstrated the clinical potential of this technology in both the diagnosis and the treatment of mental health disorders: VR compares favorably to existing treatments in anxiety disorders, eating and weight disorders, and pain management, with long-term effects that generalize to the real world. But why is VR so effective? Here, the following answer is suggested: VR shares with the brain the same basic mechanism: embodied simulations. According to neuroscience, to regulate and control the body in the world effectively, the brain creates an embodied simulation of the body in the world used to represent and predict actions, concepts, and emotions. VR works in a similar way: the VR experience tries to predict the sensory consequences of an individual's movements, providing to him/her the same scene he/she will see in the real world. To achieve this, the VR system, like the brain, maintains a model (simulation) of the body and the space around it. If the presence in the body is the outcome of different embodied simulations, concepts are embodied simulations, and VR is an embodied technology, this suggests a new clinical approach discussed in this article: the possibility of altering the experience of the body and facilitating cognitive modeling/change by designing targeted virtual environments able to simulate both the external and the internal world/body."", 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 169, 'citationCount': 249, 'journal': {'volume': '22', 'pages': '82 - 96', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology, Behavior and Social Networking'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Riva2019NeuroscienceOV,\n author = {G.

VR provides an immersive experience into a simulated environment. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterised by social communication deficits and repetitive behaviours. Children with ASD often require social skills training while VR provides a safe, controllable environment to practice skills repeatedly. The Centre for Innovative Applications of Internet and Multimedia Technologies (AIMTech Centre) at City University of Hong Kong developed a VR-enabled training program to examine its efficacy on emotional and social skills with six VR scenarios depicting the daily lives of typical children in Hong Kong. 94 children from mainstream primary schools in Hong Kong completed the study and 72 children were included in the analysis. Children from training group scored higher on emotion expression and regulation (M = 20.2, SD = 3.00) than before the training (M = 18.9, SD = 3.57, t(35) = −2.174, p = .037) and higher on social interaction and adaptation after the training (M = 21.8, SD = 2.99) than before training (M = 20.2, SD = 3.43, t(35) = −3.987, p < .0005).

Children were able to engage in VR training despite initial challenges with viewing goggles. Some children declined to participate due to scheduling reasons which may be minimised through the adoption of head-mounted displays as a portable, cost-effective device.

Accurate timing is important for the interplay of neurons, neuronal circuitries, brain areas and human individuals. In the human brain, multiple temporal integration windows are hierarchically organized, with temporal scales ranging from microseconds to tens and hundreds of milliseconds for perceptual, motor and cognitive functions, and up to minutes, hours and even months for hormonal and mood changes. Accurate timing is impaired in several brain diseases. From the current repertoire of non-invasive brain imaging methods, only magnetoencephalography (MEG) and scalp electroencephalography (EEG) provide millisecond time-resolution; our focus in this paper is on MEG. Since the introduction of high-density whole-scalp MEG/EEG coverage in the 1990s, the instrumentation has not changed drastically; yet, novel data analyses are advancing the field rapidly by shifting the focus from the mere pinpointing of activity hotspots to seeking stimulus- or task-specific information and to characterizing functional networks. During the next decades, we can expect increased spatial resolution and accuracy of the time-resolved brain imaging and better understanding of brain function, especially its temporal constraints, with the development of novel instrumentation and finer-grained, physiologically inspired generative models of local and network activity.

The emotional regulation (ER) strategies that we use determine the way in which we feel, express, and behave. Moreover, ER strategies are particularly important in adolescents, a population for which ER strategy deficits can be linked to the appearance of numerous mental health disorders, such as depression or anxiety, or disruptive behaviors. Thus, the early detection of dysfunctional ER strategies and training in adaptive ER strategies can help prevent future occurrences of possible behavioral and psychosocial disorders. In this article, the authors present the GameTeen System (GT-System), a novel instrument based on virtual reality and serious games for the assessment and training of ER strategies in adolescents. The results of their preliminary evaluation suggest that this system can effectively train and evaluate emotional regulation strategies in adolescents.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 4, 'citationCount': 39, 'journal': {'volume': '35', 'pages': '65-73', 'name': 'IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Rodríguez2015AVS,\n author = {Alejandro Rodríguez and B.

Electroencephalograms (EEGs) are one of the techniques which provides an electrical representation of biosignals that reflect changes in the activity of the human brain. Monitoring the levels of anesthesia is a very important subject, which has been proposed to avoid both patient awareness caused by inadequate dosage of anesthetic drugs and excessive use of anesthesia during surgery. This article reviews the bases of these techniques and their development within the last decades and provides a synopsis of the relevant methodologies and algorithms that are used to analyze EEG signals. In addition, it aims to present some of the physiological background of the EEG signal, developments in EEG signal processing, and the effective methods used to remove various types of noise.

Methods:  Twenty adolescents with ASD participated in a six-session virtual reality driving simulator-based experiment, during which their electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded alongside driving events and a therapist's rating of their affective states and mental workload. Five feature generation approaches including statistical features, fractal dimension features, higher order crossings (HOC)-based features, power features from frequency bands, and power features from bins ($\\Delta \\boldsymbol{f} = 2\\;{\\rm{Hz}}$ ) were applied to extract relevant features. Individual differences were removed with a two-step feature calibration method. Finally, binary classification results based on the k-nearest neighbors algorithm and univariate feature selection method were evaluated by leave-one-subject-out nested cross-validation to compare feature types and identify discriminative features. Results: The best classification results were achieved using power features from bins for engagement (0.95) and boredom (0.78), and HOC-based features for enjoyment (0.90), frustration (0.88), and workload (0.86). Conclusion: Offline EEG-based group-level classification models are feasible for recognizing binary low and high intensity of affect and workload of individuals with ASD in the context of driving. However, while promising the applicability of the models in an online adaptive driving task requires further development. Significance: The developed models provide a basis for an EEG-based passive brain computer interface system that has the potential to benefit individuals with ASD with an affect- and workload-based individualized driving skill training intervention."", 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 43, 'citationCount': 71, 'journal': {'volume': '65', 'pages': '43-51', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Fan2018EEGBasedAA,\n author = {Jing Fan and Joshua W.

The term virtual reality is credited to Jaron Lanier, founder of VPL Research; earlier experimenters, like Myron Krueger in the mid-1970s, used phrases like artificial reality. William Gibson coined cyberspace in his 1984 science fiction novel. Neuromancer. Few technologies in recent years have evoked such fiery discussions in the technical community, and fewer still have sparked such passionate involvement of the humanities and the cultural sector. Maybe the humanities community reacts because the VR interaction is so tightly coupled to the human senses. Perhaps the cultural sector clamours for a role in the evolution of VR because the technology is finally interfacing with the human, rather than the human interfacing with the technology. Whatever the reasons, VR is more a convergence of previously disparate disciplines than a whole new branch of technology. It simply takes a fresh look at human interaction. Evolving from user interface design, flight and visual simulation, and telepresence technologies, VR is unique in its emphasis on the experience of the human participant. VR focuses the user's attention on the experience while suspending disbelief about the method of creating it. We feel that neither the devices used nor the level of interactiveness or fidelity determine whether a system is VR. The quality of the experience is crucial. To stimulate creativity and productivity. the virtual experience must be credible. The reality must both react to the human participants in physically and perceptually appropriate ways, and conform to their personal cognitive representations of the microworld in which they are engrossed.

From neuroscientific evidence, this mechanism is the product of conscious or unconscious processes. In particular, the mechanism generated by a conscious process needs a priori components to be computed. The behaviors generated by previous experiences are among these components. These behaviors need to be adapted to fulfill the objectives in a specific situation. The problem we address is how to endow virtual creatures with emotion regulation in order to compute an appropriate behavior in a specific emotional situation. This problem is clearly important and we have not identified ways to solve this problem in the current literature. In our proposal, we show a way to generate the appropriate behavior in an emotional situation using a learning classifier system (LCS). We illustrate the function of our proposal in unknown and known situations by means of two case studies. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to converge to the appropriate behavior even in the first case; that is, when the system does not have previous experiences and in situations where some previous information is available our proposal proves to be a very powerful tool.",2017,46,2,"{'name': 'Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience', 'volume': '2017'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rosales2017SearchFA,\n author = {Jonathan-Hernando Rosales and Félix F.

First we compared back pain-related brain activity between subjects who have had the condition for ∼2 months with no prior history of back pain for 1 year (early, acute/subacute back pain group, n = 94), to subjects who have lived with back pain for >10 years (chronic back pain group, n = 59). In a subset of subacute back pain patients, we followed brain activity for back pain longitudinally over a 1-year period, and compared brain activity between those who recover (recovered acute/sub-acute back pain group, n = 19) and those in which the back pain persists (persistent acute/sub-acute back pain group, n = 20; based on a 20% decrease in intensity of back pain in 1 year). We report results in relation to meta-analytic probabilistic maps related to the terms pain, emotion, and reward (each map is based on >200 brain imaging studies, derived from neurosynth.org). We observed that brain activity for back pain in the early, acute/subacute back pain group is limited to regions involved in acute pain, whereas in the chronic back pain group, activity is confined to emotion-related circuitry. Reward circuitry was equally represented in both groups. In the recovered acute/subacute back pain group, brain activity diminished in time, whereas in the persistent acute/subacute back pain group, activity diminished in acute pain regions, increased in emotion-related circuitry, and remained unchanged in reward circuitry. The results demonstrate that brain representation for a constant percept, back pain, can undergo large-scale shifts in brain activity with the transition to chronic pain. These observations challenge long-standing theoretical concepts regarding brain and mind relationships, as well as provide important novel insights regarding definitions and mechanisms of chronic pain.', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 91, 'citationCount': 561, 'journal': {'volume': '136 Pt 9', 'pages': '\n          2751-68\n        ', 'name': 'Brain : a journal of neurology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Hashmi2013ShapeSP,\n author = {J.

Animals first learned to associate a fixed sequence of Pavlovian cues with sucrose reward. Subsequent intraaccumbens microinjections of an opioid-stimulating drug increased the hedonic liking impact of sucrose in behavior and firing signals of ventral pallidum neurons, and likewise, they increased incentive salience signals in firing to the reward-proximal incentive cue (but did not alter firing signals to the learned prediction value of a reward-distal cue). Microinjection of a dopamine-stimulating drug instead enhanced only the motivation component but did not alter hedonic impact or learned prediction signals. Different dedicated neuronal subpopulations in the ventral pallidum tracked signal enhancements for hedonic impact vs. incentive salience, and a faster firing pattern also distinguished incentive signals from slower hedonic signals, even for a third overlapping population.

In a combined positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging study of mood disorders, we demonstrated that the mean gray matter volume of this “subgenual” ACC (sgACC) cortex is abnormally reduced in subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder, irrespective of mood state. Neuropathological assessments of sgACC tissue acquired postmortem from subjects with MDD or bipolar disorder confirmed the decrement in gray matter volume, and revealed that this abnormality was associated with a reduction in glia, with no equivalent loss of neurons. In positron emission tomography studies, the metabolic activity was elevated in this region in the depressed relative to the remitted phases of the same MDD subjects, and effective antidepressant treatment was associated with a reduction in sgACC activity. Other laboratories replicated and extended these findings, and the clinical importance of this treatment effect was underscored by a study showing that deep brain stimulation of the sgACC ameliorates depressive symptoms in treatment-resistant MDD. This article discusses the functional significance of these findings within the context of the preclinical literature that implicates the putative homologue of this region in the regulation of emotional behavior and stress response. In experimental animals, this region participates in an extended “visceromotor network” of structures that modulates autonomic/neuroendocrine responses and neurotransmitter transmission during the neural processing of reward, fear, and stress.

Higher scores on several measures assessing anxiety proneness (e.g., neuroticism, trait anxiety, and anxiety sensitivity) were associated with greater activation of the amygdala (predominantly left-sided) and the anterior insula (bilateral).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIncreased amygdala and insula reactivity to certain types of emotional processing is seen in young adults with increased anxiety-related temperamental traits. Therefore, this brain emotion-processing profile may be a functional endophenotype for proneness to (certain kinds of) anxiety disorders.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 77, 'citationCount': 799, 'journal': {'volume': '164 2', 'pages': '\n          318-27\n        ', 'name': 'The American journal of psychiatry'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Stein2007IncreasedAA,\n author = {M.

Do some emotion regulation strategies have more to recommend them than others? According to Gross's (1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271-299) process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners. This review concludes with a consideration of five important directions for future research on emotion regulation processes."", 'year': 2002, 'referenceCount': 83, 'citationCount': 3648, 'journal': {'volume': '39 3', 'pages': '\n          281-91\n        ', 'name': 'Psychophysiology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Gross2002EmotionRA,\n author = {J.

In this paper, we present a mechanism for an autonomous robot to regulate the intensity of its social interactions with a human. Similar to the feedback from infant to caregiver, the robot uses expressive displays to modulate the interaction intensity. This mechanism is integrated within a general framework that combines perception, attention, drives, emotions, behavior selection, and motor acts. We present a specific implementation of this architecture that enables the robot to react appropriately to both social stimuli (faces) and non-social stimuli (moving toys) while maintaining a suitable interaction intensity.

In this paper, we describe the design of Amy, a conversational agent that explains social situations to help guide a child in understanding when to use socially appropriate behavior. A breathing exercise feature for emotion regulation is activated when a negative emotion is detected from the child’s input. Interviews with parents and a child psychologist informed the design of Amy as well as the 12 social stories themes that Amy shares with children. Interview inputs and previous works suggested four design considerations for social-emotional learning companions to facilitate better interaction by including relevant social story themes, formulating open-domain conversation flow, incorporating appropriate and guided emotion regulation exercise, and using lively visual user interface.",2022,65,4,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 21st Annual ACM Interaction Design and Children Conference'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Gagan2022DesigningAV,\n author = {Isser Troy Gagan and Maria Angela Mikaela Matias and Ivy Tan and Christianne Marie Vinco and Ethel Ong and Ron R.

However, which of these “big three” health behaviors most strongly predicts mental health and well-being, and their higher-order relationships in predictive models, is less known. This study investigated the differential and higher-order associations between sleep, physical activity, and dietary factors as predictors of mental health and well-being in young adults. Method In a cross-sectional survey design, 1,111 young adults (28.4% men) ages 18–25 from New Zealand and the United States answered an online survey measuring typical sleep quantity and quality; physical activity; and consumption of raw and processed fruit and vegetables, fast food, sweets, and soda, along with extensive covariates (including demographics, socioeconomic status, body mass index, alcohol use, smoking, and health conditions) and the outcome measures of depressive symptoms [measured by the Center for Epidemiological Depression Scale (CES-D)] and well-being (measured by the Flourishing Scale). Results Controlling for covariates, sleep quality was the strongest predictor of depressive symptoms and well-being, followed by sleep quantity and physical activity. Only one dietary factor—raw fruit and vegetable consumption—predicted greater well-being but not depressive symptoms when controlling for covariates. There were some higher-order interactions among health behaviors in predicting the outcomes, but these did not survive cross-validation. Conclusion Sleep quality is an important predictor of mental health and well-being in young adults, whereas physical activity and diet are secondary but still significant factors. Although strictly correlational, these patterns suggest that future interventions could prioritize sleep quality to maximize mental health and well-being in young adults.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 70, 'citationCount': 51, 'journal': {'volume': '11', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Wickham2020TheBT,\n author = {Shay-Ruby Wickham and Natasha A.

With innovations ranging from ‘virtual psychotherapists’ to social robots in dementia care and autism disorder, to robots for sexual disorders, artificially intelligent virtual and robotic agents are increasingly taking on high-level therapeutic interventions that used to be offered exclusively by highly trained, skilled health professionals. In order to enable responsible clinical implementation, ethical and social implications of the increasing use of embodied AI in mental health need to be identified and addressed. Objective This paper assesses the ethical and social implications of translating embodied AI applications into mental health care across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology and Psychotherapy. Building on this analysis, it develops a set of preliminary recommendations on how to address ethical and social challenges in current and future applications of embodied AI. Methods Based on a thematic literature search and established principles of medical ethics, an analysis of the ethical and social aspects of currently embodied AI applications was conducted across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, the analysis was structured around the following three steps: assessment of potential benefits; analysis of overarching ethical issues and concerns; discussion of specific ethical and social issues of the interventions. Results From an ethical perspective, important benefits of embodied AI applications in mental health include new modes of treatment, opportunities to engage hard-to-reach populations, better patient response, and freeing up time for physicians. Overarching ethical issues and concerns include: harm prevention and various questions of data ethics; a lack of guidance on development of AI applications, their clinical integration and training of health professionals; ‘gaps’ in ethical and regulatory frameworks; the potential for misuse including using the technologies to replace established services, thereby potentially exacerbating existing health inequalities. Specific challenges identified and discussed in the application of embodied AI include: matters of risk-assessment, referrals, and supervision; the need to respect and protect patient autonomy; the role of non-human therapy; transparency in the use of algorithms; and specific concerns regarding long-term effects of these applications on understandings of illness and the human condition. Conclusions We argue that embodied AI is a promising approach across the field of mental health; however, further research is needed to address the broader ethical and societal concerns of these technologies to negotiate best research and medical practices in innovative mental health care. We conclude by indicating areas of future research and developing recommendations for high-priority areas in need of concrete ethical guidance.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 102, 'citationCount': 215, 'journal': {'volume': '21', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Fiske2018YourRT,\n author = {A.

Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short- and long-term positive outcomes. Objective This study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression. Methods In the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations. Results The average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre- and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging. Conclusions The real-world data evaluation findings on the effectiveness and engagement levels of Wysa app on users with self-reported symptoms of depression show promise. However, further work is required to validate these initial findings in much larger samples and across longer periods.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 55, 'citationCount': 332, 'journal': {'volume': '6', 'name': 'JMIR mHealth and uHealth'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Inkster2018AnEC,\n author = {B.

After reviewing some literature related to retrieval process, repetition is one effective way to promote retrieval process. Since repeated encounters of the words facilitate the students to access the words-related information in their mind, repetition activity will be the effective solution for this context. The spaced repetition as proposed by Baddley (1990) can be appropriate for this context since learners will not be bored about the repetition. This idea is then developed by providing students with Southeast Sulawesi folklore as the reading material in order to obtain target words.

Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and ACM Digital using a predefined search strategy. Studies were included if they focused on consumers or healthcare professionals; involved a conversational agent using any unconstrained natural language input; and reported evaluation measures resulting from user interaction with the system. Studies were screened by independent reviewers and Cohen’s kappa measured inter-coder agreement. Results The database search retrieved 1513 citations; 17 articles (14 different conversational agents) met the inclusion criteria. Dialogue management strategies were mostly finite-state and frame-based (6 and 7 conversational agents, respectively); agent-based strategies were present in one type of system. Two studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 1 was cross-sectional, and the remaining were quasi-experimental. Half of the conversational agents supported consumers with health tasks such as self-care. The only RCT evaluating the efficacy of a conversational agent found a significant effect in reducing depression symptoms (effect size d\u2009=\u20090.44, p\u2009=\u2009.04). Patient safety was rarely evaluated in the included studies. Conclusions The use of conversational agents with unconstrained natural language input capabilities for health-related purposes is an emerging field of research, where the few published studies were mainly quasi-experimental, and rarely evaluated efficacy or safety. Future studies would benefit from more robust experimental designs and standardized reporting.

However, current findings are lacking as to whether the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and cortical regions are involved in the learning effect when subjects retrieve associative memory, and whether their activations differentially change over time due to learning experience. To address these issues, we designed an fMRI experiment in which face-scene pairs were learned once (L1) or six times (L6). Subjects learned the pairs at four retention intervals, 30-min, 1-day, 1-week and 1-month, after which they finished an associative recognition task in the scanner. The results showed that compared to learning once, learning six times led to stronger activation in the hippocampus, but weaker activation in the perirhinal cortex (PRC) as well as anterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vLPFC). In addition, the hippocampal activation was positively correlated with that of the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and negatively correlated with that of the vLPFC when the L6 group was compared to the L1 group. The hippocampal activation decreased over time after L1 but remained stable after L6.

Additional research is needed to examine the efficacy of a transdiagnostic treatment approach, whereby the same treatment can be applied to multiple emotional problems, beyond solely anxiety. The purpose of the present study was to examine the efficacy of a manualized and individually delivered 10‐session, transdiagnostic CBT intervention, aimed at improving emotion regulation and mental health difficulties in children with ASD. Methods Sixty‐eight children (M age = 9.75, SD = 1.27) and their parents participated in the study, randomly allocated to either a treatment immediate (n = 35) or waitlist control condition (n = 33) (ISRCTN #67079741). Parent‐, child‐, and clinician‐reported measures of emotion regulation and mental health were administered at baseline, postintervention/postwaitlist, and at 10‐week follow‐up. Results Children in the treatment immediate condition demonstrated significant improvements on measures of emotion regulation (i.e., emotionality, emotion regulation abilities with social skills) and aspects of psychopathology (i.e., a composite measure of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, adaptive behaviors) compared to those in the waitlist control condition. Treatment gains were maintained at follow‐up. Conclusions This study is the first transdiagnostic CBT efficacy trial for children with ASD.

Transitioning away from screens is often painful, and predictive factors determine the pain of a transition.

Well-crafted questions lead to new insights, generate discussion, and promote the comprehensive exploration of subject matter. Poorly constructed questions can stifle learning by creating confusion, intimidating students, and limiting creative thinking. Teachers most often ask lower-order, convergent questions that rely on students’ factual recall of prior knowledge rather than asking higher-order, divergent questions that promote deep thinking, requiring students to analyze and evaluate concepts. This review summarizes the taxonomy of questions, provides strategies for formulating effective questions, and explores practical considerations to enhance student engagement and promote critical thinking.

For a long time, it has represented a sort of “oral encyclopedia” which, through narrative, has passed down from generation to generation traditions, customs and knowledge (Halverson, 1992). The role that storytelling played, even before the discovery of writing, in the diffusion of knowledge, in the construction of interpersonal relationships and in the birth of new societies, is well known. Without doubt writing is the earliest “technology” invented by man, through which culture and knowledge have been passed down over time, after having been transmitted orally for a long time. According to Barthes and Duisit (1975), in fact, storytelling begins with the same story of the human race, almost as if to represent an ontogenetically distinctive trait of the species, which unites homo sapiens with the homo digitalis of today’s society (Montag & Diefenbach, 2018). Other authors (Kenyon et al., 1996) argue that men and women not only have stories to tell, but that they are the stories they tell.

We use this mechanism to achieve goals and objectives. This paper proposes a model for emotional regulation in virtual agents based on biological evidence of human brain function. The evidence shows different brain activation during emotional regulation. The model defines the techniques that are implemented, the data flow, and the data processing in each brain area during the emotional regulation. In the case study, a virtual agent shows behavior changes when it takes into account the emotional regulation mechanism and when it does not.

Here, using psychophysiological interaction analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we show that activity in specific areas of the frontal cortex (dorsolateral, dorsal medial, anterior cingulate, orbital) covaries with amygdala activity and that this functional connectivity is dependent on the reappraisal task.

In effect, OFC calculates how rewarding a reward is. This value signal can then be held in working memory where it can be used by lateral prefrontal cortex to plan and organize behavior toward obtaining the outcome, and by medial prefrontal cortex to evaluate the overall action in terms of its success and the effort that was required.

Do some emotion regulation strategies have more to recommend them than others? According to Gross's (1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271-299) process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners.

The obligatory home confinement imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to new virtual learning methodologies. Objective: Our objective aimed to analyze and compare the cognitive emotional regulation of students from universities on the Spanish mainland with that of students attending the Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. Methods: An online Emotional Regulation Questionnaire was applied, together with a survey covering the students’ beliefs about the pandemic, including information about their housing conditions and beliefs about online learning. The study included a sample of 1030 university students. Results: On the mainland and at Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, the students most frequently used adaptive strategies. Three of the strategies were used in both groups but to different extents (Acceptance, Positive reappraisal, Putting into perspective), while the other strategies were used in both groups to the same extent (Refocusing on planning, Positive refocusing, Rumination, Blaming others, Catastrophizing, Self-blame).

Furthermore, tranquility, hope, gratitude, and joy were positively related to self-regulated learning, although, loneliness and disinterest were negatively related. Finally, it was found that an approach to coping strategies mediated the relationship between emotions and self-regulated learning.

La investigación obedece a un estudio mixto de alcance descriptivo en el que se combinan métodos cualitativos y cuantitativos. En primer lugar, se realizó un cuestionario a estudiantes de la Universidad de Extremadura (UEx) (n= 548) y a posteriori se efectuaron entrevistas online a miembros del equipo de gobierno de la universidad. Los resultados indican que los estudiantes procedentes de familias con un nivel formativo bajo tienen menos oportunidades de uso de tecnologías digitales. Las clases virtuales que han recibido han consistido esencialmente en presentaciones subidas al campus virtual con interacciones asíncronas. La valoración negativa que hacen de la enseñanza a distancia se explica por la inversa relación percibida entre dedicación al estudio y rendimiento académico y por falta de adaptación de los docentes a las circunstancias personales y académicas de los estudiantes.

The COVID-19 pandemic is a public emergency of international concern that affects several nations. The widespread outbreak of COVID-19 virus has brought not only the risk of death but also major psychological pressure. However, the psychological impact on university students has not been studied in Ethiopia. Objective To assess the psychological impacts of COVID-19 pandemic among university students in Bench-Sheko Zone, South-west, Ethiopia, 2020. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 15 to June 15/2020. A systematic sampling technique was employed to select the study participants. The data were entered into EpiData 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 24 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify candidates and independent factors respectively. Independent factors of depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed using AORs with 95% confidence level at P-value <0.05 cut point. Results Three hundred and twenty-two university students were included with a 97.5% response rate. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was 21.2%, 27.7%, and 32.5%, respectively. Being female, staying at home, history of medical illness, and poor and moderate social support increased the risk of depression. Not living with their parents, relatives got coronavirus and low family income were risk factors for anxiety. Moreover, substance use, depression, anxiety, and poor social support were increasing the risk of stress among university students. Conclusions and Recommendations This study revealed a higher prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among university students. Thus, governments and policy makers should develop health system strategies to provide crisis-oriented psychological services for university students to minimize the mental health impact of the outbreak.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 32, 'citationCount': 86, 'journal': {'volume': '13', 'pages': '813 - 821', 'name': 'Psychology Research and Behavior Management'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Aylie2020ThePI,\n author = {Nigusie Shifera Aylie and M.

Para la categoría Reacciones físicas, el ítem con más porcentaje en la clasificación alto fue el de Inquietud (este ítem presentó diferencias según la edad).

This paper is the first one which aims to investigate the anxiety of Chinese university students after the outbreak of COVID-19 right before the start of new spring term. 3611 university students (female: male = 1.48:1) aged between 18 to 24 from all over China were enrolled to this study from a top university in China. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale – SAS (Zung, 1971) was used to assess anxiety 2 days before the start of new spring term in middle February. All four-year undergraduate students were included in the study. The mean SAS score was 40.53 (SD = 10.15), significantly higher than the national norm (Mean = 29.78, SD = 10.07, and p ≤ .001), and there were still 557 (15.43%, Mean = 58.75, and SD = 8.9) students met the cutoff of 50 and were screened positive. Comparisons among sexes, grades and majors were also conducted. Significant differences were found between all males and all female (p ≤ .001), and between all students majoring arts and sciences in the anxiety sample (n = 557, p = 0.05).

Uncertain anticipation is a shared feature of situations that elicit signs and symptoms of anxiety across psychiatric disorders, species, and assays. Despite the profound significance of anxiety for human health and wellbeing, the neurobiology of uncertain-threat anticipation remains unsettled. Leveraging a paradigm adapted from animal research and optimized for fMRI signal decomposition, we examined the neural circuits engaged during the anticipation of temporally uncertain and certain threat in 99 men and women. Results revealed that the neural systems recruited by uncertain and certain threat anticipation are anatomically colocalized in frontocortical regions, extended amygdala, and periaqueductal gray. Comparison of the threat conditions demonstrated that this circuitry can be fractionated, with frontocortical regions showing relatively stronger engagement during the anticipation of uncertain threat, and the extended amygdala showing the reverse pattern. Although there is widespread agreement that the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and dorsal amygdala—the two major subdivisions of the extended amygdala—play a critical role in orchestrating adaptive responses to potential danger, their precise contributions to human anxiety have remained contentious. Follow-up analyses demonstrated that these regions show statistically indistinguishable responses to temporally uncertain and certain threat anticipation. These observations provide a framework for conceptualizing anxiety and fear, for understanding the functional neuroanatomy of threat anticipation in humans, and for accelerating the development of more effective intervention strategies for pathological anxiety. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Anxiety—an emotion prototypically associated with the anticipation of uncertain harm—has profound significance for public health, yet the underlying neurobiology remains unclear. Leveraging a novel neuroimaging paradigm in a relatively large sample, we identify a core circuit responsive to both uncertain and certain threat anticipation, and show that this circuitry can be fractionated into subdivisions with a bias for one kind of threat or the other. The extended amygdala occupies center stage in neuropsychiatric models of anxiety, but its functional architecture has remained contentious. Here we demonstrate that its major subdivisions show statistically indistinguishable responses to temporally uncertain and certain threat. Collectively, these observations indicate the need to revise how we think about the neurobiology of anxiety and fear.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 173, 'citationCount': 50, 'journal': {'volume': '40', 'pages': '7949 - 7964', 'name': 'The Journal of Neuroscience'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Hur2020AnxietyAT,\n author = {Juyoen Hur and Jason F.

Total of 4872 participants from 31 provinces and autonomous regions were involved in the current study. Besides demographics and social media exposure (SME), depression was assessed by The Chinese version of WHO-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and anxiety was assessed by Chinese version of generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7). multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify associations between social media exposure with mental health problems after controlling for covariates. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and combination of depression and anxiety (CDA) was 48.3% (95%CI: 46.9%-49.7%), 22.6% (95%CI: 21.4%-23.8%) and 19.4% (95%CI: 18.3%-20.6%) during COVID-19 outbroke in Wuhan, China.

Student participants (N\u2009=\u2009302) completed a survey about their most demanding class of the semester and reported on how demanding the class was, how much stress they experienced related to the class, and how often student peers communicated academic support in the class. A conditional process analysis revealed that (a) academic demands were positively associated with academic stress, (b) academic support from peers buffered the negative effect of stress on academic performance (moderation), and (c) academic demands produced a negative indirect effect on academic performance through stress, but this indirect effect was buffered by student academic support (moderated mediation). This study provides evidence that students earn lower grades when academic demands create stressors, but highlights the importance of peers communicating support in mitigating the effects of these stressors on grades.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 81, 'citationCount': 11, 'journal': {'volume': '69', 'pages': '335 - 355', 'name': 'Communication Education'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Knoster2020ACP,\n author = {Kevin C.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the use of cognitive emotional regulation strategies on high school students’ anxiety level. To this end, the Spanish adaptation of the CER-Q and the Spanish adaptation of the STAI were applied to a sample of 266 high school students. A multiple linear regression model was proposed, where anxiety level was the dependent variable, and the use frequencies of emotional regulation strategies were the independent variables. Gender was also considered as an independent variable since the data showed differences in anxiety level and in the use of emotional regulation strategies between male and female subjects. The model explained 46.3% of the variance, and the predictive variables were Self-blame, Positive Reinterpretation, Catastrophizing, Rumination and gender.

The study included 341 articles (19% unpublished) gathered through a search in PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, ERIC, and ProQuest, and a hand search of 11 relevant journals. Using a random effects model, the overall effect size based on k = 341 studies and N = 273,149 participants was r = .26 (95% CI [.24, .28]), with robust support for the GB model and support for the SB model among medically ill youth. Stress-buffering analyses suggest that different stressful contexts may not allow youth to fully draw on the benefits of social support, and we propose value in seeking to better understand both stress-buffering (effects of social support are enhanced) and reverse stress-buffering (effects of social support are dampened) processes. Key findings regarding other moderators include a different pattern of effect sizes across various sources of support. In addition, gender differences were largely absent from this study, suggesting that social support may be a more critical resource for boys than is typically acknowledged. Results also demonstrated the importance of using instruments with adequate psychometric support, with careful consideration of methodological and conceptual issues.

Yet, it is unclear whether these strategies represent distinct cognitive styles associated with psychopathology, such that there are individuals who are predominantly “suppressors” or “reappraisers.” Using cluster analysis, we examined whether women with and without exposure to potentially traumatic events evidence distinct patterns of emotion regulation frequency, capacity, suppression, and cognitive reappraisal. Four patterns emerged: high regulators; high reappraisers/low suppressors; moderate reappraisers/low suppressors; and low regulators. Individuals who reported infrequently and ineffectively regulating their emotions (low regulators) also reported higher depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In contrast, individuals who reported frequently and effectively using reappraisal and low levels of suppression (high reappraisers/low suppressors) reported the lowest levels of these symptoms, suggesting that this specific combination of emotion regulation may be most adaptive. Our findings highlight that the capacity to regulate emotions and the ability to flexibly apply different strategies based on the context and timing may be associated with reduced psychopathology and more adaptive functioning.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 79, 'citationCount': 197, 'journal': {'volume': '22', 'pages': '571 - 586', 'name': 'Anxiety, Stress, & Coping'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Eftekhari2009PatternsOE,\n author = {A.

We describe a new rating scale to assess resilience. The Connor‐Davidson Resilience scale (CD‐RISC) comprises of 25 items, each rated on a 5‐point scale (0–4), with higher scores reflecting greater resilience. The scale was administered to subjects in the following groups: community sample, primary care outpatients, general psychiatric outpatients, clinical trial of generalized anxiety disorder, and two clinical trials of PTSD. The reliability, validity, and factor analytic structure of the scale were evaluated, and reference scores for study samples were calculated. Sensitivity to treatment effects was examined in subjects from the PTSD clinical trials. The scale demonstrated good psychometric properties and factor analysis yielded five factors. A repeated measures ANOVA showed that an increase in CD‐RISC score was associated with greater improvement during treatment. Improvement in CD‐RISC score was noted in proportion to overall clinical global improvement, with greatest increase noted in subjects with the highest global improvement and deterioration in CD‐RISC score in those with minimal or no global improvement. The CD‐RISC has sound psychometric properties and distinguishes between those with greater and lesser resilience. The scale demonstrates that resilience is modifiable and can improve with treatment, with greater improvement corresponding to higher levels of global improvement.

In the increasingly specialized discipline of psychology, the field of emotion regulation cuts across traditional boundaries and provides common ground.

All these factors may have caused significant stress and led to anxiety and depression in students. The purpose of this study was to study the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 associated mental health morbidity in students in the United States (US). Methods: A online cross-sectional survey was conducted using two instruments – the Perceived Stress Scale-4 (PSS-4) and the Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety-4 (PHQ-4). The survey was administered in the months of March to June during the COVID-19 pandemic to both high school and undergraduate college students. Results: In total, 369 students agreed to participate: 51.8% were male, 44.1% were college students. An elevated perceived stress level (PSS4 > 8) and a positive mood disorder (PHQ-4 > 4) was present in 49.6% and 56.6% of respondents, respectively. The mean (SD) PSS scores in males and females were 6.7 (2.7) and 8.2 (2.9) respectively among all the respondents, while the mean (SD) PHQ scores in males and females were 3.7 (3.2) and 5.3 (3.2) respectively. Prevalence of anxiety and depression in the respondents was 35.0% and 36.3% respectively. Females students reported higher PSS and PHQ scores compared to male students. There is a significant correlation between PSS and PHQ (r=0.66) Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an extremely high level of stress and mental health morbidity in both high school and college students, and this is more pronounced in females.

9,efcd2446ea5388aa794129192aa094ff65bb9455,Social Emotional Learning in Virtual Settings: Intervention Strategies,"In mid-March of 2020, schools in the United States shut down in-person learning due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Due to this unprecedented situation, school education hassince shifted to a heavy reliance on various forms of remote learning, and teachers and students have been forced to practice completely new ways of teaching and learning.Virtual learning requires students to draw from a different skill set than what is used in face-to-face settings, such as self-regulation for navigating online learning, or balancinglearning and life at home. These new and challenging experiences coincide with limited opportunities for social engagement and an increased potential for isolation. These factors are continuing to contribute to children experiencing high levels of stress as the sense of normalcy is lost from their lives and they are bombarded with new expectations and responsibilities. Children need social and emotional support now more than ever. In this paper, we discuss how integrating Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) in daily lessons can benefit children now working in virtual settings, with sample activities organized aroundcognitive regulation, emotional regulation, and social skills. We address both explicit SEL instruction methodologies and ongoing teaching practices designed to promote SEL.",2021,31,12,{'name': 'lnternational Electronic Journal of Elementary Education'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Kamei2021SocialEL,\n author = {Ai Kamei and Wendy A.

Classrooms with warm teacher-child relationships support deep learning and positive social and emotional development among students, writes Kimberly Schonert-Reichl. But when teachers poorly manage the social and emotional demands of teaching, students' academic achievement and behavior both suffer. If we don't accurately understand teachers' own social-emotional wellbeing and how teachers influence students' SEL, says Schonert-Reichl, we can never fully know how to promote SEL in the classroom.How can we boost teachers' social-emotional competence, and how can we help them create the kind of classroom environment that promotes students' SEL? Teachers are certainly at risk for poor social-emotional wellbeing. Research shows that teaching is one of the most stressful occupations; moreover, stress in the classroom is contagious—simply put, stressed-out teachers tend to have stressed-out students. In the past few years, several interventions have specifically sought to improve teachers' social-emotional competence and stress management in school, and Schonert-Reichly reviews the results, many of which are promising.She also shows how teachers' beliefs—about their own teaching efficacy, or about whether they receive adequate support, for example—influence the fidelity with which they implement SEL programs in the classroom. When fidelity is low, SEL programs are less successful. Finally, she examines the extent to which US teacher education programs prepare teacher candidates to promote their own and their students' social-emotional competence, and she argues that we can and should do much more."", 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 59, 'citationCount': 253, 'journal': {'volume': '27', 'pages': '137 - 155', 'name': 'The Future of Children'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Schonert-Reichl2019SocialAE,\n author = {K.

Emily J. Doolittle is team lead for social behavioral research in the National Center for Education Research, Institute of Education Sciences, US Department of Education. Research increasingly suggests that social and emotional learning (SEL) matters a great deal for important life outcomes like success in school, college entry and completion, and later earnings. This research also tells us that SEL can be taught and nurtured in schools so that students increase their ability to integrate thinking, emotions, and behavior in ways that lead to positive school and life outcomes. Although the term social and emotional learning has been around for 20 years, we’ve recently seen a rapid surge in interest in SEL among parents, educators, and policymakers. For example, the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) is supporting 10 large school districts and 45 smaller ones through its Collaborating Districts Initiative as they begin to incorporate a variety of SEL programs and practices into their schools. CASEL also recently launched a Collaborating States Initiative to support states as they develop policies, standards, and guidelines for SEL in schools. All 50 states have SEL standards in place at the preschool level, and four (Illinois, Kansas, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania) have SEL standards for kindergarten through 12th grade. And the Aspen Institute recently launched a National Commission on Social, Emotional, and Academic Development to explore how schools can fully integrate SEL into policies and instruction that have traditionally emphasized academics. We also know that teachers believe SEL skills can be taught, although they may not always know the best way to do so in their classrooms.1', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 12, 'citationCount': 114, 'journal': {'volume': '27', 'pages': '11 - 3', 'name': 'The Future of Children'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Jones2017SocialAE,\n author = {Stephanie M.

The present observational study used hierarchical linear modeling to examine predictors of children's social and self-regulatory outcomes in first-grade classrooms.

Participants were 178 students and 36 teachers in seven rural schools. Results indicated higher teacher emotional support related to lower child aggression and higher behavioral self-control. Emotional support was equally important for all children regardless of the number of sociodemographic risk factors. Results provide evidence for the contribution of teacher behaviors to students' social behaviors and self-regulatory skills, and suggest the importance of classroom interactions in children's acquisition of social and emotional competence.

Results support an association between exposure to Hurricane Katrina and reactive aggression via posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and poorly regulated emotion. The proposed model fits well for both boys and girls; however, results suggest that minority youth in this sample were more likely to experience emotional dysregulation in relation to posttraumatic stress than Caucasian youth. Further, results indicate that hurricane exposure, PTSD symptoms, and poorly regulated emotion are associated with reactive aggression even after controlling for proactive aggression. These findings have implications for postdisaster mental health services. Researchers examining mental health problems in youth after a significant disaster have traditionally focused on the presence of internalizing problems such as anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, with very little empirical attention paid to the incidence of post-disaster externalizing problems such as aggression.

A meta-analysis of the results shows that early math skills have the greatest predictive power, followed by reading and then attention skills.

Investigating the neural underpinnings of adaptive emotion regulation and the extent to which such processes are compromised in MDD may be helpful in understanding the pathophysiology of depression. We report results from a functional magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrating left-lateralized activation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) when downregulating negative affect in nondepressed individuals, whereas depressed individuals showed bilateral PFC activation. Furthermore, during an effortful affective reappraisal task, nondepressed individuals showed an inverse relationship between activation in left ventrolateral PFC and the amygdala that is mediated by the ventromedial PFC (VMPFC). No such relationship was found for depressed individuals, who instead show a positive association between VMPFC and amygdala. Pupil dilation data suggest that those depressed patients who expend more effort to reappraise negative stimuli are characterized by accentuated activation in the amygdala, insula, and thalamus, whereas nondepressed individuals exhibit the opposite pattern. These findings indicate that a key feature underlying the pathophysiology of major depression is the counterproductive engagement of right prefrontal cortex and the lack of engagement of left lateral-ventromedial prefrontal circuitry important for the downregulation of amygdala responses to negative stimuli.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 53, 'citationCount': 947, 'journal': {'volume': '27', 'pages': '8877 - 8884', 'name': 'The Journal of Neuroscience'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Johnstone2007FailureTR,\n author = {T.

They are mainly caused by the failures of the drivers to perceive the changes of the traffic lights or the unexpected conditions happening accidentally on the roads. In this paper, we devised a quantitative analysis for assessing driver's cognitive responses by investigating the neurobiological information underlying electroencephalographic (EEG) brain dynamics in traffic-light experiments in a virtual-reality (VR) dynamic driving environment. The VR technique allows subjects to interact directly with the moving virtual environment instead of monotonic auditory and visual stimuli, thereby provides interactive and realistic tasks without the risk of operating on an actual machine. Independent component analysis (ICA) is used to separate and extract noise-free ERP signals from the multi-channel EEG signals. A temporal filter is used to solve the time-alignment problem of ERP features and principle component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce feature dimensions. The dimension-reduced features are then input to a self-constructing neural fuzzy inference network (SONFIN) to recognize different brain potentials stimulated by red/green/yellow traffic events, the accuracy can be reached 87% in average eight subjects in this visual-stimuli ERP experiment. It demonstrates the feasibility of detecting and analyzing multiple streams of ERP signals that represent operators' cognitive states and responses to task events."", 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 19, 'citationCount': 104, 'journal': {'volume': '54', 'pages': '1349-1352', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Lin2007EEGBasedAO,\n author = {Chin-Teng Lin and I.

11,632afe17608c32e8318ba8c1a2e42b617671012d,Investigating the Feasibility of Virtual Reality for Emotion Regulation with Youth,"Investigating the Feasibility of Virtual Reality for Emotion Regulation with Youth Background: In the last ten years, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has seen a rise in research on how features of interactive technologies can be designed to enhance emotion regulation training [1]–a response in part due to the increase of mental health issues. Youth are a vulnerable population at risk for mental health issues with long wait times to get help [2]. Emotion regulation, the ability to modulate the intensity and duration of emotional states, has been explored as a trans-diagnostic intervention to improve mental health [3]. Youth aged 12-15 use less adaptive or maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (e.g., suppression) that can contribute to depression or anxiety disorders. Thus, training adaptive emotion regulation skills is crucial for this age group [4]. One of the most effective emotion regulation strategies for youth is cognitive reappraisal–changing how we think about a situation in order to decrease its emotional impact [5]. However, learning is difficult because it requires: (1) generation of meaningful emotionally laden social situations; (2) real-time feedback of internal psychological and physiological states; and (3) practice modifying the interpretation of multiple situations [6]. Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated 3D environment that allows the user to experience a simulated world through stereoscopic 360 visuals, stereo audio, and 3D interaction with tracking sensors. The affordances of VR have been shown to strongly affect human emotional responses and interpretations of social situations when used in other intervention contexts [7]. As such, VR may provide unique opportunities for cognitive reappraisal skills development through three mechanisms: Mechanism #1: virtual environment–a simulated world that evokes the visceral experience of a realistic emotional response; Mechanism #2: interaction & feedback–possibilities to control and modify emotionally evocative aspects of the virtual environment; Mechanism #3: taking multiple perspectives–the ability to put the user in another’s shoes. As an example, you put on a VR headset and find yourself walking down the halls on the first day of high school; there are lots of new faces and you hope to make a good first impression (Mech #1). You hear the sound of your heart beating and your breathing getting heavier and uneven, and other kids laughing–are they laughing at you (Mech #2)? Luckily, you have a super power that allows you to embody other peoples’ perspectives (Mech #3). You take the VR controller, point it at the older kid who was laughing, and teleport into their virtual body (Mech #2). Suddenly, you can see yourself from their perspective and hear their thoughts–“look at all these new kids. I remember my first day I tripped down the stairs and broke a tooth. So embarrassing!” (Mech #3). You teleport back to your body and hear your heart rate drop to indicate that you have regulated the anxiety response (Mech #2). They weren’t laughing at you, but empathizing with your experience. Seeing and understanding this new perspective is cognitively reappraising the event. In this scenario, VR offers youth a way to practice cognitive reappraisal in a safe, meaningful, and emotionally laden environment with real-time feedback; thus meeting the reappraisal requirements (1-3) listed above, which are normally difficult to meet. Objectives & Research Questions: There is a rise in VR’s accessibility and popularity among youth (e.g., Oculus Quest 2 VR headset does not require a computer, costs $400 CAD, and has sold over 5 million units). My expertise in technology development of VR systems and content, design for mental health, and field evaluation skills make me well positioned to take this unique opportunity to investigate the overarching research question: can the above three VR mechanisms (Mechanisms #1-3) address the three learning requirements of cognitive reappraisal skill development in youth aged 12-15? Methodology: I will conduct research that investigates the following research questions that derive from my objectives above: (1) Requirements: What are the minimum technical and design requirements for a VR platform to help youth learn and practice emotion regulation? (2) Usability: What are the system and interface usability factors that youth suggest for the VR prototypes? (3) Feasibility: What is the feasibility of using VR’s three mechanisms to address the three learning requirements of cognitive reappraisal skill development during a six-week deployment with youth in their homes? (4) Efficacy: What are the subjective indicators of effects on cognitive reappraisal skills development (whether positive or negative) reported by youth? I will answer these research questions in three phases.",2022,9,0,"{'name': 'ArXiv', 'volume': 'abs/2212.00002'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kitson2022InvestigatingTF,\n author = {Alexandra Kitson},\n booktitle = {arXiv.org},\n journal = {ArXiv},\n title = {Investigating the Feasibility of Virtual Reality for Emotion Regulation with Youth},\n volume = {abs/2212.00002},\n year = {2022}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '11189596', 'name': 'Alexandra Kitson'}]","[{'paperId': '65969e26ac088c110ba4025847141d64f68836bc', 'title': 'Interactive Technologies for Emotion Regulation Training: A Scoping Review', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2022, 'referenceCount': 133, 'citationCount': 4, 'journal': {'volume': '168', 'pages': '102906', 'name': 'Int.

12,ea8467e1d26f472a5fc8579d0fc8372149283acc,Socially Supported by an Embodied Agent: The Development of a Virtual-Reality Paradigm to Study Social Emotion Regulation,"Social emotion regulation, which can be understood as the intentional efforts by one person to regulate emotions of another person, is something we encounter and benefit from every day, and becomes especially important when a person is unable to handle an emotion or an emotional event by themselves. A paradigm that examines whether someone can perceive and benefit from regulatory efforts by another person, represented here by a virtual agent, would be highly relevant for experimental studies investigating social emotion regulation, as well as for interventions in the clinical and sub-clinical context. Virtual reality (VR) provides perhaps the ideal opportunity to test social interactions and difficulties with them, as it counters typical methodological problems of behavioral experiments, such as the trade-off between ecological validity and experimental control, as well as the difficulty of replicating social situations. The goal of the present methods paper is twofold: to provide a detailed description of the development of a novel paradigm consisting of two scenarios in VR designed to test the efficacy of social emotion regulation, and to present the anticipated results for the target populations of typically developing and autistic youth. Participants are presented with a virtual school environment and take part in two activities with a class of students and a teacher, all of whom are virtual agents. In both scenarios, participants experience a potentially stressful situation and are subsequently offered emotional support by a friendly student. Throughout the experiment, self-reports in the form of virtual smiley scales and psychophysiological measurements are collected as markers of the participants’ emotional states. Pilot results will be discussed in line with anticipated outcomes, to indicate that the experiment will be able to show the efficacy of social support by a virtual agent and provide insight into social emotion regulation for different populations. The school environment and the character of the friendly student also have the potential to be adapted for follow-up experiments on additional aspects of social emotion regulation for a variety of contexts.",2022,53,0,{'volume': '3'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Stallmann2022SociallySB,\n author = {Lina Stallmann and Daniel Dukes and Michel Tran and Valentin Durand de Gevigney and D.

The present study evaluates a novel immersive VR scenario designed to study the efficacy of social support by a virtual agent using a modified version of Cyberball, an established paradigm to induce the feeling of ostracism. Participants embodied a new pupil in a virtual school environment and played Cyberball, after which they either did or did not receive emotional support. Self-reports and psychophysiological markers demonstrated that the negative impact of social exclusion in Cyberball was successfully replicated, while participants also reported a significant improvement in emotional state after being supported by the virtual agent. These results indicate the potential of the developed scenario for research on social emotion regulation in immersive VR.

Animal and human studies on neural pathways underlying social buffering typically examined physiological reactions or regional brain activations. However, direct links between emotional and social stimuli, distinct neural processes and behavioural outcomes are still missing. Using data of 27 female participants, the current study delineated a large-scale process model of social buffering’s neural underpinnings, connecting changes in neural activity to emotional behaviour by means of voxel-wise multilevel mediation analysis. Our results confirmed that three processes underlie human social buffering: (i) social support-related reduction of activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, anterior and mid-cingulate; (ii) downregulation of aversive emotion-induced brain activity in the superficial cortex-like amygdala and mediodorsal thalamus; and (iii) downregulation of reported aversive feelings. Results of the current study provide evidence for a distinct neural process model of aversive emotion regulation in humans by social buffering.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 57, 'citationCount': 8, 'journal': {'volume': '15', 'pages': '561 - 570', 'name': 'Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Bratec2020YourPS,\n author = {Satja Mulej Bratec and Teresa Bertram and G.

But what do empathizers want others to feel? Though psychologists have studied empathy and prosociality for decades, this question has yet to be clearly addressed. This is because virtually all existing research focuses on a model under which improving others' well-being also comprises heightening their positive affect or decreasing their negative affect and helping them reach their own emotional goals. In this review, I argue that real-life empathic goals encompass a broader range-including sometimes worsening targets' affect or contravening their wishes in order to improve their well-being-that can be productively integrated into the framework of interpersonal emotion regulation (IER). I review the empathic IER spectrum in a number of contexts, including close relationships, professional caregiving, and group-based emotions. Integrating empathy and IER provides a synthetic and generative way to ask new questions about how social emotions produce prosocial actions.

An emerging literature highlights the importance of interpersonal ER, which utilizes social cues to facilitate the regulation of emotional states. In cultures that place high value on social interconnectedness as integral to their collectivistic self-construal, including East Asian cultures, interpersonal ER strategies may be particularly effective in reducing negative affect but this has not been previously tested. In this study, two groups comprising East Asian (n = 48) and Western European (n = 38) participants were randomly assigned to receive a priming narration depicting the use of either interpersonal (e.g., social modeling, perspective taking) or intrapersonal (e.g., cognitive reappraisal) ER strategies during a stressful experience. They were then instructed to utilize similar ER strategies in an emotion reactivity task during which they viewed high arousing negative pictorial stimuli while their heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (high frequency power – HF-HRV) and subjective affective states were measured. First we found that the East Asian group reported higher use of interpersonal ER strategies of social modeling and perspective taking in daily life. During the experimental interpersonal prime exposure, the East Asian group showed elevated HF-HRV (relative to baseline) compared to the Western European group, indicating more adaptive ER, but this pattern was not sustained during the reactivity or recovery phases. Instead, the East Asian group demonstrated increased HF-HRV and decreased HR across both prime conditions. The East Asian group also showed greater decreases in positive affect across the course of the experiment. Furthermore, individual differences in social modeling and individualistic self-construal moderated the effect of the ER prime in the East Asian group at trend levels, and main effects for perspective taking and reappraisal were observed in the Western European group. The findings support the notion that engaging in interpersonal ER strategies may be more beneficial for East Asian groups when immediately exposed to a stressful situation, as these strategies are congruent with cultural context and preferences, but our priming methodology may have limited the longer-term benefits.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 76, 'citationCount': 22, 'journal': {'volume': '10', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Liddell2019CulturalDI,\n author = {B.

In total, 56 individuals with ASD aged 14–24\u2009years (Mage\u2009=\u200918.15; SDage\u2009=\u20092.30) completed Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 Generalized Anxiety Disorder Dimensional Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale and Autism-Spectrum Quotient – Short. Individuals were grouped into four clusters based on their Emotion Regulation Questionnaire subscale scores. Individuals in the high suppression and low reappraisal group expressed higher depressive symptoms and lower positive well-being when compared with the low suppression and high reappraisal group. Interestingly, individuals who self-reported using both high suppression and reappraisal expressed relatively high positive well-being and low depression symptoms.

The concept itself requires a wider view of normativity than the narrow positivist one of law as command. It is certainly protean, ranging over many fundamental questions about the changing nature of the public sphere of politics and the state, and its interactions with the ‘private’ sphere of economic activity and social relations, as well as the mediation of these interactions, especially through law. This survey aims to outline and evaluate some of the main contours of the field as it has developed in this recent period, focusing on the regulation of economic activity. Regulation is seen as having emerged with the withdrawal by governments from direct provision of many economic and social services, to be replaced by corporatist bureaucracies and quasi-public agencies managing the complex public–private interactions of financialized capitalism. The arguments for ‘smart’ regulation have, in an era fixated on neo-liberalism, generally legitimized delegation of responsibility to big business. Its advocates, having been drawn into policy fields, have perhaps too often lost their critical edge, and allowed it to become instrumentalized, reflecting the technicist character of its practice.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 548, 'journal': {'volume': '26', 'pages': '676 - 699', 'name': 'Social & Legal Studies'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Picciotto2017Regulation,\n author = {S.

Parents of individuals with ASD and TD individuals were interviewed about their child's emotional experience and the use and efficacy of 10 ER strategies. In addition, participants filled out daily diaries on experience and regulation in the same emotional domains.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared to TD individuals, parents reported that individuals with ASD experienced more anger and anxiety and less amusement, made less frequent use of a variety of adaptive ER strategies (e.g. problem solving, cognitive reappraisal), and made more frequent use of maladaptive strategies (e.g. repetitive behavior). Moreover, individuals with ASD were less effective at utilizing adaptive ER strategies. Self-reports showed differences in experience of amusement and in ER strategies for anger and anxiety, but not in experience of anger and anxiety.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study provides evidence that individuals with ASD less frequently use adaptive - but more frequently use maladaptive - ER strategies.

Researchers studying individual differences in social interactions are typically interested in keeping the behavior and the appearance of the interaction partner constant across participants. With IVET researchers have full control over the interaction partners, can standardize them while still keeping the simulation realistic. Virtual simulations are valid: growing evidence shows that indeed studies conducted with IVET can replicate some well-known findings of social psychology. Moreover, IVET allows researchers to subtly manipulate characteristics of the environment (e.g., visual cues to prime participants) or of the social partner (e.g., his/her race) to investigate their influences on participants’ behavior and cognition. Furthermore, manipulations that would be difficult or impossible in real life (e.g., changing participants’ height) can be easily obtained with IVET. Beside the advantages for theoretical research, we explore the most recent training and clinical applications of IVET, its integration with other technologies (e.g., social sensing) and future challenges for researchers (e.g., making the communication between virtual humans and participants smoother).', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 83, 'citationCount': 102, 'journal': {'volume': '6', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Bombari2015StudyingSI,\n author = {Dario Bombari and M.

However, parents and clinicians have long noted the importance of emotional problems in individuals with ASD (e.g. tantrums and “meltdowns”). In this study, 21 high‐functioning children and adolescents with ASD and 22 age and gender group‐matched typically developing (TD) controls completed a Reactivity and Regulation Situation Task. This task assesses emotional reactivity and spontaneous use of emotion regulation strategies (problem solving, cognitive reappraisal, avoidance, distraction, venting, suppression, and relaxation) in the context of age‐appropriate ambiguous and potentially threatening negative scenarios. After the concept of cognitive reappraisal was explained, the scenarios were presented again to participants, and they were prompted to use this strategy. Results indicated that individuals with ASD exhibited the same level of reactivity to negative stimuli as TD participants. Furthermore, youth with ASD had a different emotion regulation profile than TD individuals, characterized by a less frequent use of cognitive reappraisal and more frequent use of suppression. When prompted to use cognitive reappraisal, participants with ASD were less able to implement reappraisal, but benefitted from this strategy when they were able to generate a reappraisal. Findings from this study suggest that cognitive reappraisal strategies may be useful to children and adolescents with ASD. Therefore, the development of treatment programs that focus on enhancing the use of adaptive forms of emotion regulation might decrease emotional problems and optimize long‐term outcomes in youth with ASD.

However, studies assessing physiological reactions to social rejection are rare and results of these studies were found to be ambiguous. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine and specify physiological effects of social rejection. Methods: Participants (n = 50) were assigned to either a social exclusion or inclusion condition of a virtual ball-tossing game (Cyberball). Immediate and delayed physiological [skin conductance level (SCL) and heart rate] reactions were recorded. In addition, subjects reported levels of affect, emotional states, and fundamental needs. Results: Subjects who were socially rejected showed increased heart rates. However, social rejection had no effect on subjects' SCLs. Both conditions showed heightened arousal on this measurement. Furthermore, psychological consequences of social rejection indicated the validity of the paradigm. Conclusions: Our results reveal that social rejection evokes an immediate physiological reaction. Accelerated heart rates indicate that behavior activation rather than inhibition is associated with socially threatening events. In addition, results revealed gender-specific response patterns suggesting that sample characteristics such as differences in gender may account for ambiguous findings of physiological reactions to social rejection."", 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 84, 'citationCount': 48, 'journal': {'volume': '5', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Iffland2014RapidHB,\n author = {Benjamin Iffland and L.

There have been mixed reactions from audiences to lifelike characters used in movies and games, with some saying that the increased realism highlights subtle imperfections, which can be disturbing. Some developers opt for a stylized rendering (such as cartoon-shading) to avoid a negative reaction [Thompson 2004]. In this paper, we investigate some of the consequences of choosing realistic or stylized rendering in order to provide guidelines for developers for creating appealing virtual characters.

However, we expected people in high-intensity negative situations to show a relative preference to choose to regulate emotions by disengagement distraction, which blocks emotional processing at an early stage before it gathers force. In three experiments, we created emotional contexts that varied in intensity, using either emotional pictures (Experiments 1 and 2) or unpredictable electric stimulation (Experiment 3). In response to these emotional contexts, participants chose between using either reappraisal or distraction as an emotion-regulation strategy. Results in all experiments supported our hypothesis. This pattern in the choice of emotion-regulation strategies has important implications for the understanding of healthy adaptation.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 25, 'citationCount': 1089, 'journal': {'volume': '22', 'pages': '1391 - 1396', 'name': 'Psychological Science'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Sheppes2011EmotionRegulationC,\n author = {G.

VR is argued to offer particular benefits for children on the autism spectrum, chiefly because it can offer simulations of authentic real-world situations in a carefully controlled and safe environment. Given the real world social difficulties experienced by children on the spectrum, this technology has therefore been argued to offer distinct advantages and benefits for social and life skills training compared to other approaches. Whilst there has been some progress in testing the relevance and applicability of VR for children on the autism spectrum in educational contexts, there remains a significant challenge in developing robust and usable technologies that can really make a difference in real world classrooms.

According to Gross's (1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271-299) process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners.

The first technique is a new message passing scheme named tile-based BP that reduces the memory and bandwidth to a fraction of the ordinary BP algorithms without performance degradation by splitting the MRF into many tiles and only storing the messages across the neighboring tiles. The tile-wise processing also enables data reuse and pipeline, resulting in efficient hardware implementation. The second technique is an O(L) fast message construction algorithm that exploits the properties of robust functions for parallelization. We apply these two techniques to a very large-scale integration circuit for stereo matching that generates high-resolution disparity maps in near real-time.

Virtual Representations of the Self (VRS) are in our opinion a tool with a great potential for engaging teenagers in emotional regulation strategies learning and an excellent example of new technology application to the basic concept in psychology field such as Bandura's modeling [1]. VRSs have already demonstrated their potential on human behavior modification (e.g. modification of physical activity; eating habits) in general population [2]. Thus, the same technology can bring in our opinion a lot to the Mental Health field, especially in emotional regulation learning.

15,728e1adf786a3639fef94977ef1258fd42cb9b3f,Virtual Reality for the Enhancement of Emotion Regulation.,"In recent decades, a growing body of literature has focused on emotion regulation (ER), which refers to the ability to implement strategies in order to modulate emotional responses and reach desirable goals. To date, impaired ER (i.e., emotion dysregulation) has been identified as a transdiagnostic factor across a wide range of psychopathological conditions, which shows the importance of improving patients' ability to regulate negative and positive emotions in clinical practice. In addition to the increasing evidence showing its efficacy in the treatment of several clinical conditions, virtual reality (VR) has recently emerged as a potentially powerful tool for enhancing ER, thus breaking new ground in the development of cutting-edge transdiagnostic interventions. In the present narrative review, we will provide an overview of the existing evidence about VR-based interventions in the field of ER, emphasizing the promising findings and the barriers that still have to be addressed. To this aim, the available VR-based literature will be analysed in relation to four categories of ER strategies: Situational strategies, attentional strategies, cognitive strategies and response modulation strategies. Furthermore, new emerging fields of research targeting innovative aspects of ER will be highlighted, including the use of VR to promote positive emotions and interpersonal ER skills. Besides, its cost-effectiveness will be discussed, taking into account the costs for both developers (e.g., clinicians and researchers) and end-users. Finally, future directions in this promising field of research will be outlined.",2021,61,15,{'name': 'Clinical psychology & psychotherapy'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Colombo2021VirtualRF,\n author = {D.

Although some evidence suggests that adopting positive strategies is beneficial for emotional well-being, the literature is inconsistent about the effects of positive emotions on subsequent regulatory processes. In the present study, we adopted a two-week ecological momentary assessment to explore the association between positive emotions and positive emotion regulation in daily life. According to our results, the less individuals felt positive emotions at one point, the more they tended to enhance their use of positive strategies from this time to the next, which in turn resulted in subsequent higher levels of positive emotions. This prototype of positive regulation can be seen as a highly adaptive mechanism that makes it possible to compensate for a lack of positive emotions by enhancing the deployment of positive strategies.

Most evidence-based psychological therapies target symptoms of heightened negative affect (e.g., negative inferential style) instead of deficits in positive affect (e.g., attenuated reward response) and typically show little benefit for anhedonia. Viewing positive scenes through virtual reality (VR) has been shown to increase positive affect and holds great promise for addressing anhedonic symptoms. In this pilot study, six participants with clinically significant depression completed 13 sessions of exposure to positive scenes in a controlled VR environment.

We developed an easy-to-use VR self-management relaxation tool (VRelax) with immersive 360° nature videos and interactive animated elements. Objective To investigate the immediate effects of VR relaxation on negative and positive affective states and short-term effects on perceived stress and symptoms in patients with a psychiatric disorder, compared to standard relaxation exercises. Methods A randomized crossover trial was conducted in 50 patients receiving ambulatory treatment for anxiety, psychotic, depressive, or bipolar disorder. Participants were randomly assigned to start with VRelax or standard relaxation and used both interventions for 10 days at home. They completed 8 visual analog scales of momentary negative and positive affective states before and after each session. Global perceived stress and psychiatric symptoms were measured before and after both intervention periods. Treatment effects were analyzed with multilevel mixed model regression analyses and 2-way analysis of variance. Results Both VRelax and standard relaxation exercises led to a statistically significant immediate improvement of all negative and positive affective states. Compared to standard relaxation, VRelax resulted in a significantly greater reduction of total negative affective state (change 16.2% versus 21.2%; t1684=−2.02, 95% CI −18.70 to −0.28; P=.04). Specifically, VRelax had a stronger beneficial effect on momentary anxiety (t1684=−3.24, 95% CI −6.86 to −1.69), sadness (t1684=−2.32, 95% CI −6.51 to −0.55), and cheerfulness (t1684=2.35, 95% CI 0.51 to 5.75). There were no significant differences between short-term effects of the two treatments on global perceived stress and symptoms. Conclusions If the results of this trial are replicated and extended, VRelax may provide a much-needed, effective, easy-to-use self-management relaxation intervention to enhance psychiatric treatments.

There has additionally been an increase in depression due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Behavioral activation is considered an evidence-based treatment for MDD. However, there are many barriers that could hinder one’s ability to engage in behavioral activation, with COVID-19 “shelter-in-place” and social distancing orders being current and large impediments. Virtual reality (VR) has been successfully used to help treat a variety of mental health conditions, but it has not yet been used as a method of administering behavioral activation to a clinical population. Using VR to engage in behavioral activation could eliminate barriers that pandemic precautions place and help decrease symptoms of depression that are especially exacerbated in these times. Objective The following case report examines the feasibility, acceptability, and tolerability of VR behavioral activation for an adult with MDD during a global pandemic. This participant was part of a larger pilot study, and the case serves as a description of the VR intervention. Methods The participant engaged in a weekly 50-minute psychotherapy Zoom session for 4 weeks, in which a modified behavioral activation protocol was administered using a VR headset to simulate activities. Data on mood ratings, homework compliance, and headset use were obtained from the headset. Acceptability, tolerability, and depression symptoms were obtained using self-report rating scales. Results The intervention was feasible, acceptable, and tolerable, as reported by this participant. The participant’s depressive symptoms decreased by five-points on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 over a month, with a beginning score of 10 (moderate depression) and a final score of 5 (mild depression). Conclusions The implications of these findings for future research are discussed.

Physiological indicators, including EEG (electroencephalogram), blood pressure, skin conductance, and pulse, were monitored in 180 Chinese university students (mean age: 20.72 ± 2.56 years) while they were watching bamboo videos. Before and after watching the videos, their psychological indicators, including positive and negative moods, were measured using the Profile of Mood States questionnaire. After watching the bamboo videos of different durations, all of the physiological indicators responded to the stimulation after only 1 min. The indicators showed different trends at 1, 3 and 5 min. EEG decreased and then was maintained at a stable level after 1 min, and the high β, low β, and α waves had no significant differences between 1, 3 and 5 min. Blood pressure dropped to a stable state after 3 min, and the decline was significantly different greater after 3 min than after 1 min. Skin conductance increased for 1 to 5 min, and it did not stabilize after a long time (5 min). Pulse decreased after 1 min but increased after 5 min. After watching the videos with bamboo of varying structures, the physiological and psychological indicators showed significantly different changes. Skin conductance significantly increased (mean value: 6.78%), and the amount of sweat was more effectively reduced, thereby reducing tension, when the students viewed videos of sympodial bamboo forests compared with monopodial bamboo forests. Bamboo forests with a higher canopy density (0.83–0.85) could significantly decrease α waves (mean value: 1.50 Hz), relaxing the human body. High β and low β waves showed greater decreases, with tension reduced more effectively, when bamboo forests with a low tilt ratio (< 1.5%) were viewed. Bamboo forests with neat undergrowth could have more beneficial physiological and psychological effects on the human body.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 62, 'citationCount': 14, 'journal': {'volume': '17', 'name': 'International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Wang2020PhysiologicalAP,\n author = {Yuqian Wang and Mingyan Jiang and Yinshu Huang and Zhiyi Sheng and Xiao Huang and Wei Lin and Qibing Chen and Xi Li and Zhenghua Luo and Bingyang Lv},\n journal = {International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health},\n title = {Physiological and Psychological Effects of Watching Videos of Different Durations Showing Urban Bamboo Forests with Varied Structures},\n volume = {17},\n year = {2020}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2108034919', 'name': 'Yuqian Wang'}, {'authorId': '46332956', 'name': 'Mingyan Jiang'}, {'authorId': '2118798532', 'name': 'Yinshu Huang'}, {'authorId': '1705432570', 'name': 'Zhiyi Sheng'}, {'authorId': '2107971005', 'name': 'Xiao Huang'}, {'authorId': '2108810892', 'name': 'Wei Lin'}, {'authorId': '6388016', 'name': 'Qibing Chen'}, {'authorId': '48568342', 'name': 'Xi Li'}, {'authorId': '2111854625', 'name': 'Zhenghua Luo'}, {'authorId': '40908491', 'name': 'Bingyang Lv'}]}, {'paperId': '68e68be43512e0db8dd150df38fbd91360934c31', 'title': 'Emotion regulation as a transdiagnostic process.', 'abstract': 'The current article addresses the consequences of emotion regulation (ER) for mental health. A large body of research has shown that alterations in ER are related to psychological disorders across different diagnostic categories. Because of the apparent ubiquity of ER difficulties in psychopathology, several authors have proposed that ER should be regarded as a transdiagnostic process. This article critically examines evidence regarding alterations in the use of cognitive ER strategies as a transdiagnostic process. Cognitive ER strategies are examined as 1 example of several possible ER-related processes that could be involved in psychopathology. There is consistent evidence showing that a reduced use of cognitive reappraisal and an increased use of negative rumination are present across a number of disorders, whereas increased levels of positive rumination appear to be confined to bipolar disorder. However, there is only preliminary evidence from prospective and/or experimental studies on the causal nature of altered ER strategy use in the development or maintenance of psychopathology. The article concludes by discussing future directions, including methodological and design issues, as well as implications for assessment and treatment when studying alterations in ER from a transdiagnostic perspective.

The fears can arise, for example, from paranoia, hallucinations, social anxiety or negative-self beliefs. The fears lead patients to withdraw from activities, and this isolation leads to a cycle of worsening physical and mental health. Breaking this cycle requires highly active treatment directly in the troubling situations so that patients learn that they can safely and confidently enter them. However patients with psychosis seldom receive such life-changing interventions. To solve this problem we have developed an automated psychological treatment delivered in virtual reality (VR). It allows patients to experience computer simulations of the situations that they find anxiety-provoking. A virtual coach guides patients, using cognitive techniques, in how to overcome their fears. Patients are willing to enter VR simulations of anxiety-provoking situations because they know the simulations are not real, but the learning made transfers to the real world. Methods and analysis 432 patients with psychosis and anxious avoidance of social situations will be recruited from National Health Service (NHS) secondary care services. In the gameChange trial, they will be randomised (1:1) to the six-session VR cognitive treatment added to treatment as usual or treatment as usual alone. Assessments will be conducted at 0, 6 (post-treatment) and 26 weeks by a researcher blind to allocation. The primary outcome is avoidance and distress in real-life situations, using a behavioural assessment task, at 6\u2009weeks. The secondary outcomes are psychiatric symptoms, activity levels and quality of life. All main analyses will be intention-to-treat. Moderation and mediation will be tested. An economic evaluation will be conducted. Ethics and dissemination The trial has received ethical approval from the NHS South Central - Oxford B Research Ethics Committee (19/SC/0075). A key output will be a high-quality automated VR treatment for patients to overcome anxious avoidance of social situations.

CBIs are based on constructive meditations where imagery abilities are essential. One of the major difficulties that participants report during the training is the difficulty related to imagery abilities. Virtual reality (VR) can be a useful tool to overcome this limitation because it can facilitate the construction and sustainment of mental images. The machine to be another (TMTBA) uses multi-sensory stimulation to induce a body swap illusion. This system allows participants to see themselves from a third perspective and have the illusion of touching themselves from outside. The main objective of the present study was to analyze the efficacy of a self-compassion meditation procedure based on the TMTBA system versus the usual meditation procedure (CAU) in increasing positive affect states, mindful self-care, and adherence to the practice, and explore the influence of imagery abilities as moderators of the effects of the condition on adherence. A sample of 16 participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: TMTBA-VR and CAU. All participants had to listen to an audio meditation about self-compassion and answer questionnaires before and after the training. The TMTBA-VR condition also had a body swap experience at the end of the meditation while listening to self-compassionate messages. Afterward, they were invited to practice this meditation for 2 weeks and then measured again. After the compassion practice, both conditions significantly increased positive qualities toward self/others, decreased negative qualities toward self, and increased awareness and attention to mental events and bodily sensations, with no differences between the conditions. After 2 weeks, both conditions showed a similar frequency of meditation practice and increases in specific types of self-care behaviors, with the frequency of clinical self-care behaviors being significantly higher in TMTBA. Finally, lower imagery ability in the visual and cutaneous modality were moderators of the efficacy of the TMTBA (vs. CAU) condition in increasing adherence to the practice. Embodied VR could be an interesting tool to facilitate and increase the efficacy of CBIs by facilitating the construction of positive and powerful mental images.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 52, 'citationCount': 29, 'journal': {'volume': '10', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Cebolla2019PuttingOI,\n author = {A.

EEG activity was analyzed as a function of global power shifts in Alpha and Beta activity, and with sLORETA current source density estimates of cingulate cortex regions of interest. Results demonstrated that both a quiet rest control condition and the VR meditation significantly reduced subjective reports of anxiety and increased Alpha power. However, the VR intervention uniquely resulted in shifting proportional power from higher Beta frequencies into lower Beta frequencies, and significantly reduced broadband Beta activity in the anterior cingulate cortex.

Fifty-one dyads (aged 18 to 26) embodied either a full-bodied avatar with mapped hands and inferred arm movements, an avatar consisting of only a floating head and mapped hands, or a static full-bodied avatar. Planned contrasts compared the effect of behavioral realism against no behavioral realism, and compared the effect of low versus high behavioral realism. Results show that participants who embodied the avatar with only a floating head and hands experienced greater social presence, self-presence, and interpersonal attraction than participants who embodied a full-bodied avatar with mapped hands. In contrast, there were no significant differences on these measures between participants in the two mapped-hands conditions and those who embodied a static avatar. Participants in the static-avatar condition rotated their own physical head and hands significantly less than participants in the other two conditions during the dyadic interaction.

We evaluated VR-presented natural settings for reducing stress and improving mood.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThere were 18 participants (9 men, 9 women), ages 32 ± 12 yr, who viewed three 15-min 360° scenes (an indoor control, rural Ireland, and remote beaches). Subjects were mentally stressed with arithmetic before scenes. Electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate variability measured psycho-physiological arousal. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the 15-question Modified Reality Judgment and Presence Questionnaire (MRJPQ) measured mood and scene quality.\n\n\nRESULTS\nReductions in EDA from baseline were greater at the end of the natural scenes compared to the control scene (-0.59, -0.52, and 0.32 μS, respectively). The natural scenes reduced negative affect from baseline ( 1.2 and 1.1 points), but the control scene did not ( 0.4 points). MRJPQ scores for the control scene were lower than both natural scenes (4.9, 6.7, and 6.5 points, respectively). Within the two natural scenes, the preferred scene reduced negative affect ( 2.4 points) more than the second choice scene ( 1.8 points) and scored higher on the MRJPQ (6.8 vs. 6.4 points).\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nNatural scene VR provided relaxation both objectively and subjectively, and scene preference had a significant effect on mood and perception of scene quality. VR may enable relaxation for people living in isolated confined environments, particularly when matched to personal preferences.Anderson AP, Mayer MD, Fellows AM, Cowan DR, Hegel MT, Buckey JC.

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT®) is the most effective treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder, but demand for DBT® far exceeds existing clinical resources. Most patients with BPD never receive DBT®. Incorporating computer technology into the DBT® could help increase dissemination. Immersive Virtual Reality technology (VR) is becoming widely available to mainstream consumers. This case study explored the feasibility/clinical potential of using immersive virtual reality technology to enhance DBT® mindfulness skills training of a 32 year old female diagnosed with BPD. Prior to using VR, the patient experienced difficulty practicing DBT® mindfulness due to her emotional reactivity, and difficulty concentrating. To help the patient focus her attention, and to facilitate DBT® mindfulness skills learning, the patient looked into virtual reality goggles, and had the illusion of slowly “floating down” a 3D computer-generated river while listening to DBT® mindfulness training audios. Urges to commit suicide, urges to self harm, urges to quit therapy, urges to use substances, and negative emotions were all reduced after each VR mindfulness session and VR mindfulness was well accepted/liked by the patient. Although case studies are scientifically inconclusive by nature, results from this feasibility study were encouraging. Future controlled studies are needed to quantify whether VR-enhanced mindfulness training has long term benefits e.g., increasing patient acceptance and/or improving therapeutic outcome. Computerizing some of the DBT® skills treatment modules would reduce cost and increase dissemination.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 55, 'citationCount': 82, 'journal': {'volume': '7', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Nararro-Haro2016TheUO,\n author = {Maria V.

In the contamination subtype, individuals are scared of germs and bacteria, are excessively concerned with cleaning, fear contamination and the spread of disease, and may have a very strong aversion to bodily secretions. A few studies on virtual reality have been conducted with people suffering from OCD, but they all focus on the subtype characterized by checking rituals. The goal of this study is to confirm the potential of a “contaminated” virtual environment in inducing anxiety in 12 adults suffering from contamination-subtype OCD compared to 20 adults without OCD (N = 32) using a within-between protocol. Subjective (questionnaire) and objective (heart rate) measurements were compiled. Participants were immersed in a control virtual environment (empty and clean room) and a “contaminated” virtual environment (filthy public restroom) designed for the treatment of OCD. Immersions were conducted in a 6-wall CAVE-like system. As hypothesized, the results of repeated-measures ANCOVAs revealed the significant impact of immersion in a filthy public restroom for participants suffering from OCD on both measures. Presence was correlated with anxiety in OCD participants and no difference in presence was observed between groups. Unwanted negative side effects induced by immersions in virtual reality were higher in the OCD group.

Attentional focus during exercise, bad-good feeling states (pre- and postexperimental), perceived exertion (3 minutes and post), heart rate, and enjoyment were assessed. Results indicated that overweight children focused on internal information under the TC, but they significantly shifted their attention to regard the external environment in the DC. This attentional distraction effect of VR was more intense in overweight than in normal-weight children. No differences between groups were found when examining changes in feeling states and perceived exertion.

It is also linked to deficits in emotional regulation and frequently co-occurs with anxiety and depression symptoms. There is also evidence that emotional dysregulation may play a mediatory role between GD and psychopathological symptomatology. Few studies have reported the outcomes of psychological interventions that specifically address these underlying processes. Objectives: To assess the utility of the Playmancer platform, a serious video game, as an additional therapy tool in a CBT intervention for GD, and to estimate pre-post changes in measures of impulsivity, anger expression and psychopathological symptomatology. Method: The sample comprised a single group of 16 male treatment-seeking individuals with severe GD diagnosis. Therapy intervention consisted of 16 group weekly CBT sessions and, concurrently, 10 additional weekly sessions of a serious video game. Pre-post treatment scores on South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), I7 Impulsiveness Questionnaire (I7), State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory 2 (STAXI-2), Symptom Checklist-Revised (SCL-90-R), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S-T), and Novelty Seeking from the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R) were compared. Results: After the intervention, significant changes were observed in several measures of impulsivity, anger expression and other psychopathological symptoms. Dropout and relapse rates during treatment were similar to those described in the literature for CBT. Conclusion: Complementing CBT interventions for GD with a specific therapy approach like a serious video game might be helpful in addressing certain underlying factors which are usually difficult to change, including impulsivity and anger expression.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 115, 'citationCount': 67, 'journal': {'volume': '6', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Tarrega2015ASV,\n author = {S.

The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of VRT in treating subjects with alcohol dependence (AD) by evaluating changes in brain metabolism.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThe VRT protocol consisted of three steps: relaxation, presentation of a high-risk situation, and presentation of an aversive situation. Twelve alcohol-dependent subjects underwent 10 sessions of VRT. The alcohol-dependent subjects were assessed with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography images before and after VRT, whereas the control group underwent imaging according to the same protocol only at baseline.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with the healthy control group, AD subjects showed higher metabolism in the right lentiform nucleus and right temporal lobe (BA20) at baseline (P(FDR < .05) = .026). In addition, the metabolism in the left anterior cingulate was lower in subjects with AD (P(uncorr) = .001). After VRT, alcohol-dependent subjects showed decreased brain metabolism in the right lentiform nucleus (P(FDR < .05) = .026) and right temporal lobe (BA38, P(FDR < .05) = .032) relative to that at baseline.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results suggest a neurobiological imbalance, notably, a high sensitivity to stimuli, in the limbic system in subjects with AD. Furthermore, we determined that metabolism decreased in the basal ganglia after VRT, which may explain the limbic-regulated responses of reward and regulation.

Behavioural activation has attracted increased interest in recent years. It has been over 5 years since our meta-analyses summarised the evidence supporting and this systematic review updates those findings and examines moderators of treatment effect. Method Randomised trials of behavioural activation for depression versus controls or anti-depressant medication were identified using electronic database searches, previous reviews and reference lists. Data on symptom level and study level moderators were extracted and analysed using meta-analysis, sub-group analysis and meta-regression respectively. Results Twenty six randomised controlled trials including 1524 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. A random effects meta-analysis of symptom level post treatment showed behavioural activation to be superior to controls (SMD −0.74 CI −0.91 to −0.56, k\u200a=\u200a25, N\u200a=\u200a1088) and medication (SMD −0.42 CI −0.83 to-0.00, k\u200a=\u200a4, N\u200a=\u200a283). Study quality was low in the majority of studies and follow- up time periods short. There was no indication of publication bias and subgroup analysis showed limited association between moderators and effect size. Conclusions The results in this meta-analysis support and strengthen the evidence base indicating Behavioural Activation is an effective treatment for depression. Further high quality research with longer term follow-up is needed to strengthen the evidence base.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 90, 'citationCount': 393, 'journal': {'volume': '9', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Ekers2014BehaviouralAF,\n author = {D.

Not surprisingly, exposure to stress is generally associated with a wide range of negative outcomes, including decreased well-being, increased incidence of disease, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder (Dohrenwend & Dohrenwend, 1974; Kendler et al., 1999; Monat et al., 2007). However, not all individuals who are exposed to even high levels of stress develop such negative outcomes. In fact, recent evidence suggests that a considerable number of individuals exhibit resilience, which is commonly defined as maintained or improved mental health in the face of stress, after short disruptions (if any) to normal functioning (Freitas & Downey, 1998; Rutter, 1999; Luthar et al., 2000; Bonanno, 2005). Note that this definition, which we adapt here, conceptualizes resilience as a potential outcome after exposure to stress rather than a psychological trait that leads to positive outcomes (c.f. Norris et al., 2008). It, therefore, appears that, in the face of comparable stressors, some individuals exhibit significantly impaired functioning while others show impressive resilience. Understanding the factors that govern the great individual variance in outcomes after stress is important for understanding mental health and for developing interventions and prevention programs that foster resilience. What factors, then, might predict resilience? One key to this question might lie in the fact that stressful events are inherently highly emotional (Sarason et al., 1978; Lazarus, 1999). For this reason, people’s ability to regulate emotions may be a critically important factor in determining resilience (Figure 2.1). The present chapter will review relevant literatures and suggest that there is indeed evidence to support this thesis. More specifically, we will propose that a specific type of emotion regulation, cognitive emotion regulation, holds particular promise for contributing to resilience.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 94, 'citationCount': 264, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'pages': '30-44', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Troy2011ResilienceIT,\n author = {Allison S.

EnglishA review of the applications of the Information and Communication Technologies in Clinical and Health Psychology in childhood and adolescence. The development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) has meant a radical change in a variety of disciplines, including Clinical and Health Psychology. During childhood and adolescence, interaction with the ICTs is common and regular, and it is also facilitated because they are digital natives who are naturally identified with the technological advances. The last decade has seen a clear revolution regarding the use of different technologies for the application of psychological treatments and the promotion of health, so as to facilitate and improve the learning of a variety of emotional competences and healthy behaviors in those populations that are in a continuous process of development and change. Cognitive-behavioral orientation and evidence-based psychological treatments have been successfully transferred to the ICTs and there are many studies that support this. The present article addresses a review of the main ICT-based devices for the treatment of different psychological disorders during childhood and adolescence, as well as in other important areas of health at these ages. The implications that these devices may have are being analyzed, as well as the possible potential challenges to optimize these resources.

Second, we examined the effects of the ESM self-monitoring intervention on these daily life behaviors.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIndividuals with a diagnosis of depression (N = 102) receiving pharmacological treatment were randomized to 1 of 2 six-week ESM intervention conditions or a control condition. Physical, sedentary, social, and leisure behaviors as well as depressive symptoms were assessed prospectively in every-day life at baseline, postintervention, and during the ESM interventions.\n\n\nRESULTS\nChange in physical activity and talking from baseline to postintervention was associated with change in depressive symptoms from baseline to postintervention. Within-person daily fluctuations in talking, physical activity, doing nothing/resting, and being alone predicted end-of-day depressive symptoms over and above depressive symptoms at the previous day. The ESM interventions contributed to change in talking, doing nothing/resting, and being alone over time in comparison with the control group. The analyses revealed individual differences in the amount of behavioral change over time and in the within-subject associations between daily behaviors and depressive symptoms.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe findings suggest that physical, sedentary, and social behaviors have affective implications for daily mental health of individuals with depression. Self-monitoring using ESM may be a useful add-on tool to achieve behavioral change and to gain personalized insight in behaviors that improve daily depressive symptoms.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 51, 'citationCount': 59, 'journal': {'volume': '35 5', 'pages': '\n          433-41\n        ', 'name': 'Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Snippe2016ChangeID,\n author = {E.

Two of the technologies that are more consolidated in this field are virtual reality (VR) and telepsychology. There are other technological innovations that are beginning to be used in clinical and health psychology such as ambient intelligence, ubiquitous computing or persuasive computing. In the last fifteen years there has been a proliferation of studies testing the efficacy of immersive virtual reality in the delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for several mental disorders and health conditions. The essence of VR is that it can simulate reality and add a new possibility: the user has the illusion of “being” in the computer-generated environment while interacting with the VR objects. This unique feature of VR is very relevant for its use in Clinical Psychology. At the same time, it can raise several ethical issues. It is important to investigate the possible effects of blurring the distinction between real and virtual worlds in vulnerable populations. Some other concerns regarding the use of VR in therapy have already been investigated, such as cybersickness. After ten years of experience treating patients with VR, this has not been a problem in the published efficacy studies. Telepsychology has also been used to improve the delivery of CBT. A number of Internetdelivered programs have already become important tools in the health system. The main advantage is that online therapy can reach people who might not otherwise seek therapy, such as disabled people or those who live in remote areas. However, several concerns have been raised about self-help procedures, like the issue of self-diagnosis. and the fact that patients usually have all of the necessary self-help information at their disposal. It is important to establish criteria to protect people from the possible negative effects of this. Other innovations such as ambient intelligence and pervasive computing bring up other ethical issues. For example, is privacy being compromised too much when people are located using GPS or physiologically monitored 24 hours a day? Criteria for considering these issues must be established. Our research group has been working with new technologies and therapies for the last fifteen years. This paper addresses the ethical issues we have encountered in our research and clinical practice; it also explores ethical issues that will become increasingly important.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 62, 'citationCount': 58, 'journal': {'volume': '7', 'pages': '77-100', 'name': 'PsychNology J.'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Botella2009CybertherapyAL,\n author = {C.

This reflects the power of presence – seen as the feeling of being located in a perceived, external world – in developing and affecting psychological wellbeing. Until today Virtual reality Environments (VEs) have been incorporated into a variety of clinical and everyday settings to improve mental health. Nevertheless many areas in the health field can be still explored by using this innovative technology. One example is represented by stress management area, one of the leading mental health problems of western societies linked to several pathologies. Following this trend our proposal is to investigate with a non clinical sample the efficacy of a relaxing narrative through a virtual experience. In a controlled study we compared three different media: Immersive VR, DVD and Audio speaker, by using the same therapeutic narrative and protocol. A control group without treatment was also included in the study. The sample included 60 university students, randomly divided in four experimental conditions. Non parametric test and correlation were used to analyse self-reports and physiological parameters. Within groups analysis - in both VR and DVD conditions - showed a significant improvement of the emotional state and significative physiological changes. Furthermore, regression analysis showed that a relationship exists between the sense of presence and the outcome achieved by the mediated experience. However, the absence of significant differences from the analysis between groups suggests that the principal determinant of presence might be the content proposed within the mediated experience. Further reflections about sense of presence in relaxing virtual environments will be discussed.', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 39, 'citationCount': 20, 'journal': {'volume': '6', 'pages': '7-25', 'name': 'PsychNology J.'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Villani2008PresenceAR,\n author = {D.

Results indicate that the participants in “imagery” spaces indicated a decrease of their sense of presence, whereas the opposite occurs in participants in “virtual” spaces.

However, in utilizing systematic desensitization, research reviews demonstrate that many patients appear to have difficulty imaging the prescribed anxiety-evoking scene. They also express strong aversion to experiencing real situations. This chapter describes the Virtual Reality Therapy (VRT), a new therapeutical approach that can be used to overcome some of the difficulties inherent in the traditional treatment of phobias. VRT, like current imaginal and in vivo modalities, can generate stimuli that could be utilized in desensitization therapy. Like systematic desensitization therapy, VRT can provide stimuli for patients who have difficulty in imagining scenes and/or are too phobic to experience real situations. Unlike in vivo systematic desensitization, VRT can be performed within the privacy of a room, thus avoiding public embarrassment and violation of patient confidentiality. VRT can generate stimuli of much greater magnitude than standard in vivo techniques. Since VRT is under patient control, it appears safer than in vivo desensitization and at the same time more realistic than imaginal desensitization. Finally, VRT adds the advantage of greater efficiency and economy in delivering the equivalent of in vivo systematic desensitization within the therapist's office. The chapter also describes how to use virtual reality in the treatment of specific phobias: fear of flying, fear of heights, fear of being in certain situations (such as a dark barn, an enclosed bridge over a river, and in the presence of an animal [a black cat] in a dark room), and fear of public speaking."", 'year': 1997, 'referenceCount': 26, 'citationCount': 126, 'journal': {'volume': '44', 'pages': '\n          59-70\n        ', 'name': 'Studies in health technology and informatics'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{North1997VirtualRT,\n author = {M.

Understanding the way we react to the interaction with virtual agents and the impact of emotions on social dynamics in the virtual world is fundamental. Therefore, in this study we investigated the implicit effect of emotional information by adopting a perceptual discrimination task. Specifically, we devised a task that explicitly required perceptual discrimination of a target while involving distance regulation in the presence of happy, neutral, or angry virtual agents. In two Immersive Virtual Reality experiments, participants were instructed to discriminate a target on the virtual agents’ t-shirts, and they had to provide the response by stopping the virtual agents (or themselves) at the distance where they could identify the target. Thus, facial expressions were completely irrelevant to the perceptual task. The results showed that the perceptual discrimination implied a longer response time when t-shirts were worn by angry rather than happy or neutral virtual agents. This suggests that angry faces interfered with the explicit perceptual task people had to perform. From a theoretical standpoint, this anger-superiority effect could reflect an ancestral fear/avoidance mechanism that prompts automatic defensive reactions and bypasses other cognitive processes.",2023,59,1,"{'name': 'Journal of Clinical Medicine', 'volume': '12'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rapuano2023InteractionWV,\n author = {M.

We also investigate the joint action for all possible gender-based pairings in the distributed IVE. Results indicated that, in the real world, social dynamics between gendered pairings emerged; male-male pairings refused to concede to one another until absolutely necessary while other pairings did not. Male-female pairings were most likely to provide ample space to one another during passage. These behaviors seemed not to appear in the IVE, and avatar gender across all pairings generated no significant behavioral differences.

The rapid expansion of environmental psychology can be gauged by the diversity and sheer quantity of publications that have appeared since Kenneth Craik’s 1973 review of this area in the present series (92). During the past 5 years (from early 1972 through early 1977), no fewer than ten text books (13, 72, 151,194, 214, 271,306, 307a, 344, 372) and six edited readers (160, 210, 320, 352, 360, 400) were published, all of which pertain to the interface between human behavior and the sociophysical environment. In addition, two multiple volume series designed to communicate significant theoretical and methodological dvances in the field (15, 16, 41) were established, while more than 30 ""state of the art"" monographs and edited volumes on specific topics within the environment-and-behavior area appeared (5, 18, 33, 39, 42, 82, 89, 96, 102, 115, 116, 135, 157, 172, 176, 179, 212, 259, 264, 276, 304, 305, 307, 315, 318, 324, 388, 389, 408, 415, 426, 433, 443, 453, 490, 494). Also during the same period, numerous reviews and programmatic analyses of environmental psychology were published in existing psychological, sociological, and geographical journals (11, 12, 38, 69, 95, 180, 234, 277, 349, 375, 407, 432, 437), as well as in several textbooks on social psychology (36, 158, 330, 390, 423).

Although comfortable interpersonal distance seems to be dependent on social factors such as the gender, age and activity of the confederates, it also seems to be modulated by the way we represent our peripersonal-action space. To test this hypothesis, the present study investigated the relation between the emotional responses registered through electrodermal activity (EDA) triggered by human-like point-light displays (PLDs) carrying different facial expressions (neutral, angry, happy) when located in the participants peripersonal or extrapersonal space, and the comfort distance with the same PLDs when approaching and crossing the participants fronto-parallel axis on the right or left side. The results show an increase of the phasic EDA for PLDs with angry facial expressions located in the peripersonal space (reachability judgment task), in comparison to the same PLDs located in the extrapersonal space, which was not observed for PLDs with neutral or happy facial expressions. The results also show an increase of the comfort distance for PLDs approaching the participants with an angry facial expression (interpersonal comfort distance judgment task), in comparison to PLDs with happy and neutral ones, which was related to the increase of the physiological response. Overall, the findings indicate that comfort social space can be predicted from the emotional reaction triggered by a confederate when located within the observer’s peripersonal space. This suggests that peripersonal-action space and interpersonal-social space are similarly sensitive to the emotional valence of the confederate, which could reflect a common adaptive mechanism in specifying theses spaces to subtend interactions with both the physical and social environment, but also to ensure body protection from potential threats.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 91, 'citationCount': 59, 'journal': {'volume': '9', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Cartaud2018PhysiologicalRT,\n author = {A.

Within face‐responsive regions, emotional faces evoke stronger responses than neutral faces (“valence effect”). We used fMRI and Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) to test the hypothesis that emotional faces differentially alter the functional coupling among face‐responsive regions. Three monkeys viewed conspecific faces with neutral, threatening, fearful, and appeasing expressions. Using Bayesian model selection, various models of neural interactions between the posterior (TEO) and anterior (TE) portions of inferior temporal (IT) cortex, the amygdala, the orbitofrontal (OFC), and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) were tested. The valence effect was mediated by feedback connections from the amygdala to TE and TEO, and feedback connections from VLPFC to the amygdala and TE. Emotional faces were associated with differential effective connectivity: Fearful faces evoked stronger modulations in the connections from the amygdala to TE and TEO; threatening faces evoked weaker modulations in the connections from the amygdala and VLPFC to TE; and appeasing faces evoked weaker modulations in the connection from VLPFC to the amygdala.

Principal Findings Comfort-distance was larger than other conditions when participants were passive, but reachability and comfort distances were similar when participants were active. Both spaces were modulated by the social valence of stimuli (reduction with virtual females vs males, expansion with cylinder vs robot) and the gender of participants.

Our main contribution is to propose a perceptual evaluation of a simple virtual reality system. The goal is to assess whether real humans are also able to accurately estimate a virtual human motion before collision avoidance. Results show that, even through a simple system, users are able to correctly evaluate the situation of an interaction on the qualitative point of view. Especially, in comparison with real interactions, users accurately decide whether they should give way to the virtual human or not. However, on the quantitative point of view, it is not easy for users to determine whether they will collide with virtual humans or not. On one hand, deciding to give way or not is a two-choice problem. On the other hand, detecting future collision requires to determine whether some visual variables belong some interval or not.

The idea is put forward, based on the experience of a large number of experimental studies, that there are two orthogonal components that contribute to this realistic response. The first is ‘being there’, often called ‘presence’, the qualia of having a sensation of being in a real place. We call this place illusion (PI). Second, plausibility illusion (Psi) refers to the illusion that the scenario being depicted is actually occurring. In the case of both PI and Psi the participant knows for sure that they are not ‘there’ and that the events are not occurring. PI is constrained by the sensorimotor contingencies afforded by the virtual reality system. Psi is determined by the extent to which the system can produce events that directly relate to the participant, the overall credibility of the scenario being depicted in comparison with expectations. We argue that when both PI and Psi occur, participants will respond realistically to the virtual reality.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 49, 'citationCount': 1485, 'journal': {'volume': '364', 'pages': '3549 - 3557', 'name': 'Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Slater2009PlaceIA,\n author = {M.

In many experiments, however, these arm movements are ambiguous. Arm flexion can be interpreted either as pulling (approach) or as withdrawing (avoidance). On the contrary, arm extension can be interpreted as reaching (approach) or as pushing (avoidance). This ambiguity can be resolved by regarding approach and avoidance as flexible action plans that are represented in terms of their effects. Approach actions reduce the distance between a stimulus and the self, whereas avoidance actions increase that distance. In this view, action effects are an integral part of the representation of an action. As a result, a neutral action can become an approach or avoidance reaction if it repeatedly results in decreasing or increasing the distance to a valenced stimulus. This hypothesis was tested in the current study. Participants responded to positive and negative words using key-presses. These “neutral” responses (not involving arm flexion or extension) were consistently followed by a stimulus movement toward or away from the participant. Responses to emotional words were faster when the response's effect was congruent with stimulus valence, suggesting that approach/avoidance actions are indeed defined in terms of their outcomes."", 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 18, 'citationCount': 109, 'journal': {'volume': '61', 'pages': '1298 - 1306', 'name': 'Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Dantzig2008ApproachAA,\n author = {Saskia van Dantzig and D.

Thus we used fMRI to determine which brain areas subserve processing of high‐valence expressions and if distinct brain areas are activated when facial expressions are processed explicitly or implicitly. Nine healthy volunteers were scanned (1.5T GE Signa with ANMR, TE/TR 40/3,000 ms) during two similar experiments in which blocks of mixed happy and angry facial expressions (“on” condition) were alternated with blocks of neutral faces (control “off” condition). Experiment 1 examined explicit processing of expressions by requiring subjects to attend to, and judge, facial expression. Experiment 2 examined implicit processing of expressions by requiring subjects to attend to, and judge, facial gender, which was counterbalanced in both experimental conditions. Processing of facial expressions significantly increased regional blood oxygenation level‐dependent (BOLD) activity in fusiform and middle temporal gyri, hippocampus, amygdalohippocampal junction, and pulvinar nucleus. Explicit processing evoked significantly more activity in temporal lobe cortex than implicit processing, whereas implicit processing evoked significantly greater activity in amygdala region. Mixed high‐valence facial expressions are processed within temporal lobe visual cortex, thalamus, and amygdalohippocampal complex. Also, neural substrates for explicit and implicit processing of facial expressions are dissociable: explicit processing activates temporal lobe cortex, whereas implicit processing activates amygdala region.

In Experiment 1, consistent with resource allocation theory (H. C. Ellis & P. W.

Holyoak, 1985)—participants confirmed where they normally falsify. Experiment 2 revealed the same confirmatory responses for participants performing a concurrent distracter task, indicating that induced mood states suppress reasoning by depleting central executive resources. This hypothesis was directly tested in Experiment 3. Participants in a positive, but not in a negative, mood state showed suppressed performance on the Tower of London task (T. Shallice, 1982)—the classical central executive task. The robust positive mood effects and the confirmation effects are discussed in terms of the D. A. Norman and T. Shallice (1986) model of central executive function and recent accounts of selection task performance (L. Cosmides, 1989; K. I. Manktelow & D. E. Over, 1991; M. Oaksford & N.

The twenty-one contributions focus on the implementation, application, and impact of computer-mediated communication in a global context. Previously limited to scientific research, global networks now have an impact on social, educational, and business communications. Individuals with a personal computer, a modem, and some simple software can join a new social community that is based on interest, not location. Global Networks, which was written largely with the assistance of the internet, provides an understanding of the issues, opportunities, and pitfalls of this new social connectivity. It looks at how networking technology can support and augment communication and collaboration from such perspectives as policy constraints and opportunities, language differences, cross-cultural communication, and social network design.

Social scientists in the field of human ecology have been concerned primarily with the distribution of such things as social classes, economic institutions, and mental illness. An almost unexplored area is microecology or the way that people in pairs or small groups arrange themselves. In the studies of Hediger (5), Howard (6), and Von Uexkull (15), ""space"" has had two different meanings. The more familiar of these refers to space in the geographic sense, i.e., space as area. It is most commonly discussed with reference to the animal\'s territory or home. However, some writers have applied the concept of territory to human behavior. W. F. Whyte (16) and Thrasher (14) have studied the territories of adolescent gangs. W. H. Whyte (17) also has studied the groupings of people within a housing development. Probably the most intensive investigation thus far has been that of Barker and Wright (2) in the Midwest. Yet this still remains relatively unexplored territory for social scientists. The second way in which the term ""space"" is used can be called ""personal space of the organism."" Although it has its roots in the work of zoologists and ethologists, it is an entirely different concept from that of territory. Personal distance is the distance that the organism customarily places between itself and other organisms. This distance may vary from species to species and individual to individual. Hediger speaks of this as ""flight distance"" and has measured this for hundreds of animals. This concept would seem to have relevance for the study of human behavior, although it has never been studied empirically so far as we know. It seems obvious that people feel uncomfortable when they talk to others who either stand too close or too far away. The concept itself has been used several times in the literature. David Katz (8) used the term ""personal space"" and compared it to the shell of a snail. Von Uexkull used the graphic analogy of people ""surrounded by soap-bubble worlds."" Stern (13) developed the concept of personal world. He noted that the physical world was without a center, but the', 'year': 1959, 'referenceCount': 8, 'citationCount': 422, 'journal': {'volume': '22', 'pages': '247-260', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Sommer1959StudiesIP,\n author = {R.

Aim: The aim of this study was to develop a rehabilitation program based on vibroacoustic and virtual reality techniques and evaluate its effectiveness on the emotional profile of children with ASD. Method: The research employed a single-subject ABA design. The population included all children with ASD attending the Zehn ara Rehabilitation Clinic in Tehran in the second half of 2021, from which 5 participants were purposively selected. Initially, the combined program was implemented for 10 sessions of 30 minutes each on two randomly chosen participants from the sample, and after validating the program, three additional participants were included in the study. The Sensory Profile 2 questionnaire (2014) was used in this research. During the baseline phase, at the end of each intervention session, and during a one-month follow-up period, the questionnaires were completed. Data analysis involved visual analysis, percentage of improvement, and percentage of overlapping and non-overlapping data. Results: The results indicated that based on the obtained effect sizes, the intervention had a significant impact on emotional regulation in participants 1 to 5, with 90%, 80%, 80%, 100%, and 90% certainty, respectively. Furthermore, the percentage of improvement resulting from the interventions for participants 1 to 5 was 20.08%, 28.75%, 28.24%, 27.24%, and 21.02%, respectively. Conclusion: Based on the findings, the combined rehabilitation program was effective in improving the emotional profile of children with autism.

This research is contextualised within the growing field of short‐term therapy as it intersects the growing demand to therapeutically address clients on the autism spectrum. The treatment intervention is delineated through five sequential phases within the walk‐in clinic setting for the practitioner clinician. A rationale, overview, and instruction for the practitioner clinician utilising this novel model is provided through a case study format. By using a more structured and integrated approach to treatment, organised through an externalised metaphor, it is suggested that the current model will be more effective for this specific clinical population. Additionally, a case illustration is provided that scaffolds the treatment model, which includes table formats and pictures. The case study illustrates the self‐regulation map metaphor visually and interactively linking client challenges, strategies, and motivations simultaneously on multiple electronic devices in session. Relevant works were selected to explore the effectiveness of single‐session consultation models for those presenting on the autism spectrum.

Once commonalities were identified within session, they were categorized or grouped into themes or general stages of change within the parameters of a four to six session model of short-term therapy. Commonalities in therapeutic stages of change may more accurately and uniformly measure outcome in short-term work, unlike the symptom-specific psychometric instruments of longer-term psychotherapy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA systematic framework for evaluating the client and clinician adherence to 20 specific tasks for these four short-term therapies is presented through the newly proposed, Brief Task Acquisition Scale (BTAS). It is further proposed that the client-clinicians' adherence to these tasks will track and ultimately increase treatment integrity.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThus, when the client-clinician relationship tracks and evaluates the three pillars of (1) stage/process change, (2) task acquisition, and (3) treatment integrity, the culmination of these efforts presents a new way of more sensitively measuring outcome in short-term psychotherapy. Data collection is suggested as a first step to empirically evaluate the testable hypotheses suggested within this current model. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message The clinician practitioner will note that the proposed Brief Services model removes the subjectivity of client satisfaction as a reliable outcome measure, and relies upon client and therapist adherence to specific tasks and stages of change within and across short-term psychotherapy. The clinical significance of the BTAS for the practitioner is three fold. The psychometric instrument (1) tracks stage or process change, (2) guides task acquisition, and (3) incorporates greater treatment integrity unlike other outcome measures. The BTAS present a new way of conceptualizing change in short-term psychotherapy regardless of modality or presenting issue, making it a more flexible and usable instrument for the clinician. The BTAS may measure outcome more sensitively and accurately, thus offering the client, therapist and client-therapist more information regarding change at each stage and at the end of short-term psychotherapy."", 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 27, 'citationCount': 9, 'journal': {'volume': '23 3', 'pages': '\n          260-71\n        ', 'name': 'Clinical psychology & psychotherapy'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{McGuinty2016RedefiningOM,\n author = {Everett McGuinty and John Nelson and A.

This intervention is primarily based upon an externalizing process, transforming of metaphoric imagery, and shifting of underlying maladaptive emotional schemas. This article addresses the clinical population of children and youth, specifically through outlining the protocol, externalizing metaphors therapy. A selective review of significant works regarding the efficacy of short-term therapy was conducted, including the process of change within narrative therapy. It is proposed that two specific processes account for the mental health change experienced by clients who receive this new treatment intervention: (1) externalization of problems and (2) purposeful client-generated metaphor manipulation, impacting upon underlying schemas. From these theoretical constructs, the present article outlines a three-session treatment protocol that manualizes these key clinical processes. A case study is presented to illustrate this intervention for anxiety and depression. Further clinical research is underway to address the testable hypotheses resulting from the current theoretical model. Clinical trials in brief psychotherapy are suggested to empirically evaluate the efficacy of this new treatment intervention for dysphoria.\n\n\nKEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE\nThis article outlines a short-term treatment intervention for anxiety and depression (dysphoira) through a novel 3-session model, where the clinician-practitioner can obtain competency through a one-day workshop.Its relevance for the clinical researcher and the mental health community is in its versatility in addressing internalizing behavior for four clinical populations: (1) children and adolescents; (2) children and adolescents on the autism spectrum; (3) adults in general; and, (4) adults with a dual-diagnosis. The treatment protocol described within is based upon the externalizing and deconstructive properties of Narrative Therapy, and the transformation of metaphoric imagery of Metaphor Therapy; both of which have little empirical support with narrative practices gaining international attention and widespread usage - through brief therapy, long-term therapy, and walk-in clinics in North America.

Method A thorough review of relevant databases was undertaken to locate published studies reporting client outcomes following SST. The focus of the review is research involving clients and presenting problems typically seen in community-based mental health and family counselling agencies. Results The findings suggest that the majority of clients attending either previously scheduled or walk-in SST find it sufficient and helpful. The studies imply that this model of service delivery leads to perceived improvement in presenting problems in general, and on specific measures of variables such as depression, anxiety, distress level and confidence in parenting skills.

Our approach is based on typical synergies within the two branches of the ANS. It covers both parasympathetic tone and sympathetic tone, and their impact on skin tone, pupil diameter and sweat. We also present the triggering of tears. We discuss the implementation of the approach as part of a 3D toolkit. This work is aimed at supporting the development of affective features for realtime intelligent artificial agents, and the study of the perception of mixed emotion and emotion regulation. We demonstrate how varying ANS parameters impacts facial behaviour, contrasting emotionally consistent vs inconsistent musculoskeletal and ANS-related features.",2020,43,5,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 20th ACM International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents'},"{'bibtex': ""@Book{Tisserand2020RealtimeSO,\n author = {Y.

Die mimische Expression grundlegender Emotionen ist über verschiedene Kulturen hinweg sehr ähnlich und du weist auch Gemeinsamkeiten zu anderen Säugetieren auf. Dies deutet auf einen gemeinsamen genetischen Ursprung des Zusammenhangs von Mimik und Emotion. Neuere Untersuchungen zeigen aber auch kulturelle Einflüsse und Unterschiede. Die Erkennung von Emotionen aus der Mimik und auch der Prozess des mimischen Ausdrucks der eigenen Emotionen erfolgt in einem äußerst komplexen zerebralen Netzwerk. Aufgrund der Komplexität des zerebralen Verarbeitungssystems gibt es eine Vielzahl von neurologischen und psychiatrischen Erkrankungen, welche die Kopplung von Mimik und Emotionen erheblich stören können. Auch durch das Tragen von Masken wird unsere Fähigkeit zur Übermittlung und zum Erkennen von Emotionen über die Mimik eingeschränkt. Durch die Mimik lassen sich aber nicht nur „echte“ Emotionen ausdrücken, sondern auch gespielte. Damit eröffnet die Mimik die Möglichkeit sozial erwünschten Ausdruck vorzuspielen und auch Emotionen bewusst vorzutäuschen. Diese Täuschungen sind jedoch zumeist nicht perfekt und können von kurzfristigen Gesichtsbewegungen begleitet sein, die auf die tatsächlich vorhandenen Emotionen hinweisen (Mikroexpressionen). Diese Mikroexpressionen sind von nur sehr kurzer Dauer und vom Menschen häufig kaum wahrnehmbar, jedoch das ideale Anwendungsgebiet für computergestützte Analysen. Diese automatische Identifikation von Mikroexpressionen hat in den letzten Jahren nicht nur wissenschaftliche Aufmerksamkeit erfahren, sondern ihr Einsatz wird auch in sicherheitsrelevanten Bereichen getestet. Der vorliegende Artikel fasst den aktuellen Wissensstand von Mimik und Emotionen zusammen. ABSTRACT Human facial expressions are unique in their ability to express our emotions and communicate them to others. The mimic expression of basic emotions is very similar across different cultures and has also many features in common with other mammals. This suggests a common genetic origin of the association between facial expressions and emotion. However, recent studies also show cultural influences and differences. The recognition of emotions from facial expressions, as well as the process of expressing one’s emotions facially, occurs within an extremely complex cerebral network. Due to the complexity of the cerebral processing system, there are a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders that can significantly disrupt the coupling of facial expressions and emotions. Wearing masks also limits our ability to convey and recognize emotions through facial expressions. Through facial expressions, however, not only “real” emotions can be expressed, but also acted ones. Thus, facial expressions open up the possibility of faking socially desired expressions and also of consciously faking emotions. However, these pretenses are mostly imperfect and can be accompanied by short-term facial movements that indicate the emotions that are actually present (microexpressions). These microexpressions are of very short duration and often barely perceptible by humans, but they are the ideal application area for computer-aided analysis. This automatic identification of microexpressions has not only received scientific attention in recent years, but its use is also being tested in security-related areas. This article summarizes the current state of knowledge of facial expressions and emotions.', 'year': 2023, 'referenceCount': 131, 'citationCount': 1374, 'journal': {'volume': '102', 'pages': 'S115 - S125', 'name': 'Laryngo- Rhino- Otologie'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Klingner2023FacialEA,\n author = {C.

Guided by new conceptual and quantitative approaches (Cowen, Elfenbein, Laukka, & Keltner, 2018; Cowen & Keltner, 2017, 2018), we explore the taxonomy of emotion recognized in facial-bodily expression. Participants (N = 1,794; 940 female, ages 18-76 years) judged the emotions captured in 1,500 photographs of facial-bodily expression in terms of emotion categories, appraisals, free response, and ecological validity. We find that facial-bodily expressions can reliably signal at least 28 distinct categories of emotion that occur in everyday life. Emotion categories, more so than appraisals such as valence and arousal, organize emotion recognition. However, categories of emotion recognized in naturalistic facial and bodily behavior are not discrete but bridged by smooth gradients that correspond to continuous variations in meaning. Our results support a novel view that emotions occupy a high-dimensional space of categories bridged by smooth gradients of meaning. They offer an approximation of a taxonomy of facial-bodily expressions, visualized within an online interactive map.

Despite equivalent overall picture brightness and contrast, pupil diameter still varied as a function of the local brightness of central vision at fixation.

It remains unresolved how much recognition and discrimination of expressions rely on the perception of morphological patterns or the processing of affective content. This review of research on the role of visual and emotional factors in expression recognition reached three major conclusions. First, behavioral, neurophysiological, and computational measures indicate that basic expressions are reliably recognized and discriminated from one another, albeit the effect may be inflated by the use of prototypical expression stimuli and forced-choice responses. Second, affective content along the dimensions of valence and arousal is extracted early from facial expressions, although this coarse affective representation contributes minimally to categorical recognition of specific expressions. Third, the physical configuration and visual saliency of facial features contribute significantly to expression recognition, with “emotionless” computational models being able to reproduce some of the basic phenomena demonstrated in human observers.

In the second, subjects compare excitement, relaxation, focus, pain, relief, boredom, anger, fear, panic, disgust, surprise, startle, sadness, and joy expressed in an agent with or without typical respiration patterns. The first study shows a statistically significant positive effect on perception of surprise, sadness, anger, shame, and fear. The second study shows a statistically significant positive effect on perception of excitement, pain, relief, boredom, anger, fear, panic, disgust, and startle.

The framework consists of a coupled Bayesian network (BN) to unify the facial expression analysis and synthesis into one coherent structure. At the analysis end, we cast the FAPs and facial action coding system (FACS) into a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to account for uncertainties in FAP extraction and to model the dynamic evolution of facial expressions. At the synthesizer, a static BN reconstructs the FAPs and their intensity. The two BNs are connected statically through a data stream link. Using the coupled BN to analyze and synthesize the dynamic facial expressions is the major novelty of this work. The novelty brings about several benefits. First, very low bitrate (9 bytes per frame) in data transmission can be achieved. Second, a facial expression is inferred through both spatial and temporal inference so that the perceptual quality of animation is less affected by the misdetected FAPs. Third, more realistic looking facial expressions can be reproduced by modelling the dynamics of human expressions.', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 46, 'citationCount': 75, 'journal': {'volume': '18', 'pages': '1383-1396', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Zhang2008DynamicFE,\n author = {Yongmian Zhang and Q.

Functions of barycentric coordinates are applied to simulate the curved ridges. The visible (macro) flexure lines which may form wrinkles are predefined edges on the micro structure.

These meaningmaking resources are grouped together as the “language of evaluation” on the grounds that they are all means by which the speaker’s/writer’s personal, evaluative involvement in the text is revealed as they adopt stances either toward phenomena (the entities, happenings, or states of affairs being construed by the text) or toward metaphenomena (propositions about these entities, happenings, and states of affairs). Early work on the appraisal framework largely focused on evaluative meanings in English, with this literature noting that no assumptions should be made as to whether the evaluative categories proposed for English necessarily operate in other languages. Subsequently, researchers have employed the descriptive principles that underlie the framework in work on other languages and in work that compares and contrasts evaluative meanings across languages (see, for example, Thomson & White, 2008). The view of language adopted by the architects of the appraisal framework is that of the systemic functional linguistic theory of Halliday and his associates (Halliday, 1994). Accordingly they hold that meaning-making can usefully be divided into three broad modes, or what Halliday terms “metafunctions”: (1) “ideational” meaning by which language construes the world of experience, (2) “interpersonal” meaning by which speakers/writers enact social roles, personas, and relationships, and (3) “textual” meaning by which these ideational and interpersonal meanings are organized into coherent texts appropriate for a given communicative setting. The evaluative meanings described by the appraisal framework provide some of the mechanisms by which the “interpersonal” metafunction operates, in that they present speakers/writers as revealing their feelings, tastes, and opinions with greater or lesser degrees of intensity and directness, as construing propositions as more or as less contentious or warrantable, and as thereby aligning or disaligning with value positions in play in the current communicative context. Within the model of the interpersonal metafunction proposed by Martin (1997) these resources of “appraisal” operate alongside two other interpersonal systems: those communicative resources by which speakers/writers perform speech functions such as asserting, questioning, responding, commanding, advising, and offering,', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 7, 'citationCount': 275, 'journal': {'name': 'Encyclopedia of Personality and Individual Differences'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{White2020AppraisalT,\n author = {P.

In this article, using a “reverse engineering” approach, we suggest that emotion inference from facial expression mirrors the expression process. As a strong case can be made for an appraisal theory account of emotional expression, which holds that appraisal results directly determine the nature of facial muscle actions, we claim that observers first detect specific appraisals from different facial muscle actions and then use implicit inference rules to categorize and name specific emotions. We report three experiments in which, guided by theoretical predictions and past empirical evidence, we systematically manipulated specific facial action units individually and in different configurations via synthesized avatar expressions. Large, diverse groups of participants judged the resulting videos for the underlying appraisals and/or the ensuing emotions. The results confirm that participants can infer targeted appraisals and emotions from synthesized facial actions based on appraisal predictions. We also report evidence that the ability to correctly interpret the synthesized stimuli is highly correlated with emotion recognition ability as part of emotional competence. We conclude by highlighting the importance of adopting a theory-based experimental approach in future research, focusing on the dynamic unfolding of facial expressions of emotion.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 78, 'citationCount': 37, 'journal': {'volume': '114', 'pages': '358–379', 'name': 'Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Scherer2018AppraisalDrivenFA,\n author = {K.

It does this by way of parasympathetic innervation from postganglionic fibers that originate from neurons in the ciliary and pterygopalatine ganglia, and by way of sympathetic innervation from postganglionic fibers that originate from neurons in the superior cervical ganglion. Ciliary ganglion neurons project to the ciliary body and the sphincter pupillae muscle of the iris to control ocular accommodation and pupil constriction, respectively. Superior cervical ganglion neurons project to the dilator pupillae muscle of the iris to control pupil dilation. Ocular blood flow is controlled both via direct autonomic influences on the vasculature of the optic nerve, choroid, ciliary body, and iris, as well as via indirect influences on retinal blood flow. In mammals, this vasculature is innervated by vasodilatory fibers from the pterygopalatine ganglion, and by vasoconstrictive fibers from the superior cervical ganglion. Intraocular pressure is regulated primarily through the balance of aqueous humor formation and outflow. Autonomic regulation of ciliary body blood vessels and the ciliary epithelium is an important determinant of aqueous humor formation; autonomic regulation of the trabecular meshwork and episcleral blood vessels is an important determinant of aqueous humor outflow. These tissues are all innervated by fibers from the pterygopalatine and superior cervical ganglia. In addition to these classical autonomic pathways, trigeminal sensory fibers exert local, intrinsic influences on many of these regions of the eye, as well as on some neurons within the ciliary and pterygopalatine ganglia.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 420, 'citationCount': 371, 'journal': {'volume': '5 1', 'pages': '\n          439-73\n        ', 'name': 'Comprehensive Physiology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{McDougal2015AutonomicCO,\n author = {D.

It has been used for assessments and training in social cognition with the use of virtual agents instead of face-to-face interactions – but its potential for the study of social emotion regulation has, perhaps surprisingly, largely remained untapped. The present study evaluates a novel immersive VR scenario designed to study the efficacy of social support by a virtual agent using a modified version of Cyberball, an established paradigm to induce the feeling of ostracism. Participants embodied a new pupil in a virtual school environment and played Cyberball, after which they either did or did not receive emotional support. Self-reports and psychophysiological markers demonstrated that the negative impact of social exclusion in Cyberball was successfully replicated, while participants also reported a significant improvement in emotional state after being supported by the virtual agent. These results indicate the potential of the developed scenario for research on social emotion regulation in immersive VR. Future studies could aim to test the efficacy of social support for people with difficulties in self-regulation, for example individuals with high social anxiety, with a view to developing training programs in VR.",2023,0,1,"{'name': 'Int.

Methods: In July 2020, 15 subjects were selected to complete two groups of treadmill walking training experiments in virtual natural environment and daily environment respectively. At the same time, the subjects' skin electrical (EDA) , pulse frequency (Pf) , respiratory frequency (Rf) physiological data and Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) data before and after walking were collected; the mean value of three dimensions of SAM and the emotion difference before and after the experiment were calculated. The differences of physiological indexes and subjective mood changes of subjects were tested by paired sample t-test. Results: Compared with the daily environment, the ΔEDA, ΔPf and ΔRf of the subjects in the virtual natural environment were all decreased , and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). There were statistically significant differences in pleasure and arousal between subjects before and after using the virtual natural environment (P <0.05). Compared with the daily environment, the Δpleasure degree of subjects using the virtual natural environment increased, and the Δarousal degree and Δdominance degree decreased, and the differences were statistically significant (P <0.05).

The role of Emerging Technologies","Traditionally, metacognition & higher mental abilities are thought to be exclusively linked to consciousness. However, a growing number of researchers support the idea that nonconscious processes may hold the keys to higher forms of intelligence. Subliminal messages expose individuals to visual or/and auditory stimuli below the threshold of perception. The current review aims to explore the effectiveness of subliminal cues on fundamental aspects of metacognition such as higher cognitive and emotional meta-abilities, affective and behavioral regulation, and academic achievement. In this context, we search for and classify the existing subliminal training techniques, while evaluating the usability of ICTs such as virtual reality, mobile apps, intelligent tutoring systems, and software in subliminal learning and training. The results of this review revealed that subliminal techniques improve all those aspects that assure metacognitive improvements in terms of self- & emotional regulation, higher mental abilities, and behavioral modification. Subliminal cues lower people's shields and update filtering mechanisms enabling people to focus on positive rather than negative interpretations. Subliminal techniques are under the umbrella of metacognitive strategies, since they can used consciously to increase self-regulation capacity as wells as expand the horizons of consciousness. Subliminal teaching techniques can be used by teachers and parents in general and special education to instill higher-level needs & motives, accelerate students’ performance and unfold students’ existing but underdeveloped abilities. Therapists can also utilize these methods to help patients with phobia, anxiety and depression to overcome fear. Subliminal techniques can be also used as a strategy by leaders, mentors, and employees to build trust, inspire and provide humanity with innovative ideas.

24,d325cb336f74cc884dcd311e0703b48ccee63da2,Using virtual reality to train emotional and social skills in children with autism spectrum disorder,"Abstract With emerging technology, computerised, internet-based and virtual reality (VR)-based treatment and training became increasingly popular. VR provides an immersive experience into a simulated environment. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterised by social communication deficits and repetitive behaviours. Children with ASD often require social skills training while VR provides a safe, controllable environment to practice skills repeatedly. The Centre for Innovative Applications of Internet and Multimedia Technologies (AIMTech Centre) at City University of Hong Kong developed a VR-enabled training program to examine its efficacy on emotional and social skills with six VR scenarios depicting the daily lives of typical children in Hong Kong. 94 children from mainstream primary schools in Hong Kong completed the study and 72 children were included in the analysis. Children from training group scored higher on emotion expression and regulation (M = 20.2, SD = 3.00) than before the training (M = 18.9, SD = 3.57, t(35) = −2.174, p = .037) and higher on social interaction and adaptation after the training (M = 21.8, SD = 2.99) than before training (M = 20.2, SD = 3.43, t(35) = −3.987, p < .0005). There was a statistically significant interaction between group and time on affective expressions, F(1, 70) = 5.223, p = .025, partial η2 = .069, and on social reciprocity, F(1, 70) = 7.769, p = .007, partial η2 = .100. Children were able to engage in VR training despite initial challenges with viewing goggles. Some children declined to participate due to scheduling reasons which may be minimised through the adoption of head-mounted displays as a portable, cost-effective device. VR seems to be a promising asset to traditional training and therapy while the importance trainers’ or therapists’ support has yet to be further investigated.",2018,7,79,"{'name': 'London Journal of Primary Care', 'pages': '110 - 112', 'volume': '10'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Yuan2018UsingVR,\n author = {Sze Ngar Vanessa Yuan and H.

The emotional regulation (ER) strategies that we use determine the way in which we feel, express, and behave. Moreover, ER strategies are particularly important in adolescents, a population for which ER strategy deficits can be linked to the appearance of numerous mental health disorders, such as depression or anxiety, or disruptive behaviors. Thus, the early detection of dysfunctional ER strategies and training in adaptive ER strategies can help prevent future occurrences of possible behavioral and psychosocial disorders. In this article, the authors present the GameTeen System (GT-System), a novel instrument based on virtual reality and serious games for the assessment and training of ER strategies in adolescents. The results of their preliminary evaluation suggest that this system can effectively train and evaluate emotional regulation strategies in adolescents.",2015,4,39,"{'name': 'IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications', 'pages': '65-73', 'volume': '35'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rodríguez2015AVS,\n author = {Alejandro Rodríguez and B.

Common issues in these days are increasing nuclear family life style and emphasizing on materialistic prospects. All these changes have their own pros and cons. Changing shades of life in the contemporary world gave way to idyllic as well as harmful life style in individuals. Working parents, increased use of virtual social media, irrational following of western culture and lack of supporting guidance from elders are making our youth isolated, negative and specifically prone to drug addiction. One of the modem world's evils is drug abuse and intensified addiction. Governments all over the world dispatch constant efforts to reduce the drug trafficking by enacting strict laws and enforcing the same. But the corruption of human resource is still high due to drug addictions and the positive potentials of individuals are stunted. One such which has rooted strongly, is Opioid Addiction and for sure it is a hindrance for the progress of youth as well as the nation.Opioid Addiction: Opioid Addiction is characterized by individual inability to stop using opiates like heroin, smack, dodhe, afeem, brown sugar etc. and also presence of strong desire to take such drugs. It is mainly used initially as experimenting and for the sake of pleasure; and later to relieve cravings. The pattem of addiction starts primarily from abuse, gradually moving towards dependence or craving and ending up engaged in compulsion. This compulsion is harmful to an individual in psychological and biological modalities as well. It has been reported by Kosten and George (2002) that brain abnormalities are resulted from the use of heroin, morphine derived drugs. As per International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-IO (2009) any three or more following signs must be present to diagnose opioid withdrawal state - (i) Craving for an opioid drug, (ii) Rhinorrhea or sneezing, (iii) Lacrimation, (iv) Muscle aches or cramps, (v) Abdominal cramps, (vi) Nausea or vomiting, (v) Diarrhea, (vi) Pupillary dilatation, (vii) recurrent chills, (viii) Tachycardia or hypertension, (ix) Yawning, and (x) restless sleep. Chronic use of opioids may lead to weight loss, loss of libido, epilepsy, fatigue and skin changes.These drugs are derived from opium poppy which can be abused by inhaling through nose, injected into a vein or smoked in a cigarette. It is strongly believed that these drugs create euphoria, a feeling of intense pleasure in an individual. As a result, individuals become dependent upon them and when they need more of the opioids to get desired effect, they tend to have 'High Tolerance', i.e., the expansion of threshold in consuming drugs. Its intoxication can cause confusion, hallucinations, provide analgesia by binding to specific receptors in the brain, spinal cord, and to a lesser degree, the peripheral nervous system. When the opioid binds to the appropriate receptor, transmission of pain impulses is inhibited. The three main classes of these opioid receptors that constitute the endogenous opioid system are referred to as mu, delta, and kappa. This system is involved in many functions including modulation of the response to painful stimuli and stressors; reward and reinforcement; and homeostatic adaptive functions such as regulation of food, water, and temperature (Hilaire, 2010).Causes of addiction There are many reasons that are responsible for drug abuse. Kreek (2012) suggested that the internal as well as external factors are responsible including stress, social setting and addict mindset. Now-a-days, the very first reason for addiction among youth can be logically identified as relationship problems or breakups. They are engaged in relationships and when they find difficult to maintain it or doesn't get attention from the partner they start engaging themselves in drugs. Instead of facing or solving the problems, they disengage themselves and seek pleasure from substances. …",2017,0,0,"{'name': 'Indian journal of positive psychology', 'pages': '138-141', 'volume': '8'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sharma2017EmotionalRA,\n author = {G.

27,3728f90e115551e777cb0be8a8eb873a5555df0a,Development of Social Mediation and Emotional Regulation in Virtual Learning Environment Research.,"Abstract 
This paper puts forward a series of theoretical underpinnings and design considerations for embodying emotional and aesthetic aspects of virtual (reality) learning environments (VLEs) in support of ubiquitous teaching, studying and learning. The authors assert that a VLE should be considered an interactive and sensation-producing affordances and instruments, as well as a mediator of communication and learning. Furthermore, a VLE should be valued as a tool for emotional and socio-structural mediation, as well as for the psycho-social regulation and control over the communication situation that the environment makes possible by allowing users to regulate psycho-social distances. 
Researchers in studying and learning have too often neglected emotional and aesthetic factors, especially in the context of network-based learning environments. These factors are examined here in terms of seven levels of observation forming a continuum from the individual subconscious/conscious interpersonal level to the social, cultural, cross- and transcultural levels. The continuum is mapped onto learning architectures, offering a greater understanding of their value as starting points and design considerations for VLEs in regulating learning. The most critical issue is to take into account the users — the human individual(s) — and the social nature(s) of using the technologies involved.

This effect was certainly evident in healthcare professional’s children that saw their parents being called to the battlefield front line against an invisible enemy and at the same time facing the media avalanche propelling fear and insecurity. Material and Methods: This state of restlessness and vulnerability promoted the development of therapeutic mindfulness groups for children or children and parents (healthcare professional related), from a Hospital Reference Center, over a period of eight weeks. Results: Throughout the sessions, high adherence to conscious attention techniques was observed, allowing the children to overcome physical distance obstacles in a virtual context used as a gateway to the living circumstances and the difficulties experienced at the time of the intervention. Discussion: In the end, improvements were reported in anxious and depressive symptoms with greater capacity for emotional regulation, interpersonal communication and impulse management.

The Perspectives of Emotional Attachment and Flow Experience,"ABSTRACT Gift-giving is popular in live streaming, and many users irrationally send virtual gifts to their favorite live streamers. Based on the attachment and flow theories, we applied the stimulus-organism-response model to explore the influence of live streamer characteristics (trustworthiness, expertise, attractiveness) and live scene characteristics (telepresence, instant feedback, interactivity, entertainment) on users’ gift-giving intention through emotional attachment and flow experience. Four hundred and three valid responses to a survey questionnaire were analyzed. Findings of the research results include three aspects. First, live streamer characteristics (trustworthiness and attractiveness) can stimulate users’ emotional attachment to a live streamer, thus promoting users’ gift-giving intention. Second, live scene characteristics (telepresence and entertainment) can stimulate users’ flow experience in live streaming. Third, users’ flow experience influences their emotional attachment to live streamer.",2021,108,57,"{'name': 'International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction', 'pages': '1317 - 1329', 'volume': '37'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Li2021WhatDG,\n author = {Yi Li and Yi Peng},\n booktitle = {International journal of human computer interactions},\n journal = {International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction},\n pages = {1317 - 1329},\n title = {What Drives Gift-giving Intention in Live Streaming?

Consequently, tourism authorities focus much attention on the factors that could give them a competitive advantage especially in attracting repeat visitations to certain tourist destinations. The current study explores the path, environment → place attachment → revisit intention using the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) model. The study obtained 455 responses from visitors to Batam Island in Indonesia using the convenience sampling method. This led to the formulation of hypotheses using the structural equation modeling (SEM). Novel findings are revealed. Atmosphere environment has a high positive correlation with place dependence while low positive correlation with place identity, place dependence, and place social bonding. Furthermore, the cultural environment is unimportant and insignificant in predicting place attachment. Interestingly, place attachment dimensions positively support revisit intentions. Place social binding is the most crucial feature of place attachment in revisit intentions. Thus, the findings obtained from documenting the importance of social interactions in tourism destinations are invaluable to tourism authorities, tourist practitioners, and tourism management in locating and extending tourist centers by reflecting on the physical and service environmental facilities that trigger social bonding-revisit effects. The findings shape new thinking to increase tourists’ repeat visits. 摘要 在一些国家, 旅游业被认为是一个重要的经济驱动力。因此, 旅游当局非常重视能够使他们具有竞争优势的因素, 特别是在吸引某些旅游目的地的重游方面。本研究采用刺激-组织-反应(S-O-R)模型, 探索环境→依恋位置→重游意愿的影响路径。该研究采用便利抽样的方法, 从印尼巴丹岛的游客中获得了455份问卷, 并且使用结构方程模型(SEM)检验了假设。研究表明, 大气环境与地方依赖呈高度正相关, 而与地方认同、地方依赖、地方社会联系呈低度正相关。此外, 文化环境在预测地点依恋方面并不显著。有趣的是, 地方依恋维度正向支持重游意愿。地点社会联系是地点依恋影响重游意愿的最重要的特征。因此, 通过记录旅游目的地社会互动的重要性所得到的研究结果, 对于旅游当局、旅游从业者和旅游管理人员反思触发社会纽带-再访效应的物质和服务环境设施, 选址和扩增旅游中心是非常宝贵的。这些发现为增加游客的重游提供了新的思路。', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 156, 'citationCount': 53, 'journal': {'volume': '22', 'pages': '51 - 82', 'name': 'Tourism Geographies'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Isa2020TheEO,\n author = {S.

In addition, viewers can engage with broadcasters by sending danmaku, a type of comment scrolled across the screen in real time. This paper investigates the role of viewers’ social interaction in paid gifting on live streaming platforms. We argue that viewer-viewer interaction can prompt paid gifting by affecting viewers’ arousal level through stimuli extracted from danmaku. Types of danmaku-related stimuli are presence of others, social competition, and emotional stimuli. Specifically, presence of others is measured by total number of words; social competition by debate level; and emotional stimuli by similarity of danmaku, number of excitement-related words, and number of emoji.

In the past two years, live streams of video games, on sites such as Twitch.tv, have become very popular. Live streams serve as meeting grounds for player communities. The Twitch streaming medium combines broadcast video with open IRC chat channels. In conjunction with gameplay, viewer participation and community building gain emphasis. Twitch streams range in size and nature, from intimate communities with fifty viewers, to massive broadcasts with tens of thousands. In this paper, we present an ethnographic investigation of the live streaming of video games on Twitch. We find that Twitch streams act as virtual third places, in which informal communities emerge, socialize, and participate. Over time, stream communities form around shared identities drawn from streams? contents and participants? shared experiences. We describe processes through which stream communities form, the motivations of members, and emergent issues in the medium.

In this article, we apply theory from the field of social psychology to understand how online communities develop member attachment, an important dimension of community success. We implemented and empirically tested two sets of community features for building member attachment by strengthening either group identity or interpersonal bonds. To increase identity-based attachment, we gave members information about group activities and intergroup competition, and tools for group-level communication. To increase bond-based attachment, we gave members information about the activities of individual members and interpersonal similarity, and tools for interpersonal communication. Results from a six-month field experiment show that participants' visit frequency and self-reported attachment increased in both conditions. Community features intended to foster identity-based attachment had stronger effects than features intended to foster bond-based attachment. Participants in the identity condition with access to group profiles and repeated exposure to their group's activities visited their community twice as frequently as participants in other conditions. The new features also had stronger effects on newcomers than on old-timers. This research illustrates how theory from the social science literature can be applied to gain a more systematic understanding of online communities and how theory-inspired features can improve their success."", 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 112, 'citationCount': 522, 'journal': {'volume': '36', 'pages': '841-864', 'name': 'MIS Q.'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Ren2012BuildingMA,\n author = {Yuqing Ren and Max Harper and Sara Drenner and S.

Accordingly, this paper endeavours to investigate the relationship between flow experience and Internet shopping behavior to which the moderating role of consumer characteristics (trust propensity, willingness to buy and self-confidence) is concerned. Data collected from 395 customers of an online shopping store provide support for the proposed research model. The results show that flow experience is significantly and positively related to Internet shopping behavior (continuance intention, purchase intention and impulsive buying). In addition, it also suggests that the relationship between flow experience and Internet shopping behavior is moderated by consumer characteristics. Specifically, when the extent of a customer's trust propensity, willingness to buy or self-confidence is relatively high, the influence of flow experience on Internet shopping behaviors is maximized.

Whereas correlates of traditional attachment replicated the pattern known from other studies (e.g., traditional attachment was strongly positively correlated with age and negatively with education), active attachment was related positively to education and curvilinearly to age, with middle-aged participants the most frequently represented. Traditional place attachment was based solely on local identity, active place attachment was associated with European and nonterritorial identity, along with the local attachment. A number of other measures differentiated the five types: values, measures of social and cultural capital, self- and group-continuity measures, and general life satisfaction. It is concluded that places do preserve their importance in times of intensive urbanization, migration, and economic development, but that the form of place attachment changes: the active- and self-conscious attachment replaces the traditional attachment.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 50, 'citationCount': 179, 'journal': {'volume': '43', 'pages': '676 - 709', 'name': 'Environment and Behavior'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Lewicka2011OnTV,\n author = {M.

The findings suggest that the 3D virtual world environment produces both positive and negative effects on brand equity when compared to the 2D environment. The positive effect of the 3D virtual world environment on brand equity occurs through telepresence, a specific aspect of flow, as well as enjoyment. The negative effect on brand equity can be explained using distraction-conflict theory in which attentional conflicts faced by users of a highly interactive and rich medium resulted in distractions from attending to the brand. Brand equity, in turn, has a positive effect on behavioral intention. The results suggest that although the 3D virtual world environment has the potential to increase brand equity by offering an immersive and enjoyable virtual product experience, the rich environment can also be a distraction. Therefore, developers of virtual world branding sites need to take into account limitations in the information processing capacity and attention span of users when designing their sites in order to avoid cognitive overload, which can lead to users being distracted from branding information.

To address this uncertainty, this paper attempts to systematically examine the impact of CMV on the inferences drawn from survey research in the IS area. First, we describe the available approaches for assessing CMV and conduct an empirical study to compare them. From an actual survey involving 227 respondents, we find that although CMV is present in the research areas examined, such biases are not substantial. The results also suggest that few differences exist between the relatively new marker-variable technique and other well-established conventional tools in terms of their ability to detect CMV. Accordingly, the marker-variable technique was employed to infer the effect of CMV on correlations from previously published studies. Our findings, based on the reanalysis of 216 correlations, suggest that the inflated correlation caused by CMV may be expected to be on the order of 0.10 or less, and most of the originally significant correlations remain significant even after controlling for CMV. Finally, by extending the marker-variable technique, we examined the effect of CMV on structural relationships in past literature. Our reanalysis reveals that contrary to the concerns of some skeptics, CMV-adjusted structural relationships not only remain largely significant but also are not statistically differentiable from uncorrected estimates. In summary, this comprehensive and systematic analysis offers initial evidence that (1) the marker-variable technique can serve as a convenient, yet effective, tool for accounting for CMV, and (2) common method biases in the IS domain are not as serious as those found in other disciplines.', 'year': 2006, 'referenceCount': 64, 'citationCount': 2690, 'journal': {'volume': '52', 'pages': '1865-1883', 'name': 'Manag.

A self-report measure of presence yielded two factors.

Prior work in individual psychology, however, suggests that holistic experiences with technology as captured in constructs such as enjoyment and flow are potentially important explanatory variables in technology acceptance theories. In this paper, we describe a multi-dimensional construct labeled cognitive absorption and defined as a state of deep involvement with software. Cognitive absorption, theorized as being exhibited through the five dimensions of \n \ntemporal dissociation, focused immersion, heightened enjoyment, control, and curiosity, is posited to be a proximal antecedent of two important beliefs about technology use: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. In addition, we propose that the individual traits of playfulness and personal innovativeness are important determinants of cognitive absorption. Based on the conceptual definition of this construct, operational measures for each dimension are developed. Using the World Wide Web as the target technology, scale validation indicates that the operational measures have acceptable psychometric properties and confirmatory factor analysis supports the proposed multi-dimensional structure. Structural equation analysis provides evidence for the theorized nomological net of cognitive absorption.

By surveying 304 Web users through an open‐ended questionnaire, this study captures a picture of Web users’ flow experiences regarding their optimal situations on the Web. Results suggest that using the World Wide Web is an activity that facilitates flow, which generates an optimal, extremely enjoyable experience with total involvement and concentration.

Online executives note that creating a compelling online experience for cyber customers is critical to creating competitive advantage on the Internet. Yet, very little is known about the factors that make using the Web a compelling experience for its users, and of the key consumer behavior outcomes of this compelling experience.Recently, the flow construct has been proposed as important for understanding consumer behavior on the World Wide Web, and as a way of defining the nature of compelling online experience. Although widely studied over the past 20 years, quantitative modeling efforts of the flow construct have been neither systematic nor comprehensive. In large parts, these efforts have been hampered by considerable confusion regarding the exact conceptual definition of flow. Lacking precise definition, it has been difficult to measure flow empirically, let alone apply the concept in practice.Following the conceptual model of flow proposed by Hoffman and Novak (1996), we conceptualize flow on the Web as a cognitive state experienced during navigation that is determined by (1) high levels of skill and control; (2) high levels of challenge and arousal; and (3) focused attention; and (4) is enhanced by interactivity and telepresence. Consumers who achieve flow on the Web are so acutely involved in the act of online navigation that thoughts and perceptions not relevant to navigation are screened out, and the consumer focuses entirely on the interaction. Concentration on the navigation experience is so intense that there is little attention left to consider anything else, and consequently, other events occurring in the consumer's surrounding physical environment lose significance. Self-consciousness disappears, the consumer's sense of time becomes distorted, and the state of mind arising as a result of achieving flow on the Web is extremely gratifying.In a quantitative modeling framework, we develop a structural model based on our previous conceptual model of flow that embodies the components of what makes for a compelling online experience. We use data collected from a largesample, Web-based consumer survey to measure these constructs, and we fit a series of structural equation models that test related prior theory. The conceptual model is largely supported, and the improved fit offered by the revised model provides additional insights into the direct and indirect influences of flow, as well as into the relationship of flow to key consumer behavior and Web usage variables.Our formulation provides marketing scientists with operational definitions of key model constructs and establishes reliability and validity in a comprehensive measurement framework. A key insight from the paper is that the degree to which the online experience is compelling can be defined, measured, and related well to important marketing variables. Our model constructs relate in significant ways to key consumer behavior variables, including online shopping and Web use applications such as the extent to which consumers search for product information and participate in chat rooms. As such, our model may be useful both theoretically and in practice as marketers strive to decipher the secrets of commercial success in interactive online environments."", 'year': 2000, 'referenceCount': 71, 'citationCount': 3013, 'journal': {'volume': '19', 'pages': '22-42', 'name': 'Marketing Science'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Novak2000MeasuringTC,\n author = {T.

At the same time, there is little empirical evidence underlying all this speculation. This article provides one such data set.

We gathered consumers' reactions via an open-ended survey using a sample of 220 shoppers. We related the reactions to the factors of product perceptions, shopping experience, customer service, and perceived consumer risk, which we had identified from the existing literature on retail patronage behavior. This study translated these factors to the World Wide Web context and explored their relative salience.With respect to product perceptions, consumers were impressed by the breadth of stores on the World Wide Web but disappointed with the depth of a merchant's offerings. The shopping experience was reported to be generally enjoyable, but at the same time frustrating. Consumers also reported that they could perceive the potential for time savings and reduced effort compared with traditional forms of shopping, but that, at present, goal-directed shopping was difficult. Nearly everyone in the sample had something negative to say about customer service on the World Wide Web, judging that the sites were not designed to be responsive to their needs and that the presentation of goods and services seemed intangible. Risk was cited as a barrier to shopping on the World Wide Web, but was not as salient to our sample as product perceptions, shopping experience, and customer service. Overall, the results suggest that World Wide Web merchants need to think more about how they perform on the factors known to affect consumer behavior; namely, product perceptions, shopping experience, and customer service.

This figure need not be the natural mother but can be anyone who plays the role of principal caregiver. This ground plan is fulfilled, except under extraordinary circumstances when the baby experiences too little interaction with any one caregiver to support the formation of an attachment. The literature on maternal deprivation describes some of these circumstances, but it cannot be reviewed here, except to note that research has not yet specified an acceptable minimum amount of interaction required for attachment formation. However, there have been substantial recent advances in the areas of individual differences in the way attachment behavior becomes organized, differential experiences associated with the various attachment patterns, and the value of such patterns in forecasting subsequent development. These advances have been much aided by a standardized laboratory situation that was devised to supplement a naturalistic, longitudinal investigation of the development of infant-mother attachment in the first year of life. This strange situation, as we entitled it, has proved to be an excellent basis for the assessment of such attachment in 1-year-olds (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978). The assessment procedure consists of classification according to the pattern of behavior shown in the strange situation, particularly in the episodes of reunion after separation. Eight patterns were identified, but I shall deal here only with the three main groups into which they fell—Groups A, B, and C. To summarize, Group B babies use their mothers as a secure base from which to explore in the preseparation episodes; their attachment behavior is greatly intensified by the separation episodes so that exploration diminishes and distress is likely; and in the reunion episodes they seek contact with, proximity to, or at least interaction"", 'year': 1979, 'referenceCount': 35, 'citationCount': 1423, 'journal': {'volume': '34 10', 'pages': '\n          932-7\n        ', 'name': 'The American psychologist'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Ainsworth1979InfantmotherA,\n author = {M.

Abstract Recreational abuse of ketamine has been associated with the emergence of a new bladder pain syndrome, ketamine‐induced cystitis, characterised by chronic inflammation and urothelial ulceration. This study investigated the direct effects of ketamine on normal human urothelium maintained in organ culture or as finite cell lines in vitro. Exposure of urothelium to ketamine resulted in apoptosis, with cytochrome c release from mitochondria and significant subsequent caspase 9 and 3/7 activation. The anaesthetic mode‐of‐action for ketamine is mediated primarily through N‐methyl D‐ aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonism; however, NHU cells were unresponsive to NMDAR agonists or antagonists and no expression of NMDAR transcript was detected. Exposure to non‐cytotoxic concentrations of ketamine (≤1 mM) induced rapid release of ATP, which activated purinergic P2Y receptors and stimulated the inositol trisphosphate receptor to provoke transient release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. Ketamine concentrations >1 mM were cytotoxic and provoked a larger‐ amplitude increase in cytosolic [Ca 2+ ] that was unresolved. The sustained elevation in cytosolic [Ca 2+ ] was associated with pathological mitochondrial oxygen consumption and ATP deficiency. Damage to the urinary barrier initiates bladder pain and in ketamine‐induced cystitis, loss of urothelium from large areas of the bladder wall is a reported feature. This study offers first evidence for a mechanism of direct toxicity of ketamine to urothelial cells by activating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 25, 'citationCount': 677, 'journal': None, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Ford2007ContactIF,\n author = {Chandra L.

Measuring such subjective data as reactions to color, heat, light, and sound would seem to be an almost impossible task; indeed, until now there has been no theory around which the research in this field could be organized. This volume represents a preliminary effort to identify the relevant variables involved and fit them into a systematic framework. Furthermore, it presents extensive sets of measures for investigating the theory and implementing it in a variety of everyday environments.Basically, the framework outlined here proposes that environmental stimuli are linked to behavioral responses by the primary emotional responses of arousal, pleasure, and dominance. By considering the impact of the environment on these basic emotional responses, the effects of diverse stimulus components within or across sense modalities can be readily compared. An additional concept, information rate, is used to compare the effects of different environments, each with stimulation in many sense modalities. In the final chapters the authors present a series of hypotheses which relate the emotional response variables to a diversity of behaviors such as physical approach, performance, affiliation, and verbally or nonverbally expressed preference.', 'year': 1974, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 5823, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Mehrabian1974AnAT,\n author = {A.

Nevertheless, the important place it will have in the field of psychiatric literature is already obvious. Whereas many psychoanalysts have tended to harden in their views with the passage of years?as do people in all walks of life?Bowlby has taken the opposite course. On the basis of his trained sensitivity to human behaviour, he has reached out to such new sciences as animal ethology and cybernetics, which were unknown in Freud's day. The result is provocative, enlightening and profoundly stimulating, though not everyone will be able to accept fully the mixture that emerges. The concept of instinctive behaviour in man still remains profoundly difficult, though the author's version is a more acceptable one than most which have been offered before. As far as the mother-child tie is concerned, this makes infinitely more sense in the light of human evolution?as interpreted by Bowlby?than on the basis of conventional psychoanalytical theory. Those who do not have the chore of reading this book in full will be able to get an impression of its most important parts from Bowlby's contribution to the 1968 Congress proceedings, which are to appear shortly.

Although a large body of literature reports positive effects of NF training on behavior and cognitive functions, there are hardly any reports on how participants can successfully learn to gain control over their own brain activity. About one third of people fail to gain significant control over their brain signals even after repeated training sessions. The reasons for this failure are still largely unknown. In this context, we investigated the effects of spontaneous mental strategies on NF performance. Twenty healthy participants performed either a SMR (sensorimotor rhythm, 12–15 Hz) based or a Gamma (40–43 Hz) based NF training over ten sessions. After the first and the last training session, they were asked to write down which mental strategy they have used for self-regulating their EEG. After the first session, all participants reported the use of various types of mental strategies such as visual strategies, concentration, or relaxation. After the last NF training session, four participants of the SMR group reported to employ no specific strategy. These four participants showed linear improvements in NF performance over the ten training sessions. In contrast, participants still reporting the use of specific mental strategies in the last NF session showed no changes in SMR based NF performance over the ten sessions. This effect could not be observed in the Gamma group. The Gamma group showed no prominent changes in Gamma power over the NF training sessions, regardless of the mental strategies used. These results indicate that successful SMR based NF performance is associated with implicit learning mechanisms. Participants stating vivid reports on strategies to control their SMR probably overload cognitive resources, which might be counterproductive in terms of increasing SMR power.', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 64, 'citationCount': 172, 'journal': {'volume': '7', 'name': 'Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': ""@Article{Kober2013LearningTM,\n author = {S.

These regions included the left rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and right medial frontopolar cortex (MFPC). Together with the LA, these six prefrontal regions thus formed the functional neuroanatomical network engaged during the rtfMRI-nf procedure. Here we perform a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) analysis of the effective connectivity for this network. The SVAR analysis demonstrates that the left rACC plays an important role during the rtfMRI-nf training, modulating the LA and the other network regions. According to the analysis, the rtfMRI-nf training leads to a significant enhancement in the time-lagged effect of the left rACC on the LA, potentially consistent with the ipsilateral distribution of the monosynaptic projections between these regions. The training is also accompanied by significant increases in the instantaneous (contemporaneous) effects of the left rACC on four other regions – the bilateral DMPFC, the right MFPC, and the left SFG. The instantaneous effects of the LA on the bilateral DMPFC are also significantly enhanced. Our results are consistent with a broad literature supporting the role of the rACC in emotion processing and regulation. Our exploratory analysis provides, for the first time, insights into the causal relationships within the network of regions engaged during the rtfMRI-nf procedure targeting the amygdala. It suggests that the rACC may constitute a promising target for rtfMRI-nf training along with the amygdala in patients with affective disorders, particularly posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 61, 'citationCount': 128, 'journal': {'volume': '8', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Zotev2013PrefrontalCO,\n author = {V.

With a surge of studies in affective neuroscience in recent decades, scientists are poised to answer this question. In this target article, we present a meta-analytic summary of the neuroimaging literature on human emotion. We compare the locationist approach (i.e., the hypothesis that discrete emotion categories consistently and specifically correspond to distinct brain regions) with the psychological constructionist approach (i.e., the hypothesis that discrete emotion categories are constructed of more general brain networks not specific to those categories) to better understand the brain basis of emotion. We review both locationist and psychological constructionist hypotheses of brain–emotion correspondence and report meta-analytic findings bearing on these hypotheses. Overall, we found little evidence that discrete emotion categories can be consistently and specifically localized to distinct brain regions. Instead, we found evidence that is consistent with a psychological constructionist approach to the mind: A set of interacting brain regions commonly involved in basic psychological operations of both an emotional and non-emotional nature are active during emotion experience and perception across a range of discrete emotion categories.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 1004, 'citationCount': 1663, 'journal': {'volume': '35', 'pages': '121 - 143', 'name': 'Behavioral and Brain Sciences'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Lindquist2012TheBB,\n author = {Kristen A.

Visitors can test the installation during the conference after about 5 minutes of training time. World of Warcraft is a common Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) in which the player controls an avatar in a virtual environment.\n The user has to wear newly developed dry EEG electrodes which are connected to a biosignal amplifier. Then the data is transmitted to a computer to perform the real-time analysis of the EEG data. The BCI system is using steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) as control signal. Therefore the system shows different icons flickering with different frequencies. If the user focuses now on one of the icons the flickering frequency is visible in the EEG data and can be extracted with frequency analysis algorithms.\n In order to control an avatar in World of Warcraft it is necessary to have 4 control icons that are analyzed in real-time. Three icons are necessary to turn left or right or to move forward. Additionally a 4th icon is required to perform certain actions like grasping objects, attacking other objects....like shown in Figure 1. The visual stimulation took place via a 60Hz LCD-display with flickering frequencies of 15, 12, 10 and 8.57Hz in combination with an underlying video.\n To visualize the flickering controls a BCI-Overlay library based on OpenGL was implemented, which can be used by any graphics application. It provides the possibility to generate BCI controls within a virtual reality environment or as overlays in combination with video sequences\n Figure 2 shows the components of the complete system. The user is connected with 8 EEG electrodes to the BCI system that is running under Windows and MATLAB. The BCI system uses the minimum energy algorithm and a linear discriminant analysis to determine if the user is looking at one of the icons or if the user is not attending.\n Via a UDP communication channel the BCI system is controlling the BCI-Overlay module that generates the 4 flickering icons around the WoW User Interface. If the BCI system detects a certain command it is transmitted to the game controller which generates the corresponding WoW command. This is straight forward for the left, right and move forward commands, but more complicated for the action command. Action commands are context dependant and the controller has to select certain possible actions. Finally the command is transmitted to WoW and the avatar performs the action.\n This allows the user to play WoW with the BCI system only by thought.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 23, 'journal': {'pages': '27'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Kapeller2012AugmentedCO,\n author = {C.

In that time planning has emerged as the dominant technology and has featured in a number of prototype systems. Nevertheless key issues remain, such as how best to control the shape of the narrative that is generated (e.g., by using narrative control knowledge, i.e., knowledge about narrative features that enhance user experience) and also how best to provide support for real-time interactive performance in order to scale up to more realistic sized systems. Recent progress in planning technology has opened up new avenues for IS and we have developed a novel approach to narrative generation that builds on this. Our approach is to specify narrative control knowledge for a given story world using state trajectory constraints and then to treat these state constraints as landmarks and to use them to decompose narrative generation in order to address scalability issues and the goal of real-time performance in larger story domains. This approach to narrative generation is fully implemented in an interactive narrative based on the “Merchant of Venice.” The contribution of the work lies both in our novel use of state constraints to specify narrative control knowledge for interactive storytelling and also our development of an approach to narrative generation that exploits such constraints.

Emotions can have good effects, as when a scientist gets excited about a line of research and pursues it successfully despite criticism. But emotions can also distort reasoning, as when a juror ignores evidence of guilt just because the accused seems like a nice guy. In Hot Thought, Paul Thagard describes the mental mechanisms -- cognitive, neural, molecular, and social -- that interact to produce different kinds of human thinking, from everyday decision making to legal reasoning, scientific discovery, and religious belief, and he discusses when and how thinking and reasoning should be emotional. Thagard argues that an understanding of emotional thinking needs to integrate the cognitive, neural, molecular, and social levels. Many of the chapters employ computational models of various levels of thinking, including HOTCO (hot cognition) models and the more neurologically realistic GAGE model. Thagard uses these models to illuminate thinking in the domains of law, science, and religion, discussing such topics as the role of doubt and reasonable doubt in legal and other contexts, valuable emotional habits for successful scientists, and the emotional content of religious beliefs. Identifying and assessing the impact of emotion, Thagard argues, can suggest ways to improve the process of reasoning.', 'year': 2006, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 267, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Thagard2006HotTM,\n author = {Paul Thagard},\n title = {Hot Thought: Mechanisms and Applications of Emotional Cognition},\n year = {2006}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1756123', 'name': 'Paul Thagard'}]}, {'paperId': 'd2663943305a24a43a359a6de2115910c561e621', 'title': 'Extending animal models of fear conditioning to humans', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2006, 'referenceCount': 106, 'citationCount': 354, 'journal': {'volume': '73', 'pages': '39-48', 'name': 'Biological Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Delgado2006ExtendingAM,\n author = {M.

In addition, the attempted inhibition of the sexual arousal generated by viewing the erotic stimuli was associated with activation of the right superior frontal gyrus and right anterior cingulate gyrus. No activation was found in limbic areas.

This problem is common to philosophy (Aristotle 1988), statistical inference (Casella & Berger 2001) and machine learning (Mitchell 1997, Agluin & Smith 1983). We constrain ourselves only to the latter two frameworks. Within machine-learning, we further concentrate on its subfield called inductive logic programming (Nienhuys-Cheng & de Wolf 1997). Whereas in statistics we namely concentrate on evaluating hypotheses, in machine learning we study ways of constructing the theories. From the theoretical viewpoint, however, the construction is also viewed as a selection of a hypothesis from an a priori given set. Unlike in statistics, however, the range of considered hypotheses is usually large so that hypotheses cannot by inspected individually by a human. Such a set of hypotheses may be conveniently viewed as (equivalent to) a language L H generated by a certain formal grammar. Every hypothesis H ∈ L H induces a mapping h : X → O where X is a predefined (usually countable) set of instances (which we also call the domain of L H) and O is a set usually assumed to be finite and its elements called classes. Very often, O has just two elements. The assigned mapping gives the hypothesis its meaning (semantics). The usual formalization of the concept learning task is then as follows. Let there be a hypothesis C ∈ L H called the target concept and let n examples (x 1 , c(x 1)),(x 2 , c(x 2)),... ,(x n , c(x n))= S drawn from a predefined distribution D X on X be provided to the algorithm L called the learner (S is called a sample). We ask L to output an hypothesis H ∈ L H such that a specified error function Err(H, C) is minimized with respect to D X. The error function may be defined as e.g. Err(H, C) = 0 if H ≡ C (i.e. h(x) = c(x) ∀x ∈ X) and Err(H, C) = 1 otherwise, that is, irrespectively of the distribution D X.

This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.', 'year': 1995, 'referenceCount': 14, 'citationCount': 85128, 'journal': {'volume': '57', 'pages': '289-300', 'name': 'Journal of the royal statistical society series b-methodological'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Benjamini1995ControllingTF,\n author = {Y.

31,30a467e734a2ec4210aa473f7064c04c41414bd1,Using Virtual Collaboration and Education to Increase Teachers’ Ability to Promote Self-regulation,"ABSTRACT The aim of this evidence-based occupational therapy (OT) project was to answer the question, “Does education and scheduled collaboration on the use of sensory tools in the school environment increase general education teachers’ understanding of OT’s role in self-regulation?” Evidence supports the use of asynchronous learning modules for professional development. Research indicates that the addition of an interactive element enhances learning. Collaboration is supported by evidence for enhanced effectiveness of sensory tools in schools. The project was implemented over the course of 7 weeks. Teachers participated in 5 weeks of intervention with a weekly 30-min asynchronous web-based learning module and a 30-min individual or group collaboration session. Results showed increased positive perceptions with 5 of 10 Likert scale questions showing a statistically significant increase. In addition, data showed a statistically significant positive change in teachers’ knowledge related to OT’s role in schools, self-regulation, and social-emotional skills. Data from open-ended questions revealed an increase in teachers’ understanding of different causes of student behaviors and increased knowledge of self-regulation tools. The results suggest teachers’ understanding of OT’s role in self-regulation increases through the use of asynchronous virtual learning and scheduled collaboration sessions with an occupational therapist. Further research is recommended to increase the generalizability of results and to identify the most effective use of collaboration to enhance teachers’ understanding of self-regulation.",2021,32,0,"{'name': 'Journal of Occupational Therapy, Schools, & Early Intervention', 'pages': '403 - 417', 'volume': '15'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Donald2021UsingVC,\n author = {J.

School-based occupational therapy (SBOT) practice takes place within a complex system that includes service recipients, service providers, and program decision makers across health and education sectors. Despite the promotion of collaborative consultation at a policy level, there is little practical guidance about how to coordinate multi-agency service and interprofessional collaboration among these stakeholders. Purpose. This paper reports on a process used to engage program administrators in an examination of SBOT collaborative consultation practice in one region of Ontario to provide an evidence-informed foundation for decision making about implementation of these services. Methods Within an appreciative inquiry framework (Cooperrider, Whitney, & Stavros, 2008), Developmental Work Research methods (Engeström, 2000) were used to facilitate shared learning for improved SBOT collaborative consultation. Program administrators participated alongside program providers and service recipients in a series of facilitated workshops to develop principles that will guide future planning and decision making about the delivery of SBOT services. Findings. Facilitated discussion among stakeholders led to the articulation of 12 principles for effective collaborative practice. Program administrators used their shared understanding to propose a new model for delivering SBOT services. Implications.

When investigating teachers’ promotion of SRL, not only teacher behavior, but also teachers’ beliefs as well as their knowledge about SRL are relevant aspects to consider. Therefore, this study seeks to examine teachers’ knowledge and beliefs on promoting SRL, as well as their predictive value on teachers’ promotion of SRL in the classroom. Forty-seven primary school teachers completed questionnaires on knowledge and beliefs towards both components of the promotion of SRL: strategy instruction and a constructivist learning environment. In addition, teachers had to answer open-ended questions on their understanding of SRL, as well as their implementation of SRL in their classroom. The results show that teachers are more positive towards constructivist than towards SRL (teacher beliefs), and most teachers mentioned characteristics of constructivist learning environments, while only few teachers addressed strategy instruction when being asked about their understanding of SRL (teacher knowledge). Moreover, teacher beliefs are the only predictor for teacher behavior. The results indicate how teacher education could support teachers to learn how to promote SRL effectively.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 47, 'citationCount': 122, 'journal': {'volume': '2012', 'pages': '741713', 'name': 'Education Research International'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Ewijk2012WhatTT,\n author = {C.

Occupational therapists working in school health have recognized the need to move away from a one-to-one direct service delivery model towards a more collaborative, classroom-based approach.

To capture the experiences of occupational therapists implementing P4C and to elicit their perspectives about how this model differs from the direct service approach. Methods. Semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted with seven therapists who had delivered P4C in 10 Ontario schools. Thematic analysis was utilized with themes verified through member checking. Findings. Five themes (a year of growth, becoming a community, the key ingredients of P4C, a balancing act, and providing services that make an impact) reflected therapists' personal and professional growth, aspects of the model they believed were key, challenges they encountered, and the impact they felt they had made. Implications. Partnering for Change has the potential to transform school-based occupational therapy and overcome existing barriers to collaboration.

Trait emotional intelligence (trait EI or trait emotional self-efficacy) refers to individuals' emotion-related self-perceptions (Petrides, Furnham, & Mavroveli, 2007). The children's trait EI sampling domain provides comprehensive coverage of their affective personality. Preliminary evidence shows that the construct has important implications for children's psychological and behavioural adjustment. AIMS. This study investigates the associations between trait EI and school outcomes, such as performance in reading, writing, and maths, peer-rated behaviour and social competence, and self-reported bullying behaviours in a sample of primary school children. It also examines whether trait EI scores differentiate between children with and without special educational needs (SEN). SAMPLE. The sample comprised 565 children (274 boys and 286 girls) between the ages of 7 and 12 (M((age)) = 9.12 years, SD= 1.27 years) attending three English state primary schools. METHOD. Pupils completed the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Child Form (TEIQue-CF), the Guess Who peer assessment, the Peer-Victimization Scale, and the Bullying Behaviour Scale. Additional data on achievement and SEN were collected from the school archives. RESULTS. As predicted by trait EI theory, associations between trait EI and academic achievement were modest and limited to Year 3 children. Higher trait EI scores were related to more nominations from peers for prosocial behaviours and fewer nominations for antisocial behaviour as well as lower scores on self-reported bulling behaviours. Furthermore, SEN students scored lower on trait EI compared to students without SEN. CONCLUSIONS. Trait EI holds important and multifaceted implications for the socialization of primary schoolchildren."", 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 116, 'citationCount': 213, 'journal': {'volume': '81 Pt 1', 'pages': '\n          112-34\n        ', 'name': 'The British journal of educational psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Mavroveli2011TraitEI,\n author = {S.

Researchers from the fields of virtual reality (VR) and game design highlight the potential of VR technologies as a great tool to promote empathy. However, there is little empirical and systematic knowledge on how to use VR technology to help promote empathy in young children. To address this gap, we developed a VR Empathy Game prototype to explore how VR experiences can inculcate empathy development in young children. To evaluate this prototype, we conducted a qualitative study with 15 children from 6 to 9 years old. We used an interpretive case study to provide an in-depth understanding of children’s experiences with the VR Empathy Game. To guide participant selection, we used a purposeful sampling approach and intentionally included K-3 children with different empathy and social skills levels. 
  
This paper describes one case representing a challenge that children with a low level of empathy can experience while playing the VR Empathy Game. This case explains the game experience of a seven-year-old boy, Gabe. The case is entitled: “The VR Empathy Game Experience with a Focus on Exploring the Environment and Looking for Clues.” Gabe confused intrinsic and extrinsic game goals and played the game focusing only on the VR environment. He perceived the game characters as an information source rather than building relationships with them unlike the children with a higher level of empathy. This case represents the group of four boys who participated in our study. In comparison with other participants, Gabe’s case provided very little evidence of noticing the characters' emotions. Our findings suggest that game designers should provide additional scaffolding for children with little levels of empathy, including additional reflective questions and reminders to interact with the characters. We also suggest a follow-up study exploring how different storylines would help children’s game experience.",2022,18,0,{'name': 'European Conference on Games Based Learning'},"{'bibtex': '@Conference{Muravevskaia2022CaseSO,\n author = {Ekaterina Muravevskaia and Christina Gardner-Mccune},\n booktitle = {European Conference on Games Based Learning},\n journal = {European Conference on Games Based Learning},\n title = {Case Study on VR Empathy Game: Challenges with VR Games Development for Emotional Interactions with the VR Characters},\n year = {2022}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '3439826', 'name': 'Ekaterina Muravevskaia'}, {'authorId': '1403600070', 'name': 'Christina Gardner-Mccune'}]","[{'paperId': '0eda78e135ad8b0a6a8d2eaf281f3e0c67ad84fe', 'title': 'Social Presence in VR Empathy Game for Children: Empathic Interaction with the Virtual Characters', 'abstract': ""This paper discusses children's empathic interactions with the VR characters.

Yet despite this, educational software has traditionally attempted to harness games as extrinsic motivation by using them as a sugar coating for learning content. This article tests the concept of intrinsic integration as a way of creating a more productive relationship between educational games and their learning content. Two studies assessed this approach by designing and evaluating an educational game called Zombie Division to teach mathematics to 7- to 11-year-olds. Study 1 examined the learning gains of 58 children who played either the intrinsic, extrinsic, or control variants of Zombie Division for 2 hr, supported by their classroom teacher. Study 2 compared time on task for the intrinsic and extrinsic variants of the game when 16 children had free choice of which game to play. The results showed that children learned more from the intrinsic version of the game under fixed time limits and spent 7 times longer playing it in free-time situations. Together, these studies offer evidence for the genuine value of an intrinsic approach for creating effective educational games. The theoretical and commercial implications of these findings are discussed.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 81, 'citationCount': 515, 'journal': {'volume': '20', 'pages': '169 - 206', 'name': 'Journal of the Learning Sciences'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Nair2011MotivatingCT,\n author = {C.

As early as 1965, Sutherland envisioned that the ‘ultimate display’ would enable users to actively interact with the virtual space as if it were real, giving them “a chance to gain familiarity with concepts not realizable in the physical world” (Sutherland, 1965, p. 506). William Gibson appears to have shared this vision when coining the term ‘cyberspace’ in his 1984 novel Neuromancer, defining it as “a consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts · · · ” (p. 51). While the image may have seemed farfetched at the time, the mounting popularity of home video game consoles, massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs), and massive open online courses (MOOCs) all demonstrate that virtual reality (VR) is an increasingly integral component of our everyday lives. Despite some romanticized versions of VR, much of the previous literature focused on its dangers. Early studies voiced concerns about how individuals would no longer be able to receive true emotional and social support online (e.g., Kraut et al., 1998) and more recent research focused on Internet addiction (e.g., Lam et al., 2009) as well as the antisocial effects of playing violent games (e.g., Bartholow, Bushman, & Sestir, 2006). Overall, the results suggest that spending extensive amounts of time in VR can result in apathetic or even violent attitudes and behavior toward others. Indeed, early conversations between Jaron Lanier, one of the pioneers of the technology, and William Gibson, who consulted Lanier while writing his manifesto, focused on this tension. Lanier envisioned prosocial uses for the technology he championed, but Gibson felt compelled to write about the less wholesome applications, saying, “Jaron, I tried. But it’s coming out dark” (Lanier, 2013, p. 329). In terms of academic research, there is a group of scholars who focus on a more positive outlook; the unique affordances of virtual environments actually promote prosocial behavior when leveraged. Recent developments show that even brief virtual interventions can increase environmental awareness, reduce racial bias, and enhance general altruistic behavior. These interventions have been found to be especially powerful when the user feels fully immersed in the virtual world. With these findings in mind, the present chapter will outline the characteristics and strengths of virtual environments. It will then describe the malleable nature of prosocial behavior and explain how the', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 58, 'citationCount': 4, 'journal': None, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Shriram201822VR,\n author = {K.

Successful teachers use strategies that regulate students' emotions and behaviors while also controlling their own emotions (stress, nervousness). To prepare teachers for the challenges of teaching, teacher training should include emotional and behavioral management strategies. Virtual Training Environments (VTEs) are effective at providing experiences and increasing learning in many domains. Creating VTEs for teachers can improve student learning and teacher retention. We introduce our current research aimed at integrating emotionally-intelligent virtual students within a 3D classroom training system. In our simulation, virtual students' emotional states will be determined from an appraisal process of actions taken by the teacher trainee in the virtual classroom. Virtual students will then display the appropriate non-verbal behaviors and react to the teacher accordingly.

The core of the system is a real-time 3D virtual simulation of a classroom, populated by twenty-four semi-autonomous virtual students. The system has been designed as a companion tool for classroom management seminars in a syllabus for primary and secondary school teachers. Whereby, it will allow lecturers to link theory with practice, using the medium of VR. The system is therefore designed for two users: a trainee teacher and an instructor supervising the training session. The teacher is immersed in a real-time 3D simulation of a classroom by means of a head-mounted display and headphone. The instructor operates a graphical desktop console which renders a view of the class and the teacher, whose avatar movements are captured by a marker-less tracking system. This console includes a 2D graphics menu with convenient behaviour and feedback control mechanisms to provide human-guided training sessions. The system is built using low-cost consumer hardware and software. Its architecture and technical design are described in detail. A first evaluation confirms its conformance to critical usability requirements (i.e., safety and comfort, believability, simplicity, acceptability, extensibility, affordability and mobility). Our initial results are promising, and constitute the necessary first step toward a possible investigation of the efficiency and effectiveness of such a system in terms of learning outcomes and experience.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 85, 'citationCount': 74, 'journal': {'volume': '3', 'pages': '26', 'name': 'Frontiers ICT'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Lugrin2016BreakingBB,\n author = {Jean-Luc Lugrin and Marc Erich Latoschik and Michael Habel and D.

Aggregating 115 effect sizes from 83 studies, it finds that technological immersion has a medium-sized effect on presence. Additionally, results show that increased levels of user-tracking, the use of stereoscopic visuals, and wider fields of view of visual displays are significantly more impactful than improvements to most other immersive system features, including quality of visual and auditory content.

We currently focus our work on excessive alcohol consumption as a target behavior, and our approach is adaptable to other target behaviors (e.g., overeating, lack of exercise, narcotic drug use, non-adherence to treatment). We based our current approach on a successful existing patient-centered brief motivational intervention for behavior change---the Drinker’s Check-Up (DCU)---whose computer-delivery with a text-only interface has been found effective in reducing alcohol consumption in problem drinkers. We discuss the results of users’ evaluation of the computer-based DCU intervention delivered with a text-only interface compared to the same intervention delivered with two different ECAs (a neutral one and one with some empathic abilities). Users rate the three systems in terms of acceptance, perceived enjoyment, and intention to use the system, among other dimensions.

It is based on findings from the JISC-funded DEsign of Learning spaces in 3D Virtual Environments (DELVE) project at the University of Nottingham and the Open University. Given continued confusion about the term immersion, what it means for a learner to be immersed, and the relationship between immersion, presence and engagement, notions of immersion and engagement in 3D virtual environments are explored in the context of previous published studies ranging from virtual reality to psychology. The resultant improved understanding of the terminology is then used as the basis for coding results from a qualitative, inductive analysis of 20 students that undertook a substantive learning task in the virtual environment Second Life. Emergent themes from the analysis identify key factors that act to both enhance and restrict learner engagement in 3D virtual worlds and a set of principles for practitioners who wish to use 3D virtual environments to enhance learner engagement is presented.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 25, 'citationCount': 47, 'journal': {'volume': '8', 'pages': '40 - 55', 'name': 'Innovation in Teaching and Learning in Information and Computer Sciences'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Mount2009LearnerIE,\n author = {N.

Results indicate that engagement is a process comprised of four distinct stages: point of engagement, period of sustained engagement, disengagement, and reengagement. Furthermore, the process is characterized by attributes of engagement that pertain to the user, the system, and user-system interaction. We also found evidence of the factors that contribute to nonengagement. Emerging from this research is a definition of engagement—a term not defined consistently in past work—as a quality of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety-novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control.

Following a description of what is meant by E-learning environments and an overview of the four category model and design process known as the ARCS model, a variety of studies are summarized. The ARCS model is based on a synthesis of motivational concepts and a problem-solving approach to design, rather than the application of specific motivational solutions that are advocated without regard to the specific characteristics of a given situation. The first group of reviewed studies illustrates the results of testing the motivational design process in several different E-learning settings, in relation to learner self-regulation and in terms of the interaction of personality characteristics and motivational strategies. The second group of studies includes tests of the validity of a simplified motivational design process that has been used in diverse types of E-learning settings, including multiple countries and cultures. Overall, the results of these empirical studies have confirmed the validity of this model for the systematic design of motivationally enhanced instruction in E-learning settings with regard to lowering drop-out rates and other positive motivational outcomes.', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 51, 'citationCount': 522, 'journal': {'volume': '29', 'pages': '229 - 239', 'name': 'Journal of Educational Media'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Keller2004LearnerMA,\n author = {J.

We propose that the degree of immersion can be objectively assessed as the characteristics of a technology, and has dimensions such as the extent to which a display system can deliver an inclusive, extensive, surrounding, and vivid illusion of virtual environment to a participant. Other dimensions of immersion are concerned with the extent of body matching, and the extent to which there is a self-contained plot in which the participant can act and in which there is an autonomous response. Presence is a state of consciousness that may be concomitant with immersion, and is related to a sense of being in a place. Presence governs aspects of autonomie responses and higher-level behaviors of a participant in a VE.

Analysis of four gameplay streams shows how the streamer, through inclusion strategies and active viewer participation, promote viewer engagement in a way that resembles the mechanisms of offline Interaction Rituals.

Four hundred and three valid responses to a survey questionnaire were analyzed. Findings of the research results include three aspects. First, live streamer characteristics (trustworthiness and attractiveness) can stimulate users’ emotional attachment to a live streamer, thus promoting users’ gift-giving intention.

While acknowledging the homogenizing effect of the term nüzhubo, we focus on two performers on Douyu – Hani9 and Nvliu – that are challenging conventional nüzhubo tropes.

Twitch is approximately the thirtieth most-viewed website in the world, with over 150\u2009million spectators, and 2\u2009million individuals around the world regularly broadcasting. Although less well-known than Facebook or Twitter, these figures demonstrate that Twitch has become a central part of the platformized Internet. We explore a seven-part typology of monetization extant on Twitch: subscribing, donating and “cheering,” advertising, sponsorships, competitions and targets, unpredictable rewards for viewers, and the implementation of games into streaming channels themselves. We explore each technique in turn, considering how streamers use the affordances of the platform to earn income, and invent their own methods and techniques to further drive monetization. In doing so, we look to consider the particular kinds of governance and infrastructure manifested on Twitch. By governance, we mean how the rules, norms, and regulations of Twitch influence and shape the cultural content both produced and consumed within its virtual borders; and by infrastructure, we mean how the particular technical affordances of the platform, and many other elements besides, structure how content production on Twitch might be made profitable, and therefore decide what content is made, and how, and when.

In addition, viewers can engage with broadcasters by sending danmaku, a type of comment scrolled across the screen in real time. This paper investigates the role of viewers’ social interaction in paid gifting on live streaming platforms. We argue that viewer-viewer interaction can prompt paid gifting by affecting viewers’ arousal level through stimuli extracted from danmaku. Types of danmaku-related stimuli are presence of others, social competition, and emotional stimuli. Specifically, presence of others is measured by total number of words; social competition by debate level; and emotional stimuli by similarity of danmaku, number of excitement-related words, and number of emoji.

The theoretical framework is tested using Structural Equation Modeling based on survey data collected in China.

Our main findings are: parasocial relationship was consistently correlated with all three types of social support, while social presence was only related with instrumental and financial support; interpersonal attractiveness was associated with emotional and instrumental support and lonely people were more likely to give instrumental support.

Online streamers can interact with viewers in real time in live platforms with audio, video and text. The virtual gift is one of the most important business models for these live streaming platforms. The viewers can purchase and send virtual gifts to the streamers during the live process. These behaviors have great market potential and economic value, but little previous research paid attention about this. In this paper, we measured the basic information and economic behavior of users on a large representative live streaming platform (Inke1). To be specific, we discovered 20% of viewers contributed 97% of all gifts, and 77% of viewers only present for top three streamers. Especially, we also found that most gifting behaviors broke out in short periods when barrage increased, and gifting behaviors could be inspired by others due to competitiveness. Moreover, we investigated the correlation of various factors, proposed a decision tree based prediction model to infer the future revenue of the streamers.

This study examines two paths by which information provision influences price premiums: trusting beliefs and price consciousness. The results demonstrate that providing rich information, together with enhanced interactivity, increases the perceived trustworthiness of the e-tailer, which reduces consumers' price consciousness and increases the price premiums."", 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 32, 'citationCount': 23, 'journal': {'volume': '37', 'pages': '927-946', 'name': 'Online Inf.

Examination of the relationship between anxiety intensity, interpretation, and performance as a function of skill level and situation criticality revealed that anxiety interpretation was a stronger predictor of performance than anxiety intensity. In addition, anxiety intensity increased, interpretations became more debilitative, and performance decreased as the situation became more critical, and anxiety intensity was lower and interpreted as more facilitative toward upcoming performance by the elite rugby union player, which coincided with better lineout performance. Study 2 measured the free-throw performance of competitive basketball players during simulated basketball matches, with anxiety responses assessed in relation to these free-throws at half time and full time. Anxiety, measured through the IAMS, was interpreted as more facilitative prior to successful free-throws with players suggesting that these interpretations were due to high levels of self-confidence that was associated with an increase in focus.

However, various kinds of self-management educational materials which government or healthcare institutions provide for patients may not achieve the expected outcome. One of the critical reasons affecting patients’ use intention could be patients’ perceived information overload regarding the self-management educational materials. Purpose: This study proposed an extended model of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), which incorporated perceived information overload, to explore if information overload will prevent chronic patients from reading educational materials for self-care management. The independent variables are attitude, subject norm, perceived behavior control and perceived information overload while the dependent variable is behavior intention to use the self-management educational materials. Perceived information overload is also referred to as an antecedent variable which may has impacts on attitude and perceived behavior control. Methods: The cross-sectional study interviewed newly diagnosed chronic patients with coronary artery disease, who are the potential users of the self-management educational materials, in a medical center in Taiwan. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics of the basic information distribution of the respondents, and structural equation modeling to study the reliability and validity for testing hypotheses. Results: A total of 110 respondents were enrolled in this study and successful interview data were collected from 106 respondents. The result indicates that the patients’ perceived information overload of self-management educational materials was validated to have impacts on attitude and perceived behavioral control constructs of the TPB as well as contributing a direct impact on patients’ intentions to use self-management educational materials. Besides, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control constructs were validated to have signiﬁcant impacts on behavioral intentions, whereas the attitude construct was not. Finally, the relationships between information overload and attitude, information overload and intention, subjective norm and intention, as well as perceived behavioral control and intention varied signiﬁcantly between highly-and less-educated respondents. Differing self-management educational materials for respondents of various educational levels could be formulated to substantially boost the use of self-management educational materials. Conclusions: This study demonstrated a comprehensive framework, which extended perceived information overload into the TPB model, to predict patients’ behavioral intention of using self-management educational materials. We expect the results of this study will provide useful insights for studying self-management educational materials usage and information overload from the perspectives of academia, governments, and healthcare providers. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 40, 'citationCount': 33, 'journal': None, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Liua2016InternationalJO,\n author = {hung-Feng Liua and Kuang-Ming Kuob},\n title = {International Journal of Medical Informatics},\n year = {2016}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2264041633', 'name': 'hung-Feng Liua'}, {'authorId': '2264050102', 'name': 'Kuang-Ming Kuob'}]}]"
35,5844822960f7143e9e0b3abd17f3e1a77d67aa62,A systematic review of virtual reality therapies for substance use disorders: Impact on secondary treatment outcomes.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Virtual reality (VR) therapy may be an effective tool in treating urges and cravings in substance use disorder (SUD). Given the high co-occurrence of difficulties with mood, anxiety, and emotional dysregulation with SUD, this review sought to examine the extant literature on the efficacy of VR for SUD in improving these secondary treatment outcomes.


METHODS
A systematic literature review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines in PubMed, PsychInfo, and Embase. Studies were included if they utilized immersive VR, were conducted with individuals with substance use disorder/dependence/misuse, and included measures of mood, anxiety, depression, emotional dysregulation, or retention in treatment.


RESULTS
Seven articles met our inclusion criteria. Five studies were conducted on patients using nicotine and utilized a cue-exposure intervention. VR was effective at reducing substance use and cravings in the majority of studies. Results on the efficacy of VR for improving mood, anxiety, and emotional regulation were mixed. Work examining retention in treatment was limited.


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
VR for SUD has the potential to improve mood and anxiety symptoms as well as retention in treatment for patients with SUD, particularly if the therapy targets these psychological symptoms. Future studies examining components of VR for SUD in individuals with drug use disorders, as well as examinations of targeted interventions for associated mood, emotional dysregulation, and retention in treatment, are necessary.

However, there is an unmet need for complementary approaches to treat OUD patients coping with pain; furthermore, few studies have probed neurobiological features of pain or its management during OUD treatment.

Assessments included functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of pain neuromatrix activation and connectivity (pre- and post-intervention), saliva cortisol and C-reactive protein (CRP) at baseline and weeks 4, 8 and 12; and self-reported pain and affective symptoms before and after each intervention session.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter each intervention session (relative to pre-session), ratings of pain, opioid craving, anxiety and depression (but not anger) decreased. Saliva cortisol (but not CRP) levels decreased from pre- to post-session. From pre- to post-intervention fMRI assessments, pain task-related left postcentral gyrus (PCG) activation decreased. At baseline, PCG showed positive connectivity with other regions of the pain neuromatrix, but this pattern changed post-intervention.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese preliminary findings demonstrate feasibility, therapeutic promise, and brain basis of a meditative intervention for OUD patients undergoing MMT.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 69, 'citationCount': 7, 'journal': {'name': 'Pain medicine'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Faraj2021AVR,\n author = {M.

Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive technology that may provide effective behavioral therapeutics for chronic pain.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nObjective: To conduct a double-blind, parallel arm, single cohort, remote, randomized placebo-controlled trial for a self-administered behavioral skills-based VR program in community-based individuals with self-reported chronic low back pain during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMethods: A national online convenience sample of individuals with self-reported non-malignant low back pain > 6 months duration and with average pain intensity > 4/10 was enrolled and randomized 1:1 to one of two daily (56-day) VR programs: (1) EaseVRx (immersive pain relief skills VR program); or (2) Sham VR (2D nature content delivered in a VR headset). Objective device use data and self-reported data were collected. The primary outcomes were the between-group effect of EaseVRx versus Sham VR across time points, and the between-within interaction effect representing the change in average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, stress, mood, and sleep over time (baseline to end-of-treatment at day 56). Secondary outcomes were global impression of change and change in physical function, sleep disturbance, pain self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, pain acceptance, pain medication use, and user satisfaction. Analytic methods included intention-to-treat and a mixed-model framework.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe study sample was 179 adults (female: 77%; Caucasian: 91%; at least some college education: 92%; mean age: 51.5 years, SD=13.1; average pain intensity: 5/10, SD=1.2; back pain duration >5 years: 67%). No group differences were found for any baseline variable or treatment engagement. User satisfaction ratings were higher for EaseVRx vs. Sham VR (p<0.0001). For the between-groups factor, EaseVRx was superior to Sham VR for all primary outcomes (highest p-value = .0090), and between-groups Cohen's d effect sizes ranged from 0.40 to 0.49 indicating superiority was moderately clinically meaningful. For EaseVRx, large pre-post effect sizes ranged from 1.17-1.3 and met moderate to substantial clinical importance for reduced pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, mood, and stress. Between group comparisons for physical function and sleep disturbance showed superiority for the EaseVRx group vs. the Sham VR group (p=0.0224 and p=.0132, respectively). Pain catastrophizing, pain self-efficacy, pain acceptance, prescription opioid use (morphine milligram equivalent; MME) did not reach statistical significance for either group. Use of over-the-counter analgesic use was reduced for EaseVRx (p<0.01) but not for ShamVR.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEaseVRx had high user satisfaction and superior and clinically meaningful symptom reduction for average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, mood, and stress compared to sham VR. Additional research is needed to determine durability of treatment effects and to characterize mechanisms of treatment effects. Home-based VR may expand access to effective and on-demand non-pharmacologic treatment for chronic low back pain.\n\n\nCLINICALTRIAL\nClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04415177.\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT\nRR2-25291."", 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 53, 'journal': {'name': 'Journal of medical Internet research'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Darnall2021DoubleblindRP,\n author = {B.

Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive technology and emerging digital behavioral pain therapy with analgesic efficacy for acute pain. We found no scientific literature on skills-based VR behavioral programs for chronic pain populations. Objective The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a self-administered VR program that included content and skills informed by evidence-based behavioral treatment for chronic pain. The secondary aim is to determine the preliminary efficacy of the VR program in terms of average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, stress, mood, and sleep, and its impact on pain-related cognition and self-efficacy. The tertiary aim was to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and compare the VR treatment with an audio-only treatment. This comparison isolated the immersive effects of the VR program, thereby informing potential mechanisms of effect. Methods We conducted an RCT involving a web-based convenience sample of adults (N=97) aged 18-75 years with self-reported chronic nonmalignant low back pain or fibromyalgia, with an average pain intensity >4 over the past month and chronic pain duration >6 months. Enrolled participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 unblinded treatments: (1) VR: a 21-day, skills-based VR program for chronic pain; and (2) audio: an audio-only version of the 21-day VR program. The analytic data set included participants who completed at least 1 of 8 surveys administered during the intervention period: VR (n=39) and audio (n=35). Results The VR and audio groups launched a total of 1067 and 1048 sessions, respectively. The majority of VR participants (n=19/25, 76%) reported no nausea or motion sickness. High satisfaction ratings were reported for VR (n=24/29, 83%) and audio (n=26/33, 72%). For VR efficacy, symptom improvement over time was found for each pain variable (all P<.001), with results strengthening after 2 weeks. Importantly, significant time×group effects were found in favor of the VR group for average pain intensity (P=.04), pain-related inference with activity (P=.005), sleep (P<.001), mood (P<.001), and stress (P=.003). For pain catastrophizing and pain self-efficacy, we found a significant declining trend for both treatment groups. Conclusions High engagement and satisfaction combined with low levels of adverse effects support the feasibility and acceptability of at-home skills-based VR for chronic pain. A significant reduction in pain outcomes over the course of the 21-day treatment both within the VR group and compared with an audio-only version suggests that VR has the potential to provide enhanced treatment and greater improvement across a range of pain outcomes.

Among the main consequences of chronic and excessive alcohol use are cognitive and executive deficits. Some of these deficits may be reversed in specific cognitive and executive domains with behavioral approaches consisting of cognitive training. The advent of computer-based interventions may leverage these improvements, but randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of digital interactive-based interventions are still scarce. Objective The aim of this study is to explore whether a cognitive training approach using VR exercises based on activities of daily living is feasible for improving the cognitive function of patients with AUD undergoing residential treatment, as well as to estimate the effect size for this intervention to power future definitive RCTs. Methods This study consisted of a two-arm pilot RCT with a sample of 36 individuals recovering from AUD in a therapeutic community; experimental group participants received a therapist-guided, VR-based cognitive training intervention combined with treatment as usual, and control group participants received treatment as usual without cognitive training. A comprehensive neuropsychological battery of tests was used both at pre- and postassessments, including measurement of global cognition, executive functions, attention, visual memory, and cognitive flexibility. Results In order to control for potential effects of global cognition and executive functions at baseline, these domains were controlled for in the statistical analysis for each individual outcome. Results indicate intervention effects on attention in two out of five outcomes and on cognitive flexibility in two out of six outcomes, with effect sizes in significant comparisons being larger for attention than for cognitive flexibility. Patient retention in cognitive training was high, in line with previous studies. Conclusions Overall, the data suggest that VR-based cognitive training results in specific contributions to improving attention ability and cognitive flexibility of patients recovering from AUD.

We assessed the association between mortality following detox and receipt of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and residential treatment after detox.\n\n\nDESIGN\nCohort study generated from individually linked public health data sets.\n\n\nSETTING\nMassachusetts, USA.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nA total of 30\u2009681 opioid detox patients with 61\u2009819 detox episodes between 2012 and 2014.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS\nTreatment categories included no post-detox treatment, MOUD, residential treatment or both MOUD and residential treatment identified at monthly intervals. We classified treatment exposures in two ways: (a) 'on-treatment' included any month where a treatment was received and (b) 'with-discontinuation' individuals were considered exposed through the month following treatment discontinuation. We conducted multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses and extended Kaplan-Meier estimator cumulative incidence for all-cause and opioid-related mortality for the treatment categories as monthly time-varying exposure variables.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nTwelve months after detox, 41% received MOUD for a median of 3\xa0months, 35% received residential treatment for a median of 2\xa0months and 13% received both for a median of 5\xa0months. In on-treatment analyses for all-cause mortality compared with no treatment, adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) were 0.34 [95% confidence interval (CI)\xa0=\xa00.27-0.43] for MOUD, 0.63 (95% CI\xa0=\xa00.47-0.84) for residential treatment and 0.11 (95% CI\xa0=\xa00.03-0.43) for both. In with-discontinuation analyses for all-cause mortality, compared with no treatment, AHRs were 0.52 (95% CI\xa0= 0.42-0.63) for MOUD, 0.76 (95% CI\xa0=\xa00.59-0.96) for residential treatment and 0.21 (95% CI\xa0=\xa00.08-0.55) for both. Results were similar for opioid-related overdose mortality.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmong people who have undergone medically managed opioid withdrawal, receipt of medications for opioid use disorder, residential treatment or the combination of medications for opioid use disorder and residential treatment were associated with substantially reduced mortality compared with no treatment."", 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 40, 'citationCount': 27, 'journal': {'name': 'Addiction'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Walley2020AssociationBM,\n author = {A.

Research in alcohol, marijuana, and nicotine use disorders have linked coping motives (e.g. using substances to ameliorate negative emotional states) to problematic substance use. We evaluated the link between emotion regulation difficulties (as assessed via the difficulties in emotion regulation scale [DERS]) and motives for drug use (as assessed via the Drug Use Motives Questionnaire) among individuals (n = 68) with opioid use disorders who were in methadone maintenance treatment. We found that the DERS total score was significantly associated with coping motives for use. Nonacceptance of emotional responses was the only DERS domain that offered nonredundant prediction of coping motives. These findings highlight the relevance of specific emotion regulation deficits in motives for illicit drug use among individuals with opioid use disorders and may help inform targeted cognitive-behavioral treatments in this population.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 31, 'citationCount': 17, 'journal': {'volume': '49', 'pages': '74 - 80', 'name': 'Cognitive Behaviour Therapy'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Gold2020EmotionRA,\n author = {Alexandra K.

But the extent to which SUD interventions impact emotional outcomes among general SUD populations is yet unquantified. The current meta-analysis aims to fill this gap.\n\n\nMETHOD\nA total of 11,754 records were screened for randomized, controlled trials examining the effect of behavioral SUD interventions on emotion outcomes. Our search yielded a total of 138 effect sizes calculated based on data from 5,146 individuals enrolled in 30 independent clinical trials. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to calculate pooled effect sizes, and metaregression analyses examined study-level moderators (e.g., intervention type).\n\n\nRESULTS\nFindings indicated a small but significant effect of SUD interventions on emotion outcomes, d = 0.157, 95% CI [0.052, 0.262] (k = 30). The effect size for negative emotion was nominally bigger, d = 0.162, 95% CI [0.056, 0.269] (k = 30), whereas the effect for positive emotion did not reach statistical significance, d = 0.062, 95% CI [-0.089, 0.213] (k = 7). Studies featuring SUD interventions designed to specifically target emotions (i.e., affect-regulation, mindfulness-based treatments) produced larger reductions in negative emotion compared with studies featuring interventions that did not contain specific emotion modules (e.g., contingency management).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFindings suggest that SUD interventions-especially mindfulness-based and affect-regulation treatments-indeed significantly reduce negative emotion, although relatively small effect sizes indicate potential room for improvement. Conclusions regarding positive emotion should be considered preliminary because of the limited numbers of samples assessing these outcomes.

Objective We aimed to develop a methodological framework with input from an international working group in order to guide the design, implementation, analysis, interpretation, and communication of trials that develop and test VR treatments. Methods A group of 21 international experts was recruited based on their contributions to the VR literature. The resulting Virtual Reality Clinical Outcomes Research Experts held iterative meetings to seek consensus on best practices for the development and testing of VR treatments. Results The interactions were transcribed, and key themes were identified to develop a scientific framework in order to support best practices in methodology of clinical VR trials. Using the Food and Drug Administration Phase I-III pharmacotherapy model as guidance, a framework emerged to support three phases of VR clinical study designs—VR1, VR2, and VR3. VR1 studies focus on content development by working with patients and providers through the principles of human-centered design. VR2 trials conduct early testing with a focus on feasibility, acceptability, tolerability, and initial clinical efficacy. VR3 trials are randomized, controlled studies that evaluate efficacy against a control condition. Best practice recommendations for each trial were provided.

With virtual reality (VR), computer-generated interactive environments, individuals can repeatedly experience their problematic situations and be taught, via evidence-based psychological treatments, how to overcome difficulties. VR is moving out of specialist laboratories. Our central aim was to describe the potential of VR in mental health, including a consideration of the first 20 years of applications. A systematic review of empirical studies was conducted. In all, 285 studies were identified, with 86 concerning assessment, 45 theory development, and 154 treatment. The main disorders researched were anxiety (n = 192), schizophrenia (n = 44), substance-related disorders (n = 22) and eating disorders (n = 18). There are pioneering early studies, but the methodological quality of studies was generally low. The gaps in meaningful applications to mental health are extensive. The most established finding is that VR exposure-based treatments can reduce anxiety disorders, but there are numerous research and treatment avenues of promise. VR was found to be a much-misused term, often applied to non-interactive and non-immersive technologies. We conclude that VR has the potential to transform the assessment, understanding and treatment of mental health problems. The treatment possibilities will only be realized if – with the user experience at the heart of design – the best immersive VR technology is combined with targeted translational interventions. The capability of VR to simulate reality could greatly increase access to psychological therapies, while treatment outcomes could be enhanced by the technology's ability to create new realities. VR may merit the level of attention given to neuroimaging."", 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 67, 'citationCount': 617, 'journal': {'volume': '47', 'pages': '2393 - 2400', 'name': 'Psychological Medicine'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Freeman2017VirtualRI,\n author = {Daniel Freeman and S.

The objectives of this study were to observe trends in treatment utilization; examine correlates of treatment utilization and treatment types/settings among adolescent substance users with and without substance use disorder (SUD); and assess gender differences.\n\n\nMETHODS\nNational Survey on Drug Use and Health data were pooled across 2002 to 2013, with a combined sample of 79,885 past-year substance users ages 12 to 17 (17,510 with SUD and 62,375 without SUD). Treatment was defined as receiving treatment or counseling for use of alcohol or any drug, not counting cigarettes. Trends were assessed by joinpoint linear regression, and multivariable logistic regression assessed odds ratios of treatment utilization.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPercentages of past-year treatment use did not change in 2002 to 2013. Treatment utilization was more prevalent among adolescents with SUD than without (11.4% vs. 1.4%) and among males than females. Among adolescents with and without SUD, criminal justice involvement and perceiving a need for treatment increased adolescent treatment utilization, while SUDs other than alcohol abuse, older age, and talking to parents increased treatment use among adolescents with SUD, and polysubstance use and male gender increased treatment among those without SUD. Treatment gaps persisted among non-Hispanic Blacks for both groups with and without SUD, male Hispanics with SUD, female non-Hispanic Asians without SUD, and private insurance coverages. Gender differences were observed in SUD, race/ethnicity, and insurance coverage. Most adolescents received treatment for both alcohol and drug use, and self-help group and outpatient rehabilitation facility were the most used treatment settings.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTreatment utilization among adolescents with past-year substance use remained low and unimproved in 2002 to 2013. Treatment gaps among minority populations, insurance coverage, and in educating adolescents on seeking relevant treatment must be addressed. Using screening processes such as Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment, health professionals can help prevent lifelong SUD by recognizing and addressing substance misuse early.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 45, 'citationCount': 22, 'journal': {'volume': '40 8', 'pages': '\n          1717-27\n        ', 'name': 'Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Haughwout2016TreatmentUA,\n author = {Sarah P.

Various methods to study craving exist; however, suppressing craving to successfully promote abstinence remains an unmet clinical need in SUDs. One reason is that social and environmental contexts recalling drug and alcohol consumption in the everyday life of patients suffering from SUDs often initiate craving and provoke relapse. Current behavioral therapies for SUDs use the cue-exposure approach to suppress salience of social and environmental contexts that may induce craving. They facilitate learning and cognitive reinforcement of new behavior and entrain craving suppression in the presence of cues related to drug and alcohol consumption. Unfortunately, craving often overweighs behavioral training especially in real social and environmental contexts with peer pressure encouraging the use of substance, such as parties and bars. In this perspective, virtual reality (VR) is gaining interest in the development of cue-reactivity paradigms and practices new skills in treatment. VR enhances ecological validity of traditional craving-induction measurement. In this review, we discuss results from (1) studies using VR and alternative virtual agents in the induction of craving and (2) studies combining cue-exposure therapy with VR in the promotion of abstinence from drugs and alcohol use. They used virtual environments, displaying alcohol and drugs to SUD patients. Moreover, some environments included avatars. Hence, some studies have focused on the social interactions that are associated with drug-seeking behaviors and peer pressure. Findings indicate that VR can successfully increase craving.

It remains unclear what interventions can help them to quit smoking.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions, with and without specific mood management components, in smokers with current or past depression.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nIn April 2013, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, other reviews, and asked experts for information on trials.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nCriteria for including studies in this review were that they had to be randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing smoking cessation interventions in adult smokers with current or past depression. Depression was defined as major depression or depressive symptoms. We included studies where subgroups of participants with depression were identified, either pre-stated or post hoc. The outcome was abstinence from smoking after six months or longer follow-up. We preferred prolonged or continuous abstinence and biochemically validated abstinence where available.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nWhen possible, we estimated pooled risk ratios (RRs) with the Mantel-Haenszel method (fixed-effect model). We also performed subgroup analyses, by length of follow-up, depression measurement, depression group in study, antidepressant use, published or unpublished data, format of intervention, level of behavioural support, additional pharmacotherapy, type of antidepressant medication, and additional nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nForty-nine RCTs were included of which 33 trials investigated smoking cessation interventions with specific mood management components for depression. In smokers with current depression, meta-analysis showed a significant positive effect for adding psychosocial mood management to a standard smoking cessation intervention when compared with standard smoking cessation intervention alone (11 trials, N = 1844, RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.92). In smokers with past depression we found a similar effect (13 trials, N = 1496, RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.77). Meta-analysis resulted in a positive effect, although not significant, for adding bupropion compared with placebo in smokers with current depression (5 trials, N = 410, RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.27). There were not enough trial data to evaluate the effectiveness of fluoxetine and paroxetine for smokers with current depression. Bupropion (4 trials, N = 404, RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.31 to 3.18) might significantly increase long-term cessation among smokers with past depression when compared with placebo, but the evidence for bupropion is relatively weak due to the small number of studies and the post hoc subgroups for all the studies. There were not enough trial data to evaluate the effectiveness of fluoxetine, nortriptyline, paroxetine, selegiline, and sertraline in smokers with past depression.Twenty-three of the 49 trials investigated smoking cessation interventions without specific components for depression. There was heterogeneity between the trials which compared psychosocial interventions with standard smoking cessation counselling for both smokers with current and past depression. Therefore, we did not estimate a pooled effect. One trial compared nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) versus placebo in smokers with current depression and found a positive, although not significant, effect (N = 196, RR 2.64, 95% CI 0.93 to 7.45). Meta-analysis also found a positive, although not significant, effect for NRT versus placebo in smokers with past depression (3 trials, N = 432, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.60). Three trials compared other pharmacotherapy versus placebo and six trials compared other interventions in smokers with current or past depression. Due to heterogeneity between the interventions of the included trials we did not estimate pooled effects.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nEvidence suggests that adding a psychosocial mood management component to a standard smoking cessation intervention increases long-term cessation rates in smokers with both current and past depression when compared with the standard intervention alone. Pooled results from four trials suggest that use of bupropion may increase long-term cessation in smokers with past depression. There was no evidence found for the use of bupropion in smokers with current depression. There was not enough evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of the other antidepressants in smokers with current or past depression. There was also not enough evidence to evaluate the group of trials that investigated interventions without specific mood management components for depression, including NRT and psychosocial interventions."", 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 189, 'citationCount': 135, 'journal': {'volume': '8', 'pages': '\n          CD006102\n        ', 'name': 'The Cochrane database of systematic reviews'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Meer2013SmokingCI,\n author = {R.

Objective To present nationally representative data on the prevalence and comorbidity of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM–IV) alcohol and drug use disorders and independent mood and anxiety disorders (including only those that are not substance induced and that are not due to a general medical condition). Design Face-to-face survey. Setting The United States. Participants Household and group quarters residents. Main Outcome Measures Prevalence and associations of substance use disorders and independent mood and anxiety disorders. Results The prevalences of 12-month DSM–IV independent mood and anxiety disorders in the U.S. population were 9.21 percent (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 8.78 percent–9.64 percent) and 11.08 percent (95 percent CI, 10.43 percent–11.73 percent), respectively. The rate of substance use disorders was 9.35 percent (95 percent CI, 8.86 percent–9.84 percent). Only a few individuals with mood or anxiety disorders were classified as having only substance-induced disorders. Associations between most substance use disorders and independent mood and anxiety disorders were positive and significant (p < .05). Conclusions Substance use disorders and mood and anxiety disorders that develop independently of intoxication and withdrawal are among the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in the United States. Associations between most substance use disorders and independent mood and anxiety disorders were overwhelmingly positive and significant, suggesting that treatment for a comorbid mood or anxiety disorder should not be withheld from individuals with substance use disorders.', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 69, 'citationCount': 1839, 'journal': {'volume': '29', 'pages': '107 - 120', 'name': 'Alcohol Research & Health'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Grant2004PrevalenceAC,\n author = {B.

Of the more than 300 citations extracted, 44 were placebo-controlled clinical trials, 14 of which were selected for this analysis and included 848 patients: 5 studies of tricyclic antidepressants, 7 of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, and 2 from other classes\n\n\nDATA EXTRACTION\nWe independently screened the titles and abstracts of each citation, identified placebo-controlled trials of patients with both substance dependence and depression, applied the inclusion criteria, and reached consensus. Data on study methods, sample characteristics, and depression and substance use outcomes were extracted. The principal measure of effect size was the standardized difference between means on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS).\n\n\nDATA SYNTHESIS\nFor the HDS score, the pooled effect size from the random-effects model was 0.38 (95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.58). Heterogeneity of effect on HDS across studies was significant (P <.02), and studies with low placebo response showed larger effects. Moderator analysis suggested that diagnostic methods and concurrent psychosocial interventions influenced outcome. Studies with larger depression effect sizes (>0.5) demonstrated favorable effects of medication on measures of quantity of substance use, but rates of sustained abstinence were low.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAntidepressant medication exerts a modest beneficial effect for patients with combined depressive- and substance-use disorders. It is not a stand-alone treatment, and concurrent therapy directly targeting the addiction is also indicated. More research is needed to understand variations in the strength of the effect, but the data suggest that care be exercised in the diagnosis of depression-either by observing depression to persist during at least a brief period of abstinence or through efforts by clinical history to screen out substance-related depressive symptoms.', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 78, 'citationCount': 500, 'journal': {'volume': '291 15', 'pages': '\n          1887-96\n        ', 'name': 'JAMA'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Nunes2004TreatmentOD,\n author = {E.

Virtual reality (VR) may potentially be effectively utilized in anger management, and this study aimed to verify the applicability of the VR-based anger control training program. The data obtained by having 60 young male participants divided into 2 groups, the high aggression group and the low aggression group, based on their Aggression Questionnaire scores to execute this program were analyzed. The program consisted of ""Anger Exposure Training"" for provoking anger and facilitating anger control and ""Mindfulness Training"" for providing the meditation experience for controlling anger. The anger scores and comfort scores obtained from these tasks, respectively, were analyzed for differences between the groups and between the experimental conditions. The anger regulation and comfort enhancement rates were analyzed for correlations with psychological variables. In Anger Exposure Training, the anger scores in angry expression were reduced in managed expression of anger in both groups. In Mindfulness Training, meditation increased comfort score as well in both groups, and the comfort enhancement rates were negatively correlated with the levels of self-differentiation and open communication with mother only in the high aggression group. These results indicate that the VR environments can provide an effective means of trainings for managing anger.

Developing interventions that slow down cognitive decline would greatly benefit the autonomy of these elderly, as well as their caretakers. Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive and interactive human-computer interface with real-time simulation that is suggested to be a promising tool to improve cognitive functioning. This literature review discusses the features of immersive VR, including its opportunities and limitations, that are of special relevance for improving cognition in elderly. First, the high flexibility of VR allows for personalized and safe training of potentially harmful situations and isolated aspects of tasks. Second, VR’s dynamic and real-time feedback on performance provides a labor-extensive tool for caretakers in elderly care. Third, the acquisition of high resolution data enables the exposure of subtle changes over time, relevant for detecting the nature and extent of cognitive changes in elderly, including those with dementia. Fourth, immersive VR has been related to cybersickness. Finally, VR is immersive and enables the perception and expression of emotions, motor behaviors, and multiple senses. Aged subjects are found to have sparing of emotional learning and show increased reliance on multisensory integration for learning. Moreover, they experience high levels of flow, motivation, and presence in VR setups. Despite the clear potential of immersive VR, the studies available are small scale and have not been replicated. The digital illiteracy of elderly and healthcare personnel form an additional barrier for implementation. Hence, while replication of outcomes and standardization of VR interventions is required before it can be used in standard care, VR may provide a particularly effective tool for training cognition in elderly.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 130, 'citationCount': 39, 'journal': {'volume': '66', 'pages': '614 - 623', 'name': 'Gerontology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Bauer2020ThePO,\n author = {A.

Continuous-variable analysis strategies drawing from a general linear model framework can be applied to such designs. The growing emphasis on dimensional examinations of psychological constructs, encouraged by the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria framework, encourages continuous-variable analytic strategies. However, the interpretative implications of applying these strategies to various types of populations and sample score distributions, including those used in EGDs, are not always recognized. Appropriateness and utility of EGDs depend in part on whether the goal is to determine whether a relationship exists between 2 variables or to determine its strength. Whereas the literature investigating EGDs has emphasized symmetrical thresholds for defining extreme groups (e.g., bottom 10% vs. top 10%), psychopathologists often employ asymmetric thresholds (e.g., above a diagnostic threshold vs. a broader range of scores in a healthy comparison group). The present article selectively reviews literature on EGDs and extends it with simulations of symmetric and asymmetric selection criteria. Results indicate that including a wide range of scores in EGDs substantially mitigates problems (e.g., inflation of effect size) that arise when using statistical methods classically employed for continuous variables.

We conducted a systematic review to determine whether virtual reality (VR) simulation training can supplement and/or replace conventional patient-based endoscopy training for health professional trainees with limited or no prior endoscopic experience. Methods\u2002We searched medical, educational, and computer literature databases in July 2017 for trials that compared VR simulation training with no training, conventional training, another form of simulation training, or an alternative method of VR training. We screened, abstracted data, and performed quantitative analysis and quality assessment through Cochrane methodology. Results\u2002We included 18 trials with 3817 endoscopic procedures. VR training provided no advantage over no training or conventional training based on the primary outcome of composite score of competency. VR training was advantageous over no training based on independent procedure completion (relative risk [RR]\u200a=\u200a1.62, 95\u200a% confidence interval [CI] 1.15\u200a–\u200a2.26, moderate-quality evidence), overall rating of performance (mean difference [MD] 0.45, 95\u200a%CI 0.15\u200a–\u200a0.75, very low-quality evidence), and mucosal visualization (MD 0.60, 95\u200a%CI 0.20\u200a–\u200a1.00, very low-quality evidence). Compared with conventional training, VR training resulted in fewer independent procedure completions (RR\u200a=\u200a0.45, 95\u200a%CI 0.27\u200a–\u200a0.74, low-quality evidence). We found no differences between VR training and no training or conventional training for other outcomes. Based on qualitative analysis, we found no significant differences between VR training and other forms of simulation training. VR curricula based in educational theory provided benefit with respect to composite score of competency, compared with unstructured curricula. Conclusions\u2002VR simulation training is advantageous over no training and can supplement conventional endoscopy training.

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT®) is the most effective treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder, but demand for DBT® far exceeds existing clinical resources. Most patients with BPD never receive DBT®. Incorporating computer technology into the DBT® could help increase dissemination. Immersive Virtual Reality technology (VR) is becoming widely available to mainstream consumers. This case study explored the feasibility/clinical potential of using immersive virtual reality technology to enhance DBT® mindfulness skills training of a 32 year old female diagnosed with BPD. Prior to using VR, the patient experienced difficulty practicing DBT® mindfulness due to her emotional reactivity, and difficulty concentrating. To help the patient focus her attention, and to facilitate DBT® mindfulness skills learning, the patient looked into virtual reality goggles, and had the illusion of slowly “floating down” a 3D computer-generated river while listening to DBT® mindfulness training audios. Urges to commit suicide, urges to self harm, urges to quit therapy, urges to use substances, and negative emotions were all reduced after each VR mindfulness session and VR mindfulness was well accepted/liked by the patient. Although case studies are scientifically inconclusive by nature, results from this feasibility study were encouraging. Future controlled studies are needed to quantify whether VR-enhanced mindfulness training has long term benefits e.g., increasing patient acceptance and/or improving therapeutic outcome.

Various methods to study craving exist; however, suppressing craving to successfully promote abstinence remains an unmet clinical need in SUDs. One reason is that social and environmental contexts recalling drug and alcohol consumption in the everyday life of patients suffering from SUDs often initiate craving and provoke relapse. Current behavioral therapies for SUDs use the cue-exposure approach to suppress salience of social and environmental contexts that may induce craving. They facilitate learning and cognitive reinforcement of new behavior and entrain craving suppression in the presence of cues related to drug and alcohol consumption. Unfortunately, craving often overweighs behavioral training especially in real social and environmental contexts with peer pressure encouraging the use of substance, such as parties and bars. In this perspective, virtual reality (VR) is gaining interest in the development of cue-reactivity paradigms and practices new skills in treatment. VR enhances ecological validity of traditional craving-induction measurement. In this review, we discuss results from (1) studies using VR and alternative virtual agents in the induction of craving and (2) studies combining cue-exposure therapy with VR in the promotion of abstinence from drugs and alcohol use. They used virtual environments, displaying alcohol and drugs to SUD patients. Moreover, some environments included avatars. Hence, some studies have focused on the social interactions that are associated with drug-seeking behaviors and peer pressure. Findings indicate that VR can successfully increase craving. Studies combining cue–exposure therapy with virtual environment, however, reported mitigated success so far.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 108, 'citationCount': 138, 'journal': {'volume': '8', 'name': 'Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Hone-Blanchet2014TheUO,\n author = {Antoine Hone-Blanchet and T.

It is generally believed that the greater the size of the crowd of bystanders, the less the chance that any of them will intervene. A complementary model is that social identity is critical as an explanatory variable. For example, when the bystander shares common social identity with the victim the probability of intervention is enhanced, other things being equal. However, it is generally not possible to study such hypotheses experimentally for practical and ethical reasons. Here we show that an experiment that depicts a violent incident at life-size in immersive virtual reality lends support to the social identity explanation. 40 male supporters of Arsenal Football Club in England were recruited for a two-factor between-groups experiment: the victim was either an Arsenal supporter or not (in-group/out-group), and looked towards the participant for help or not during the confrontation. The response variables were the numbers of verbal and physical interventions by the participant during the violent argument. The number of physical interventions had a significantly greater mean in the in-group condition compared to the out-group. The more that participants perceived that the Victim was looking to them for help the greater the number of interventions in the in-group but not in the out-group. These results are supported by standard statistical analysis of variance, with more detailed findings obtained by a symbolic regression procedure based on genetic programming. Verbal interventions made during their experience, and analysis of post-experiment interview data suggest that in-group members were more prone to confrontational intervention compared to the out-group who were more prone to make statements to try to diffuse the situation.', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 41, 'citationCount': 152, 'journal': {'volume': '8', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Slater2013BystanderRT,\n author = {M.

Feminist perspectives assume patriarchal control to be at the root of domestic violence, and see anger and alcohol as excuses for abusive behaviour. Psychological approaches identify anger and alcohol as risk factors for violence in some subgroups of offenders. A risk–needs model is presented, in which a distinction is drawn between acute and stable dynamic risk factors. Both may be targets of intervention, but addressing stable dynamic risk factors is more likely to effect enduring change. A theoretical understanding is required to identify stable dynamic risk factors, and here we suggest an affective defence approach to anger-related domestic violence and a social problem solving approach to alcohol-related domestic violence.

This paper describes the results of principal-components analyses of Presence Questionnaire (PQ) data from 325 participants following exposure to immersive virtual environments. The analyses suggest that a 4-factor model provides the best fit to our data. The factors are Involvement, Adaptation/Immersion, Sensory Fidelity, and Interface Quality. Except for the Adaptation/Immersion factor, these factors corresponded to those identified in a cluster analysis of data from an earlier version of the questionnaire. The existence of an Adaptation/Immersion factor leads us to postulate that immersion is greater for those individuals who rapidly and easily adapt to the virtual environment. The magnitudes of the correlations among the factors indicate moderately strong relationships among the 4 factors. Within these relationships, Sensory Fidelity items seem to be more closely related to Involvement, whereas Interface Quality items appear to be more closely related to Adaptation/Immersion, even though there is a moderately strong relationship between the Involvement and Adaptation/Immersion factors.', 'year': 2005, 'referenceCount': 32, 'citationCount': 562, 'journal': {'volume': '14', 'pages': '298-312', 'name': 'Presence: Teleoperators & Virtual Environments'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Witmer2005TheFS,\n author = {B.

The VR and non-VR groups underwent eight sessions of neurofeedback training over 2 weeks, while the control group just waited during the same period. The VR group used a head-mounted display (HMD) and a head tracker, which let them look around the virtual world. Conversely, the non-VR group used only a computer monitor with a fixed viewpoint. All participants performed a continuous performance task (CPT) before and after the complete training session. The results showed that both the VR and non-VR groups achieved better scores in the CPT after the training session, while the control group showed no significant difference.

Previous research has suggested that emotional regulation (ER) and emotional dysregulation (ED) may be factors which are correlated with symptom severity and maintenance of TR-PTSD. This embedded mixed-methods pilot study (n = 9) sought to explore the impact of 3MDR on ER and ED of MMs and veterans. Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale (DERS-18) data were collected at baseline, prior to each session, and at one week, one month, and three months postintervention and analyzed. Qualitative data collected from sessions, debriefs, and follow-up interviews were transcribed and descriptively analyzed. Results demonstrated statistically significant decreases in DERS-18 scores from preintervention to postintervention at each timepoint. Qualitatively, participants perceived improvements in ER within specified DERS-18 domains. We describe how 3MDR’s unique and novel approach addresses ED through cognitive–motor stimulation, narration, divergent thinking, reappraisal of aversive stimuli, dual-task processing, and reconsolidation of traumatic memories.

Although psychotherapy can reduce symptoms, some military members may experience treatment-resistant PTSD. Multimodular motion-assisted memory desensitization and reconsolidation (3MDR) has been introduced as a virtual reality (VR) intervention for military members with PTSD related to military service. The 3MDR intervention incorporates exposure therapy, psychotherapy, eye movement desensitization and reconsolidation, VR, supportive counselling, and treadmill walking. Objective The objective of this study is to investigate whether 3MDR reduces PTSD symptoms among military members with combat-related treatment-resistant PTSD (TR-PTSD); examine the technology acceptance and usability of the Computer Assisted Rehabilitation ENvironment (CAREN) and 3MDR interventions by Canadian Armed Forces service members (CAF-SMs), veterans, 3MDR clinicians, and operators; and evaluate the impact on clinicians and operators of delivering 3MDR. Methods This is a mixed-methods waitlist controlled crossover design randomized controlled trial. Participants include both CAF-SMs and veterans (N=40) aged 18-60 years with combat-related TR-PTSD (unsuccessful experience of at least 2 evidence-based trauma treatments). Participants will also include clinicians and operators (N=12) who have been trained in 3MDR and subsequently utilized this intervention with patients. CAF-SMs and veterans will receive 6 weekly 90-minute 3MDR sessions. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months postintervention. Quantitative data collection will include multiomic biomarkers (ie, blood and salivary proteomic and genomic profiles of neuroendocrine, immune-inflammatory mediators, and microRNA), eye tracking, electroencephalography, and physiological data. Data from outcome measures will capture self-reported symptoms of PTSD, moral injury, resilience, and technology acceptance and usability. Qualitative data will be collected from audiovisual recordings of 3MDR sessions and semistructured interviews. Data analysis will include univariate and multivariate approaches, and thematic analysis of treatment sessions and interviews. Machine learning analysis will be included to develop models for the prediction of diagnosis, symptom severity, and treatment outcomes. Results This study commenced in April 2019 and is planned to conclude in April 2021. Study results will guide the further evolution and utilization of 3MDR for military members with TR-PTSD and will have utility in treating other trauma-affected populations. Conclusions The goal of this study is to utilize qualitative and quantitative primary and secondary outcomes to provide evidence for the effectiveness and feasibility of 3MDR for treating CAF-SMs and veterans with combat-related TR-PTSD. The results will inform a full-scale clinical trial and stimulate development and adaptation of the protocol to mobile VR apps in supervised clinical settings. This study will add to knowledge of the clinical effectiveness of 3MDR, and provide the first comprehensive analysis of biomarkers, technology acceptance and usability, moral injury, resilience, and the experience of clinicians and operators delivering 3MDR.

Several protective and risk factors have been identified in civilians and veterans to explain why some individuals develop PTSD and others do not. However, no research has confirmed the relationship between emotion regulation and PTSD in deployed German Armed Forces service members after a foreign assignment. Previous studies have identified some protective factors, such as social support, social acknowledgment, specific personal values, and posttraumatic growth, as well as risk factors, like moral injury and emotion regulation. Thus, the aim of the present study is to confirm the relationship between emotion regulation and PTSD and to test for factors that are associated with higher severity of PTSD symptoms in such a sample. Methods A post-hoc secondary analysis was conducted on data collected in a randomized controlled trial. Participants (N = 72) were male active and former military service members that have returned from deployment and were recruited from the German Armed Forces. These participants were separated into two groups according to PTSD diagnosis based on the results of a structured diagnostic interview. Data from evaluation questionnaires administered upon entry into the study were subjected to a cross-sectional analysis. The measures included the severity of PTSD symptoms, clusters of PTSD symptoms, clinical measures, and several measures assessing PTSD-related constructs. Analyses included the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, X2 tests for nominal data, Mann-Whitney U-tests for non-parametric data, and a mediation analysis. Results The results of the mediation analysis revealed that difficulties in emotion regulation were significantly associated with the severity of PTSD symptoms, which was mediated by social acknowledgment and experimental avoidance but not by moral injury. The analyses showed that the severity of PTSD symptoms and all clusters of PTSD symptoms were significantly associated with most of the measured constructs in expectable directions. Participants in the PTSD group showed significantly higher mean scores on questionnaires measuring constructs that have been associated with PTSD, like emotion regulation and moral injury. They also showed lower mean scores in questionnaires for social support and social acknowledgment as a victim or survivor than participants in the non-PTSD group. Conclusion The present results show that difficulties in emotion regulation are directly associated with the severity of PTSD symptoms in service members of the German Armed Forces. This association is mediated by social acknowledgment and experimental avoidance, but not by moral injury. Thus, future studies should investigate these potentially crucial factors for better understanding of the development and maintenance of PTSD in service members of the German Armed Forces after deployment to create possible treatment adaptions.

In addition, it is yet to be known how EP‐ and ER‐related areas are interactively linked to regulatory behavior, and whether this interaction is disrupted in MDD. In our study, regional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and whole‐brain functional connectivity (FC) of meta‐analytic‐driven EP‐ and ER‐related areas were compared between 32 healthy controls (HC) and 20 MDD patients. Then, we aimed to investigate whether the EP‐related areas can predict the ER‐related areas and regulatory behavior in both groups. Finally, the brain–behavior correlations between the EP‐ and ER‐related areas and depression severity were assessed. We found that: (a) affective areas are regionally and/or connectively disturbed in MDD; (b) EP‐ER interaction seems to be disrupted in MDD; overburden of emotional reactivity in amygdala may inversely affect cognitive control processes in prefrontal cortices, which leads to diminished regulatory actions.

Early abuse and neglect can deregulate the child's developing neurobiological system by reducing its resistance to stressful events, leading to later problems of emotional regulation. Children who have been subjected to physical or emotional abuse tend to pay more attention to signs that contain anger and are hypersensitive to threat. Scar hypothesis and the theories of behavioural sensitization or electrophysiological kindling suggest that emotional traumas may leave traces that persist even after remission of depression, and render individuals vulnerable to the onset of new episodes, even under the influence of only moderate psychosocial stress. Unfavorable early social experiences, such as emotional abuse or institutionalization can affect the structure and function of the prefrontal cortex. Exposure to repeated emotional stressors, even in the absence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnoses, has been shown to produce increased synapse formation and dendritic growth in basolateral amygdala, dendritic retraction in the hippocampus, and anxiety-like behavior against specific triggers, such as phobia of open spaces. During the narration of an emotionally traumatic event, there is activation of the limbic system, the right amygdale, the orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate gyrus. In addition, there is an activation of the anterior insula, which records the physical impact of negative emotions, and the anterior and medial temporal cortex, which are involved in negative emotions. Neuroimaging studies in PTSD patients have found hypoactivity in the frontal lobe, anterior cingulate and thalamic areas, indicating the effects of PTSD on executive function, attention and cognitive, memorial, and affective and somatosensory integration. One of the most replicated findings in studies involving PTSD patients is the decreased activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Studies have also found a negative correlation between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and amygdala activation. A recent meta-analysis revealed structural brain abnormalities associated with PTSD and emotional trauma and suggested that global brain volume reductions can distinguish PTSD from major depression. Neuroimaging studies of successful eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) treatment have consistently shown that patients exhibited increased frontal lobe activation. Moving beyond diagnostic boundaries, focusing on the causal interplay between specific traumatic processes and using standardized measures, are useful directions for future research in memory, emotion and emotional trauma."", 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 83, 'citationCount': 28, 'journal': {'volume': '31 2', 'pages': '\n          162-171\n        ', 'name': 'Psychiatrike = Psychiatriki'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Giotakos2020NeurobiologyOE,\n author = {O.

A novel virtual reality and motion-assisted exposure therapy, called 3MDR, provides treatment in an immersive, personalized and activating context. Objective: To study the efficacy of 3MDR for veterans with treatment-resistant PTSD. Method: In a randomized controlled trial (n = 43) 3MDR was compared to a non-specific treatment component control group. Primary outcome was clinician-rated PTSD symptoms at baseline, after 3MDR, and at the 12-week and 16-week follow-up (primary end point). Intention-to-treat analyses of covariance and mixed models were applied to study differences between groups at the end point and over the course of intervention, controlling for baseline scores. Results: The decrease in PTSD symptom severity from baseline to end point was significantly greater for 3MDR as compared to the control group, with a large effect size (F[1, 37] = 6.43, p = 0.016, d = 0.83). No significant between-group difference was detected in the course of PTSD symptoms during treatment when including all time points. The dropout rate was low (7%), and 45% of the patients in the 3MDR group improved clinically. The number needed to treat was 2.86. Conclusions: In this trial, 3MDR significantly decreased PTSD symptoms in veterans with, on average, a history of 4 unsuccessful treatments. The low dropout rate may be indicative of high engagement. However, a lack of significant differences on secondary outcomes limits conclusions that can be drawn on its efficacy and underlines the need for larger phase III trials. These data show emerging evidence for 3MDR and its potential to progress PTSD treatment for veterans (Dutch Trial Register Identifier: NL5126).', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 58, 'citationCount': 31, 'journal': {'volume': '89', 'pages': '215 - 227', 'name': 'Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Gelderen2020InteractiveME,\n author = {M.

Since its formal introduction in the DSM‐III in 1980, knowledge has grown significantly regarding its causes, maintaining mechanisms and treatments. Despite this increased understanding, however, the actual definition of the disorder remains controversial. The DSM‐5 and ICD‐11 define the disorder differently, reflecting disagreements in the field about whether the construct of PTSD should encompass a broad array of psychological manifestations that arise after trauma or should be focused more specifically on trauma memory phenomena. This controversy over clarifying the phenotype of PTSD has limited the capacity to identify biomarkers and specific mechanisms of traumatic stress. This review provides an up‐to‐date outline of the current definitions of PTSD, its known prevalence and risk factors, the main models to explain the disorder, and evidence‐supported treatments. A major conclusion is that, although trauma‐focused cognitive behavior therapy is the best‐validated treatment for PTSD, it has stagnated over recent decades, and only two‐thirds of PTSD patients respond adequately to this intervention. Moreover, most people with PTSD do not access evidence‐based treatment, and this situation is much worse in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Identifying processes that can overcome these major barriers to better management of people with PTSD remains an outstanding challenge.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 191, 'citationCount': 221, 'journal': {'volume': '18', 'name': 'World Psychiatry'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Bryant2019PosttraumaticSD,\n author = {R.

A Systematic Review on Suggested Mechanisms of Action', 'abstract': 'Background: Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing [EMDR] is an innovative, evidence-based and effective psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]. As with other psychotherapies, the effectiveness of EMDR contrasts with a limited knowledge of its underlying mechanism of action. In its relatively short life as a therapeutic option, EMDR has not been without controversy, in particular regarding the role of the bilateral stimulation as an active component of the therapy. The high prevalence of EMDR in clinical practice and the dramatic increase in EMDR research in recent years, with more than 26 randomized controlled trials published to date, highlight the need for a better understanding of its mechanism of action. Methods: We conducted a thorough systematic search of studies published until January 2018, using PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Knowledge and Scopus databases that examined the mechanism of action of EMDR or provided conclusions within the framework of current theoretical models of EMDR functioning. Results: Eighty-seven studies were selected for review and classified into three overarching models; (i) psychological models (ii) psychophysiological models and (iii) neurobiological models. The evidence available from each study was analyzed and discussed. Results demonstrated a reasonable empirical support for the working memory hypothesis and for the physiological changes associated with successful EMDR therapy. Recently, more sophisticated structural and functional neuroimaging studies using high resolution structural and temporal techniques are starting to provide preliminary evidence into the neuronal correlates before, during and after EMDR therapy. Discussion: Despite the increasing number of studies that published in recent years, the research into the mechanisms underlying EMDR therapy is still in its infancy. Studies in well-defined clinical and non-clinical populations, larger sample sizes and tighter methodological control are further needed in order to establish firm conclusions.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 160, 'citationCount': 84, 'journal': {'volume': '9', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Landin-Romero2018HowDE,\n author = {R.

In veterans with PTSD, up to two-thirds retain their diagnosis after psychotherapy and often their disorder is treatment-resistant, which calls for improvement of therapeutic approaches for this population. One of the factors hypothesized to underlie low response in PTSD treatment is high behavioral and cognitive avoidance to traumatic reminders. In the current paper we explore if a combination of personalized virtual reality, multi-sensory input, and walking during exposure can enhance treatment engagement, overcome avoidance, and thereby optimize treatment effectiveness. Virtual reality holds potential to increase presence and in-session attention and to facilitate memory retrieval. Multi-sensory input such as pictures and music can personalize this experience. Evidence for the positive effect of physical activity on fear extinction and associative thinking, as well as embodied cognition theories, provide a rationale for decreased avoidance by literally approaching cues of the traumatic memories. A dual-attention task further facilitates new learning and reconsolidation. These strategies have been combined in an innovative framework for trauma-focused psychotherapy, named Multi-modular Motion-assisted Memory Desensitization and Reconsolidation (3MDR). In this innovative treatment the therapeutic setting is changed from the face-to-face sedentary position to a side-by-side activating context in which patients walk toward trauma-related images in a virtual environment. The framework of 3MDR has been designed as a boost for patients with treatment-resistant PTSD, which is illustrated by three case examples. The intervention is discussed in context of other advancements in treatment for treatment-resistant PTSD. Novel elements of this approach are activation, personalization and empowerment. While developed for veterans with PTSD who do not optimally respond to standardized treatments, this innovative framework holds potential to also be used for other patient populations and earlier stages of treatment for patients with PTSD.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 92, 'citationCount': 39, 'journal': {'volume': '9', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychiatry'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Gelderen2018AnIF,\n author = {M.

Yet, the fear based conceptualization fails to consider the rules of modern combat, the culture of combatants, operational stressors and the moral dimension. Recently there is renewed interest in moral distress and moral injury with a focus on guilt, shame, and anger. Accumulating evidence suggests a link between transgression of moral values and symptoms of guilt and shame, anger, suicidal ideation, and PTSD in military servicemen and veterans. Although proper assessment is still in its infancy, there is a need to better understand how moral decisions can affect the mental health of military personnel at any point during their careers, including postrelease. The authors illustrate this with three clinical case reports. They conclude with a call for attention to the relation between the incurrence of moral injurious distress, and the role of guilt and shame as drivers for chronicity of PTSD. Identifying and addressing these issues can contribute to therapy adherence, facilitate successful progression, and contribute to healing and moral repair and reduce overall symptoms of PTSD.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 55, 'citationCount': 21, 'journal': {'volume': '6', 'pages': '156 - 164', 'name': 'Military Behavioral Health'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Vermetten2018ACO,\n author = {E.

This paper outlines a novel approach that builds on a cognitive-motor interaction in a virtual interactive environment. It is based on the theory of memory reconsolidation and the embodiment of cognition. The framework we envision allows the patient to 'step into the past' by using forward motion as an essential ingredient to augment the impact of exposure to traumatic events. The behavioural response of approaching that is the exact opposite from the avoidance usually applied by patients and the enhancement of divergent thinking are the most prominent hypothesized mechanisms of action. This can contribute to strengthening of personal efficacy and self-reflection that is generated by high emotional engagement, as well as a sense of accomplishment and enhanced recovery as illustrated by a clinical case example. We argue that innovations with personalized virtual reality and motion need to be further investigated and implemented in current therapy settings."", 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 18, 'citationCount': 18, 'journal': {'volume': '9', 'name': 'European Journal of Psychotraumatology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Nijdam2018MovingFI,\n author = {M.

In Canada, the military mental health system has received heavy investment to improve occupational outcomes. We investigated military occupational outcomes of diagnosed mental disorders in a cohort of 30,513 personnel who deployed on the Afghanistan mission. Methods: Cohort members were military personnel who deployed on the Afghanistan mission from 2001 to 2008. Mental disorder diagnoses and their attribution to the Afghanistan mission were ascertained via medical records in a stratified random sample (n = 2014). Career-limiting medical conditions (that is, condition-associated restrictions that reliably lead to medically related attrition) were determined using administrative data. Outcomes were assessed from first Afghanistan-related deployment return. Results: At 5 years of follow-up, the Kaplan-Meier estimated cumulative fraction with career-limiting medical conditions was 40.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 35.5 to 46.4) among individuals with Afghanistan service–related mental disorders (ARMD), 23.6% (CI 15.5 to 31.8) with other mental disorders, and 11.1% (CI 8.9 to 13.3) without mental disorders. The adjusted Cox regression hazard ratios for career-limiting medical condition risk were 4.89 (CI 3.85 to 6.23) among individuals with ARMD and 2.31 (CI 1.48 to 3.60) with other mental disorders, relative to those without mental disorders. Conclusions: Notwithstanding the Canadian military’s mental health system investments, mental disorders (particularly ARMD) still led to a high risk of adverse military occupational outcomes.

The client attends to alternating bilateral visual, auditory or sensory stimulation while confronted with emotionally disturbing material. It is thought that the bilateral stimulation as a specific element of EMDR facilitates accessing and processing of negative material while presumably creating new associative links. We hypothesized that the putatively facilitated access should be reflected in increased activation of the amygdala upon bilateral EMDR stimulation even in healthy subjects. Methods We investigated 22 healthy female university students (mean 23.5 years) with fMRI. Subjects were scanned while confronted with blocks of disgusting and neutral picture stimuli. One third of the blocks was presented without any additional stimulation, one third with bilateral simultaneous auditory stimulation, and one third with bilateral alternating auditory stimulation as used in EMDR. Results Contrasting disgusting vs. neutral picture stimuli confirmed the expected robust effect of amygdala activation for all auditory stimulation conditions. The interaction analysis with the type of auditory stimulation revealed a specific increase in activation of the right amygdala for the bilateral alternating auditory stimulation. Activation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex showed the opposite effect with decreased activation. Conclusions We demonstrate first time evidence for a putative neurobiological basis of the bilateral alternating stimulation as used in the EMDR method. The increase in limbic processing along with decreased frontal activation is in line with theoretical models of how bilateral alternating stimulation could help with therapeutic reintegration of information, and present findings may pave the way for future research on EMDR in the context of posttraumatic stress disorder.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 61, 'citationCount': 41, 'journal': {'volume': '9', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Herkt2014FacilitatingAT,\n author = {Deborah Herkt and V.

Distinguishing between treatment responders vs. non-responders in this population has become an important public health priority. This study was conducted to identify pre-treatment characteristics of U.S. veterans with combat-related PTSD that might contribute to favorable and unfavorable responses to high value treatments for this condition. Method This study focused on 805 patients who completed a VHA PTSD residential program between 2000 and 2007. These patients completed the PTSD Clinical Checklist at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and a four-month follow-up assessment. Latent growth curve analysis (LCGA) was incorporated to determine trajectories of changes in PTSD across these assessments and whether several key clinical concerns for this population were associated with their treatment responses. Study Findings LCGA indicated three distinct trajectories in PTSD outcomes and identified several clinical factors that were prospectively linked with changes in veterans' posttraumatic symptomatology. When compared to a group with high PTSD symptom severity that decreased over the program but relapsed at follow-up (41%), the near half (48.8%) of the sample with an improving trajectory had less combat exposure and superior physical/mental health. However, when compared to a minority (10.2%) with relatively low symptomatology that also remained somewhat stable, patients in the improving group were younger and also reported greater combat exposure, poorer physical/mental health status, and more problems with substance abuse before the start of treatment. Conclusions Findings suggest that veterans are most likely to benefit from residential treatment in an intermediate range of symptoms and risk factors, including PTSD symptom severity, history of combat exposure, and comorbid issues with physical/mental health.

Emotion activation studies in these individuals have shown hyperactivation in emotion-related regions, including the amygdala and insula, and hypoactivation in emotion-regulation regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, few studies have examined patterns of connectivity at rest in individuals with PTSD, a potentially powerful method for illuminating brain network structure.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing the amygdala as a seed region, we measured resting-state brain connectivity using 3 T functional magnetic resonance imaging in returning male veterans with PTSD and combat controls without PTSD.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifteen veterans with PTSD and 14 combat controls enrolled in our study. Compared with controls, veterans with PTSD showed greater positive connectivity between the amygdala and insula, reduced positive connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus, and reduced anticorrelation between the amygdala and dorsal ACC and rostral ACC.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS\nOnly male veterans with combat exposure were tested, thus our findings cannot be generalized to women or to individuals with non-combat related PTSD.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results demonstrate that studies of functional connectivity during resting state can discern aberrant patterns of coupling within emotion circuits and suggest a possible brain basis for emotion-processing and emotion-regulation deficits in individuals with PTSD.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 75, 'citationCount': 317, 'journal': {'volume': '37 4', 'pages': '\n          241-9\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of psychiatry & neuroscience : JPN'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Sripada2012AlteredRA,\n author = {Rebecca K.

Consistent with these revisions, we postulate two models of emotion dysregulation in PTSD in which fear is not the prevailing emotion but is only one of several components implicated in a dysregulated emotional system that also mediates problems regulating anger, guilt, shame, dissociation, and numbing. We discuss whether there is a relationship between fear and other emotion regulation systems that may help further our understanding of PTSD and its underlying neurocircuitry. Two pathways describing the relationship between fear and other emotion regulation systems in PTSD are proposed. The first pathway describes emotion dysregulation as an outcome of fear conditioning through stress sensitization and kindling. The second pathway views emotion dysregulation as a distal vulnerability factor and hypothesizes a further exacerbation of fear and other emotion regulatory problems, including the development of PTSD after exposure to one or several traumatic event(s) later in life.

Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are both widely used in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There has, however, been debate regarding the advantages of one approach over the other. This study sought to determine whether there was any evidence that one treatment was superior to the other. Method. We performed a systematic review of the literature dating from 1989 to 2005 and identified eight publications describing treatment outcomes of EMDR and CBT in active–active comparisons. Seven of these studies were investigated meta-analytically. Results. The superiority of one treatment over the other could not be demonstrated. Trauma-focused CBT and EMDR tend to be equally efficacious. Differences between the two forms of treatment are probably not of clinical significance. While the data indicate that moderator variables influence treatment efficacy, we argue that because of the small number of original studies, little benefit is to be gained from a closer examination of these variables. Further research is needed within the framework of randomized controlled trials. Conclusions. Our results suggest that in the treatment of PTSD, both therapy methods tend to be equally efficacious. We suggest that future research should not restrict its focus to the efficacy, effectiveness and efficiency of these therapy methods but should also attempt to establish which trauma patients are more likely to benefit from one method or the other.

Psychophysiologic and emotional self-report data also were obtained to confirm the intended effects of script-driven imagery.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe PTSD group exhibited rCBF decreases in medial frontal gyrus in the traumatic vs neutral comparison. When this comparison was conducted separately by subgroup, MCVs and FNVs with PTSD exhibited these medial frontal gyrus decreases. Only MCVs exhibited rCBF increases in the left amygdala. However, for both subgroups with PTSD, rCBF changes in medial frontal gyrus were inversely correlated with rCBF changes in the left amygdala and the right amygdala/periamygdaloid cortex. Furthermore, in the traumatic condition, for both subgroups with PTSD, symptom severity was positively related to rCBF in the right amygdala and negatively related to rCBF in medial frontal gyrus.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results suggest a reciprocal relationship between medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala function in PTSD and opposing associations between activity in these regions and symptom severity consistent with current functional neuroanatomic models of this disorder.', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 44, 'citationCount': 759, 'journal': {'volume': '61 2', 'pages': '\n          168-76\n        ', 'name': 'Archives of general psychiatry'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Shin2004RegionalCB,\n author = {L.

Therapeutic adherence is reported a problem in military populations compromising treatment efficacy. Therefore, a new potential supplementary treatment is specially designed for patients with cr-PTSD. This intervention is called Military Motion Memory Desensitization and Reprocessing (3MDR). The treatment incorporates key elements of successful treatments as Virtual Reality Exposure (VRE) and Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing (EMDR) and adds motion to the condition. We aimed at designing a treatment procedure that preserved dual task processing principle, yet introduced new engagement by performing the desensitization during motion by to walking on a treadmill. Moreover, we aimed at exposure to real high-affect pictures of deployment setting. Subjects walk a repetitive cycle while walking and viewing high affect pictures of deployment scenes. Dual task processing was maintained by an oscillating ball. Aspects of presence are adhered to, to maximize possible positive outcome.\n\n\nMETHOD\nTwo veterans with chronic PTSD, received four weekly sessions of 3MDR therapy. The indicator of effectiveness was difference in CAPS (Clinical Administrated PTSD Scale)-score. The treatment was designed on the Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment (CAREN) facility.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe 3MDR treatment did further decrease PTSD symptoms. Patients were highly satisfied about the treatment and had no attention to drop out.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe results of the two cases suggest that the 3MDR treatment is a successful, more additional treatment that goes further into the patients affect where other treatment may stagnate.

(p. vii) This neglect was obvious through casual observation and had been confirmed by a power review of the 1960 volume of the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, which found the mean power to detect medium effect sizes to be .48 (Cohen, 1962). Thus, the chance of obtaining a significant result was about that of tossing a head with a fair coin. I attributed this disregard of power to the inaccessibility of a meager and mathematically difficult literature, beginning with its origin in the work of Neyman and Pearson (1928,1933). The power handbook was supposed to solve the problem. It required no more background than an introductory psychological statistics course that included significance testing. The exposition was verbal-intuitive and carried largely by many worked examples drawn from across the spectrum of behavioral science. In the ensuing two decades, the book has been through revised (1977) and second (1988) editions and has inspired dozens of power and effect-size surveys i n many areas of the social and life sciences (Cohen, 1988, pp. xi-xii). During this period, there has been a spate of articles on power analysis in the social science literature, a baker's dozen of computer programs (re"", 'year': 1992, 'referenceCount': 7, 'citationCount': 32848, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Cohen1992QUANTITATIVEMI,\n author = {Jacob Cohen},\n title = {QUANTITATIVE METHODS IN PSYCHOLOGY A Power Primer},\n year = {1992}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145670758', 'name': 'Jacob Cohen'}]}, {'paperId': '54d43d1f69efdc752f1689af215391606c73cf79', 'title': 'Bmc Medical Research Methodology Content and Communication: How Can Peer Review Provide Helpful Feedback about the Writing?', 'abstract': 'Background: Peer review is assumed to improve the quality of research reports as tools for scientific communication, yet strong evidence that this outcome is obtained consistently has been elusive.

This research examines the effect of multistage waiting on consumers’ emotional responses and emotion regulation strategies. The study is conducted at a virtual restaurant in Second Life, an online simulation website. The results show that there is a significant interaction effect between consumption stage and the type of emotional responses. Although both anxiety and anger are the most intense emotions felt during preprocess waiting, anxiety is the strongest emotion felt during in-process waiting, and anger is the most salient emotional reaction during postprocess waiting. Results also indicate that there is a significant interaction effect between consumption stage and the type of emotion regulation strategies used by consumers. Attentional deployment and reappraisal are dominant emotion regulation strategies used by consumers during preprocess waiting; in addition, reappraisal and attentional deployment are the predominant strategies used during in-process waiting and postprocess waiting, respectively.

The product may have high or low quality, and consumers are heterogeneously informed. The firm chooses a slow or (at a cost) a fast service rate. In equilibrium, informed consumers join the queue if it is below a threshold. The threshold varies with the quality of the good, so an uninformed consumer updates her belief about quality on observing the length of the queue. The strategy of an uninformed consumer has a “hole”: she joins the queue at lengths both below and above the hole, but not at the hole itself. We show that if the prior probability the product has high quality and the proportion of informed consumers are both low, a high-quality firm may select a slower service rate than a low-quality firm. The queue can therefore be a valuable signaling device for a high-quality firm.

A minimum of a master’s level background is preferred (in the opinion of the reviewer). The calculus and matrix algebra, in addition to the advanced terminology, will eliminate any misunderstandings with respect to prerequisites. In the typical format of a collection of contributions from both academicians and practicing electrical and industrial engineers, the continuity is somewhat lacking. This is regrettably often inevitable, due to the difference of writing styles of the authors. The issue is exacerbated by the differences in chapter formats. Some have (often excellent) cases, while others present mostly theory. Much of the book is (not surprisingly) devoted to benchmarking, a topic of extreme familiarity to quality professionals, but only relatively recently introduced to process engineering applications. Benchmarking techniques are delineated based on data-driven and model-driven techniques, and on single input– single output and multiple input–multiple output systems. The general benchmarking coverage culminates with a chapter-long simulation study of a divided wall column distillation process. Other chapters cover economic auditing of control systems, locating sources of disturbances, technical issues with control-system benchmarking, and new research directions. The strongest of these is the economic auditing (in Chap. 2), almost three-fourths of which is devoted to a case study of an oil-production platform. The mix of managerial and engineering methodology and verbiage is optimal. The weakest chapter covers the location of disturbances. Giving short shrift to statistical techniques, the authors ignore much relevant literature in this vital area. The case study is of little use for elucidation; it is too short, and uses a small subset of available methodology. The interested reader is referred to Blanke, Kinnaert, Lunze, and Staroswiecki (2006) for a thorough coverage of locating disturbances in control systems. The final chapter is definitely tailored for the academician interested in cutting-edge process-control scholarship. The proposed new research directions are no doubt relevant, covering new performance metrics, algorithms, and performance analysis. But this largely amounts to straining at gnats, since there is a wealth of literature available on many applicable statistically-based techniques. The most salient is algorithmic process control, and the general integration of statistical process control with engineering process control. Montgomery (2004) offers a superb introduction and coverage of the major corpus in this subject. Overall, the book accomplishes its ostensible purpose. The mix of theory and application will most likely appeal more to the academic reader than the industrial practitioner. The caveat here is that the academician in question needs a thorough background in control theory. This is not an introductory text for interlopers wishing to break into process control-theoretic research. Despite certain shortcomings, the current piece is a nice addition to the process control library. Any interested academic researchers from this area should strongly consider purchasing it. Conversely, most practitioners will find it too pedantic. This is hardly an indictment of this text, as the entire series seems to target the ivory tower.

Methods: The authors conducted a prospective cohort study of 3,718 participants, aged 65 years and older of the Chicago Health and Aging Project. Participants completed a food frequency questionnaire and were administered at least two of three cognitive assessments at baseline, 3-year, and 6-year follow-ups. Cognitive function was measured using the average z-score of four tests: the East Boston Tests of immediate memory and delayed recall, the Mini-Mental State Examination, and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test. Results: The mean cognitive score at baseline for the analyzed cohort was 0.18 (range: –3.5 to 1.6), and the overall mean change in score per year was a decline of 0.04 standardized units. In mixed effects models adjusted for age, sex, race, and education, compared with the rate of cognitive decline among persons in the lowest quintile of vegetable intake (median of 0.9 servings/day), the rate for persons in the fourth quintile (median, 2.8 servings/day) was slower by 0.019 standardized units per year (p = 0.01), a 40% decrease, and by 0.018 standardized units per year (p = 0.02) for the fifth quintile (median, 4.1 servings/day), or a 38% decrease in rates.

VR-based testing and training scenarios that would be difficult, if not impossible, to deliver using conventional neuropsychological methods are now being developed that take advantage of the assets available with VR technology.

This article focuses on specifying the assets that are available with VR for neuropsychological applications along with discussion of current VR-based research that serves to illustrate each asset. VR allows for the precise presentation and control of dynamic multi-sensory 3D stimulus environments, as well as providing advanced methods for recording behavioural responses. This serves as the basis for a diverse set of VR assets for neuropsychological approaches that are detailed in this article.

Do some emotion regulation strategies have more to recommend them than others? According to Gross's (1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271-299) process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners.

J. hanger (1978) remains true today: that much of contemporary psychological research is based on the assumption that people are consciously and systematically processing incoming information in order to construe and interpret their world and to plan and engage in courses of action. As did E. J. hanger, the authors question this assumption. First, they review evidence that the ability to exercise such conscious, intentional control is actually quite limited, so that most of moment-to-mom ent psychological life must occur through nonconscious means if it is to occur at all. The authors then describe the different possible mechanisms that produce automatic, environmental control over these various phenomena and review evidence establishing both the existence of these mechanisms as well as their consequences for judgments, emotions, and behavior. Three major forms of automatic self-regulation are identified: an automatic effect of perception on action, automatic goal pursuit, and a continual automatic evaluation of one's experience. From the accumulating evidence, the authors conclude that these various nonconscious mental systems perform the lion's share of the self-regulatory burden, beneficently keeping the individual grounded in his or her current environment.

Its position as an integrated program within the SAS statistical package makes it an ideal choice for empirical researchers and applied statisticians seeking to do data reduction, management, and analysis within a single statistical package. Because the program was developed from the perspective of a “mixed” statistical model with both random and fixed effects, its syntax and programming logic may appear unfamiliar to users in education and the social and behavioral sciences who tend to express these models as multilevel or hierarchical models. The purpose of this paper is to help users familiar with fitting multilevel models using other statistical packages (e.g., HLM, MLwiN, MIXREG) add SAS PROC MIXED to their array of analytic options. The paper is written as a step-by-step tutorial that shows how to fit the two most common multilevel models: (a) school effects models, designed for data on individuals nested within naturally occurring hierarchies (e.g., students within classes); and (b) individual growth models, designed for exploring longitudinal data (on individuals) over time. The conclusion discusses how these ideas can be extended straighforwardly to the case of three level models.

Developmental Changes in Mental Performance. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 1973, 38 (3, Serial No. 150). A distinction was made between the general level of a person\'s IQ (i.e., the average of his scores across age) and his profile contour (i.e., the developmental pattern of inflections in performance). Most research has focused on the general level of IQ and its correlates; this project systematically investigated patterns of IQ change with data from the Fels Longitudinal Study. Normal middle-class children changed an average of 28.5 IQ points between 21/2 and 17 years of age, and one in seven displayed shifts of more than 40 points. While siblings were more similar in their general level of IQ than unrelated children matched or unmatched for social class, the pattern of developmental changes in childhood IQs or infant DQs was not more similar among siblings than among unrelated children. Twins and triplets scored lower in general level and were less variable in IQ over age than singletons, thus potentially qualifying attempts to generalize IQ change results based upon multiple-birth samples to singletons. Parent-child IQ correlations were higher when the parent was assessed as an adult than if both parent and child were tested at the same chronological ages. A sample of 80 subjects who had relatively complete IQ data (maximum of 17 tests) between 2/2 and 17 years were clustered into five groups which represented different patterns of IQ change over age. These profiles were relatively simple linear or quadratic trends and not random fluctuations about a constant value. Major inflection points occurred at 6 and 10 years of age. It was not obvious that these patterns were simple products of repeated testing or the changing nature of the IQ test. The children in the five IQ profile clusters had parents who were different in the extent to which they attempted to accelerate their child\'s development and the severity of punishments they administered. These parental correlates appeared to hold up even when parental education and IQ as well as the general level of the child\'s IQ were statistically controlled. Given the assumptions prompted by these data, the changing nature of environmental circumstances across the childhood years for a given individual may be as potent in changing IQ as the differences between family environments.

THE LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES IN IQ Several reviews of the literature on the development of mental performance are available (Bayley 1970; Bloom 1964; Pinneau 1961). However, most of the research surveyed involves correlations between mental test performance at several different ages and correlations between personality and social variables with IQ at one age versus another. Such research strategies are valuable and have yielded important results, but they are ""developmental"" only in the sense that data are available at several ages on the same subjects and correlational relationships are derived within and across age periods. Because the correlation coefficient is independent of the means of the distributions, it is possible to obtain high correlational stability of IQ across age but marked fluctuations in the group mean. In short, cross-age correlations reveal little about the nature of absolute changes in level of performance, and they provide only partial information about individual differences in developmental pattern. This project focuses on developmental patterns of change in the level of mental performance as assessed by traditional intelligence tests.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 97, 'citationCount': 6663, 'journal': None, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Mccall2016MONOGRAPHSOT,\n author = {R.

Predictors included demographic, health status, health behavior, affect, knowledge, and subjective norm variables.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBreast symptoms and greater cancer worry increased perceived susceptibility for all three measures. Other predictors varied by dependent measure. Random change, indicating individual variability, was observed for percent risk only.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDespite small model effect sizes, breast symptoms and cancer worry were consistent predictors and may be good targets for messages designed to influence women's perceived susceptibility to breast cancer. Researchers may benefit from using measures of perceived susceptibility with larger response scales, but additional measurement research is needed.

In our second study, we found that the behavioral changes stemming from the virtual environment transferred to subsequent face-to-face interactions. Participants were placed in an immersive virtual environment and were given either shorter or taller avatars. They then interacted with a confederate for about 15 minutes. In addition to causing a behavioral difference within the virtual environment, we found that participants given taller avatars negotiated more aggressively in subsequent face-to-face interactions than participants given shorter avatars.

This paper examines the issue of taxes in virtual world games.

We argue for realization of income, and therefore taxation, at the exchange. We expect that burdensome policies such as requiring game operators to monitor and report taxable activities to the authorities will dissuade game play and likely result in the collapse of these vibrant economies.

A comparison was made of characteristics in groups of people with different preferences for video conferencing in Internet communications and in groups with a preference for virtual interaction with the world and the real one. The respondents were divided into groups based on the results of a questionnaire designed to identify the features of interaction with the virtual space, which was developed by the authors. The study involved 182 respondents (17–32 years), (M=21.1; SD=2.6). As a result, significant differences in psychological characteristics were obtained between the groups. In the group of people who prefer visual communication, in comparison with those who prefer other methods of communication, the use of the Internet for the purpose of mood regulation, improvement of their emotional state, and greater cognitive absorption are more typical. Also in these groups there are differences in the characteristics that reflect awareness. The group of people who prefer virtual interaction with the real world is characterized by more “problematic” use of the Internet, characterized by a preference for online communication, use of the network for the purpose of mood regulation, cognitive absorption, and difficulties in controlling spending time on the network. In terms of subjective wellbeing, this group is characterized by a more pronounced sense of lack of self-development, improvement and self-realization, greater boredom and apathy in relation to life",2022,0,0,{'name': 'RSUH/RGGU Bulletin.

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, interactions between people and pets have been of great help in the regulation of mood and spirit. And in modern society, more and more people regard pets as their emotional sustenance, it can be said that pets are no longer just living in the family as animals, but also a kind of ""loved ones"", so the health and care of pets is particularly important. IoT devices come in the form of wearables for tracking human activity. Now wearables can also be used to monitor animal activity. Novel Pet Collaborative Care (NPCC) uses biosensors and corresponding software to monitor and maintain animal health records, as well as supports remote virtual interactions with pets or virtual pets. The main purpose of this article is to review the latest advances in the field of animal health, and to improve and strengthen them on this basis, with the aim of conducting research and development in the hope of bringing more benefits to pets.",2022,16,0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 2022 5th International Conference on Big Data and Internet of Things'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Xie2022VirtualIO,\n author = {Haoxue Xie and Tengyue Li and S.

This includes services for verticals that demand Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC). Scheduling strongly impacts the communication latency, and 5G NR introduces grant-free scheduling to reduce the latency at the radio level. Grant-free scheduling can use shared resources and the transmission of K replicas per packet to increase the packet delivery ratio and efficiently utilize the spectrum. Previous studies have shown that existing 5G NR grant-free scheduling has limitations to sustain URLLC requirements for aperiodic (or uncertain) and deterministic traffic that is characteristic of verticals such as Industry 4.0 or manufacturing. In this context, this paper proposes and evaluates a novel grant-free scheduling scheme that can efficiently support deterministic and aperiodic uplink traffic. The scheme avoids packet collisions among UEs sharing resources using a priority-based contention resolution process that relies on the transmission of announcement messages in minislots and a local channel sensing process. This study demonstrates that the proposed sensing-based grant-free scheduling scheme outperforms current 5G NR grant-free scheduling implementations, and can support a higher number of UEs with URLLC and deterministic requirements with a considerably lower number of radio resources.', 'year': 2022, 'referenceCount': 23, 'citationCount': 8, 'journal': {'volume': '71', 'pages': '4171-4183', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Lucas-Estañ2022SensingBasedGS,\n author = {M.

Syrian (Mesocricetus auratus) and dwarf (Phodopus sp.) hamsters are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the laboratory setting. However, pet shop-related COVID-19 outbreaks have not been reported. Methods We conducted an investigation of a pet shop-related COVID-19 outbreak due to Delta variant AY.127 involving at least three patients in Hong Kong. We tested samples collected from the patients, environment, and hamsters linked to this outbreak and performed whole genome sequencing analysis of the RT-PCR-positive samples. Results The patients included a pet shop keeper (Patient 1), a female customer of the pet shop (Patient 2), and the husband of Patient 2 (Patient 3). Investigation showed that 17.2% (5/29) and 25.5% (13/51) environmental specimens collected from the pet shop and its related warehouse, respectively, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR. Among euthanized hamsters randomly collected from the storehouse, 3% (3/100) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR and seropositive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody by ELISA. Whole genome analysis showed that although all genomes from the outbreak belonged to the Delta variant AY.127, there were at least 3 nucleotide differences among the genomes from different patients and the hamster cages. Genomic analysis suggests that multiple strains have emerged within the hamster population, and these different strains have likely transmitted to human either via direct contact or via the environment. Conclusions Our study demonstrated probable hamster-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

This study proposes mixed reality (MR)-based human–animal interaction content along with presenting the experimental verification of its effect on the reduction of mental stress. A mental arithmetic task was employed to induce acute mental stress, which was followed by either MR content, in which a participant interacted with virtual animals via gestures and voice commands, or a slide show of animal images. During the experiment, an electrocardiogram (ECG) was continuously recorded with a patch-type, wireless ECG sensor on the chest of the subject, and their psychological state was evaluated with the help of questionnaires after each task. The findings of the study demonstrate that the MR-based interaction with virtual animals significantly reduces mental stress and induces positive emotions.

The popular media portrayal of the human benefits of pet ownership is often biased and overstated, oftentimes creating unrealistic expectations for pet owners. There is evidence that pets can be beneficial to the health and well-being of their owners in certain circumstances; however, there is also evidence that negative or ambivalent relationships between owners and pets can be a detriment to owner well-being, as well as a risk for shelter relinquishment (i.e., surrender) of the pet. Relinquishment due to adverse scenarios like the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may increase rates of shelter euthanasia of adoptable pets. In this study we identify the unique difficulties related to caring for pets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pet owners reported concerns related to pets, humans, and the entire household or family, inclusive of people and pets. Data from this study indicate that strength of the owner’s attachment to their pet, as well as their economic resources, and the characteristics of their household are associated with the types of concerns expressed. We discuss implications for human well-being and pet welfare, and the need to address these issues in order to prevent shelter relinquishment. Abstract Pets may be a positive presence for their owners during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, it is pertinent to identify the hardships associated with pet ownership. We conducted a large-scale survey of U.S. pet owners (n = 2254) in spring and summer 2020 to assess the ways that relationships with pets impacted life during COVID-19. We used thematic analysis to analyze 3671 open-ended responses to three prompts. Reported concerns fell into three major categories: (1) pet-focused (meeting needs of pets; procuring supplies; accessing veterinary care; new and emerging behavioral issues; fate of the pet if owner becomes ill; general safety and well-being), (2) human-focused (issues with working from home; well-being and mental health; balancing responsibilities), and (3) household-focused (disease spread; economic issues). Quantitative analyses showed that the owner’s strength of attachment to their pet, economic resources, and relationship status were associated with the types of concerns expressed. Results from this study indicate that pet owners experienced unique hardships related to changes in everyday life from the COVID-19 pandemic. These hardships should be considered alongside the potential benefits found in other studies in order to manage pet owner expectations, prevent pet relinquishment, and more fully understand multifaceted human-companion animal relationships.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 68, 'citationCount': 119, 'journal': {'volume': '10', 'name': 'Animals : an Open Access Journal from MDPI'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Applebaum2020TheCD,\n author = {Jennifer W.

Accelerometer data, reported as motion intensity index, and GPS location were acquired, transmitted and logged at 1 and 15 minute intervals, respectively. We evaluated the tracker's GPS accuracy (GPSBias as the euclidean distance between the actual and projected tracker location) and variables associated with the tracker’s data transmission capabilities. The results indicate that field trackers had a greater accuracy for remote sensing of GPS locations compared to indoor trackers facing increasing communication interference to acquire satellite signals (GPSBias; 5.20 vs. 17.76 m; P<0.01). Overall, the trackers and deployments appeared to have a comparable GPS accuracy to other tracking devices and systems available in the market. The total data packets that were successfully transmitted were similar between the indoor and field trackers, but the number of data packets that were processed varied between the two deployments (P=0.02). Due to the static deployment of indoor and field trackers, activity data was almost nonexistent for most devices.

This design can solve the problem that the pet owner can’t take care of the pet’s diet for various reasons to a certain extent. The system uses STC89C52RC single chip as the main control chip, which can manually set the feeding times and feeding time of pets, display the data through LCD1602 screen, and use step motor to control the opening and closing of the intelligent pet feeder. A sound prompt module is set up, which uses the buzzer to send out feeding signals during feeding time to attract pets to eat.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 13, 'citationCount': 2, 'journal': {'volume': '1885', 'name': 'Journal of Physics: Conference Series'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Su2021SmartPF,\n author = {Qiaoping Su and Yuan Liu and Hao Wu},\n journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},\n title = {Smart Pet Feeding Device Based on Single Chip Microcomputer},\n volume = {1885},\n year = {2021}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1576521349', 'name': 'Qiaoping Su'}, {'authorId': '2143862280', 'name': 'Yuan Liu'}, {'authorId': '2119798694', 'name': 'Hao Wu'}]}, {'paperId': None, 'title': 'AI in Health and Diagnostics: Computer Science & IT Book Chapter', 'abstract': None, 'year': None, 'referenceCount': None, 'citationCount': None, 'journal': None, 'citationStyles': None, 'authors': []}, {'paperId': None, 'title': 'Diseño de un prototipo wearable para el monitoreo de signos vitales a través de sensores y alerta de anomalías en canes mediante una aplicación móvil', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': None, 'citationCount': None, 'journal': None, 'citationStyles': None, 'authors': []}, {'paperId': None, 'title': 'Smart Pet Insights System Based on IoT and ML', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2022, 'referenceCount': None, 'citationCount': None, 'journal': None, 'citationStyles': None, 'authors': []}, {'paperId': None, 'title': 'INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT), ITS APPLICATION AREA AND COMBINATION WITH GPS', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2022, 'referenceCount': None, 'citationCount': None, 'journal': None, 'citationStyles': None, 'authors': []}]"

Bereavement extends to the anonymity of cyberspace. What role does virtual interaction play in SNS in dealing with the basic human emotion of grief caused by the loss of a beloved person? The analysis laid out in this article provides answers in light of an interdisciplinary perspective on online bereavement. Relevant lines of research are scrutinized. After laying out the theoretical spectrum for the study, hypotheses based on a prior in-depth qualitative content analysis of 179 postings in three different German online bereavement platforms are proposed and scrutinized in a quantitative content analysis (2127 postings from 318 users). Emotion regulation patterns in SNS and similarities as well as differences in online bereavement of children, adolescents and adults are revealed. Large-scale quantitative findings into central motives, patterns, and restorative effects of online shared bereavement in regulating distress, fostering personal empowerment, and engendering meaning are presented.

The recent emergence of online environments as new sites for the temporal, spatial and social expansion of death and mourning (Brubaker and Hayes 2011; Brubaker, Hayes and Dourish 2013) has attracted scholarly interest in digital post-death rituals of mourning and memorialisation as an important social phenomenon (Walter et al. 2011; de Vries and Roberts 2004). While previous studies have been largely based on content analyses of individual MySpace logs and Facebook or discussion forum posts, the present study approaches digital memorial posts as entextualised moments of mourning shared with and for a networked audience (John 2013; Androutsopoulos 2014). The article analyses a corpus of Facebook memorial posts (N=525) as post sequences, wall events and texts, looking at how content on the site is produced, shared and discursively regimented. Based on the analysis, it is suggested that the intextualisation of moments of mourning on Facebook is participatory: it involves users’ selection of moments for public display relating to offline ceremonies of mourning, calendar-important dates or personal updates and contributing to the production of a textured wall in memory of the dead. The textuality of posts is found to rely on an ad hoc blending of formal genres of mourning and vernacular genres of writing dependent on (i) situational (date of posting activity, position in the post sequence) and (ii) extra-textual parameters (gender of poster, relationship with the deceased).

Here we propose such a framework. We first map a ""space"" differentiating classes of interpersonal regulation according to whether an individual uses an interpersonal regulatory episode to alter their own or another person\'s emotion. We then identify 2 types of processes--response-dependent and response-independent--that could support interpersonal regulation.

However, we expected people in high-intensity negative situations to show a relative preference to choose to regulate emotions by disengagement distraction, which blocks emotional processing at an early stage before it gathers force. In three experiments, we created emotional contexts that varied in intensity, using either emotional pictures (Experiments 1 and 2) or unpredictable electric stimulation (Experiment 3). In response to these emotional contexts, participants chose between using either reappraisal or distraction as an emotion-regulation strategy. Results in all experiments supported our hypothesis.

Consistent with claims that emotion systems are loosely coupled, facial expressions of anger and sadness co‐occurred to a moderate degree with the expected appraisal themes, and when this happened, the experience of emotion was stronger. The results for the positive emotions were more complex, but lend credence to the hypothesis that laughter and smiling are distinct.

A study was designed involving qualitative methods of data collection (semi-structured interviews) and analysis (a grounded theory approach). Counsellors were recruited from two cities in Southern Britain (Plymouth and Southampton). Twenty nine (76% response rate) counsellors agreed to participate (Southampton n = 15, Plymouth, n = 14). Semi-structured face-to-face audio-taped interviews elicited information about their perceptions of the appropriateness of general practitioner referrals, counselling strategies and models of bereavement. Analysis indicated that counsellors saw bereavement counselling within a broader agenda of work concerned with loss and relationship management. Many drew on eclectic approaches to bereavement counselling and specific strategies included: facilitating telling of the 'story' of the loss; engaging in active listening and valuing allowing people to talk; establishing a supportive relationship; and enabling the bereaved person to deal with unfinished business and to say 'goodbye'. Counsellors drew on implicit stage/phase models of grief that assumed levels of distress reduced over time.

Criticisms include imprecise definition, failure to represent dynamic processing that is characteristic of grieving, lack of empirical evidence and validation across cultures and historical periods, and a limited focus on intrapersonal processes and on health outcomes. Therefore, a revised model of coping with bereavement, the dual process model, is proposed. This model identifies two types of stressors, loss- and restoration-oriented, and a dynamic, regulatory coping process of oscillation, whereby the grieving individual at times confronts, at other times avoids, the different tasks of grieving. This model proposes that adaptive coping is composed of confrontation--avoidance of loss and restoration stressors. It also argues the need for dosage of grieving, that is, the need to take respite from dealing with either of these stressors, as an integral part of adaptive coping.

Abortion is a sensitive subject in Vietnam, embedded in moral ambiguities concerning youth sexual activities and the ancestral relationship the Vietnamese have with the dead. The aborted fetus is not easily reconciled with the act of ancestor worship and questions arise as to how women express their grief and if a continuing relationship should be sustained with the aborted fetus. Based on twelve months’ ethnographic research, this article contends that some Vietnamese women are continuing a relationship with their aborted fetus within the online memorial Nghia Trang Online as a way of performing ancestor worship and expressing their grief. Through the theory of durable biography and disenfranchised grief, it will be demonstrated that a continuing relationship is formed through communication and online offerings to express grief, ask for forgiveness, share past and present experiences, and through prayer and guidance for the fetus in the otherworld. Introduction ...abortion IS BAD. In our culture people who kill their babies or abort are not treated in fairways. But actually they don't care about what others think. And those people seem unsociable, I think. But they're not worth to be helped. They have to pay for what they did... I find it so messed up about those people who aborted or killed their own babies.

(Vinh2, an English student in the outer districts of Ho Chi Minh City.) Son, how are you? There are many thoughts which are piling on me and making me tired and in a terrible mood. I want to erase everything I am thinking about and start something new. I almost can't stand it anymore. I could not sleep well last night because of these thoughts. There is no one with whom I can share my feelings and it leaves me feeling uncomfortable and lonely. If I could cry I would, but these tears have run dry. I feel as I am at a standstill. Only one thing left, my little son. If only you and I could travel far away. (Communication between a member and fetus on the Vietnamese memorial website Nghia Trang Online; translation3.) The above quotations highlight differing perceptions of abortion in Vietnam. The first is by a young man on the outskirts of Ho Chi Minh City, who feels that those who undergo abortion are morally similar to prostitutes and deserve an obliteration of societal care; an endless round of scorn should await. The second quotation illuminates online communication between a mother and her fetus, in this case a son who would never be born. The tone is reflective and insightful about her recent feelings and powerfully interweaves the living and the dead into a conjoined moment in time: while the future for them cannot be, their online communication remains. At first glance, the words could perhaps be written by any mother, anywhere. There is a familiarity to the longings and sadness examined and yet this communication is intrinsically tied to Vietnamese cosmologies relating to the dead, abortion, technology, and fundamentally to the relationship between those who abort and their unborn offspring. While there is a large body of research concerned with Vietnamese women’s suffering after an abortion (Gammeltoft 2003, 2006, 2010; Nguyen and Liamputtong 2007; Whittaker 2010), how Vietnamese use online memorials to mitigate their grief has not been studied. This article argues that abortion brings about a profound disenfranchised grief for some Vietnamese women. In the online realm however, a durable biography can be created between a mother and her fetus through direct communications and online offerings, which can help to enfranchise her grief. This article will firstly explore research concerned with the continuation of a relationship with the dead through the concept of a durable biography (Walter 1996), which is where individuals make sense of their loss through their own recollections and by conversing with others about the dead, which in turn weaves the deceased meaningfully back into their own life. Conversations and the sharing of experiences and emotions are the key elements in the continued relationships. This article will then examine the concept of disenfranchised grief (Doka 2002) – grief difficult to express in society, and not socially sanctioned – contextualising it within literature on grief following perinatal death more widely. For those who experience pregnancy loss through abortion, miscarriage, stillbirth, or other pregnancy complications4, it FINNISH DEATH STUDIES ASSOCIATION SPRING 2014 www.thanatos-journal.com, ISSN 2242-6280 30(180) 2 To protect anonymity minor details concerning informants, members, and those memorialised on Nghia Trang Online have been changed. Pseudonyms have also been utilized. 3 Vietnamese translated to English has been noted at the end of quotes. All other quotes are verbatim. Translations in this work are the authors. 4 While I am aware that the experiences of abortion and other forms of pregnancy loss may be profoundly different, for the purposes of this article, abortion and other pregnancy loss constitute a broader context of loss around issues embedded in the memorialisation process, including: the disenfranchisement of grief, the lack of long-term support, and the ambiguity of the body and personhood of the fetus. I weave in these other forms of perinatal loss to help compliment the theory more thoroughly as there is limited research concerning abortion and online memorialisation. can be a devastating experience extenuated by disenfranchised grief. This section will demonstrate that in online memorials members can powerfully enfranchise their grief, remember their fetus and connect with others to discuss the deceased and find support. An overview of the project, the methodology utilised, the field site and the informant selection will then be presented. Moving on, attitudes towards abortion and youth sexual practices are analysed in relation to ancestor worship, which is the main relationship Vietnamese have with the dead, to demonstrate significant reasons it is difficult to continue a relationship with an aborted fetus in Vietnam. Many Vietnamese believe that an aborted fetus will “haunt” those responsible and lead to future fertility difficulties. In the face of such a powerful cosmology of the dead, the question becomes, how can Vietnamese women remember their fetus? One possible way, which is the final focus of this article, is through a continued relationship online, as Vietnamese women5 who have undergone an abortion visit the online memorial site Nghia Trang Online (NTO) to create a tomb for their fetus. It will be argued that members use online communication and offerings to engage in ancestor worship, express grief to the fetus, ask for forgiveness, and pray and guide the fetus in the otherworld. Through these interactions, a durable biography (Walter 1996) is created which reincorporates the fetuses back into the world of the living. Continuing Bonds, Durable Biography and Disenfranchised Grief While death ends a physical relationship, research has recognised the important bonds which can continue between the living and the dead (Francis et al. 2005; Howarth 2000; Klass et al. 1996; Valentine 2008; Walter 1996). This was not always so: previous influential psychological, psychoanalytical and psychiatric models of grief and bereavement argued that after death, survivors had to detach themselves from relations with the dead through the untangling of emotional ties (Parkes 1986; see Klass et al. 1996, 5–14 for discussion). Such a paradigm defined the process of grief as being something which needed “to be eventually ‘resolved’ by ‘detaching’, ‘letting go’ and ‘moving on’” to new relationships (Walter 1999, xi). Indeed, Dennis Klass, Phyllis Silverman and Steven Nikman note: The view of grief most accepted in this century holds that for successful mourning to take place the mourner must disengage from the deceased, and let go of the past...(T)o experience a continuing bond with the deceased in the present has been thought of as symptomatic of psychological problems. (Klass et al.1996, 4) Klass et al. (1996) coined the term continuing bonds to express the meaningful ways individuals could continue a relationship with the dead, and were in part responsible for the shift in bereavement literature which argued that the dead could be incorporated back into the life of the living. In the same year as this transformative research into continuing bonds, Tony Walter (1996) proposed the theory of durable biography that also interrogated previous grief and bereavement scholarship. Using personal experiences of loss through the deaths of his father and girlfriend, Walter demonstrated how we shape our understandings of the FINNISH DEATH STUDIES ASSOCIATION SPRING 2014 www.thanatos-journal.com, ISSN 2242-6280 31(180) 5 Vietnamese women were not alone in their online interactions (other informants included the father, friends and sometimes other family), but for the purpose of this article I concentrate on the experiences of women.

In exploring coping, they describe exciting new empirical studies about how people can and do cope with grief, without professional intervention. People do not grieve alone, so chapters on coping present new ways to understand grief at an interpersonal level as well.

Rather, based on five theoretical arguments, we propose that the social sharing of an emotional experience forms an integral part of the emotional processes. A series of six studies investigated different aspects of this hypothesis. Study 1 showed that an overwhelming majority of people reported sharing their emotional experiences and that the memories of these experiences tended to come back spontaneously to their consciousness. No difference was found among emotions. Using a different procedure, Studies 2 and 3 replicated these findings in two different populations. In addition, these studies provided indications that women share their experiences with a wider array of individuals than do men. The first three studies did not find any differences among emotions, but they did not include shame.

However, the existing interventions do not take the emotional aspects of obesity into account. Forty percent of the overweight population is an emotional eater. Emotional eaters gain weight because of poor emotion regulation, not just due to bad eating habits. We aim at developing a personalised virtual coach ‘Denk je zelf!’ providing support for self-regulation of emotions for obese emotional eaters. This paper presents a research study protocol on validating persuasive coaching strategies in emotion regulation, based on Dialectical Behaviour Therapy, ultimately targeting behaviour change.

Despite numerous attempts to promote physical activity and healthy diet, existing interventions do not focus on the common emotional causes of obesity. There is a need for self-management support of this vulnerable target group: emotional eaters. This paper presents the results of the design case study focusing on a holistic design and evaluation of a personalised virtual mHealth coach that provides self-management training ‘Denk je zelf!’ (Dutch for ‘Develop a wise mind and counsel yourself’). The target group are young adults with an emotional eating disorder and who are obese. The contextual inquiry study was conducted to gain insights into the needs and experiences of the target users, including interviews and questionnaires with emotional eaters, patients undergoing obesity treatment, and healthcare practitioners. Personas and the use-case scenario were derived from these results and translated into the new ‘Denk je zelf!’ virtual coach, based on Dialectical Behaviour Therapy and experience sampling measures to capture user experience and emotional state. The main contributions of this paper are: (a) combining holistic eHealth design, behavior chain analysis, and dialectic behaviour therapy in one personalised virtual mHealth coaching application for emotional eaters; (b) applying emotionenriched Personas to guide the design; (c) the results of the initial user evaluation. Preliminary results suggest that the ‘Denk je zelf!’ virtual coach is useful for helping the target group.

Existing lifestyle coaching services offer individual users access to web portals where they can communicate about a growing number of ingredients of everyday life concern: physical activity, nutrition, medication, mood, sleep and sexual health. Mobile technology in combination with body worn sensors support user’s awareness of their physical condition and lifestyle. Despite the large number of available lifestyle interventions and pilot trials, only very few are successfully transferred into the real health care practice. Low usability and lack of transparency on the reliability and trustworthiness of the information are just a few examples of the major barriers for successful implementation.

One of the reasons for this is that the current development of eHealth technology often disregards the interdependencies between technology, human characteristics, and the socioeconomic environment, resulting in technology that has a low impact in health care practices. To overcome the hurdles with eHealth design and implementation, a new, holistic approach to the development of eHealth technologies is needed, one that takes into account the complexity of health care and the rituals and habits of patients and other stakeholders. Objective The aim of this viewpoint paper is to improve the uptake and impact of eHealth technologies by advocating a holistic approach toward their development and eventual integration in the health sector. Methods To identify the potential and limitations of current eHealth frameworks (1999–2009), we carried out a literature search in the following electronic databases: PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Knowledge, PiCarta, and Google Scholar. Of the 60 papers that were identified, 44 were selected for full review. We excluded those papers that did not describe hands-on guidelines or quality criteria for the design, implementation, and evaluation of eHealth technologies (28 papers). From the results retrieved, we identified 16 eHealth frameworks that matched the inclusion criteria. The outcomes were used to posit strategies and principles for a holistic approach toward the development of eHealth technologies; these principles underpin our holistic eHealth framework. Results A total of 16 frameworks qualified for a final analysis, based on their theoretical backgrounds and visions on eHealth, and the strategies and conditions for the research and development of eHealth technologies. Despite their potential, the relationship between the visions on eHealth, proposed strategies, and research methods is obscure, perhaps due to a rather conceptual approach that focuses on the rationale behind the frameworks rather than on practical guidelines. In addition, the Web 2.0 technologies that call for a more stakeholder-driven approach are beyond the scope of current frameworks. To overcome these limitations, we composed a holistic framework based on a participatory development approach, persuasive design techniques, and business modeling. Conclusions To demonstrate the impact of eHealth technologies more effectively, a fresh way of thinking is required about how technology can be used to innovate health care. It also requires new concepts and instruments to develop and implement technologies in practice. The proposed framework serves as an evidence-based roadmap.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 120, 'citationCount': 904, 'journal': {'volume': '13', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Gemert-Pijnen2011AHF,\n author = {J.

A literature search from 2008 to March 2010 was conducted. Studies were eligible for inclusion if: participants were adults with a body mass index ≤ 25, at least one study arm involved an internet-based intervention and the primary aims were weight loss or maintenance. Eight additional studies over the eighteen included in the previous review met the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted on sample characteristics, attrition, weight loss, duration of treatment and maintenance of weight loss. Effect sizes (Hedges g) and relative 95% confidence intervals were calculated for all two-way comparisons within each study. No attempt was made to pool the data in a meta-analysis because of the great heterogeneity of designs among studies. An examination of effect sizes show that the higher significant effects pertain studies that found a superiority of behavioral internet-based programs enhanced by features such as tailored feedback on self-monitoring of weight, eating and activity over education only internet-based interventions. However, control groups are very different among studies and this heterogeneity probably accounts for much of the variance in effect sizes. Hence, questions still remain as to the effectiveness of web-based interventions in achieving weight loss or maintenance. Implications for further research include using a “real” control group in order to make meta-analysis possible and developing multi-factorial design in order to separate components of interventions and identify which of them or patterns of them are keys to success.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 44, 'citationCount': 124, 'journal': {'volume': '7', 'pages': '19 - 28', 'name': 'Clinical Practice and Epidemiology in Mental Health : CP & EMH'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Manzoni2011InternetBasedBI,\n author = {G.

The primary purpose of this article is to address a variety of potential mechanisms of change that may be associated with those aspects of DBT that are unique to the treatment and its theoretical underpinnings. Based on the biosocial theory of BPD, many of these mechanisms can be distilled down to the following process: the reduction of ineffective action tendencies linked with dysregulated emotions. Specifically we address the following interventions and associated mechanisms of change: mindfulness, validation, targeting and chain analysis, and dialectics. Patient change in BPD is conceptualized primarily as helping the patient to engage in functional, life-enhancing behavior, even when intense emotions are present.

Previous research has suggested that missing out on emotional experiences may affect mental health and impact cognitive abilities. In recent years, there has been growing research interest in designing non-pharmacological interventions to improve the health-related quality of life of older adults. With virtual reality offering endless opportunities for health support, we must consider how virtual reality can be sensitively designed to provide comfortable, enriching out-world experiences to older adults to enhance their emotional regulation. Thirty older adults living with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia participated in the study. Affect and emotional behavior were measured. The usability and the sense of presence were also assessed. Finally, we assessed the virtual reality experiences based on physiological responses and eye-tracking data. The results indicated that virtual reality can positively enhance the mental health of this population by eliciting a positive affective state and enhancing their emotional regulation. Overall, this paper raises awareness of the role of virtual reality in emotion elicitation, regulation, and expression and enhances our understanding of the use of virtual reality by older adults living with mild cognitive impairments or mild dementia.",2023,61,2,"{'name': 'International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health', 'volume': '20'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Matsangidou2023AffectiveOE,\n author = {M.

Despite the importance of supporting the mental well-being of people with dementia, in many cases, it remains undertreated. In recent years, there has been growing research interest in designing non-pharmacological interventions aiming to improve the Health-Related Quality of Life for people with dementia within long-term care. With computer technology and especially Virtual Reality offering endless opportunities for mental support, we must consider how Virtual Reality for people with dementia can be sensitively designed to provide comfortable, enriching out-world experiences.

Twenty-one older adults in a senior living community and a family member (who participated in the VR with the older adult from a distance) engaged in a baseline telephone call, followed by three weekly VR sessions. The VR was associated with improvements in older adultsʻ affect and stress, relationship with their family member, and overall quality of life, compared to baseline. Family membersʻ negative affect, depressive symptoms, and caregiver burden also decreased and their mental health improved after using the VR, compared to baseline. Using the VR, however, did not change their relationship with the older adult. In addition, older adults and family members who experienced the VR sessions as more socially engaging reported better psychological and relational well-being, with older adults also experiencing greater improvements in overall quality of life. Finally, preliminary results suggest that older adults with dementia and their family members might benefit even more from using the VR than older adults with MCI and their family members.', 'year': 2022, 'referenceCount': 57, 'citationCount': 6, 'journal': {'volume': '38', 'pages': '1904 - 1915', 'name': 'Health Communication'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Afifi2022UsingVR,\n author = {T.

Virtual reality (VR) reminiscence was reported to improve anxiety, apathy, and cognitive function immediately after intervention in individuals at residential aged care facilities. However, its effect on elderly patients with dementia and how long this effect could last remain unknown. Objective The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of immersive VR reminiscence in people with dementia both immediately after and 3-6 months after intervention. Methods A pilot study was conducted in 2 dementia care units. VR reminiscence therapy sessions were conducted twice per week for a 3-month period. Cognitive function, global status, depressive symptoms, and caregiver burden were assessed before and immediately after VR intervention in 20 participants. Subsequently, 7 participants were reassessed 3-6 months after the VR intervention. Wilcoxon sign-rank test was used for statistical comparisons of the changes. Results There were no significant changes in cognitive function, global status, and caregiver burden immediately after the VR intervention, but there was a significant reduction in depressive symptoms (P=.008). Moreover, compared with the cognitive function immediately after VR, it kept declining 3-6 months after. Conclusions Immersive VR reminiscence can improve mood and preserve cognitive function in elderly patients with dementia during the period of the intervention. Studies using a control group and comparing the use of VR with traditional forms of reminiscence should be conducted in the future to confirm and expand on these findings.', 'year': 2022, 'referenceCount': 27, 'citationCount': 8, 'journal': {'volume': '10', 'name': 'JMIR Serious Games'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Huang2022TheLE,\n author = {Ling-Chun Huang and Yuan-Han Yang},\n journal = {JMIR Serious Games},\n title = {The Long-term Effects of Immersive Virtual Reality Reminiscence in People With Dementia: Longitudinal Observational Study},\n volume = {10},\n year = {2022}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5978619', 'name': 'Ling-Chun Huang'}, {'authorId': '145142380', 'name': 'Yuan-Han Yang'}]}, {'paperId': 'd0a50e5807072c09375d6ddb36a1dfed75606a13', 'title': 'Using a Nature-Based Virtual Reality Environment for Improving Mood States and Cognitive Engagement in Older Adults: A Mixed-Method Feasibility Study', 'abstract': 'Abstract Background and Objectives Exposure to nature and nature-based imagery has been shown to improve mood states and stave off cognitive decline in older adults. Even “micro-doses” of natural scenery can provide beneficial effects in situations where more extensive interactions with nature are not feasible. In the current study, we evaluated the use of virtual reality (VR) for delivering interactive nature-based content with the goal of prompting active engagement and improving mood states in older adults. Research Design and Methods The researchers developed a novel VR environment that combined 360-degree videos of natural areas and botanical gardens with interactive digital features that allowed users to engage with aspects of the environment. We recruited 50 older adults to try out this VR environment and measured changes in mood states and attitudes toward VR from before versus after the sessions. We controlled for variables such as age, education level, and exposure to nature in everyday life, and we looked for differences in responses to the VR among participants with cognitive impairments (CIs) versus without, and participants with physical disabilities versus without. Results The findings indicated significant improvements in “good” mood and “calm” mood dimensions after exposure to the VR, as well as improvements in attitudes toward the technology. These positive outcomes were significantly greater for participants with physical disabilities compared to those without disabilities. No differences were found in the responses of participants with CIs versus those without. Exit interviews provided a variety of helpful suggestions about ways to improve the VR equipment design and content to meet the needs of an older adult population. Discussion and Implications The study demonstrates that VR can provide a cost-effective, noninvasive, and nonpharmaceutical approach for improving the lives of older adults in both clinical and recreational settings, particularly when real-world access to nature is limited.', 'year': 2022, 'referenceCount': 125, 'citationCount': 12, 'journal': {'volume': '6', 'name': 'Innovation in Aging'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Kalantari2022UsingAN,\n author = {S.

Participants of this study found the VR experiences to be enjoyable and were relaxed and happy while viewing them. Most participants were attentive or focused while viewing the VR experiences, and the experiences were found to be a source of reminiscence for some of the participants. Participants related well to others around them during a majority of the experiences and the VR experiences were a point of conversation between the staff and the participants.

Methods: A PubMed search and critical review were performed relating to studies of MCI, depression, anxiety, and apathy. Results: MCI patients have a high prevalence of depression/anxiety/apathy; furthermore, patients with MCI and concomitant depression/anxiety/apathy have more pronounced cognitive deficits and progress more often to dementia than MCI patients without depression/anxiety/apathy.

There is a lack of effective pharmacological treatments for apathy, and nonpharmacological interventions are a preferred first-line approach to treatment. Virtual reality (VR) using head-mounted displays (HMDs) is being successfully used in exposure- and distraction-based therapies; however, there is limited research on using HMDs for symptoms of neurological disorders. Objective This feasibility study aimed to assess whether VR using HMDs could be used to deliver tailored reminiscence therapy and examine the willingness to participate, response rates to measures, time taken to create tailored content, and technical problems. In addition, this study aimed to explore the immediate effects between verbal fluency and apathy after exposure to VR. Methods A mixed methods study was conducted in a sample of older adults residing in aged care, and 17 participants were recruited. Apathy was measured using the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), and verbal fluency was used as a proxy measure of improvements in apathy and debriefing interviews to assess feedback from participants. Side effects that can occur from using HMDs were also measured. Results We recruited participants from a high socioeconomic status setting with a high education level, and the participation rate was 85% (17/20); most responses to measures were positive. Access to a wide range of freely available content and the absence of technical difficulties made the delivery of a VR reminiscence intervention highly feasible. Participants had improved semantic scores (t14=−3.27; P=.006) but not phonemic fluency scores (t14=0.55; P=.59) immediately after the intervention. Those with higher levels of apathy demonstrated the greatest cognitive improvements after a VR reminiscence experience, which was indicated by a strong positive relationship between the AES and semantic verbal fluency change scores postminus pre-VR (r=0.719; 95% CI 0.327 to 0.900; P=.003). All participants enjoyed the experience despite 35% (6/17) of participants experiencing temporary side effects. Conclusions This study provides initial evidence that it is feasible to use VR with HMDs for therapy to treat symptoms of apathy in older adults in residential aged care. However, there is a need to closely monitor the side effects of HMD use in older adults. Further research is needed using an active control group to compare the use of VR with traditional forms of reminiscence therapy.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 104, 'citationCount': 34, 'journal': {'volume': '22', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Saredakis2019UsingVR,\n author = {Dimitrios Saredakis and H.

A mixed-methods study was conducted with 13 residents of varying cognitive capacity in a residential aged care facility (RACF) operated by a not-for-profit organization in Brisbane, Australia. Residents participated in one facilitated VR session, either as a group or individual session. Residents' mood and apathy were measured by the Observed Emotion Rating Scale (OERS) and the Person-Environment Apathy Rating Scale. Residents also completed a structured interview to provide their feedback after the VR session. In addition, four RACF staff members were interviewed about their experience of using the VR in residents and the ongoing feasibility. The experience of VR administered by a researcher and leisure and lifestyle coordinator as a leisure activity, significantly reduced apathy in residents (Z\u2009=\u2009-2.818, p\u2009=\u20090.005) through observations of increased facial expression, eye contact, physical engagement, verbal tone, and expression. The study did not find a VR impact on the OERS measures; no significant increase in fear/anxiety was observed. Reminiscence was clearly observed in six of the nine residents with the ability to verbally communicate. VR was found not to be helpful in residents during episodes of acute neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms. This study suggested feasibility of using fully immersive VR delivered by mobile phone technologies.

The purpose of this paper is to review the emerging VR applications developed for the evaluation and treatment of patients with neurological diseases. We start by discussing the impact of novel VR tasks that encourage and facilitate the patient's empowerment and involvement in the rehabilitation process. Then, a systematic review was carried out on six well-known electronic libraries using the terms: “Virtual Reality AND Neurorehabilitation,” or “Head Mounted Display AND Neurorehabilitation.” This review focused on fully-immersive VR systems for which 12 relevant studies published in the time span of the last five years (from 2014 to 2019) were identified. Overall, this review paper examined the use of VR in certain neurological conditions such as dementia, stroke, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's, and multiple sclerosis. Most of the studies reveal positive results suggesting that VR is a feasible and effective tool in the treatment of neurological disorders. In addition, the finding of this systematic literature review suggested that low-cost, immersive VR technologies can prove to be effective for clinical rehabilitation in healthcare, and home-based setting with practical implications and uses. The development of VR technologies in recent years has resulted in more accessible and affordable solutions that can still provide promising results.

Research design and methods: Eight people with dementia and 16 caregivers were recruited in January and February 2018 from a UK hospital specialising in progressive neurological conditions. A mixed methods design measured affect and behaviour using the Observed Emotion Rating Scale, Overt Aggression Scale-Modified for Neurorehabilitation and St Andrew’s Sexual Behaviour Assessment. Thematic analysis was conducted following semi-structured interviews. Caregivers who worked at the hospital supported people with dementia throughout the process and were interviewed for their views on Head Mounted Display-Virtual Reality (HMD-VR) use with people with dementia. Results HMD-VR was tried and accepted by people with dementia. Participants viewed HMD-VR positively as a ‘change in environment’ and would use it again. People with dementia experienced more pleasure during and after HMD-VR compared to before exposure, as well as increased alertness after. Three core themes emerged: ‘Virtual Reality Experiences’, ‘Impact of Virtual Reality’ and ‘Experiences within the Virtual Environment’. Caregivers discussed preconceptions about virtual reality use and how these changed.

This technology has the potential to provide mental stimulation, a connection to autobiographical memory through reminiscence, and enhanced quality of life (QoL) to people living with dementia (PLWD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this mini-review, we examine the available evidence from studies reporting on the potential benefits of virtual and augmented reality to provide enjoyable, leisurely activities that may promote QoL and psychological well-being and facilitate social interaction. In total, 10 studies of varying study designs and durations (5 min to 6 months) using virtual (n = 9) and augmented reality (n = 1) were examined in PLWD (n = 6) and MCI (n= 3), in addition to 1 study that included participants with both conditions. Overall, the virtual experiences were enjoyed by the participants, improved their mood and apathy, and were preferred when compared with nonvirtual experiences. However, small sample sizes and variations in study design limit the generalizability of the results. Nevertheless, the use of virtual and augmented reality technology for PLWD and MCI is a novel and emerging method which may provide cognitive stimulation and improve well-being. Future research should explore the potential application of this technology to promote social interaction in both the community and aged care settings.

In 2010, more than 35 million people worldwide were estimated to be living with dementia. Some people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will progress to dementia but others remain stable or recover full function. There is great interest in finding good predictors of dementia in people with MCI. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is the best-known and the most often used short screening tool for providing an overall measure of cognitive impairment in clinical, research and community settings.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo determine the diagnostic accuracy of the MMSE at various thresholds for detecting individuals with baseline MCI who would clinically convert to dementia in general, Alzheimer's disease dementia or other forms of dementia at follow-up.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched ALOIS (Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Specialized Register of diagnostic and intervention studies (inception to May 2014); MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to May 2014); EMBASE (OvidSP) (1980 to May 2014); BIOSIS (Web of Science) (inception to May 2014); Web of Science Core Collection, including the Conference Proceedings Citation Index (ISI Web of Science) (inception to May 2014); PsycINFO (OvidSP) (inception to May 2014), and LILACS (BIREME) (1982 to May 2014). We also searched specialized sources of diagnostic test accuracy studies and reviews, most recently in May 2014: MEDION (Universities of Maastricht and Leuven, www.mediondatabase.nl), DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, via the Cochrane Library), HTA Database (Health Technology Assessment Database, via the Cochrane Library), and ARIF (University of Birmingham, UK, www.arif.bham.ac.uk). No language or date restrictions were applied to the electronic searches and methodological filters were not used as a method to restrict the search overall so as to maximize sensitivity. We also checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews, tracked citations in Scopus and Science Citation Index, used searches of known relevant studies in PubMed to track related articles, and contacted research groups conducting work on MMSE for dementia diagnosis to try to locate possibly relevant but unpublished data.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe considered longitudinal studies in which results of the MMSE administered to MCI participants at baseline were obtained and the reference standard was obtained by follow-up over time. We included participants recruited and clinically classified as individuals with MCI under Petersen and revised Petersen criteria, Matthews criteria, or a Clinical Dementia Rating = 0.5. We used acceptable and commonly used reference standards for dementia in general, Alzheimer's dementia, Lewy body dementia, vascular dementia and frontotemporal dementia.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nWe screened all titles generated by the electronic database searches. Two review authors independently assessed the abstracts of all potentially relevant studies. We assessed the identified full papers for eligibility and extracted data to create two by two tables for dementia in general and other dementias. Two authors independently performed quality assessment using the QUADAS-2 tool. Due to high heterogeneity and scarcity of data, we derived estimates of sensitivity at fixed values of specificity from the model we fitted to produce the summary receiver operating characteristic curve.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nIn this review, we included 11 heterogeneous studies with a total number of 1569 MCI patients followed for conversion to dementia. Four studies assessed the role of baseline scores of the MMSE in conversion from MCI to all-cause dementia and eight studies assessed this test in conversion from MCI to Alzheimer´s disease dementia. Only one study provided information about the MMSE and conversion from MCI to vascular dementia. For conversion from MCI to dementia in general, the accuracy of baseline MMSE scores ranged from sensitivities of 23% to 76% and specificities from 40% to 94%. In relationship to conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's disease dementia, the accuracy of baseline MMSE scores ranged from sensitivities of 27% to 89% and specificities from 32% to 90%. Only one study provided information about conversion from MCI to vascular dementia, presenting a sensitivity of 36% and a specificity of 80% with an incidence of vascular dementia of 6.2%. Although we had planned to explore possible sources of heterogeneity, this was not undertaken due to the scarcity of studies included in our analysis.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nOur review did not find evidence supporting a substantial role of MMSE as a stand-alone single-administration test in the identification of MCI patients who could develop dementia. Clinicians could prefer to request additional and extensive tests to be sure about the management of these patients. An important aspect to assess in future updates is if conversion to dementia from MCI stages could be predicted better by MMSE changes over time instead of single measurements. It is also important to assess if a set of tests, rather than an isolated one, may be more successful in predicting conversion from MCI to dementia."", 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 135, 'citationCount': 583, 'journal': {'volume': '3', 'pages': '\n          CD010783\n        ', 'name': 'The Cochrane database of systematic reviews'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': ""@Article{Arévalo-Rodriguez2015MiniMentalSE,\n author = {I.

The person is seen as attempting to manage and cope with their difficulties, through a variety of coping mechanisms. Some are able to seek to maximize their cognitive capacities, and there are a number of strategies now available to assist in this process. However, the emotional aspects merit increased attention, with more awareness needed of the range of powerful emotions that may be present, and of the possibility of therapeutic interventions to alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Many of the difficult behaviours seen in dementia may be understood more fully with an appreciation of their emotional underpinning, in feelings of anger, fear, insecurity and hopelessness. The interaction between caregiver strain and challenging behaviour also merits further exploration. The person-centred approach has many implications for practice, as well as for research. The perspective of the person with dementia, and outcomes reflecting that perspective, must be represented in research studies in dementia care.

Five emotional VR scenes were designed in our study and each scene had five emotion segments; happiness, fear, anxiety, sadness, and disgust. When participants experienced the VR scenes, their pupil dilation and the brightness in the headset were captured. We found that both the negative and positive emotion segments produced pupil dilation in the VR environments. We also explored the effect of showing heart beat cues to the users, and if this could cause difference in pupil dilation. In our study, three different heart beat cues were shown to users using a combination of three channels; haptic, audio, and visual. The results showed that the haptic-visual cue caused the most significant pupil dilation change from the baseline.

Previous research has suggested that emotional regulation (ER) and emotional dysregulation (ED) may be factors which are correlated with symptom severity and maintenance of TR-PTSD. This embedded mixed-methods pilot study (n=9) sought to explore the impact of 3MDR on ER and ED of MMs and Veterans. Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale (DERS-18) data was collected at baseline, prior to each session, and at 1 week, 1 month and 3 months post-intervention and analyzed using a Wilcoxon signed-ranks test. Qualitative data collected from sessions, debriefs, and follow-up interviews were transcribed and descriptively analyzed. Results demonstrated statistically significant decreases in DERS-18 scores from pre-intervention to post-intervention at each timepoint. Qualitatively, participants perceived improvements in ER within specified DERS-18 domains. We describe how 3MDR’s unique and novel approach may address ED through cognitive-motor stimulation, narration, divergent thinking, reappraisal of aversive stimuli, dual-task processing, and reconsolidation of traumatic memories.

Although psychotherapy can reduce symptoms, some military members may experience treatment-resistant PTSD. Multimodular motion-assisted memory desensitization and reconsolidation (3MDR) has been introduced as a virtual reality (VR) intervention for military members with PTSD related to military service. The 3MDR intervention incorporates exposure therapy, psychotherapy, eye movement desensitization and reconsolidation, VR, supportive counselling, and treadmill walking. Objective The objective of this study is to investigate whether 3MDR reduces PTSD symptoms among military members with combat-related treatment-resistant PTSD (TR-PTSD); examine the technology acceptance and usability of the Computer Assisted Rehabilitation ENvironment (CAREN) and 3MDR interventions by Canadian Armed Forces service members (CAF-SMs), veterans, 3MDR clinicians, and operators; and evaluate the impact on clinicians and operators of delivering 3MDR. Methods This is a mixed-methods waitlist controlled crossover design randomized controlled trial. Participants include both CAF-SMs and veterans (N=40) aged 18-60 years with combat-related TR-PTSD (unsuccessful experience of at least 2 evidence-based trauma treatments). Participants will also include clinicians and operators (N=12) who have been trained in 3MDR and subsequently utilized this intervention with patients. CAF-SMs and veterans will receive 6 weekly 90-minute 3MDR sessions. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months postintervention. Quantitative data collection will include multiomic biomarkers (ie, blood and salivary proteomic and genomic profiles of neuroendocrine, immune-inflammatory mediators, and microRNA), eye tracking, electroencephalography, and physiological data. Data from outcome measures will capture self-reported symptoms of PTSD, moral injury, resilience, and technology acceptance and usability. Qualitative data will be collected from audiovisual recordings of 3MDR sessions and semistructured interviews. Data analysis will include univariate and multivariate approaches, and thematic analysis of treatment sessions and interviews. Machine learning analysis will be included to develop models for the prediction of diagnosis, symptom severity, and treatment outcomes. Results This study commenced in April 2019 and is planned to conclude in April 2021. Study results will guide the further evolution and utilization of 3MDR for military members with TR-PTSD and will have utility in treating other trauma-affected populations. Conclusions The goal of this study is to utilize qualitative and quantitative primary and secondary outcomes to provide evidence for the effectiveness and feasibility of 3MDR for treating CAF-SMs and veterans with combat-related TR-PTSD. The results will inform a full-scale clinical trial and stimulate development and adaptation of the protocol to mobile VR apps in supervised clinical settings. This study will add to knowledge of the clinical effectiveness of 3MDR, and provide the first comprehensive analysis of biomarkers, technology acceptance and usability, moral injury, resilience, and the experience of clinicians and operators delivering 3MDR.

Several protective and risk factors have been identified in civilians and veterans to explain why some individuals develop PTSD and others do not. However, no research has confirmed the relationship between emotion regulation and PTSD in deployed German Armed Forces service members after a foreign assignment. Previous studies have identified some protective factors, such as social support, social acknowledgment, specific personal values, and posttraumatic growth, as well as risk factors, like moral injury and emotion regulation. Thus, the aim of the present study is to confirm the relationship between emotion regulation and PTSD and to test for factors that are associated with higher severity of PTSD symptoms in such a sample. Methods A post-hoc secondary analysis was conducted on data collected in a randomized controlled trial. Participants (N = 72) were male active and former military service members that have returned from deployment and were recruited from the German Armed Forces. These participants were separated into two groups according to PTSD diagnosis based on the results of a structured diagnostic interview. Data from evaluation questionnaires administered upon entry into the study were subjected to a cross-sectional analysis. The measures included the severity of PTSD symptoms, clusters of PTSD symptoms, clinical measures, and several measures assessing PTSD-related constructs. Analyses included the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, X2 tests for nominal data, Mann-Whitney U-tests for non-parametric data, and a mediation analysis. Results The results of the mediation analysis revealed that difficulties in emotion regulation were significantly associated with the severity of PTSD symptoms, which was mediated by social acknowledgment and experimental avoidance but not by moral injury. The analyses showed that the severity of PTSD symptoms and all clusters of PTSD symptoms were significantly associated with most of the measured constructs in expectable directions. Participants in the PTSD group showed significantly higher mean scores on questionnaires measuring constructs that have been associated with PTSD, like emotion regulation and moral injury. They also showed lower mean scores in questionnaires for social support and social acknowledgment as a victim or survivor than participants in the non-PTSD group. Conclusion The present results show that difficulties in emotion regulation are directly associated with the severity of PTSD symptoms in service members of the German Armed Forces. This association is mediated by social acknowledgment and experimental avoidance, but not by moral injury. Thus, future studies should investigate these potentially crucial factors for better understanding of the development and maintenance of PTSD in service members of the German Armed Forces after deployment to create possible treatment adaptions.

In addition, it is yet to be known how EP‐ and ER‐related areas are interactively linked to regulatory behavior, and whether this interaction is disrupted in MDD. In our study, regional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and whole‐brain functional connectivity (FC) of meta‐analytic‐driven EP‐ and ER‐related areas were compared between 32 healthy controls (HC) and 20 MDD patients. Then, we aimed to investigate whether the EP‐related areas can predict the ER‐related areas and regulatory behavior in both groups. Finally, the brain–behavior correlations between the EP‐ and ER‐related areas and depression severity were assessed. We found that: (a) affective areas are regionally and/or connectively disturbed in MDD; (b) EP‐ER interaction seems to be disrupted in MDD; overburden of emotional reactivity in amygdala may inversely affect cognitive control processes in prefrontal cortices, which leads to diminished regulatory actions.

Early abuse and neglect can deregulate the child's developing neurobiological system by reducing its resistance to stressful events, leading to later problems of emotional regulation. Children who have been subjected to physical or emotional abuse tend to pay more attention to signs that contain anger and are hypersensitive to threat. Scar hypothesis and the theories of behavioural sensitization or electrophysiological kindling suggest that emotional traumas may leave traces that persist even after remission of depression, and render individuals vulnerable to the onset of new episodes, even under the influence of only moderate psychosocial stress. Unfavorable early social experiences, such as emotional abuse or institutionalization can affect the structure and function of the prefrontal cortex. Exposure to repeated emotional stressors, even in the absence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnoses, has been shown to produce increased synapse formation and dendritic growth in basolateral amygdala, dendritic retraction in the hippocampus, and anxiety-like behavior against specific triggers, such as phobia of open spaces. During the narration of an emotionally traumatic event, there is activation of the limbic system, the right amygdale, the orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate gyrus. In addition, there is an activation of the anterior insula, which records the physical impact of negative emotions, and the anterior and medial temporal cortex, which are involved in negative emotions. Neuroimaging studies in PTSD patients have found hypoactivity in the frontal lobe, anterior cingulate and thalamic areas, indicating the effects of PTSD on executive function, attention and cognitive, memorial, and affective and somatosensory integration. One of the most replicated findings in studies involving PTSD patients is the decreased activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Studies have also found a negative correlation between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and amygdala activation. A recent meta-analysis revealed structural brain abnormalities associated with PTSD and emotional trauma and suggested that global brain volume reductions can distinguish PTSD from major depression. Neuroimaging studies of successful eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) treatment have consistently shown that patients exhibited increased frontal lobe activation. Moving beyond diagnostic boundaries, focusing on the causal interplay between specific traumatic processes and using standardized measures, are useful directions for future research in memory, emotion and emotional trauma."", 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 83, 'citationCount': 28, 'journal': {'volume': '31 2', 'pages': '\n          162-171\n        ', 'name': 'Psychiatrike = Psychiatriki'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Giotakos2020NeurobiologyOE,\n author = {O.

A novel virtual reality and motion-assisted exposure therapy, called 3MDR, provides treatment in an immersive, personalized and activating context. Objective: To study the efficacy of 3MDR for veterans with treatment-resistant PTSD. Method: In a randomized controlled trial (n = 43) 3MDR was compared to a non-specific treatment component control group. Primary outcome was clinician-rated PTSD symptoms at baseline, after 3MDR, and at the 12-week and 16-week follow-up (primary end point). Intention-to-treat analyses of covariance and mixed models were applied to study differences between groups at the end point and over the course of intervention, controlling for baseline scores. Results: The decrease in PTSD symptom severity from baseline to end point was significantly greater for 3MDR as compared to the control group, with a large effect size (F[1, 37] = 6.43, p = 0.016, d = 0.83). No significant between-group difference was detected in the course of PTSD symptoms during treatment when including all time points. The dropout rate was low (7%), and 45% of the patients in the 3MDR group improved clinically. The number needed to treat was 2.86. Conclusions: In this trial, 3MDR significantly decreased PTSD symptoms in veterans with, on average, a history of 4 unsuccessful treatments. The low dropout rate may be indicative of high engagement. However, a lack of significant differences on secondary outcomes limits conclusions that can be drawn on its efficacy and underlines the need for larger phase III trials.

Since its formal introduction in the DSM‐III in 1980, knowledge has grown significantly regarding its causes, maintaining mechanisms and treatments. Despite this increased understanding, however, the actual definition of the disorder remains controversial. The DSM‐5 and ICD‐11 define the disorder differently, reflecting disagreements in the field about whether the construct of PTSD should encompass a broad array of psychological manifestations that arise after trauma or should be focused more specifically on trauma memory phenomena. This controversy over clarifying the phenotype of PTSD has limited the capacity to identify biomarkers and specific mechanisms of traumatic stress. This review provides an up‐to‐date outline of the current definitions of PTSD, its known prevalence and risk factors, the main models to explain the disorder, and evidence‐supported treatments. A major conclusion is that, although trauma‐focused cognitive behavior therapy is the best‐validated treatment for PTSD, it has stagnated over recent decades, and only two‐thirds of PTSD patients respond adequately to this intervention. Moreover, most people with PTSD do not access evidence‐based treatment, and this situation is much worse in low‐ and middle‐income countries.

As with other psychotherapies, the effectiveness of EMDR contrasts with a limited knowledge of its underlying mechanism of action. In its relatively short life as a therapeutic option, EMDR has not been without controversy, in particular regarding the role of the bilateral stimulation as an active component of the therapy. The high prevalence of EMDR in clinical practice and the dramatic increase in EMDR research in recent years, with more than 26 randomized controlled trials published to date, highlight the need for a better understanding of its mechanism of action. Methods: We conducted a thorough systematic search of studies published until January 2018, using PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Knowledge and Scopus databases that examined the mechanism of action of EMDR or provided conclusions within the framework of current theoretical models of EMDR functioning. Results: Eighty-seven studies were selected for review and classified into three overarching models; (i) psychological models (ii) psychophysiological models and (iii) neurobiological models. The evidence available from each study was analyzed and discussed. Results demonstrated a reasonable empirical support for the working memory hypothesis and for the physiological changes associated with successful EMDR therapy. Recently, more sophisticated structural and functional neuroimaging studies using high resolution structural and temporal techniques are starting to provide preliminary evidence into the neuronal correlates before, during and after EMDR therapy. Discussion: Despite the increasing number of studies that published in recent years, the research into the mechanisms underlying EMDR therapy is still in its infancy.

In veterans with PTSD, up to two-thirds retain their diagnosis after psychotherapy and often their disorder is treatment-resistant, which calls for improvement of therapeutic approaches for this population. One of the factors hypothesized to underlie low response in PTSD treatment is high behavioral and cognitive avoidance to traumatic reminders. In the current paper we explore if a combination of personalized virtual reality, multi-sensory input, and walking during exposure can enhance treatment engagement, overcome avoidance, and thereby optimize treatment effectiveness. Virtual reality holds potential to increase presence and in-session attention and to facilitate memory retrieval. Multi-sensory input such as pictures and music can personalize this experience. Evidence for the positive effect of physical activity on fear extinction and associative thinking, as well as embodied cognition theories, provide a rationale for decreased avoidance by literally approaching cues of the traumatic memories. A dual-attention task further facilitates new learning and reconsolidation. These strategies have been combined in an innovative framework for trauma-focused psychotherapy, named Multi-modular Motion-assisted Memory Desensitization and Reconsolidation (3MDR). In this innovative treatment the therapeutic setting is changed from the face-to-face sedentary position to a side-by-side activating context in which patients walk toward trauma-related images in a virtual environment. The framework of 3MDR has been designed as a boost for patients with treatment-resistant PTSD, which is illustrated by three case examples. The intervention is discussed in context of other advancements in treatment for treatment-resistant PTSD. Novel elements of this approach are activation, personalization and empowerment. While developed for veterans with PTSD who do not optimally respond to standardized treatments, this innovative framework holds potential to also be used for other patient populations and earlier stages of treatment for patients with PTSD.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 92, 'citationCount': 39, 'journal': {'volume': '9', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychiatry'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Gelderen2018AnIF,\n author = {M.

Yet, the fear based conceptualization fails to consider the rules of modern combat, the culture of combatants, operational stressors and the moral dimension. Recently there is renewed interest in moral distress and moral injury with a focus on guilt, shame, and anger. Accumulating evidence suggests a link between transgression of moral values and symptoms of guilt and shame, anger, suicidal ideation, and PTSD in military servicemen and veterans. Although proper assessment is still in its infancy, there is a need to better understand how moral decisions can affect the mental health of military personnel at any point during their careers, including postrelease. The authors illustrate this with three clinical case reports. They conclude with a call for attention to the relation between the incurrence of moral injurious distress, and the role of guilt and shame as drivers for chronicity of PTSD. Identifying and addressing these issues can contribute to therapy adherence, facilitate successful progression, and contribute to healing and moral repair and reduce overall symptoms of PTSD.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 55, 'citationCount': 21, 'journal': {'volume': '6', 'pages': '156 - 164', 'name': 'Military Behavioral Health'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Vermetten2018ACO,\n author = {E.

This paper outlines a novel approach that builds on a cognitive-motor interaction in a virtual interactive environment. It is based on the theory of memory reconsolidation and the embodiment of cognition. The framework we envision allows the patient to 'step into the past' by using forward motion as an essential ingredient to augment the impact of exposure to traumatic events. The behavioural response of approaching that is the exact opposite from the avoidance usually applied by patients and the enhancement of divergent thinking are the most prominent hypothesized mechanisms of action. This can contribute to strengthening of personal efficacy and self-reflection that is generated by high emotional engagement, as well as a sense of accomplishment and enhanced recovery as illustrated by a clinical case example. We argue that innovations with personalized virtual reality and motion need to be further investigated and implemented in current therapy settings."", 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 18, 'citationCount': 18, 'journal': {'volume': '9', 'name': 'European Journal of Psychotraumatology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Nijdam2018MovingFI,\n author = {M.

In Canada, the military mental health system has received heavy investment to improve occupational outcomes. We investigated military occupational outcomes of diagnosed mental disorders in a cohort of 30,513 personnel who deployed on the Afghanistan mission. Methods: Cohort members were military personnel who deployed on the Afghanistan mission from 2001 to 2008. Mental disorder diagnoses and their attribution to the Afghanistan mission were ascertained via medical records in a stratified random sample (n = 2014). Career-limiting medical conditions (that is, condition-associated restrictions that reliably lead to medically related attrition) were determined using administrative data. Outcomes were assessed from first Afghanistan-related deployment return. Results: At 5 years of follow-up, the Kaplan-Meier estimated cumulative fraction with career-limiting medical conditions was 40.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 35.5 to 46.4) among individuals with Afghanistan service–related mental disorders (ARMD), 23.6% (CI 15.5 to 31.8) with other mental disorders, and 11.1% (CI 8.9 to 13.3) without mental disorders. The adjusted Cox regression hazard ratios for career-limiting medical condition risk were 4.89 (CI 3.85 to 6.23) among individuals with ARMD and 2.31 (CI 1.48 to 3.60) with other mental disorders, relative to those without mental disorders. Conclusions: Notwithstanding the Canadian military’s mental health system investments, mental disorders (particularly ARMD) still led to a high risk of adverse military occupational outcomes. Such investments have intrinsic value but may not translate into reduced medically related attrition without improvements in prevention and treatment effectiveness.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 30, 'citationCount': 21, 'journal': {'volume': '61', 'pages': '348 - 357', 'name': 'The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Boulos2016MilitaryOO,\n author = {D.

The client attends to alternating bilateral visual, auditory or sensory stimulation while confronted with emotionally disturbing material. It is thought that the bilateral stimulation as a specific element of EMDR facilitates accessing and processing of negative material while presumably creating new associative links. We hypothesized that the putatively facilitated access should be reflected in increased activation of the amygdala upon bilateral EMDR stimulation even in healthy subjects. Methods We investigated 22 healthy female university students (mean 23.5 years) with fMRI. Subjects were scanned while confronted with blocks of disgusting and neutral picture stimuli. One third of the blocks was presented without any additional stimulation, one third with bilateral simultaneous auditory stimulation, and one third with bilateral alternating auditory stimulation as used in EMDR. Results Contrasting disgusting vs. neutral picture stimuli confirmed the expected robust effect of amygdala activation for all auditory stimulation conditions. The interaction analysis with the type of auditory stimulation revealed a specific increase in activation of the right amygdala for the bilateral alternating auditory stimulation. Activation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex showed the opposite effect with decreased activation. Conclusions We demonstrate first time evidence for a putative neurobiological basis of the bilateral alternating stimulation as used in the EMDR method. The increase in limbic processing along with decreased frontal activation is in line with theoretical models of how bilateral alternating stimulation could help with therapeutic reintegration of information, and present findings may pave the way for future research on EMDR in the context of posttraumatic stress disorder.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 61, 'citationCount': 41, 'journal': {'volume': '9', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Herkt2014FacilitatingAT,\n author = {Deborah Herkt and V.

Distinguishing between treatment responders vs. non-responders in this population has become an important public health priority. This study was conducted to identify pre-treatment characteristics of U.S. veterans with combat-related PTSD that might contribute to favorable and unfavorable responses to high value treatments for this condition. Method This study focused on 805 patients who completed a VHA PTSD residential program between 2000 and 2007. These patients completed the PTSD Clinical Checklist at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and a four-month follow-up assessment. Latent growth curve analysis (LCGA) was incorporated to determine trajectories of changes in PTSD across these assessments and whether several key clinical concerns for this population were associated with their treatment responses. Study Findings LCGA indicated three distinct trajectories in PTSD outcomes and identified several clinical factors that were prospectively linked with changes in veterans' posttraumatic symptomatology. When compared to a group with high PTSD symptom severity that decreased over the program but relapsed at follow-up (41%), the near half (48.8%) of the sample with an improving trajectory had less combat exposure and superior physical/mental health. However, when compared to a minority (10.2%) with relatively low symptomatology that also remained somewhat stable, patients in the improving group were younger and also reported greater combat exposure, poorer physical/mental health status, and more problems with substance abuse before the start of treatment. Conclusions Findings suggest that veterans are most likely to benefit from residential treatment in an intermediate range of symptoms and risk factors, including PTSD symptom severity, history of combat exposure, and comorbid issues with physical/mental health. Addressing these factors in an integrative manner could help to optimize the effectiveness of treatments of combat-related PTSD in many cases."", 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 78, 'citationCount': 49, 'journal': {'volume': '9', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Currier2014ResidentialTF,\n author = {J.

Emotion activation studies in these individuals have shown hyperactivation in emotion-related regions, including the amygdala and insula, and hypoactivation in emotion-regulation regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, few studies have examined patterns of connectivity at rest in individuals with PTSD, a potentially powerful method for illuminating brain network structure.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing the amygdala as a seed region, we measured resting-state brain connectivity using 3 T functional magnetic resonance imaging in returning male veterans with PTSD and combat controls without PTSD.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifteen veterans with PTSD and 14 combat controls enrolled in our study. Compared with controls, veterans with PTSD showed greater positive connectivity between the amygdala and insula, reduced positive connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus, and reduced anticorrelation between the amygdala and dorsal ACC and rostral ACC.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS\nOnly male veterans with combat exposure were tested, thus our findings cannot be generalized to women or to individuals with non-combat related PTSD.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results demonstrate that studies of functional connectivity during resting state can discern aberrant patterns of coupling within emotion circuits and suggest a possible brain basis for emotion-processing and emotion-regulation deficits in individuals with PTSD.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 75, 'citationCount': 317, 'journal': {'volume': '37 4', 'pages': '\n          241-9\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of psychiatry & neuroscience : JPN'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Sripada2012AlteredRA,\n author = {Rebecca K.

We discuss whether there is a relationship between fear and other emotion regulation systems that may help further our understanding of PTSD and its underlying neurocircuitry. Two pathways describing the relationship between fear and other emotion regulation systems in PTSD are proposed. The first pathway describes emotion dysregulation as an outcome of fear conditioning through stress sensitization and kindling. The second pathway views emotion dysregulation as a distal vulnerability factor and hypothesizes a further exacerbation of fear and other emotion regulatory problems, including the development of PTSD after exposure to one or several traumatic event(s) later in life.

Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are both widely used in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There has, however, been debate regarding the advantages of one approach over the other. This study sought to determine whether there was any evidence that one treatment was superior to the other. Method. We performed a systematic review of the literature dating from 1989 to 2005 and identified eight publications describing treatment outcomes of EMDR and CBT in active–active comparisons. Seven of these studies were investigated meta-analytically. Results. The superiority of one treatment over the other could not be demonstrated. Trauma-focused CBT and EMDR tend to be equally efficacious. Differences between the two forms of treatment are probably not of clinical significance. While the data indicate that moderator variables influence treatment efficacy, we argue that because of the small number of original studies, little benefit is to be gained from a closer examination of these variables. Further research is needed within the framework of randomized controlled trials. Conclusions. Our results suggest that in the treatment of PTSD, both therapy methods tend to be equally efficacious. We suggest that future research should not restrict its focus to the efficacy, effectiveness and efficiency of these therapy methods but should also attempt to establish which trauma patients are more likely to benefit from one method or the other.

Psychophysiologic and emotional self-report data also were obtained to confirm the intended effects of script-driven imagery.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe PTSD group exhibited rCBF decreases in medial frontal gyrus in the traumatic vs neutral comparison. When this comparison was conducted separately by subgroup, MCVs and FNVs with PTSD exhibited these medial frontal gyrus decreases. Only MCVs exhibited rCBF increases in the left amygdala. However, for both subgroups with PTSD, rCBF changes in medial frontal gyrus were inversely correlated with rCBF changes in the left amygdala and the right amygdala/periamygdaloid cortex. Furthermore, in the traumatic condition, for both subgroups with PTSD, symptom severity was positively related to rCBF in the right amygdala and negatively related to rCBF in medial frontal gyrus.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results suggest a reciprocal relationship between medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala function in PTSD and opposing associations between activity in these regions and symptom severity consistent with current functional neuroanatomic models of this disorder.', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 44, 'citationCount': 759, 'journal': {'volume': '61 2', 'pages': '\n          168-76\n        ', 'name': 'Archives of general psychiatry'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Shin2004RegionalCB,\n author = {L.

Therapeutic adherence is reported a problem in military populations compromising treatment efficacy. Therefore, a new potential supplementary treatment is specially designed for patients with cr-PTSD. This intervention is called Military Motion Memory Desensitization and Reprocessing (3MDR). The treatment incorporates key elements of successful treatments as Virtual Reality Exposure (VRE) and Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing (EMDR) and adds motion to the condition. We aimed at designing a treatment procedure that preserved dual task processing principle, yet introduced new engagement by performing the desensitization during motion by to walking on a treadmill. Moreover, we aimed at exposure to real high-affect pictures of deployment setting. Subjects walk a repetitive cycle while walking and viewing high affect pictures of deployment scenes. Dual task processing was maintained by an oscillating ball. Aspects of presence are adhered to, to maximize possible positive outcome.\n\n\nMETHOD\nTwo veterans with chronic PTSD, received four weekly sessions of 3MDR therapy. The indicator of effectiveness was difference in CAPS (Clinical Administrated PTSD Scale)-score. The treatment was designed on the Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment (CAREN) facility.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe 3MDR treatment did further decrease PTSD symptoms. Patients were highly satisfied about the treatment and had no attention to drop out.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe results of the two cases suggest that the 3MDR treatment is a successful, more additional treatment that goes further into the patients affect where other treatment may stagnate. The presence was highly appreciated.

A comprehensive four-year longitudinal study spanning from 2018 to 2021 investigated a model of self-efficacy that include discernment, resourcefulness, diverse options, creative thinking, fairness, emotional regulation, and culture. Our sample consisted of participants surveyed before the GVT experience (n=584) and after the GVT experience (n=399), representing learners from six countries. The results of the study unveiled several key findings: (a) self-efficacy was influenced by multiple factors, with fairness emerging as a more significant contributor after the GVT experience; (b) irrespective of the GVT experience, learners from individualist countries demonstrated higher levels of self-efficacy compared to those from collectivist countries, suggesting that cultural dimensions play a role in shaping learners' self-efficacy, regardless of their participation in GVT activities; and (c) when controlling for the pandemic, there was a specific impact to the learner as it related to self-efficacy and the experience of global learning. These insights contribute to our understanding of the intricate dynamics of self-efficacy in the realm of virtual exchange and provide valuable implications for educators, organizations, and policymakers seeking to enhance learner outcomes in global virtual team settings.",2023,93,0,{'name': 'International Journal on Studies in Education'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Pearl2023UnlockingTP,\n author = {Mona Pearl and Kelly Tzoumis and Bridget Lockie},\n booktitle = {International Journal of Studies in Education},\n journal = {International Journal on Studies in Education},\n title = {Unlocking the Potential of Global Learning: The Impact of Virtual Exchange Programs on Self-Efficacy},\n year = {2023}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '73003960', 'name': 'Mona Pearl'}, {'authorId': '21492726', 'name': 'Kelly Tzoumis'}, {'authorId': '2222679897', 'name': 'Bridget Lockie'}]","[{'paperId': 'ed4b47e2eeac7f3ef0ab15953a10cf2ea55023d6', 'title': 'The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Primary, Secondary, and K-12 Education: A Systematic Review', 'abstract': 'The study aims to provide a cohesive overview and summary of the COVID-19 pandemic impact on primary education, secondary education, and K-12 education through an extensive literature review.

As we continue to pursue online program offerings beyond the pandemic period, it is important to address students’ sense of isolation and their efforts to stay engaged in learning.\xa0 This study aims to identify the extent to which the challenges students faced in a virtual learning environment during the pandemic, have impacted their intention to effectively use the online learning method. Respondents for this study consist of students in one private university. This study employs a quantitative method. A set of questionnaire survey was administered online with a return of 367 respondents. The research data was analyzed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) and Smart PLS. The findings gathered indicate that self-regulation, students' sense of isolation and lack of learning resources significantly impact their intention to effectively use e-learning methods.

Drawing on conservation of resources theory and self‐regulation theory, we examined the mechanism and process underlying individuals' performance in GVTs in this specific situation. We posit that the local severity of the pandemic has a negative effect on individuals' performance in GVTs and that self‐regulation functions as a coping mechanism in times of pandemic‐related ambient stress, reducing its negative effect on performance. We suggest that three cultural value orientations, that is, uncertainty avoidance, collectivism, and long‐term orientation, explain different levels of self‐regulation, which in turn moderates the relationship between the local severity of the pandemic and individual performance in GVTs. Based on a sample of 2727 individuals from 31 countries participating in an international business consulting project during the early stage of the unfolding pandemic, we show that (a) the local severity of the pandemic had a negative effect on individuals' performance, (b) the negative effect of the pandemic on performance is weaker for individuals with high self‐regulation, and (c) uncertainty avoidance and long‐term orientation are positively associated with self‐regulation, which mediates the moderating relationship between the cultural value orientations and the relationship between the COVID‐19 pandemic and individual performance in GVTs."", 'year': 2022, 'referenceCount': 158, 'citationCount': 6, 'journal': {'volume': '44', 'pages': '102 - 131', 'name': 'Journal of Organizational Behavior'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Schlaegel2022COVID19AI,\n author = {Christopher Schlaegel and M.

Experiment 1B (N = 50) assessed the efficacy of distraction and reappraisal strategies in aversive conditions with low and high intensity. Contrary to our prediction, reappraisal was more effective than distraction, independent of the intensity of the aversive conditions. In Experiment 2 (N = 113), we tested the interactive relationship between perceived intensity levels and depression on the relative effectiveness of reappraisal and distraction. We found that while in perceived low-intensity situations the advantage of distraction over reappraisal increased as depressive symptoms increased, no such relationship was found in high-intensity situations. The results suggest that while all individuals prefer to apply reappraisal in both low- and high-intensity conditions, for those with high level of depressive symptoms, such a preference acts against their own interests.

However, few studies have specifically examined how motivation and external environmental factors (e.g., institutions) affect medical students’ performance with large-scale data sets. The roles of self-efficacy and learning engagement in the mechanisms that govern how motivation affects academic performance are still unclear. Objective: This study aims to advance a comprehensive understanding about the relationships between medical students’ motivation, self-efficacy, learning engagement, and academic performance in a nationwide survey, taking students’ demographic factors and sociocultural environments into consideration. Design: We collected data from 1930 medical students in China. We probed the relations between studying variables. We then performed structural equation model (SEM) analysis to examine the mediating roles of self-efficacy and learning engagement on the relationship between motivation and academic performance. We further carried out multiple-group SEM analyses to compare differences between males and females, and between students in key universities and colleges (KUCs) and non-key universities and colleges (NKUCs). Results: Medical students in KUCs demonstrated significantly higher intrinsic motivation, better academic performance and lower extrinsic motivation than those in NKUCs. Male students reported higher intrinsic motivation but surprisingly lower academic performance than females. The total effect of intrinsic motivation on academic performance was larger than that of extrinsic motivation. There were significant indirect effects of either intrinsic or extrinsic motivation on academic performance through learning engagement. Besides, both intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation predicted self-efficacy; however, the direct effect of self-efficacy on academic performance was not significant. Conclusions: This study provided researchers with a holistic picture of students’ types of motivation in relation to academic performance. Findings from this study can help in rethinking the role of self-efficacy in medicine, in finding more effective interventions for promoting medical students’ levels of motivation, and in developing motivation-related counselling methods for different groups of medical students.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 31, 'citationCount': 127, 'journal': {'volume': '25', 'name': 'Medical Education Online'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Wu2020MedicalSM,\n author = {Hongbin Wu and Shan Li and Juan Zheng and Jianru Guo},\n journal = {Medical Education Online},\n title = {Medical students’ motivation and academic performance: the mediating roles of self-efficacy and learning engagement},\n volume = {25},\n year = {2020}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '49498788', 'name': 'Hongbin Wu'}, {'authorId': '1739185543', 'name': 'Shan Li'}, {'authorId': '48510527', 'name': 'Juan Zheng'}, {'authorId': '1566647899', 'name': 'Jianru Guo'}]}, {'paperId': '5aa9cd9cd054298bb4a9e837b19046ef43c078b9', 'title': 'The Correlation Between Critical and Creative Thinking Skills on Cognitive Learning Results', 'abstract': ""Purpose : A correlational research was conducted to reveal the correlation between critical thinking and creative thinking skills on students' cognitive learning results in inquiry learning strategy and to reveal the contribution of critical thinking skills and creative thinking skills to students’ cognitive learning results.

Most studies have sought to clarify the role of self-injury as a coping strategy, and while this research is central to the understanding of those who self-injure, factors that influence coping behaviors may affect treatment and prevention efforts. This study examined the mediational effect of coping self-efficacy (CSE) on the relationship between emotion dysregulation and frequency of NSSI. The sample included 187 self-injuring university students between the ages of 18–26, and was predominately female (76.5%) and Caucasian (67.4%). Participants completed the Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale, the Coping Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Non-Suicidal Self-Injury Assessment Tool. Results indicated that CSE did not act as a mediator between difficulty with ER and frequency of NSSI. However, greater difficulty with ER predicted increased frequency in NSSI. These results highlight the importance of ER skills in the prevention and cessation of NSSI. It is imperative that mental health practitioners working with young adults focus on actual skill building rather than increasing CSE, as increased ER skills are likely to both increase CSE and reduce NSSI.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 65, 'citationCount': 18, 'journal': {'volume': '5', 'name': 'Cogent Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Midkiff2018TheRO,\n author = {Melanie Midkiff and C.

We propose that an independent process involves studying cultural traditions and systems, which imparts foreign concepts that enable unconventional solutions. If so, advantages on unconventionality problems should be associated with experiences studying of another culture, such as typically occurs in study-abroad programs. The link should be especially strong for individuals with personalities high in openness and in contexts featuring choice. A survey of MBA students' past foreign stays found that greater study abroad was associated with more unconventional solutions and provided mixed support for the two moderating conditions. Study 2 experimentally varied the presence of choice before putting participants through a simulated foreign internship featuring study and situations demanding adaptation. Subsequent solutions to a product design problem were more conventionally Asian and (marginally) less conventionally American in the choice condition, and these effects were mediated by the amount of foreign knowledge acquisition. Implications for selecting employees and developing employees on the basis of foreign experiences are discussed.

A latent growth curve approach was used to investigate level and stability of emotional stability and self–efficacy in managing negative emotions and in expressing positive emotions. We found that initial levels of emotional stability and self–efficacy beliefs are highly correlated. In accordance with the posited hypothesis, the growth rate of perceived self–efficacy in managing negative emotions predicted the growth rate of emotional stability, whereas the opposite path was not significant. The growth rates of perceived self–efficacy in expressing positive emotions and emotional stability were not related to each other. Taken together, these findings point to self–efficacy beliefs as instrumental to the change of traits. Practical implications of results are discussed, highlighting the role of social cognitive theory in supplying the proper strategies to design effective interventions to enable people to make the best use of their potentials.

Such an approach consists of specifying the components that characterize emotion regulation and then systematically evaluating deviations within each of these components and their underlying dimensions. Initial guidelines for how to combine such dimensions and components in order to capture substantial and meaningful contextual influences are presented.

Wisdom and Management in the Knowledge Economy explains why unwise managerial practice can happen in a world characterized by an excess of information and knowledge. Drawing on Aristotle’s idea of practical wisdom, the book develops a theory of social practice wisdom that addresses important social psychological and sociological dynamics that underpin wise management and organizations. As well as providing a detailed theory of social practice wisdom, this book considers practical issues in organizational communication, behavior, culture, change and knowledge as well as in HRM, leadership, ethics, strategy, international business, business education, and wisdom research.

This paper extends current understanding about the concept of self-efficacy in the context of computer software. We describe how two broad types of computer self-efficacy beliefs, general self-efficacy and task-specific self-efficacy, are constructed across different computing tasks by suggesting that initial general CSE beliefs will strongly predict subsequentspecific CSE beliefs. The theorized causal relationships illustrate the malleability and development of CSE beliefs over time, within a training environment where individuals are progressively provided with greater opportunity for hands-on experience and practice with different software. Consistent with the findings of prior research, judgments of self-efficacy then serve as key antecedents of the perceived cognitive effort (ease of use) associated with technology usage. Further, we theorize that self-efficacy judgments in the task domain of computing are strongly influenced by the extent to which individuals believe that they are personally innovative with respect to information technology. Panel data were collected using a longitudinal research design within a training context where 186 subjects were taught two software packages in a sequential manner over a 14-week period.

Abstract: Adolescence is a critical stage of growth and development in life-cycle of an individual. Because of the importance of developmental success during this stage, with implications of adult development and positive mental health, the current study aims to examine the predictor roles of cognitive flexibility and self-efficacy on mental well-being of Turkish adolescents. Moreover, as the association between cognitive flexibility and self-efficacy are considered to have crucial effects on adolescents’ mental well-being, it was supposed that academic, social and emotional selfefficacy could mediate the relation between cognitive flexibility and mental well-being. The participants of the research are comprised of 192 females (49%) and 200 males (51%), a total of 392 high school students who were attending four different high schools enrolled in grades 9–12, in a city of Turkey. Cognitive Flexibility Inventory, The Self-Efficacy Scale for Children and Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale were applied in data collection. The results showed that cognitive flexibility positively correlated with sub-dimensions of self-efficacy and mental well-being. Also, sub-dimensions of self-efficacy positively correlated with mental wellbeing. Findings from the mediational model indicated that academic, social and emotional self-efficacy served to mediate the relationship between cognitive flexibility and mental well-being.

On the one hand, the cross-national literature provides an impressively consistent picture of the predicted systematic differences; on the other hand, the nature of the evidence is inconclusive. Cross-national evidence is insufficient to argue for a causal process, and comparative data cannot specify if effects are due to both individualism and collectivism, only individualism, only collectivism, or other factors (including other aspects of culture). To address these issues, the authors conducted a meta-analysis of the individualism and collectivism priming literature, with follow-up moderator analyses. Effect sizes were moderate for relationality and cognition, small for self-concept and values, robust across priming methods and dependent variables, and consistent in direction and size with cross-national effects. Results lend support to a situated model of culture in which cross-national differences are not static but dynamically consistent due to the chronic and moment-to-moment salience of individualism and collectivism.

One cannot be all things, which would require mastery of every realm of human life. People differ in the areas in which they cultivate their efficacy and in the levels to which they develop it even within their given pursuits. For example, a business executive may have a high sense of organizational efficacy but low parenting efficacy. Thus, the efficacy belief system is not a global trait but a differentiated set of self-beliefs linked to distinct realms of functioning. Multidomain measures reveal the patterning and degree of generality of people\'s sense of personal efficacy. There is no all-purpose measure of perceived self-efficacy. The "" one measure fits all "" approach usually has limited explanatory and predictive value because most of the items in an all-purpose test may have little or no relevance to the domain of functioning. Moreover, in an effort to serve all purposes, items in such a measure are usually cast in general terms divorced from the situational demands and circumstances. This leaves much ambiguity about exactly what is being measured or the level of task and situational demands that must be managed. Scales of perceived self-CHAPTER 14 Note that this date is incorrect. The book was published in 2006. 308 A. BANDURA efficacy must be tailored to the particular domain of functioning that is the object of interest. Although efficacy beliefs are multifaceted, social cognitive theory identifies several conditions under which they may co-vary even across distinct domains of functioning (Bandura, 1997). When different spheres of activity are governed by similar sub-skills there is some inter-domain relation in perceived efficacy. Proficient performance is partly guided by higher-order self-regulatory skills. These include generic skills for diagnosing task demands, constructing and evaluating alternative courses of action, setting proximal goals to guide one\'s efforts, and creating self-incentives to sustain engagement in taxing activities and to manage stress and debilitating intrusive thoughts. Generic self-management strategies developed in one realm of activity are serviceable in other activity domains with resulting co-variation in perceived efficacy among them. Co-development is still another correlative process. Even if different activity domains are not sub-served by common sub-skills, the same perceived efficacy can occur if development of competencies is socially structured so that skills in dissimilar domains are developed together. For example, students are likely to develop similarly high perceived self-efficacy …', 'year': 2006, 'referenceCount': 20, 'citationCount': 4592, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Bandura2006GUIDEFC,\n author = {A.

Our study also investigates the potential of online technology skills transfer programs to impact the entrepreneurship of participants in a developing economy by raising their self-efficacy scores and by integrating their learning with the entrepreneurial context of small businesses. A total of 60 vocational Mexican students and 115 Mexican small entrepreneurs were identified as participants in this study. 30 of these students and 15 of these Mexican companies participated in the online technology skills transfer part of the study which involved two online courses in database design and development as well as implementation while being integrated with the real-life context of a small entrepreneurial venture. The remaining 30 students were used as a control group to assess their self-efficacy scores. The remaining 100 small entrepreneurs were used as a sample to assess the level of self-efficacy in Mexican entrepreneurs.

HR and LR subjects received noncontingent success feedback, failure feedback, or no feedback on a task that ostensibly assessed ""therapeutic abilities."" Subjects were subsequently tested on insolvable puzzles (Experiment 1) or on solvable anagrams (Experiment 2). According to Kanfer and Hagerman\'s (1981) self-regulation model, self-regulatory activities are evoked primarily in situations in which subjects are faced with repeated failure. Hence we predicted that individual differences in self-control would influence performance on the insolvable puzzles and not anagram performance after exposure to noncontingent failure. This prediction was confirmed: Only the performance of LR subjects on the insolvable puzzles was debilitated by the helplessness induction, whereas HR and LR subjects showed equal helplessness-induced deficits on the anagrams. The latter finding was interpreted in terms of the learned-helplessness model without the mediating effects of self-regulatory processes. As predicted from the self-control model, HR subjects more frequently checked statements indicating positive self-evaluations and task-oriented thoughts and less frequently checked negative self-evaluations than did LR subjects during exposure to uncontrollability in both experiments. We concluded that the self-control model accounts best for subjects\' self-reactions during exposure to uncontrollability or failure, whereas the learned-helplessness model accounts for the generalization of helplessness from uncontrollable situations to controllable ones.', 'year': 1985, 'referenceCount': 41, 'citationCount': 127, 'journal': {'volume': '48 1', 'pages': '\n          198-215\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Rosenbaum1985LearnedHA,\n author = {M.

Parents of children on the autism spectrum may experience greater stress, depression, and strained interpersonal relationships than those with typically developing children or those with children experiencing other developmental delays. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and initial effects of a virtual Mindful Self-Compassion workshop for parents of children on the autism spectrum and the impact on stress, self-compassion, parenting self-efficacy, and mindfulness. This pilot study used a mixed-method approach to test this hypothesis. Participants completed surveys before and after the brief workshop and participated in a 1-hr focus group within 1 week of completing the surveys. The findings indicate that a short, 3-day virtual workshop may be effective toward improving parents’ mindfulness and self-compassion. Parents reported feeling more mindful in their day-to-day life, more self-compassionate during difficult times, and more patient with themselves and other people in their family. A brief, virtual workshop may be effective for short-term improvements in outcomes for parents of children on the autism spectrum.",2023,29,0,{'name': 'Journal of Early Intervention'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Curl2023VirtualMW,\n author = {Emily L.

Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder face disproportionately high levels of demand both as caregivers, and as partners in multiple, complex, intervention programs. This study examines the relationship between parents’ experiences with their child’s interventions—specifically their sense of involvement in treatment and satisfaction with intervention-related training—and their confidence in parenting a child with autism spectrum disorder, defined as autism-specific parenting self-efficacy. Participants (N\u2009=\u2009438, 93% mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder aged 2–17\u2009years) completed our novel autism-specific parenting self-efficacy scale and rated their experience of involvement in their child’s interventions and satisfaction with intervention-related training across a range of common autism spectrum disorder–related treatments. Respondents also completed a caregiver burden scale. Findings indicate that parents who report greater involvement in their child’s interventions, and note greater satisfaction with intervention-related training, also report greater autism-specific parenting self-efficacy. Parents who report greater financial and social burden report lower autism-specific parenting self-efficacy. We propose that these results are important in creating intervention experiences that foster parental self-efficacy through involvement, productive training experiences, and addressing parental burden. Lay abstract What is already known about the topic? Parents of children with autism experience enormous challenges managing the complex needs of caring for their children. This includes coordinating multiple and complex therapies and acting as partners in treatment. Parenting self-efficacy is the confidence a person has in their ability to manage the tasks that are part of raising a child. People who have more confidence, or greater parenting self-efficacy, often feel less stressed and are more able to manage the demands of family life. This is particularly important for parents with children who have autism spectrum disorder, since they experience more parenting pressures. Although a lot is known about parenting self-efficacy in parents of neurotypical children, we do not know enough about how to help parents of children with autism spectrum disorder develop greater parenting self-efficacy. What this paper adds? This study shows that parents gain a greater sense of parenting self-efficacy when they feel more involved in their child’s therapy and are more satisfied with the training they receive as part of these therapies. We also find that feeling pressure related to being a caregiver of a child with autism spectrum disorder can undermine autism-specific parenting self-efficacy. However, parents’ sense of confidence was not limited by the severity of their child’s symptoms. Implications for practice, research, or policy The results suggest that there is an opportunity to help parents develop a greater sense of confidence in their ability to manage the complexities of raising a child with autism spectrum disorder by helping them feel more involved in treatment and by creating intervention-related training experiences that are more satisfying. Providers might also help by taking time to address the challenges and pressures that parents are experiencing, and helping them find ways to deal with these challenges. We suggest that there needs to be more research exploring how providers can best design interventions that support autism-specific parenting self-efficacy as a way of improving parental and child well-being.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 85, 'citationCount': 16, 'journal': {'volume': '25', 'pages': '1395 - 1408', 'name': 'Autism'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Kurzrok2021AutismspecificPS,\n author = {Jennifer Kurzrok and Eileen McBride and R.

The first is to synthesize factors that impact parents’ experiences of caring for a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD); the second is to identify factors that impact parental stress and parental decision-making to use autism services or not. Parents of children with ASD score higher on levels of stress than other groups of parents. The daily challenges of caring for the child are endless and effect all aspects of the child's care as well as the parent's mental health and ability to manage the needs of the child and family. Understanding more about the challenges parents face will provide direction for research, intervention development, and practice. Accordingly, a search was conducted using CINAHL and Medline. Inclusion criteria included articles available in full text, published in English, and focused on children with ASD distinct from other diagnoses, as well as parental experiences of caring for a child with ASD. Articles (N = 132) that met the inclusion criteria were summarized. Challenging aspects of the child's diagnosis and care are discussed, as well as the factors that impact parental stress and decision-making to use autism services. Recommendations for research and practice include interventional development related to early diagnosis, disparity, access to care, parental decision-making to use autism services, and parental stress management."", 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 140, 'citationCount': 207, 'journal': {'volume': '37', 'pages': '153 - 163', 'name': 'Issues in Mental Health Nursing'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Bonis2016StressAP,\n author = {Susan A.

The aim of this study is to examine the effects of mindfulness training for adolescents with autism spectrum disorder, combined with Mindful Parenting training. Method: A total of 23 adolescents with autism spectrum disorder, referred to a mental health clinic, received nine weekly sessions of mindfulness training in group format. Their parents (18 mothers, 11 fathers) participated in parallel Mindful Parenting training. A pre-test, post-test, and 9-week follow-up design was used. Data were analyzed using multi-level analyses. Results: Attendance rate was 88% for adolescents and fathers and 86% for mothers. Adolescents reported an increase in quality of life and a decrease in rumination, but no changes in worry, autism spectrum disorder core symptoms, or mindful awareness. Although parents reported no change in adolescent’s autism spectrum disorder core symptoms, they reported improved social responsiveness, social communication, social cognition, preoccupations, and social motivation. About themselves, parents reported improvement in general as well as in parental mindfulness. They reported improved competence in parenting, overall parenting styles, more specifically a less lax, verbose parenting style, and an increased quality of life. Discussion: Mindfulness training for adolescents with autism spectrum disorder combined with Mindful Parenting is feasible. Although the sample size was small and no control group was included, the first outcomes of this innovative training are positive.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 54, 'citationCount': 121, 'journal': {'volume': '19', 'pages': '906 - 914', 'name': 'Autism'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Bruin2015MYmindMT,\n author = {E.

Exploratory factor analysis and internal consistency parameters confirmed a robust three‐factor structure of the BAPQ, corresponding to the proposed aloof, pragmatic language and rigidity subscales. Based upon the distribution of Broad Autism Phenotype (BAP) features in the general population, new normative cutoff values for BAPQ subscales were established that provide increased specificity relative to those previously reported, and thus enhance the utility of the BAPQ for diagnostically classifying the BAP. These cutoffs were also used to estimate prevalence of the BAP and its three components, with rates ranging between 14–23% for PCAs and between 5–9% for CPs. Analysis of patterns of BAP characteristics within family members revealed that BAP features were more likely to co‐occur in PCAs relative to CPs. Collectively, these findings extend the utility of the BAPQ and provide additional evidence that it is an efficient and reliable tool for disaggregating the heterogeneity of autism through the identification of meaningful subgroups of parents.

However, no research to date has examined the psychometric properties of the PSI-SF in a sample of parents of young children with ASD. In this regard, item response theory (IRT) can be used to estimate how much information or discrimination each item of a scale offers across the entire range of the latent variable being measured, by creating individual item information curves or profiles. The purpose of this study was to use IRT to examine the discriminability of PSI-SF items in a sample of parents of young children with ASD who experience varying levels of parental stress.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study involved the parents of 141 children with autism spectrum disorders (91.4% mothers; mean age 36.2 years) who completed the PSI-SF following diagnosis. Item characteristic curves were constructed for each of the PSI-SF items and examined with regard to item functioning.\n\n\nRESULTS\nResults indicated that, for the most part, changes in parental distress severity were reflected in changes on item scores. However, several items on the subscales measuring parent-child dysfunctional interactions and child behavior difficulty functioned poorly to discriminate parents across a range of total stress severity.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe parent-child dysfunctional interaction and difficult child subscales of the PSI-SF scale should be used with caution with parents of young children with ASD. More research is required to examine PSI-SF content validity, at least among parents of children with ASD and perhaps parents of children with other disabilities as well.', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 22, 'citationCount': 121, 'journal': {'volume': '51 11', 'pages': '\n          1269-77\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Zaidman-Zait2010AnIR,\n author = {A.

The context of the workplace became an important variable in the impact of the lockdown on individuals. In this study, we deepened the categories of healthcare workers (HWs), virtual workers (VWs), and the elderly, along with their emotional approach to this emergency. A sample of 257 participants (ElderlyN = 62; HWsN = 104; VWsN = 91) completed: a semi-structured interview on their experience during lockdown via telephone; an online survey with a sociodemographic questionnaire; the Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale (DERS); and the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI). Linguistic measures of the Referential Process were utilized to code the interviews. An independent ANOVA explored the variability among groups. The results show more affective language in the Elderly (M = 0.0310, SD = 0.0070) and a growth in spirituality (M = 4.16, SD = 3.17). HWs displayed a higher PTGI (M = 56.84, SD = 20.29), while VWs displayed a lower PTGI (M = 50.02, SD = 21.05). Moreover, VWs presented higher scores in Impulse on the DERS (M = 11.67, SD = 5.05) and a more cognitive/abstract narration (Reflection IREF M = 0.0260, SD = 0.0071; Reorganization IWRRL M = 0.5419, SD = 0.0032; Referential Activity IWRAD M = 0.4978, SD = 0.0029).

It also brought the importance of daily emotional management for survival to the forefront of every human being. Our study aims to explore whether emotional processes perform different functions during waking thoughts and night dreams during the first lockdown in Italy. Utilizing Multiple Code Theory (MCT), our goal is to verify whether waking thoughts facilitate a functional disconnection in order to manage the trauma caused by COVID-19. Two online forms were distributed to random participants in the general population, presenting a total of 49 reports of night dreams (23 males; mean age 33.45 ds. 10.12; word mean 238.54 ds. 146.8) and 48 reports of waking thoughts (25 males; mean age 34.54 ds. 12.8; word mean M. 91 words ds. 23). The Referential Process linguistic measures and Affect Salience Index were utilized. It was found that Affect Salience is present in both dreams and in waking thoughts; however, Referential Activity was higher in dreams and Reflection and Affect words were higher in waking thoughts. Two different processes of emotional elaboration emerged. The results highlight the use of greater symbolization processes during dreams and a higher emotional distance in waking thoughts. These results confirm that during the nocturnal processes, there is greater contact with the processing of trauma, while during the diurnal processes, defensive strategies were activated to cope with and manage life via a moment of the defensive disruption of daily activities.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 107, 'citationCount': 7, 'journal': {'volume': '12', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Mariani2021NarrativesOD,\n author = {R.

Nevertheless, previous research has demonstrated that traumatic experiences can also lead to positive reactions, stimulating resilience and feelings of growth. The aim of this narrative review is to investigate the positive aspects associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the possible health prevention and promotion strategies by analyzing the available scientific evidence. In particular, we focus on the constructs of resilience, coping strategies and posttraumatic growth (PTG). A literature search was performed on the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Psycinfo databases. Forty-six articles were included in the literature synthesis. Psychological resilience is a fundamental variable for reducing and preventing the negative psychological effects of the pandemic and is associated with lower levels of depression, anxiety and burnout. At the individual and organizational level, resilience plays a crucial role in enhancing wellbeing in healthcare and non-healthcare workers. Connected to resilience, adaptive coping strategies are essential for managing the emergency and work-related stress. Several positive factors influencing resilience have been highlighted in the development of PTG. At the same time, high levels of resilience and positive coping strategies can enhance personal growth. Considering the possible long-term coexistence and consequences of COVID-19, organizational interventions should aim to improve workers’ adaptive coping skills, resilience and PTG in order to promote wellbeing.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 98, 'citationCount': 103, 'journal': {'volume': '18', 'name': 'International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Finstad2021ResilienceCS,\n author = {Georgia Libera Finstad and Gabriele Giorgi and L.

A group of 170 medical personnel from (tertiary) hospitals who participated in the pandemic aid operation in Hubei completed self-administered questionnaires, including the perceived organizational support scale, emotional labor scale, and professional identity scale. This study used Pearson's correlation in SPSS to analyze the three variables of organizational support, emotional labor, and professional identity. Organizational support and emotional labor (r = 0.443, P < 0.01), organizational support and professional identity (r = 0.631, P < 0.01), and emotional labor and occupational identity (r = 0.511, P < 0.01) showed a significant positive correlation. The bootstrapping mediating effect test was used to determine the overall mediating effect of occupational identity. Occupational identity was a complete mediating effect between organizational support and emotional labor. The results show that a strong sense of organizational support can promote higher emotional labor among medical workers in Hubei Province. A strong sense of organizational support will also promote a stronger professional identity; further, a strong professional identity completely mediates the effect of perceived organizational support on emotional labor. These results infer that in emergency medical and health services, medical personnel can realize a high sense of organizational support, which could enhance their professional identity; this enables them to combine their professional goals with organizational goals more actively and to finally pay higher emotional labor to achieve organizational goals."", 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 49, 'citationCount': 9, 'journal': {'volume': '12', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Zeng2021FactorsTI,\n author = {Z.

A group of 267 HCWs from a hospital in the Lazio Region completed self-administered questionnaires online through Google Forms, including the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), Resilience Scale, and Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale Short Form (IU). Cluster analysis highlighted two opposite burnout risk profiles: low burnout and high-risk burnout. The high-risk group had lower resilience and greater difficulties in tolerating the uncertainty than the low-burnout group. A set of general linear models confirmed that both IU subscales, prospective and inhibition, moderated the relationship between resilience and burnout (specifically in the depersonalization dimension). In conclusion, the results showed that individual levels of resilience and one's ability to tolerate uncertainty have been significant factors in determining the impact of the COVID-19 emergency on HCWs.

While the software has been an essential tool for productivity, learning, and social interaction, something about being on videoconference all day seems particularly exhausting, and the term “Zoom Fatigue” caught on quickly. In this article, I focus on nonverbal overload as a potential cause for fatigue, and provide four arguments outlining how various aspects of the current Zoom interface likely lead to psychological consequences. The arguments are based on academic theory and research, but also have yet to be directly tested in the context of Zoom, and require future experimentation to confirm.

The current paper presents the development and validation of the Zoom Exhaustion & Fatigue Scale (ZEF Scale). In one qualitative study, we developed a set of interview prompts based on previous work on media use. Those interviews resulted in the creation of 49 survey items that spanned several dimensions. We administered those items in a survey of 395 respondents and used factor analyses to reduce the number of items from 49 to 15, revealing five dimensions of fatigue: general, social, emotional, visual, and motivational fatigue. Finally, in a scale validation study based on 2724 respondents, we showed the reliability of the overall scale and the five factors and demonstrated scale validity in two ways.

The aim of this paper is to review studies on the course of mental health problems during and after the first lockdown phase. Methods We conducted a rapid review of multi-wave studies in general populations with time points during and after the first lockdown phase. Repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that utilised validated instruments were included. The main outcome was whether indicators of mental health problems have changed during and after the first lockdown phase. The study was registered with PROSPERO No. CRD42020218640. Results Twenty-three studies with 56 indicators were included in the qualitative review. Studies that reported data from pre-pandemic assessments through lockdown indicated an increase in mental health problems. During lockdown, no uniform trend could be identified. After lockdown, mental health problems decreased slightly. Conclusions As mental health care utilisation indicators and data on suicides do not suggest an increase in demand during the first lockdown phase, we regard the increase in mental health problems as general distress that is to be expected during a global health crisis.

Organisations have had to make provision for staff to operate remotely following the implementation of lockdown regulations around the world, because the pandemic has led to restrictions on movement and the temporary closure of workplace premises. The purpose of this paper is to provide insights from remote workers' experiences in South Africa about immediate conversion from the normal workplace environment to working remotely from home. The structuration theory was adopted to understand the social structural challenges experienced by staff working from home.Design/methodology/approachData were collected using a Web-based survey, administered when the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in movement restrictions, using the judgemental sampling technique.FindingsThe results are presented using both external and internal features that are linked to the social structures experienced by remote workers who participated in the survey. The key findings indicate that despite the positive aspects of remote working using advances in technology, there are also negative aspects and risks attached to remote working such as work overload and pressures to perform timeously. This can pose severe threats to workers' routines and lifestyle, and the lack of interaction can impinge on their health and general well-being.Research limitations/implicationsThe online survey was carried out with first-time remote workers who were the target for the study. Some respondents may have had an affinity for remote working because of the novelty. The sample size may not be generalised, as the collected sample is moderately small, although the purpose of the paper was to report on a small sample size, given the rapidity of the study.Practical implicationsThe paper seeks to highlight social structures that exist in South Africa, which accentuate the resource divide for remote workers. Also, the paper aims to encourage organisations (employers) to better understand challenges that workers encountered while working from their homes during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown restrictions.Originality/valueThe relevance of this paper is in its contribution to the structuration theory and remote working literature, as well as to the study of these topics in the context of South Africa."", 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 55, 'citationCount': 49, 'journal': {'name': 'International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Matli2020TheCW,\n author = {W.

Until now to monitor these phases clinicians and researchers have used several referential process computerized linguistic measures, which however need the sessions verbatim transcription. In order to have a less time-consuming method we developed and tested a therapist self-report questionnaire measuring the referential process phases. Method We asked eight psychotherapists in a first study and nine psychotherapists in a second study to complete the Referential Process Post-session Scale – Therapist version (RPPS-T) just after the end of their sessions. In a third study we transcribed 29 sessions conducted by three psychotherapists to calculate the correlations between the RPPS-T scores and the computerized linguistic measures of the referential process calculated on the session transcripts. Results In the first study we collected 105 evaluations regarding 29 patients and an exploratory factor analysis revealed a four-factor pattern consistent with the hypothesized constructs. The analysis reduced the initial pool of 42 items to 12. In the second study 130 sessions with 25 different patients have been evaluated on the shortened version of the RPPS-T and a confirmatory factor analysis found that the four-factor model satisfactorily fitted the new data as well. In the third study we found that the factors of RPPS-T regarding the symbolizing phase correlated with the corresponding computerized linguistic measures calculated on the session transcripts.

People ≥70 were deemed “Clinically Vulnerable.” Distancing measures were introduced to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19. However, these may have a negative impact on older people who are vulnerable to social isolation and may have challenges accessing services and provisions. Objectives: To investigate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on the lives of older people. Study design and setting: Cross-sectional telephone survey. Participants: Community-dwelling older people, 76–97 years. Outcomes: Health anxiety; General health (RAND Short-form 36 Survey); Physical activity; Depression (PHQ-8); Anxiety (GAD-2); Loneliness; Access to services; Challenges, concerns and positive experiences. Data analysis: Counts (%), means (SDs). Thematic analysis was used to identify themes from open questions. Results: n\u2009=\u2009142. 52% did not worry about their health; 76% rated their health as “good”, “very good” or “excellent”. < 10% met the criteria indicative of depression (PHQ-8), or anxiety (GAD-2). 42% were less active than before lockdown. 27% were lonely at least some of the time. Over half of participants identified positive aspects. Conclusions: Most participants reported good health with low levels of health anxiety, anxiety and depression. Many were able to identify positive aspects to lockdown and may be better equipped to deal with lockdown than anticipated.

Social distancing policies, mandatory lockdowns, isolation periods, and anxiety of getting sick, along with the suspension of productive activity, loss of income, and fear of the future, jointly influence the mental health of citizens and workers. Workplace aspects can play a crucial role on moderating or worsening mental health of people facing this pandemic scenario. The purpose of this literature review is to deepen the psychological aspects linked to workplace factors, following the epidemic rise of COVID-19, in order to address upcoming psychological critical issues in the workplaces. We performed a literature search using Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus, selecting papers focusing on workers’ psychological problems that can be related to the workplace during the pandemic. Thirty-five articles were included. Mental issues related to the health emergency, such as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and sleep disorders are more likely to affect healthcare workers, especially those on the frontline, migrant workers, and workers in contact with the public. Job insecurity, long periods of isolation, and uncertainty of the future worsen the psychological condition, especially in younger people and in those with a higher educational background. Multiple organizational and work-related interventions can mitigate this scenario, such as the improvement of workplace infrastructures, the adoption of correct and shared anti-contagion measures, including regular personal protective equipment (PPE) supply, and the implementation of resilience training programs. This review sets the basis for a better understanding of the psychological conditions of workers during the pandemic, integrating individual and social perspectives, and providing insight into possible individual, social, and occupational approaches to this “psychological pandemic”.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 86, 'citationCount': 443, 'journal': {'volume': '17', 'name': 'International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Giorgi2020COVID19RelatedMH,\n author = {Gabriele Giorgi and L.

The aim of this study is to explore the relationships between dimensions of burnout and various psychological features among Italian GPs during the COVID-19 emergency. A group of 102 GPs completed self-administered questionnaires available online through Google Forms, including Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), Resilience Scale, Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale Short Form (IU), and Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS). Cluster analysis highlighted four distinct burnout risk profiles: Low Burnout, Medium Risk, High Risk, and High Burnout. The High Burnout group showed both lower Resilience and lower CISS Task-oriented coping strategy than the Medium Risk group and higher IU Prospective than the Low Burnout group. Results of a linear regression analysis confirmed that CISS Emotion-oriented style positively predicted MBI Emotional Exhaustion, CISS Task-oriented and Emotion-oriented emerged as significant predictors (negatively and positively, respectively) of MBI Depersonalization, and Resilience positively predicted MBI Personal Accomplishment. In conclusion, the results showed that the COVID-19 emergency had a significant impact on GPs’ work management. Implementing task-oriented problem management, rather than emotional strategies, appears to protect against burnout in these circumstances.

In the current study, we integrate transactional stress theory (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) with self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000) to advance and test a model predicting that CovH anxiety prompts individuals to suppress emotions, which has detrimental implications for their psychological need fulfillment. In turn, lack of psychological need fulfillment hinders employees' abilities to work effectively, engage with their family, and experience heightened well-being. Our model further predicts that handwashing frequency-a form of problem-focused coping-will mitigate the effects of CovH anxiety. We test our propositions using a longitudinal design that followed 503 employees across the first four weeks that stay-at-home and social distancing orders were enacted. Consistent with predictions, CovH anxiety was found to impair critical work (goal progress), home (family engagement) and health (somatic complaints) outcomes due to increased emotion suppression and lack of psychological need fulfillment. Further, individuals who frequently engage in handwashing behavior were buffered from the negative impact of CovH anxiety. Combined, our work integrates and extends existing theory and has a number of important practical implications.

Older adults showed the highest levels of resilience following the September 11th (9/11) terrorist attacks, but during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak there were no age-related differences in well-being. The current study examined the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) disruption on well-being throughout adulthood. Research Design and Methods Perceived stress and affect were examined in 166 community-dwelling adults (Mage=35.65; SD=15.53; range=18-79) in relation to the perceived disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic to their lives. Results A significant moderation was found for age and COVID-19 disruption on perceived stress [F(5, 153) = 8.88, p & .05, R2= .22] and negative affect [F(5, 154) = 4.91, p & .05, R2= .14], but not for positive affect. For participants over 50, those who rated COVID-19 as a low or high disruption had similar scores on stress and negative affect, but with younger aged participants, perceiving high disruption corresponded with higher levels of stress and negative affect. Discussion and Implications Findings are consistent with the strength and vulnerability integration (SAVI) model, wherein older adults try to maintain positive emotional well-being; with middle-aged and older adults in the current study having experienced less negative impact on well-being. Middle-aged and older adults may be better able to regulate negative emotions, from COVID-19, than younger adults.

The current study assesses rates of mental health outcomes in the Italian general population three to 4 weeks into lockdown measures and explores the impact of COVID-19 related potential risk factors. Methods A web-based survey spread throughout the internet between March 27th and April 6th 2020. Eighteen thousand one hundred forty-seven individuals completed the questionnaire, 79.6% women. Selected outcomes were post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), depression, anxiety, insomnia, perceived stress, and adjustment disorder symptoms (ADS). Seemingly unrelated logistic regression analysis was performed to identify COVID-19 related risk factors. Results Endorsement rates for PTSS were 6,604 (37%), 3,084 (17.3%) for depression, 3,700 (20.8%) for anxiety, 1,301 (7.3%) for insomnia, 3,895 (21.8%) for high perceived stress and 4,092 (22.9%) for adjustment disorder. Being woman and younger age were associated with all of the selected outcomes. Quarantine was associated with PTSS, anxiety and ADS. Any recent COVID-related stressful life event was associated with all the selected outcomes. Discontinued working activity due to the COVID-19 was associated with all the selected outcomes, except for ADS; working more than usual was associated with PTSS, Perceived stress and ADS. Having a loved one deceased by COVID-19 was associated with PTSS, depression, perceived stress, and insomnia. Conclusion We found high rates of negative mental health outcomes in the Italian general population 3 weeks into the COVID-19 lockdown measures and different COVID-19 related risk factors. These findings warrant further monitoring on the Italian population’s mental health.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 37, 'citationCount': 999, 'journal': {'volume': '11', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychiatry'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Rossi2020COVID19PA,\n author = {R.

The number of cases and deaths cannot be explained simply because of the epidemic starting in Italy earlier compared with other countries besides China. It is important to understand why death rates were so high in Italy to learn how to best prepare and how to plan for optimal actions in other countries. Some contributing factors may be immutable (eg, age structure of the population), but even these need to be laid out carefully in preparedness assessments. Some other contributing factors are potentially modifiable. Some factors pertain to demographics and background disease in the population. Italy has the most elderly population in Europe and the second most elderly population in the world after Japan. COVID-19 has a strong age dependence for the severity of the infection and the risk of death. The median age of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 who are dying in Italy has been 80 years, and the average age of patients requiring critical care support has been 67 years. Moreover, COVID-19 morbidity and mortality is strongly dependent on the presence of concomitant serious diseases, and Italy has a high proportion of patients with history of smoking and high rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and ischemic heart disease.2 The corollary is that preparedness for needs of intensive care unit (ICU) beds and estimates of expected deaths should consider the age structure and chronic diseases of the population served by each health care system. Taking this adjustment into account, burden of disease may be expected to be much less in most areas in the United States, with variability across states and hospital catchment areas. For example, the proportion of the population older than 65 years is 9.5% in Alaska as compared with 19.1% in Florida and 23.1% in Italy. A second set of factors in Italy is the increased burden of cases that presented themselves to the health care system. The proportion of people infected must have been very high in specific areas that were highly affected. In the town of Vò, all 3300 residents were tested the day the first case was detected in the third week of February, and 3% were found to be infected.3 Following aggressive testing, the epidemic was extinguished. However, elsewhere in Italy, it is likely that the prevalence of infection was several times higher in the absence of effective public health intervention. For example, it is likely that the health care system was overwhelmed in Bergamo owing to massive viral transmission during the Champions League match on February 19, 2020 (Atalanta vs Valencia), where a third of the population of Bergamo attended and continued celebrations overnight. Italian life is famous for its socialization and frequent congregations and clustering. It is possible also that in early stages, there was not much adoption of standard hygienic measures, and instructions to stay at home proved difficult to accept, with many complaints registered with the police.4 Accordingly, a higher level of preparedness should be considered for areas where mass gatherings have occurred or where there is extensive social intermingling. A third set of factors pertains to the standard capacity of the health care system and decisions made during hospital management of the presenting cases. Italy has a highly competent state-run health care system, but it has only a modest number of ICU beds and very few subintensive care beds. Overall, 5090 ICU beds (8.4 per 100 000 population) are available in Italy, and 2601 beds in coronary care units (4.3 per 100 000 population),5 as opposed to much higher numbers (36 ICU beds per 100 000 population) in the United States. Given the little experience in dealing with the new virus, it is unavoidable that some strategic mistakes were made about which patients should be hospitalized. In the winter, hospitals tend to run close to full capacity, with 87% average occupancy in Italy during the flu season. Apparently, many patients with relatively modest symptoms were admitted; by the time more patients with severe cases started to arrive, there were limited reserves. Hospital overcrowding may also explain the high infection rate of medical personnel. As of March 30, 2020, 8920 medical personnel had been found to be infected in Italy,6 leading to further loss of capacity for hospitals to respond. Moreover, early infection of medical personnel led to the spread of the infection to other patients within hospitals. In Lombardy, SARS-CoV-2 became largely a nosocomial infection. Nine percent of infections in Italy occurred among health care personnel.6 Characteristically, the first patient with COVID-19 visited the emergency department twice, thus exposing all of the personnel and patients in that area before the infection was recognized. Italy is a decentralized country; thus, preparedness and containment may have been hampered. There was a delay from the first case detection (February 21, 2020) to the first containment decree from the government that closed the relevant villages 3 days later. The lessons relevant to other countries are the need to (1) avoid bringing patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection to the hospital, except when they clearly require hospital care; (2) maintain strict hygienic procedures in the hospital environment; and (3) act swiftly in VIEWPOINT', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 9, 'citationCount': 286, 'journal': {'name': 'JAMA internal medicine'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Boccia2020WhatOC,\n author = {S.

The Weighted Referential Activity Dictionary (WRAD) and other linguistic measures (Reflection, Disfluency, and Somatic Sense) were applied to texts derived from the TSIA using the Discourse Attributes Analysis Program (DAAP).\n\n\nRESULTS\nMultiple linear regressions performed in the whole sample showed a relation between TSIA scores and Somatic Sense. Comparing the two groups, hypertensive subjects yielded higher scores on the TSIA than the young adult sample; no differences in DAAP measures emerged. A significant negative correlation was found between the TAS-20 Difficulty Describing Feelings score and the DAAP measure of references to body activations (Somatic Sense) both in the young adult sample and in hypertensives. In the young adult sample, negative relations emerged between different TSIA factors, WRAD score, and Somatic Sense; a positive relation with fragmented speech (Disfluency) and use of rationalization (Reflection) was also found. In hypertensive subjects, using the TSIA, a negative correlation between alexithymia and Somatic Sense and a positive correlation between alexithymia and the Mean High WRAD (a measure of intensity of engagement during the speech) were found.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe TSIA seems to be a more adequate instrument than the TAS-20 to explore relations between alexithymia and RA.

Bucci’s theory of the referential process (1997) concerns three phases whereby a person activates emotional, or bodily experience (Arousal Phase), conveys the images and events associated with it (Symbolizing Phase), and reconsiders them (Reorganizing Phase). The Symbolizing Phase is the major focus of this study and is operationalized by a measure called referential activity (RA) based on judges’ ratings of the concreteness, specificity, clarity and imagery of language style. Computational models of RA have previously been created in several languages, however, due to the complexity of modeling RA, different modeling strategies have been employed for each language and common features that predict RA across languages are not well understood. Working from previous computational models developed in English and Italian, this study specifies a new model of predictors common to both languages that correlates between r = .36 and.45 with RA.

First, factorial structure, internal consistency, and concurrent validity of our Italian version of the DERS were examined with a sample of 323 students (77% female; mean age 25.6). Second, test-retest analyses were completed using a different sample of 61 students (80% female; mean age 24.7). Third, the scores produced by a small clinical sample of participants (N = 38; mean age = 24.2) affected by anorexia, binge eating disorder, or bulimia were compared to those of an age-matched, nonclinical female sample (N = 38; mean age = 24.7).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe factorial structure replicated quite well the six-factor structure proposed by Gratz and Roemer. The internal consistency and test-retest reliability were adequate and comparable to previous findings.

49,338eb07b27a2fc5ce9ce386845acb835c996d2ca,Research on Learning Concentration Recognition with Multi-Modal Features in Virtual Reality Environments,"Learning concentration, as a crucial factor influencing learning outcomes, provides the basis for learners’ self-regulation and teachers’ instructional adjustments and intervention decisions. However, the current research on learning concentration recognition lacks the integration of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral features, and the integration of interaction and vision data for recognition requires further exploration. The way data are collected in a head-mounted display differs from that in a traditional classroom or online learning. Therefore, it is vital to explore a recognition method for learning concentration based on multi-modal features in VR environments. This study proposes a multi-modal feature integration-based learning concentration recognition method in VR environments. It combines interaction and vision data, including measurements of interactive tests, text, clickstream, pupil facial expressions, and eye gaze data, to measure learners’ concentration in VR environments in terms of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral representation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method, which integrates interaction and vision data to comprehensively represent the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions of learning concentration, outperforms single-dimensional and single-type recognition results in terms of accuracy. Additionally, it was found that learners with higher concentration levels achieve better learning outcomes, and learners’ perceived sense of immersion is an important factor influencing their concentration.",2023,46,1,{'name': 'Sustainability'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Hu2023ResearchOL,\n author = {Renhe Hu and Zihan Hui and Yifan Li and Jueqi Guan},\n booktitle = {Sustainability},\n journal = {Sustainability},\n title = {Research on Learning Concentration Recognition with Multi-Modal Features in Virtual Reality Environments},\n year = {2023}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2225680673', 'name': 'Renhe Hu'}, {'authorId': '2225677390', 'name': 'Zihan Hui'}, {'authorId': '2110489870', 'name': 'Yifan Li'}, {'authorId': '2090331915', 'name': 'Jueqi Guan'}]","[{'paperId': '9e3b91cbf9c723abd3cdf273ee5b3eb6db180ef0', 'title': 'A survey on automatic engagement recognition methods: online and traditional classroom', 'abstract': 'Student engagement in a learning environment is directly related to students’ perception and involvement of the educational activities in the class, along with their physical and mental health.

One perennial challenge is that the magnitude of the task-evoked pupil response diminishes over the course of an experiment, a phenomenon we refer to as a fatigue effect. Reducing fatigue effects may improve sensitivity to task effects and reduce the likelihood of confounds due to systematic physiological changes over time. In this paper, we investigated the degree to which fatigue effects could be ameliorated by experimenter intervention. In Experiment 1, we assigned participants to one of three groups-no breaks, kinetic breaks (playing with toys, but no social interaction), or chatting with a research assistant-and compared the pupil response across conditions. In Experiment 2, we additionally tested the effect of researcher observation. Only breaks including social interaction significantly reduced the fatigue of the pupil response across trials. However, in all conditions we found robust evidence for fatigue effects: that is, regardless of protocol, the task-evoked pupil response was substantially diminished (at least 60%) over the duration of the experiment. We account for the variance of fatigue effects in our pupillometry data using multiple common statistical modeling approaches (e.g., linear mixed-effects models of peak, mean, and baseline pupil diameters, as well as growth curve models of time-course data).

Importantly, sustained attention undergoes significant development over the early childhood period. Yet, how sustained attention fluctuates over time on task has not been clearly outlined, particularly in young children. In this study, we provide a first test of whether the pupillary response can be used as an indicator of moment-to-moment sustained attention over time on task in young children. Children aged 5 to 7 years (N = 41) completed a psychomotor vigilance task, where they were asked to press a button as fast as possible at the onset of a target stimulus. We measured reaction times over the course of the task, pupil size prior to target onset (baseline pupil size), and pupil size in response to target onset (task-evoked pupil size). The results showed a stereotypical vigilance decrement in children’s response times: as time on task increased, reaction times increased. Critically, children’s task-evoked pupil size decreased over time on task, while no such change was present in baseline pupil size. These results suggest that young children’s waning sustained attention may be linked to a decrease in alertness while overall arousal is maintained. We discuss the importance of leveraging pupillometry to understand the mechanisms of sustained attention over individuals and development.', 'year': 2022, 'referenceCount': 96, 'citationCount': 1, 'journal': {'volume': '10', 'name': 'Journal of Intelligence'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Benitez2022PupillometryAA,\n author = {Viridiana L.

Students were asked to programmatically choreograph dance performances for virtual characters within an educational desktop application we built earlier called Virtual Environment Interactions (VEnvI). As part of a middle school science class, 90 students from the 6th and 7th grades participated in our study. All students first visually programmed dance choreography for a virtual character they created in VEnvI on a laptop. Then, they viewed and interacted with the resulting dance performance in a between-subjects design in one of the three conditions. We compared and contrasted the benefits of embodied immersive virtual reality (EVR) viewing utilizing a head-mounted display with a body-scaled and gender-matched self-avatar, immersive virtual reality only (IVR) viewing, and desktop VR (NVR) viewing with VEnvI on pedagogical outcomes, programming performance, presence, and attitudes towards STEM and computational thinking. Results from a cognition questionnaire showed that, in the learning dimensions of Knowledge and Understanding (Bloom's taxonomy) as well as Multistructural (SOLO taxonomy), participants in EVR and IVR scored significantly higher than NVR. Also, participants in EVR scored significantly higher than IVR. We also discovered similar results in objective programming performance and presence scores in VEnvI. Furthermore, students’ attitudes towards computer science, programming confidence, and impressions significantly improved to be the highest in EVR and then IVR as compared to NVR condition.

We combine these data sources to predict elementary students’ success within the system as well as components of their math identity as measured though a standardized survey. Data from 147 students was examined longitudinally over a year of study. The results indicated links between math success and non-cognitive measures of math identity. Additionally, the results indicate that math identity was strongly predicted by click-stream variables and the production of more lexically sophisticated and cohesive language.

In this paper, we study the task of multi-class classification of online posts of Twitter users, and show how far it is possible to go with the classification, and the limitations and difficulties of this task. The proposed approach of multi-class classification achieves an accuracy of 60.2% for 7 different sentiment classes which, compared to an accuracy of 81.3% for binary classification, emphasizes the effect of having multiple classes on the classification performance.

Specifically, two metrics are tested in response to task difficulty: (1) the change in pupil diameter with respect to inter- or intra-trial baseline, and (2) the rate and magnitude of microsaccades. Participants performed easy and difficult mental arithmetic tasks while fixating a central target. Inter-trial change in pupil diameter and microsaccade magnitude appear to adequately discriminate task difficulty, and hence cognitive load, if the implied causality can be assumed. This paper’s contribution corroborates previous work concerning microsaccade magnitude and extends this work by directly comparing microsaccade metrics to pupillometric measures. To our knowledge this is the first study to compare the reliability and sensitivity of task-evoked pupillary and microsaccadic measures of cognitive load.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 71, 'citationCount': 163, 'journal': {'volume': '13', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Krejtz2018EyeTC,\n author = {Krzysztof Krejtz and A.

In this paper, we present a fusion framework considering three channel data sources: 1) videos/images from a camera, 2) eye movement information tracked by a low solution eye tracker and 3) mouse movement. Based on these data modalities, we propose a novel approach of multi-channel data fusion to explore the learning unit state recognition. We also propose a method to build a learning state recognition model to avoid manually labeling image data. The experiments were carried on our designed online learning prototype system, and we choose CART, Random Forest and GBDT regression model to predict e-learner's learning state. The results show that multi-channel data fusion model have a better recognition performance in comparison with single channel model. In addition, a best recognition performance can be reached when image, eye movement and mouse movement features are fused."", 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 23, 'citationCount': 3, 'journal': {'volume': 'abs/1806.07372', 'name': 'ArXiv'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Tian2018LearningUS,\n author = {Feng Tian and Jia Yue and Xing Wan and K.

Distance learning system can be regarded as one of ubiquitous computing applications since the learners can study anywhere even in mobile environments. However, the instructor cannot know if the learners comprehend the lecture or not since each learner is physically isolated. Therefore, a framework which detects the learners’ concentration condition is required. If a distance learning system obtains the information that many learners are not concentrated on the class due to the incomprehensible lecture style, the instructor can perceive it through the system and change the presentation strategy. This is a context-aware technology which is widely used for ubiquitous computing services. In this paper, an efficient distance learning system, which accurately detects learners’ concentration condition during a class, is proposed. The proposed system uses multiple biological information which are learners’ eye movement metrics, i.e. fixation counts, fixation rate, fixation duration and average saccade length obtained by an eye tracking system. The learners’ concentration condition is classified by using machine learning techniques. The proposed system has performed the detection accuracy of 90.7% when Multilayer Perceptron is used as a classifier. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed eye metrics has been confirmed. Furthermore, it has been clarified that the fixation duration is the most important eye metric among the four metrics based on the investigation of evaluation experiment.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 28, 'citationCount': 14, 'journal': {'volume': '5', 'pages': '1-15', 'name': 'Journal of Computational Chemistry'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Daniel2017DetectionOL,\n author = {Kim Daniel and E.

We measure engagement by how long students are watching each video, and whether they attempt to answer post-video assessment problems. Our main findings are that shorter videos are much more engaging, that informal talking-head videos are more engaging, that Khan-style tablet drawings are more engaging, that even high-quality pre-recorded classroom lectures might not make for engaging online videos, and that students engage differently with lecture and tutorial videos. Based upon these quantitative findings and qualitative insights from interviews with edX staff, we developed a set of recommendations to help instructors and video producers take better advantage of the online video format.

Furthermore, Electroencephalograph (EEG) signals are also analyzed and classified for use as a benchmark for comparison with ECG analysis. Several advanced signal processing techniques have been implemented and investigated to derive multiple clandestine and informative features from both these physiological signals. Decomposition and feature extraction are done using Stockwell-transform for the ECG signal, while Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used for EEG. These features are then applied to various machine-learning algorithms to produce classification models that are capable of differentiating between the cases of a person being attentive and a person not being attentive.

Correlational and path analyses revealed that teacher involvement was central to children's experiences in the classroom and that teacher provision of both autonomy support and optimal structure predicted children's motivation across the school year. Reciprocal effects of student motivation on teacher behavior were also found. Students who showed higher initial behavioral engagement received subsequently more of all 3 teacher behaviors. These findings suggest that students who are behaviorally disengaged receive teacher responses that should further undermine their motivation. The importance of the student-teacher relationship, especially interpersonal involvement, in optimizing student motivation is highlighted. What are the factors that motivate children to learn? Educators and parents value motivation in school for its own sake as well as for its long-term contribution to children's learning and self-esteem. Highly motivated children are easy to identify: They are enthusiastic, interested, involved, and curious; they try hard and persist; and they actively cope with challenges and setbacks. These are the children who should stay in school longer, learn more, feel better about themselves, and continue their education after high school. Recent research has borne this out (Ames & Ames, 1984, 1985; Pintrich, 1991; Stipek, 1988). Although motivated students are easy to recognize, they are difficult to find. Research shows that across the preschool to high school years, children's intrinsic motivation decreases and they feel increasingly alienated from learning (Harter, 1981).

We found that human observers reliably agree when discriminating low versus high degrees of engagement (Cohen's κ = 0.96). When fine discrimination is required (four distinct levels) the reliability decreases, but is still quite high ( κ = 0.56). Furthermore, we found that engagement labels of 10-second video clips can be reliably predicted from the average labels of their constituent frames (Pearson r=0.85), suggesting that static expressions contain the bulk of the information used by observers.

Studies have shown that virtual reality (VR) can trigger stronger and more specific emotional reactivity in users than other visual/audio media. Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) usually suffer from social impairments, such as challenges in emotion perception and emotion expression. A smart VR eHealth system that carefully triggers specific emotional reactions and detects the patterns in children with ASD can help with early screening, intervention, and emotional regulation. This paper proposes a VR gaming system that makes use of psychophysiological sensor signals, in-game performance and responses, stressor mini-games to detect different emotional reactivity patterns, and dynamically changes the game scene according to the current emotional status. This is a framework of a long-term study, where the ultimate goal is to develop a VR system with real-time feedback to assist early screening and diagnosis of ASD.",2021,0,2,"{'name': '2021 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing & Communications, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/IOP/SCI)', 'pages': '288-294'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mekbib2021DesigningAS,\n author = {Estephanos Mekbib and Yan Huang and Chao Mei and Y.

Within the framework of the Range-Frequency model, we tested whether temporal presentation of an emotional context, known to produce a contrast effect on valence ratings, also influences the regulation of interpersonal distances. Two groups of participants were shown virtual characters with either a neutral facial expression (target stimuli) or an emotional facial expression (contextual stimuli) in two successive sessions (angry then happy emotional context, or vice-versa). Participants rated the valence of the characters and judged the appropriateness of various interpersonal distances. The results showed a contrast effect of the emotional context on the valence rating of neutral characters, which extended to preferred interpersonal distance, although sparingly.

Typically, this bias has been conceptualized as driven by an overactive bottom-up attentional system; however, this potentially overlooks the role of top-down attention in being able to modulate this bottom-up bias. Here, the role of top-down mechanisms in directing attention toward emotional faces was assessed with a modified dot-probe task, in which participants were given a top-down cue (""happy"" or ""angry"") to attend to a happy or angry face on each trial, and the cued face was either presented with a face of the other emotion (angry, happy) or a neutral face. This study found that social anxiety was not associated with differences in shifting attention toward cued angry faces. However, participants with higher levels of social anxiety were selectively impaired in attentional shifting toward a cued happy face when it was paired with an angry face, but not when paired with a neutral face. The results indicate that top-down attention can be used to orient attention to emotional faces, but that higher levels of social anxiety are associated with selective deficits in top-down control of attention in the presence of threat.

However, in modern societies with overcrowded and hyperstimulating environments, we can only surreptitiously glimpse the faces of others in order to quickly make behavioral adjustments.

In the present study, we investigated this issue by testing whether facial expressions that are difficult to identify modify the physiological response (Electrodermal Activity, EDA) and subsequent judgment of interpersonal comfort distance. We recorded participants' EDA while they provided comfort judgments to interpersonal distances with a Point-Light Walker (PLW). The PLW, with an emotionally neutral gait, moved toward and crossed participants at various distances after the latter were exposed to a negative (anger), positive (happiness) or neutral facial expression presented at the perceptual threshold. Bayesian analyses of the data revealed an increase versus decrease of interpersonal comfort distance with the PLW depending on the negative versus positive emotional valence of the facial expression. They also showed an increase in EDA when the approaching PLW violated interpersonal comfort distance after participants were exposed to an angry facial expression. These effects correlated with the subjective assessment of the arousal of facial expressions. Thus, previous exposure to barely visible facial expressions can alter the representation of social comfort space and the physiological response associated with a violation of interpersonal comfort distances, depending on the valence and arousal of the emotional social stimuli."", 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 55, 'citationCount': 12, 'journal': {'pages': '\n          e13600\n        ', 'name': 'Psychophysiology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Cartaud2020TheIO,\n author = {A.

In the present internet-based experimental study, we analyzed the preferred IPD of 457 French participants when facing human-like characters that were either wearing a face mask or displaying a neutral, happy or angry facial expression. Results showed that IPD was significantly reduced when characters were wearing a face mask, as they were perceived as more trustworthy compared to the other conditions. Importantly, IPD was even more reduced in participants infected with Covid-19 or living in low-risk areas, while it was not affected by the predicted health of the characters. These findings shed further light on the psychological factors that motivate IPD adjustments, in particular when facing a collective threat.

Thirty volunteers underwent fMRI scanning while viewing approaching or withdrawing faces (Social) and insects/arachnids (Non-social). Preferred distance to the stimuli was assessed behaviourally in a computerized task, and in real life. Results showed that approaching social and non-social stimuli of varying threat levels elicited activation of frontoparietal regions previously linked to peripersonal space, as well as of the midbrain periaqueductal gray, suggesting the engagement of defensive mechanisms by personal space intrusions. However, functional connectivity patterns of the midbrain differed for social and non-social stimuli, with enhanced coupling with the premotor cortex to approaching social stimuli. Additionally, connectivity strength between the midbrain and the premotor cortex was associated with preferred interpersonal distance.

Although comfortable interpersonal distance seems to be dependent on social factors such as the gender, age and activity of the confederates, it also seems to be modulated by the way we represent our peripersonal-action space. To test this hypothesis, the present study investigated the relation between the emotional responses registered through electrodermal activity (EDA) triggered by human-like point-light displays (PLDs) carrying different facial expressions (neutral, angry, happy) when located in the participants peripersonal or extrapersonal space, and the comfort distance with the same PLDs when approaching and crossing the participants fronto-parallel axis on the right or left side. The results show an increase of the phasic EDA for PLDs with angry facial expressions located in the peripersonal space (reachability judgment task), in comparison to the same PLDs located in the extrapersonal space, which was not observed for PLDs with neutral or happy facial expressions. The results also show an increase of the comfort distance for PLDs approaching the participants with an angry facial expression (interpersonal comfort distance judgment task), in comparison to PLDs with happy and neutral ones, which was related to the increase of the physiological response. Overall, the findings indicate that comfort social space can be predicted from the emotional reaction triggered by a confederate when located within the observer’s peripersonal space. This suggests that peripersonal-action space and interpersonal-social space are similarly sensitive to the emotional valence of the confederate, which could reflect a common adaptive mechanism in specifying theses spaces to subtend interactions with both the physical and social environment, but also to ensure body protection from potential threats.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 91, 'citationCount': 59, 'journal': {'volume': '9', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Cartaud2018PhysiologicalRT,\n author = {A.

In fact, it is hard to imagine a meaningful interaction in which emotion communication plays no role and even banal everyday transactions such as paying at a supermarket often involve an exchange of smiles or sometimes the expression of displeasure by one or both interaction partners. Importantly, these expressions serve as social signals that provide information about the expresser as well as about the situation (Hess, Kappas and Banse 1995) and that help to coordinate and facilitate interpersonal interaction and communication (Niedenthal and Brauer 2012; Parkinson, Fischer and Manstead 2005). This chapter explores the influence of context on the social signal value of such emotion expressions. What do they in fact tell us about the person or the situation and what influence has the context they occur in on the meaning of the exchange? When considering the impact of context, on the one hand, and the social signals inherent in emotion expressions, on the other, the first question to ask would be what emotions actually signal. The scientific study of emotion expressions is usually traced to Darwin's seminal work On the Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animal ([1872] 1965). Darwin understood emotion expressions as the visible part of an underlying emotional state, which are evolved and (at least at some point in the past) adaptive. The notion that the expressions communicate the organisms’ state and thereby allow a prediction of the organisms’ likely behaviour was a central point in this argument. Yet, Darwin's view has been disputed and rejected by those who considered facial expressions as exclusively or predominantly social or cultural signals, which are not linked to underlying states. Research by Ekman and colleagues (Ekman 1973; Ekman and Friesen 1971; Ekman, Friesen and Ellsworth 1972; Ekman, Sorenson and Friesen 1969) as well as Izard (Izard 1971a, 1971b) initially vindicated Darwin's idea that at least some basic emotional expressions are universal and directly associated with an underlying emotional state (see Hwang and Matsumoto, this volume, for a defence of this view, and Jack and Russell, both this volume, for criticisms). To this day, this view has been repeatedly challenged by those who consider emotion expressions to be purely social signals or social constructions unconnected to an underlying state (Barrett 2013; Fridlund 1994)."", 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 68, 'citationCount': 19, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'pages': '199-218', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Hess2016TheIO,\n author = {U.

A divisive-normalization account—in which representation of stimulus intensity is normalized (divided) by concurrent stimulus intensities—predicts that choice preferences among options increase with the range of option values. In the first experiment reported here, I manipulated the range of attractiveness of the faces presented on each trial by varying the attractiveness of an undesirable distractor face that was presented simultaneously with two attractive targets, and participants were asked to choose the most attractive face. I used normalization models to predict the context dependence of preferences regarding facial attractiveness. The more unattractive the distractor, the more one of the targets was preferred over the other target, which suggests that divisive normalization (a potential canonical computation in the brain) influences social evaluations. I obtained the same result when I manipulated faces’ averageness and participants chose the most average face. This finding suggests that divisive normalization is not restricted to value-based decisions (e.g., attractiveness).

The literature on interpersonal distance in ASD is not conclusive. While some studies show preferences for closer distances among this group, others show preferences for farther distances than controls. A common symptom of ASD that may explain the variance in responses to interpersonal distance in this population is social anxiety (SA), which has been shown to correlate with interpersonal distance preferences. In the current study, we investigated interpersonal distance preferences in a group of individuals with ASD using both behavioral and ERP measures. We found greater variance in interpersonal distance preferences in the ASD group than in the control group. Furthermore, we showed that this variance can be explained by differences in SA level and can be predicted by the N1 amplitude, an early ERP component related to attention and discrimination processes.

Most data showing implicit affective stimuli influence on evaluative judgments, come from experiments conducted in an affective priming paradigm. The paradigm was introduced by Murphy and Zajonc (1993) who presented evidence for the existence of unconscious primary affect (Zajonc, 1980) and its influence on cognition. In their original experiments they presented neutral target stimuli (for example Chinese ideographs), which were preceded by either 1-s or 4-ms exposures of photographs of faces expressing either positive or negative emotions. The results showed that suboptimal (4ms) affective primes induced affect that influenced evaluations of the neutral targets. Ideographs primed by negative facial expressions were judged more negatively than those primed by positive ones. Interestingly, neither the facial expression nor even the presence of any image was accessible to the participants’ awareness. In contrast to suboptimal affective primes, both optimal affective primes (exposed for 1 s) and affectively neutral suboptimal primes (e.g., geometric figures of different shapes) failed to influence the participants’ judgments about targets. This was the first effect observed in affective priming research. However, it turned out in later studies that the reverse effect is also possible (Glaser and Banaji, 1999; Ohme et al., 1999). The first effect, when judgments about neutral stimuli are consistent with the valance affective primes, is referred to as the assimilation effect. The reverse effect, when targets primed negatively are evaluated more positively than those primed positively (thus inconsistently with priming valance), is called the contrast effect. It turned out that which of the two effects is obtained is not a matter of chance but is related to important psychological and neurobiological processes occurring at the time when affect is elicited. Both effects are quite simple and both proof that judgmentsmay be influenced by stimuli presented outside conscious awareness. Accordingly, in this opinion article, we will explore the psychological mechanism underlying the effects of assimilation and contrast.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 47, 'citationCount': 8, 'journal': {'volume': '5', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Kobylińska2014AssimilationAC,\n author = {D.

According to the predominant “basic emotion” approach, the perception of emotion in faces is based on the rapid, automatic categorization of prototypical, universal expressions. Consequently, the perception of facial expressions has typically been investigated using isolated, de-contextualized, static pictures of facial expressions that maximize the distinction between categories. However, in everyday life, an individual’s face is not perceived in isolation, but almost always appears within a situational context, which may arise from other people, the physical environment surrounding the face, as well as multichannel information from the sender. Furthermore, situational context may be provided by the perceiver, including already present social information gained from affective learning and implicit processing biases such as race bias. Thus, the perception of facial expressions is presumably always influenced by contextual variables. In this comprehensive review, we aim at (1) systematizing the contextual variables that may influence the perception of facial expressions and (2) summarizing experimental paradigms and findings that have been used to investigate these influences. The studies reviewed here demonstrate that perception and neural processing of facial expressions are substantially modified by contextual information, including verbal, visual, and auditory information presented together with the face as well as knowledge or processing biases already present in the observer. These findings further challenge the assumption of automatic, hardwired categorical emotion extraction mechanisms predicted by basic emotion theories.

The reduction in adjustment was greater when stimuli were presented successively and when the experimental set covered a limited range.

A relatively neutral face seems sad when presented alongside a happier face, happy alongside a sadder face. A relatively unhappy face seems sad when presented alongside an angrier face, angry alongside a sadder face. The specific emotion seen in a face can be predicted by combining the idea that human judgment is relative with a model of the scale implicit in the judgment of emotion. In that model, categories and dimensions descriptive of feelings are interrelated in a systematic fashion: Categorical descriptors such as happy, sad, calm, and angry are at specific locations around the periphery of an emotion judgment space defined by degree of pleasure and degree of arousal. Viewing one facial expression (an anchor) shifts the entire scale of judgment, displacing the emotion seen in a subsequent expression (the target) in the opposite direction. Specifically, (a) magnitude of shift in perception of the target is proportional to the distance of the anchor from the center of the emotion space, (b) the angle of shift differs by 180° from the angle from the center to the anchor, and (c) the quantitative pleasure-arousal shift in the target corresponds to predictable shifts in the applicability of categorical descriptors. The geometric formulation of these ideas, although perhaps exaggerating our ability to quantify the message seen in a facial expression, did suggest specific hypotheses, some of which were tested here in six experiments. Supportive results were found with successive and with simultaneous presentation of anchor and target, with various target expressions including expressions of neutral, surprised, and angry feelings, with both posed and spontaneous target expressions, with target expressions posed by the same actor seen in the anchor and by a different actor, with different groups of observers, and with different', 'year': 1987, 'referenceCount': 41, 'citationCount': 263, 'journal': {'volume': '116', 'pages': '223-237', 'name': 'Journal of Experimental Psychology: General'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Russell1987RelativityIT,\n author = {J.

Boredom is related to the situation at hand and may lead to decreased performance. We frame the situation by connecting socio-emotional and cognitive conflict and individual differences to shed light onto the function of boredom. We look at the relation of boredom to theoretically connected emotions and their regulation. We conducted an online experiment in a virtual workplace setting (N = 57). We induced a socio-emotional and cognitive conflict situation by using a socially interactive agent which shames participants. Individual differences were operationalised through social identity and self-consciousness. We tested how social identity (predictor) and self-consciousness (moderator) influence cognitive appraisal of threat (mediator) and boredom (outcome). The results revealed that self-consciousness moderates the effect of social identity on cognitive appraisal of threat which then mediates the effect of social identity on boredom.",2021,0,0,"{'name': '2021 9th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction Workshops and Demos (ACIIW)', 'pages': '1-8'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chehayeb2021IndividualDA,\n author = {Lara Chehayeb and Dimitra Tsovaltzi and Rhythm Arora and Patrick Gebhard},\n booktitle = {2021 9th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction Workshops and Demos (ACIIW)},\n journal = {2021 9th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction Workshops and Demos (ACIIW)},\n pages = {1-8},\n title = {Individual Differences and the Function of Emotions in Socio-Emotional and Cognitive Conflict: If an Agent Shames you, will you still be Bored?},\n year = {2021}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2149701012', 'name': 'Lara Chehayeb'}, {'authorId': '1722662', 'name': 'Dimitra Tsovaltzi'}, {'authorId': '31428092', 'name': 'Rhythm Arora'}, {'authorId': '48785659', 'name': 'Patrick Gebhard'}]",[]

 For a woman to experience an orgasm she needs adequate physical, psychological, social and emotional stimulation to be highly aroused and have the ability to let go and be vulnerable. Mindfulness positively impacts attentional control, cognitive control, emotion regulation, and how one processes the perception of one’s self. Research indicates the positive influence of mindfulness training on immune function and overall brain function1, positively influencing outcomes including improved levels of performance on attentional tasks2, increased empathy3, and reduced physical symptoms and stress4, as well as positive changes in anxiety and depression.5 Group-based mindfulness cognitive behavioral therapy in women with sexual interest and arousal disorder have shown an improvement in sexual desire, distress, and function measures.6-8
 
 
 
 We expect that we will be able to recruit, enroll and retain females living with anorgasmia into a virtual, group-based mindfulness intervention.
 
 
 
 Subjects were recruited using social media and flyers for self-referral and physician-referral methods. The study enrolled 10 females with self-reported lifelong anorgasmia with an average age of 39 years (±10.4), 90% white, 10% black. All subjects reported being non-Hispanic or Latina, identified as straight, and in monogamous relationships. Menopause status varied among subjects. We conducted an 8-week virtual, group mindfulness series incorporating mindfulness education, writing exercises, opportunities for meditation practice, with time for discussion and sharing. Subjects received daily reminders to listen to prescribed mindfulness meditations at home. Meditation usage was tracked using REDCap including which recording was listened to, session duration, and session frequency.
 
 
 
 Of 26 women screened, 10 enrolled in the study. Two had scheduling conflicts, 2 never attended a session, and 6 attended at least four sessions. Of these, the average attendance was 75% during each session and each subject attending an average of 6 sessions. Subjects were asked to rate (0-10, where “0” is Not at all Appropriate and “10” is Very Appropriate) the degree to which group and virtual formats were appropriate (8.33 ±1.89, 8.17±2.62), and the weekly meeting schedule (7.33 ±2.56). At-home recording platform was deemed easy to use (8.83 ±1.67), however, subjects felt the recordings were moderately beneficial and convenient (6.33 ±1.11 and 5.17 ±1.86). Mindfulness meditations were listened to 173 times, with a subject mean of 28.8 (±20.7) times. When session duration was adjusted for excessive time, the mean mindfulness duration was 15.5 (±9.2) minutes. With a sample of only 8 subjects, we cautioned against reporting any pre-to-post analyses for the Female Sexual Function Index, the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale-10, PROMIS-Sexual Function, PROMIS-Depression SF or PROMIS-Anxiety SF. Completion rates at both the pre- and post- time points was 75%.
 
 
 
 The virtual group-based mindfulness intervention was generally perceived to be appropriate and easy to use for females presenting with anorgasmia and enabled participation from all over the US. With this success, future research with a larger sample size and a comparison group are warranted.

It is widely used in the fields of anxiety relief, fear therapy, and depression regulation. However, objectively evaluating the emotional intervention effect of virtual reality technology is a difficult problem. The main purpose of this paper is to explore the use of EEG signals to identify individual emotional states in virtual reality scenarios and to improve the computational efficiency and recognition accuracy of emotional valence. To induce the target emotional state of the participants, we established a relatively standard emotion-induced virtual reality video library. The EEG data of the participants were collected synchronously as they watched the virtual reality video. The results show that the emotion recognition performance of multiple features (energy spectrum, differential entropy, differential asymmetry, and rational asymmetry) is better than that of a single feature. The radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) performed better than the deep belief network (DBN). RBFNN achieves the highest average classification accuracy of 91.1%. By combining the feature selection (F-test) method with the RBFNN, an ideal classification performance can be maintained with computational efficiency improvements. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the features extracted from the theta band outperform features extracted from other bands in emotional valence decoding. These results may contribute to the application of EEG-based affective computing technology in the field of psychological rehabilitation and assessment.",2023,30,0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 2023 7th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing'},"{'bibtex': '@Book{Pei2023EEGbasedER,\n author = {Guanxiong Pei and Cunhang Fan and Taihao Li and Jia Jin and Rui Wang},\n booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2023 7th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing},\n journal = {Proceedings of the 2023 7th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing},\n title = {EEG-based Emotion Recognition in Immersive Virtual Reality: Meeting the Requirement of Accuracy and Computational Efficiency},\n year = {2023}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '35193292', 'name': 'Guanxiong Pei'}, {'authorId': '117639306', 'name': 'Cunhang Fan'}, {'authorId': '2149199629', 'name': 'Taihao Li'}, {'authorId': '2152331555', 'name': 'Jia Jin'}, {'authorId': '2220599079', 'name': 'Rui Wang'}]","[{'paperId': '2462722da0ca4525a8901df1256db3ec704bcd0c', 'title': 'A Dataset for Emotion Recognition Using Virtual Reality and EEG (DER-VREEG): Emotional State Classification Using Low-Cost Wearable VR-EEG Headsets', 'abstract': 'Emotions are viewed as an important aspect of human interactions and conversations, and allow effective and logical decision making.

This study aims to use a virtual reality (VR) headset to induce four classes of emotions (happy, scared, calm, and bored), to collect brainwave samples using a low-cost wearable EEG headset, and to run popular classifiers to compare the most feasible ones that can be used for this particular setup. Firstly, we attempt to build an immersive VR database that is accessible to the public and that can potentially assist with emotion recognition studies using virtual reality stimuli. Secondly, we use a low-cost wearable EEG headset that is both compact and small, and can be attached to the scalp without any hindrance, allowing freedom of movement for participants to view their surroundings inside the immersive VR stimulus. Finally, we evaluate the emotion recognition system by using popular machine learning algorithms and compare them for both intra-subject and inter-subject classification. The results obtained here show that the prediction model for the four-class emotion classification performed well, including the more challenging inter-subject classification, with the support vector machine (SVM Class Weight kernel) obtaining 85.01% classification accuracy.

The motivation for this study is therefore to discover a combination of emotion features and recognition method that will produce the best result in building an efficient emotion recognizer in an affective system. We introduced a shifted tanh normalization scheme to realize the inverse Fisher transformation applied to the DEAP physiological dataset and consequently performed series of experiments using the Radial Basis Function Artificial Neural Networks (RBFANN). In our experiments, we have compared the performances of digital image based feature extraction techniques such as the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG), Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and the Histogram of Images (HIM). These feature extraction techniques were utilized to extract discriminatory features from the multimodal DEAP dataset of physiological signals. Experimental results obtained indicate that the best recognition accuracy was achieved with the EEG modality data using the HIM features extraction technique and classification done along the dominance emotion dimension.

An exploratory study involving 60 participants was performed, recording electroencephalographic and electrocardiographic signals using wearable devices. The real vs. virtual psychological comparison was performed using self-assessment emotional response tests, whereas the physiological comparison was performed through Support Vector Machine algorithms, endowed with an effective feature selection procedure for a set of state-of-the-art metrics quantifying cardiovascular and brain linear and nonlinear dynamics. We included an initial calibration phase, using standardized 2D and 360° emotional stimuli, to increase the accuracy of the model. The self-assessments of the physical and virtual museum support the use of IVEs in emotion research. The 2-class (high/low) system accuracy was 71.52% and 77.08% along the arousal and valence dimension, respectively, in the physical museum, and 75.00% and 71.08% in the virtual museum.

Electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that inherent negatively valent contexts modulate cortical face processing as assessed with ERP components. However, it is not well understood whether learned (rather than inherent) and three-dimensional aversive contexts similarly modulate the neural processing of faces. Using full immersive virtual reality (VR) and mobile EEG techniques, 25 participants underwent a differential fear conditioning paradigm, in which one virtual room was paired with an aversive noise burst (threat context) and another with a nonaversive noise burst (safe context). Subsequently, avatars with neutral or angry facial expressions were presented in the threat and safe contexts while EEG was recorded. Analysis of the late positive potential (LPP), which presumably indicates motivational salience, revealed a significant interaction of context (threat vs. safe) and face type (neutral vs. angry). Neutral faces evoked increased LPP amplitudes in threat versus safe contexts, while angry faces evoked increased early LPP amplitudes regardless of context.

In recent years, affective computing systems using physiological signals, such as ECG, GSR and EEG has shown very promising results. However, like many other machine learning studies involving physiological signals, the bottle neck is always around the database acquisition and the annotation process. To investigate potential ways to address this small sample problem, this paper introduces a Deep Belief Networks (DBN) based learning system for the EEG-based affective processing system. Through the greedy-layer pretraining using unlabeled data as well as a supervised fine-tuning process, the DBN-based approaches significantly reduced the number of labeled samples required. The DBN methods also acted as an application specific feature selector, by examining the weight vector between the input feature vector and the first invisible layer, we can gain much needed insights on the spatial or spectral locations of the most discriminating features. In this study, DBNs are trained on the narrow-band spectral features extracted from multichannel EEG recordings. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed DBN-based learning system, we carried out an subject-independent affective states classification experiments on the DEAP database to classify 2-dimensional affect states. As a baseline to the proposed DBN approach, the same classification problem was also carried out using support vector machines (SVMs) and one-way ANOVA based feature selection process. The classification results shown that the proposed framework using Deep Belief Networks not only provided better classification performance, but also significantly lower the number of labeled data required to train such machine learning systems.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 21, 'citationCount': 24, 'journal': {'pages': '148-153', 'name': '2016 Digital Media Industry & Academic Forum (DMIAF)'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Xu2016EEGbasedAS,\n author = {Haiyan Xu and K.

55,916d784a12756102f87b803805586dfed5351860,Emotion Regulation Using Virtual Environments and Real-Time fMRI Neurofeedback,"Neurofeedback (NFB) enables the voluntary regulation of brain activity, with promising applications to enhance and recover emotion and cognitive processes, and their underlying neurobiology. It remains unclear whether NFB can be used to aid and sustain complex emotions, with ecological validity implications. We provide a technical proof of concept of a novel real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) NFB procedure. Using rtfMRI-NFB, we enabled participants to voluntarily enhance their own neural activity while they experienced complex emotions. The rtfMRI-NFB software (FRIEND Engine) was adapted to provide a virtual environment as brain computer interface (BCI) and musical excerpts to induce two emotions (tenderness and anguish), aided by participants' preferred personalized strategies to maximize the intensity of these emotions. Eight participants from two experimental sites performed rtfMRI-NFB on two consecutive days in a counterbalanced design. On one day, rtfMRI-NFB was delivered to participants using a region of interest (ROI) method, while on the other day using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Our multimodal VR/NFB approach was technically feasible and robust as a method for real-time measurement of the neural correlates of complex emotional states and their voluntary modulation. Guided by the color changes of the virtual environment BCI during rtfMRI-NFB, participants successfully increased in real time, the activity of the septo-hypothalamic area and the amygdala during the ROI based rtfMRI-NFB, and successfully evoked distributed patterns of brain activity classified as tenderness and anguish during SVM-based rtfMRI-NFB. Offline fMRI analyses confirmed that during tenderness rtfMRI-NFB conditions, participants recruited the septo-hypothalamic area and other regions ascribed to social affiliative emotions (medial frontal / temporal pole and precuneus). During anguish rtfMRI-NFB conditions, participants recruited the amygdala and other dorsolateral prefrontal and additional regions associated with negative affect. These findings were robust and were demonstrable at the individual subject level, and were reflected in self-reported emotion intensity during rtfMRI-NFB, being observed with both ROI and SVM methods and across the two sites. Our multimodal VR/rtfMRI-NFB protocol provides an engaging tool for brain-based interventions to enhance emotional states in healthy subjects and may find applications in clinical conditions associated with anxiety, stress and impaired empathy among others.",2018,76,59,"{'name': 'Frontiers in Neurology', 'volume': '9'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lorenzetti2018EmotionRU,\n author = {V.

Data from 523 participants were collected in a single night. The exploratory experiment was designed as a collective computer game where players manipulated mental states of relaxation and concentration with neurofeedback targeting modulation of relative spectral power in alpha and beta frequency ranges. Besides validating robust time-of-night effects, gender differences and distinct spectral power patterns for the two mental states, our results also show differences in neurofeedback learning outcome. The unusually large sample size allowed us to detect unprecedented speed of learning changes in the power spectrum (~ 1 min). Moreover, we found that participants' baseline brain activity predicted subsequent neurofeedback beta training, indicating state-dependent learning. Besides revealing these training effects, which are relevant for BCI applications, our results validate a novel platform engaging art and science and fostering the understanding of brains under natural conditions."", 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 47, 'citationCount': 68, 'journal': {'volume': '10', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Kovacevic2015MyVD,\n author = {Natasha Kovacevic and P.

Although intravenous ketamine infusions can lift mood within hours, the current review describes how intranasal ketamine administration can have ultra-rapid antidepressant effects, beginning within minutes (5–40 minutes) and lasting hours, but with repeated treatments needed for sustained antidepressant actions. Research in rodents suggests that increased synaptogenesis in PFC may contribute to the prolonged benefit of ketamine administration, beginning hours after administration. However, these data cannot explain the relief that occurs within minutes of intranasal ketamine delivery. We hypothesize that the ultra-rapid effects of intranasal administration in humans may be due to ketamine blocking the NMDAR circuits that generate the emotional representations of pain (eg, Brodmann Areas 24 and 25, insular cortex), cortical areas that can be overactive in depression and which sit above the nasal epithelium. In contrast, NMDAR blockade in the dorsolateral PFC following systemic administration of ketamine may contribute to cognitive deficits. This novel view may help to explain how intravenous ketamine can treat the symptoms of depression yet worsen the symptoms of schizophrenia.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 84, 'citationCount': 25, 'journal': {'volume': '21', 'pages': '12 - 22', 'name': 'CNS Spectrums'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Opler2015AmelioratingTD,\n author = {L.

We investigated the feasibility of training healthy humans to self-regulate the hemodynamic activity of the amygdala, which plays major roles in emotional processing. Participants in the experimental group were provided with ongoing information about the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activity in the left amygdala (LA) and were instructed to raise the BOLD rtfMRI signal by contemplating positive autobiographical memories. A control group was assigned the same task but was instead provided with sham feedback from the left horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (HIPS) region. In the LA, we found a significant BOLD signal increase due to rtfMRI neurofeedback training in the experimental group versus the control group. This effect persisted during the Transfer run without neurofeedback. For the individual subjects in the experimental group the training effect on the LA BOLD activity correlated inversely with scores on the Difficulty Identifying Feelings subscale of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. The whole brain data analysis revealed significant differences for Happy Memories versus Rest condition between the experimental and control groups. Functional connectivity analysis of the amygdala network revealed significant widespread correlations in a fronto-temporo-limbic network.

The neural basis of this intricate cognitive architecture has not been investigated thus far. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging while subjects imagined their own actions toward another person (self-agency) which either conformed or were counter to a social value and were associated with pride or guilt, respectively. Imagined actions of another person toward the subjects (other-agency) in accordance with or counter to a value were associated with gratitude or indignation/anger. As hypothesized, superior anterior temporal lobe (aTL) activity increased with conceptual detail in all conditions. During self-agency, activity in the anterior ventromedial prefrontal cortex correlated with pride and guilt, whereas activity in the subgenual cingulate solely correlated with guilt. In contrast, indignation/anger activated lateral orbitofrontal-insular cortices. Pride and gratitude additionally evoked mesolimbic and basal forebrain activations. Our results demonstrate that social values emerge from coactivation of stable abstract social conceptual representations in the superior aTL and context-dependent moral sentiments encoded in fronto-mesolimbic regions.

Recent studies suggest the involvement of frontal cortical regions in the modulation of amygdala reactivity and the mediation of effective emotion regulation. However, within-subject inter-regional connectivity between amygdala and prefrontal cortex in the context of affect regulation is unknown. Here, using psychophysiological interaction analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we show that activity in specific areas of the frontal cortex (dorsolateral, dorsal medial, anterior cingulate, orbital) covaries with amygdala activity and that this functional connectivity is dependent on the reappraisal task. Moreover, strength of amygdala coupling with orbitofrontal cortex and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex predicts the extent of attenuation of negative affect following reappraisal.

This approach is distinctly different from spatially localized real‐time implementations, since it does not require prior assumptions about functional localization and individual performance strategies, and has the ability to provide feedback based on intuitive translations of brain state rather than localized fluctuations. Thus this approach provides the capability for a new class of experimental designs in which real‐time feedback control of the stimulus is possible—rather than using a fixed paradigm, experiments can adaptively evolve as subjects receive brain‐state feedback. In this report, we describe our implementation and characterize its performance capabilities. We observed ∼80% classification accuracy using whole brain, block‐design, motor data. Within both left and right motor task conditions, important differences exist between the initial transient period produced by task switching (changing between rapid left or right index finger button presses) and the subsequent stable period during sustained activity. Further analysis revealed that very high accuracy is achievable during stable task periods, and that the responsiveness of the classifier to changes in task condition can be much faster than signal time‐to‐peak rates. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of this implementation with respect to behavioral task, suggesting that our results are applicable across a spectrum of cognitive domains. Beyond basic research, this technology can complement electroencephalography‐based brain computer interface research, and has potential applications in the areas of biofeedback rehabilitation, lie detection, learning studies, virtual reality‐based training, and enhanced conscious awareness.

Few measures have been developed specifically to assess individual differences in the use of emotion regulation strategies. This paper reports on a new self-report instrument designed to assess the frequency with which adolescents use both functional and dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies, which draw on both internal (intrapersonal) and external (interpersonal) resources to regulate emotions. The new measure was used in a cross-sectional survey of 225 adolescents. Factor analyses supported the structure of the measure, which has four scales: ‘internal-functional’, ‘internal-dysfunctional’, ‘external-functional’ and ‘external-dysfunctional’ emotion regulation. The new measure demonstrated good psychometric properties. Frequent use of dysfunctional emotion regulation was significantly positively correlated with parent reports of level of emotional and behavioural problems, and also with self-reported level of psychosomatic health problems. Frequent use of functional emotion regulation was significantly positively correlated with self-reported quality of life across a number of different dimensions. These results provide evidence for the validity of the measure. The results also highlight that assessment of both functional and dysfunctional emotion regulation is important.\u2009Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 26, 'citationCount': 162, 'journal': {'volume': '14', 'pages': '145-156', 'name': 'Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Phillips2007ANS,\n author = {K.

We also test whether PFC and amygdala regions are engaged during emotion regulation in older (62- to 64-year-old) rather than younger individuals. We measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging as participants regulated (increased or decreased) their affective responses or attended to negative picture stimuli. We also collected saliva samples for 1 week at home for cortisol assay. Consistent with previous work in younger samples, increasing negative affect resulted in ventral lateral, dorsolateral, and dorsomedial regions of PFC and amygdala activation. In contrast to previous work, decreasing negative affect did not produce the predicted robust pattern of higher PFC and lower amygdala activation. Individuals demonstrating the predicted effect (decrease < attend in the amygdala), however, exhibited higher signal in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) for the same contrast. Furthermore, participants displaying higher VMPFC and lower amygdala signal when decreasing compared with the attention control condition evidenced steeper, more normative declines in cortisol over the course of the day.

Control over the endogenous pain modulatory system is a particularly important target because it could enable a unique mechanism for clinical control over pain. Here, we found that by using real-time functional MRI (rtfMRI) to guide training, subjects were able to learn to control activation in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), a region putatively involved in pain perception and regulation. When subjects deliberately induced increases or decreases in rACC fMRI activation, there was a corresponding change in the perception of pain caused by an applied noxious thermal stimulus. Control experiments demonstrated that this effect was not observed after similar training conducted without rtfMRI information, or using rtfMRI information derived from a different brain region, or sham rtfMRI information derived previously from a different subject. Chronic pain patients were also trained to control activation in rACC and reported decreases in the ongoing level of chronic pain after training. These findings show that individuals can gain voluntary control over activation in a specific brain region given appropriate training, that voluntary control over activation in rACC leads to control over pain perception, and that these effects were powerful enough to impact severe, chronic clinical pain.', 'year': 2005, 'referenceCount': 124, 'citationCount': 821, 'journal': {'volume': '102 51', 'pages': '\n          18626-31\n        ', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{DeCharms2005ControlOB,\n author = {R.

Discussion is organized around processes of reward and memory formation that occur during approach and consummatory phases of affiliation. Appetitive and consummatory reward processes are mediated independently by the activity of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA)-nucleus accumbens shell (NAS) pathway and the central corticolimbic projections of the u-opiate system of the medial basal arcuate nucleus, respectively, although these two projection systems functionally interact across time. We next explicate the manner in which DA and glutamate interact in both the VTA and NAS to form incentive-encoded contextual memory ensembles that are predictive of reward derived from affiliative objects. Affiliative stimuli, in particular, are incorporated within contextual ensembles predictive of affiliative reward via: (a) the binding of affiliative stimuli in the rostral circuit of the medial extended amygdala and subsequent transmission to the NAS shell; (b) affiliative stimulus-induced opiate potentiation of DA processes in the VTA and NAS; and (c) permissive or facilitatory effects of gonadal steroids, oxytocin (in interaction with DA), and vasopressin on (i) sensory, perceptual, and attentional processing of affiliative stimuli and (ii) formation of social memories. Among these various processes, we propose that the capacity to experience affiliative reward via opiate functioning has a disproportionate weight in determining individual differences in affiliation. We delineate sources of these individual differences, and provide the first human data that support an association between opiate functioning and variation in trait affiliation.', 'year': 2005, 'referenceCount': 766, 'citationCount': 814, 'journal': {'volume': '28 3', 'pages': '\n          313-50; discussion 350-95\n        ', 'name': 'The Behavioral and brain sciences'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Depue2005ANM,\n author = {R.

Biofeedback relaxation provides an experimental model to explore neural mechanisms contributing to emotional representations and intentional autonomic control. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore neural mechanisms contributing to integration of volitional intent, self-representation, and autonomic states of arousal, embodied within performance of a biofeedback relaxation exercise. Data were obtained from 17 subjects to assess brain activity during relaxation in which a visual index of electrodermal arousal was modulated by accuracy (addition of random ""noise"") or sensitivity (by scalar adjustments of feedback). A central matrix of cortical, subcortical and brainstem autonomic centres was activated during biofeedback relaxation, as well as regions that mediate visual and somatesthetic representations and executive control. Anterior cingulate, amygdala, and insula activity was modulated by task manipulations that increased demand on processing interoceptive representations, while variation in anterior insula activity reflected an interaction between accuracy and sensitivity of feedback.

Using event-related fMRI, we tested the hypothesis that voluntary modulation of negative emotion is associated with changes in neural activity within the amygdala. Negative and neutral pictures were presented with instructions to either maintain the emotional response or passively view the picture without regulating the emotion. Each picture presentation was followed by a delay, after which subjects indicated how they currently felt via a response keypad. Consistent with previous reports, greater signal change was observed in the amygdala during the presentation of negative compared to neutral pictures. No significant effect of instruction was found during the picture presentation component of the trial. However, a prolonged increase in signal change was observed in the amygdala when subjects maintained the negative emotional response during the delay following negative picture offset. This increase in amygdalar signal due to the active maintenance of negative emotion was significantly correlated with subjects' self-reported dispositional levels of negative affect.

Taken separately, specific studies vary in task dimensions and in type(s) of emotion studied and are limited by statistical power and sensitivity. By examining findings across studies, we sought to determine if common or segregated patterns of activations exist across various emotional tasks. We reviewed 55 PET and fMRI activation studies (yielding 761 individual peaks) which investigated emotion in healthy subjects. Peak activation coordinates were transformed into a standard space and plotted onto canonical 3-D brain renderings. We divided the brain into 20 nonoverlapping regions, and characterized each region by its responsiveness across individual emotions (positive, negative, happiness, fear, anger, sadness, disgust), to different induction methods (visual, auditory, recall/imagery), and in emotional tasks with and without cognitive demand. Our review yielded the following summary observations: (1) The medial prefrontal cortex had a general role in emotional processing; (2) fear specifically engaged the amygdala; (3) sadness was associated with activity in the subcallosal cingulate; (4) emotional induction by visual stimuli activated the occipital cortex and the amygdala; (5) induction by emotional recall/imagery recruited the anterior cingulate and insula; (6) emotional tasks with cognitive demand also involved the anterior cingulate and insula.

We investigated, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and healthy volunteers, how the amygdala interacts with other cortical regions while subjects are judging the sex of faces with negative, positive, or neutral emotion. The data were analyzed by a subtractive method, then, to clarify possible interaction among regions within the brain, several kinds of analysis (i.e., a correlation analysis, a psychophysiological interaction analysis and a structural equation modeling) were performed. Overall, significant activation was observed in the bilateral fusiform gyrus, medial temporal lobe, prefrontal cortex, and the right parietal lobe during the task. The results of subtraction between the conditions showed that the left amygdala, right orbitofrontal cortex, and temporal cortices were predominantly involved in the processing of the negative expressions. The right angular gyrus was involved in the processing of the positive expressions when the negative condition was subtracted from the positive condition. The correlation analysis showed that activity in the left amygdala positively correlated with activity in the left prefrontal cortex under the negative minus neutral subtraction condition. The psychophysiological interaction revealed that the neural responses in the left amygdala and the right prefrontal cortex underwent the condition-specific changes between the negative and positive face conditions. The right amygdaloid activity also had an interactive effect with activity in the right hippocampus and middle temporal gyrus. These results may suggest that the left and right amygdalae play a differential role in effective processing of facial expressions in collaboration with other cortical or subcortical regions, with the left being related with the bilateral prefrontal cortex, and the right with the right temporal lobe.', 'year': 2001, 'referenceCount': 59, 'citationCount': 237, 'journal': {'volume': '13', 'pages': '1035-1047', 'name': 'Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Iidaka2001NeuralIO,\n author = {T.

To address this issue, brain activation was measured in normal male subjects while they either responded in a normal manner to erotic film excerpts or voluntarily attempted to inhibit the sexual arousal induced by viewing erotic stimuli.

In addition, the attempted inhibition of the sexual arousal generated by viewing the erotic stimuli was associated with activation of the right superior frontal gyrus and right anterior cingulate gyrus.

This decrease correlated with a simultaneous increase in rCBF in the right prefrontal cortex, a neocortical region implicated in regulating emotional responses.

In particular we suggest that activations common to all subjects reflect aspects of functional anatomy that may be ""typical"" of the population from which that group was sampled. These commonalities can be identified by a conjunction analysis of the activation effects in which the contrasts, testing for an activation, are specified separately for each subject. A conjunction is the joint refutation of multiple null hypotheses, in this instance, of no activation in any subject. The motivation behind this use of conjunctions is that fixed-effect analyses are generally more ""sensitive"" than equivalent random-effect analyses. This is because fixed-effect analyses can harness the large degrees of freedom and small scan-to-scan variability (relative to the variability in responses from subject to subject) when assessing the significance of an estimated response. The price one pays for the apparent sensitivity of fixed-effect analyses is that the ensuing inferences pertain to, and only to, the subjects studied. However, a conjunction analysis, using a fixed-effect model, allows one to infer: (i) that every subject studied activated and (ii) that at least a certain proportion of the population would have shown this effect. The second inference depends upon a meta-analytic formulation in terms of a confidence region for this proportion. This approach retains the sensitivity of fixed-effect analyses when the inference that only a substantial proportion of the population activates is sufficient.', 'year': 1999, 'referenceCount': 15, 'citationCount': 1102, 'journal': {'volume': '10', 'pages': '385-396', 'name': 'NeuroImage'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Friston1999MultisubjectFS,\n author = {Karl J.

The pathways involve transmission to the amygdala from sensory processing areas in the thalamus and cortex. Within the amygdala, the lateral nucleus receives the sensory inputs and the central nucleus provides the interface with motor systems controlling specific defense responses. Internal connections between the lateral and central nuclei allow the structures involved in receiving inputs and generating outputs to communicate. This circuitry contributes to stress reactions in two important ways. First, by way of these pathways environmental events that are interpreted as threatening activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and thereby initiate so-called stress reactions. Second, nuclear regions of the amygdala contain receptors for adrenal steroids. Steroids released from the adrenal gland as a result of amygdala activity can therefore influence the processing of the environment by the amygdala. Although the amygdala is likely to play a major role in stress responses, relatively little work has been done to elucidate the nature of its role. This is an important topic for future research aimed at understanding how the biological cascade that constitutes the stress response fits into a broader network involved in emotional and cognitive information processing functions. In contrast to other models of stress, fear conditioning allows as to approach this complex problem armed with a clear understanding of major aspects of the circuitry involved in processing stress-inducing stimuli.', 'year': 1994, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 100, 'journal': {'volume': '6', 'pages': '231-237', 'name': 'Seminars in Neuroscience'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{LeDoux1994TheAC,\n author = {Joseph E LeDoux},\n journal = {Seminars in Neuroscience},\n pages = {231-237},\n title = {The amygdala: contributions to fear and stress},\n volume = {6},\n year = {1994}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2332694', 'name': 'Joseph E LeDoux'}]}, {'paperId': 'f82f152244b1cb861db0f290d55302011aee28dc', 'title': 'Development and validation of brief measures of positive and negative affect: the PANAS scales.', 'abstract': 'In recent studies of the structure of affect, positive and negative affect have consistently emerged as two dominant and relatively independent dimensions.

This study employed a randomized, controlled and longitudinal design to investigate the effect of a secularized analytical compassion meditation program, cognitive-based compassion training (CBCT), on empathic accuracy. Twenty-one healthy participants received functional MRI scans while completing an empathic accuracy task, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), both prior to and after completion of either CBCT or a health discussion control group. Upon completion of the study interventions, participants randomized to CBCT and were significantly more likely than control subjects to have increased scores on the RMET and increased neural activity in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC).

Americans: The Moderating Role of Acculturation","Two widely studied strategies of emotion regulation are suppression (inhibiting emotional response) and reappraisal (reframing an emotional experience). Suppression has been associated with greater instances of internalizing (i.e., depression) and externalizing (i.e., gambling) problems. However, among Asian individuals where suppression is encouraged in their collectivistic culture, the opposite effect has been observed. This, however, does not consider Asian Americans, who may be exposed to both collectivistic and western, individualistic cultural norms. One way to account for this cultural discrepancy is through examining acculturation, the extent to which an individual is assimilated into their host or heritage culture. The present study aimed to examine whether acculturation influences the strength of the association between emotion regulation strategies (suppression and reappraisal) and internalizing/externalizing problems in a sample of Filipino Americans. Participants completed a virtual gambling task assessing their externalizing problems, as well as a series of questionnaires assessing their acculturation, emotion regulation strategy frequencies, and internalizing problems. The results of the study showed that Filipino Americans who retain more Filipino cultural norms may make less low-risk decisions when engaging in cognitive reappraisal.",2023,134,0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Manalastas2023EmotionRS,\n author = {G.

The aim of the present study was to determine the mechanisms underlying the impact of self-stigma on depression and anxiety in a collectivistic culture such as the Philippines. Specifically, this study sought to examine: (1) the mediating role of self-criticism on the impact of self-stigma on depression and anxiety, and (2) the moderating role of interdependent self-construal on the impact of self-criticism on depression and anxiety in Filipinos. Surveys measuring self-stigma, self-criticism, interdependent self-construal, depression, and anxiety symptoms were administered to 312 adolescents in rural communities in the Philippines. Using structural equation modeling, findings revealed indirect effects of self-stigma on both depression and anxiety via self-criticism. Findings confirmed that interdependent self-construal attenuate the detrimental impact of self-criticism on depression and anxiety in collectivistic contexts. This study offers novel insights about the underlying mechanisms that operate in the impact of self-stigma on depression and anxiety symptoms among individuals in collectivist contexts. We highlight that self-criticism may have both adaptive and maladaptive functions in collectivist cultures. The study provides implications on the importance of culturally sensitive clinical interventions in preventing depression and anxiety by combating self-stigma and the negative aspect of self-criticism in collectivist cultures.

Participants also reported on perceived regulatory effort, difficulty, and success after deploying each emotion regulation strategy. In 2 samples of participants (N = 142), reappraisal (vs. acceptance) was associated with larger decreases in negative and larger increases in positive emotions, both during the film clips and recovery period. However, acceptance was perceived as less difficult to deploy than reappraisal, and was associated with a smaller dampening of skin conductance level (indicating more successful regulation) during the film clips in 1 sample. These results suggest that reappraisal and acceptance may exert differential short-term effects: Whereas reappraisal is more effective for changing subjective experiences in the short term, acceptance may be less difficult to deploy and be more effective at changing one’s physiological response. Thus, these 2 strategies may both be considered “effective” for different reasons.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 81, 'citationCount': 136, 'journal': {'volume': '18', 'pages': '58–74', 'name': 'Emotion'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Troy2017CognitiveRA,\n author = {Allison S.

Only those studies have been included in the review which reported either cognitive reappraisal or expressive suppression in their findings. Review indicates that individualistic cultures prefer emotional expression to regulate emotions while collectivistic cultures, such as in Pakistan, focus more on expressive suppression. Emotional suppression can cause mental disease, physiological illness, and poor social and psychological adjustment. To sum up, culture predicts whether individuals are motivated to express or suppress their emotions. Collectivist culture encourages greatest control on emotion expression while interacting with family and friends with more emphasis on maintaining social harmony. On the other hand, individualistic culture endorses comparatively less expression of negative emotions especially towards strangers.

However, there is mixed evidence on the implementation of emotion regulation strategies across the life span. To clarify the discrepancies in the literature, we examined the modulating influence of contextual factors in understanding emotion regulation strategy use in older and young adults. Forty-eight older adults and forty-nine young adults completed a retrospective survey inquiring about the use of emotion regulation strategies in emotion-eliciting situations experienced over the preceding 2 weeks. We used factor analysis to establish clusters of emotion regulation strategies, resulting in cognitive strategies, acceptance, and maladaptive strategies. Overall, we found context-dependent age-related differences in emotion regulation strategy use. Specifically, older adults reported greater use of acceptance than young adults in situations of moderate intensity and in situations that evoke anxiety and sadness. In addition, older adults reported using maladaptive strategies to a lesser extent in high- and moderate-intensity situations and in situations that elicit anxiety and sadness when compared with young adults. There were no age-related differences in the use of cognitive strategies across contexts. Older adults, compared to young adults, reported less use of maladaptive strategies and greater use of acceptance than young adults, which suggests that the enhanced emotional functioning observed later in life may be due to a shift in strategy implementation.

To characterise the effect of reappraisal on risk taking, we systematically varied both the goal of regulation and the value of the decision options. Participants engaged in two reappraisal strategies with opposite goals, to increase (“emphasise”) or decrease (“de-emphasise”) the importance of an upcoming decision, during the presentation of cues signalling monetary decisions. The expected value of taking a risk was systematically varied across decisions such that a risky choice could be beneficial or disadvantageous.

We examined one potential mediator that arises directly from emotion-regulatory effort (expression of positive emotion), and another mediator that does not involve emotion processes per se, but instead results from the link between regulation and self-processes (subjective inauthenticity). Across three studies, only inauthenticity mediated the link between habitual use of suppression and poor social functioning (lower relationship satisfaction, lower social support). These findings replicated across individuals socialized in Western and East Asian cultural contexts, younger and older adults, when predicting social functioning concurrently and a decade later, and even when broader adjustment was controlled. Thus, the social costs of suppression do not seem to be due to reduced positive emotion expression but rather the incongruence between inner-self and outer-behavior.

One possible mechanism may be smokers' emotion regulation strategies. Preliminary research among adolescents and young adults suggests that greater utilization of expressive suppression versus cognitive reappraisal is associated with higher rates of smoking initiation. There is limited research, however, on the role of emotion regulation strategies in smoking maintenance in adult smokers.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData from participants in a laboratory study (N = 121) were used to examine whether utilization of cognitive reappraisal and/or expressive suppression were related to smoking characteristics and subjective (i.e., mood, urge to smoke ratings) and behavioral reactions (i.e., Emotional Stroop Task performance, smoking behavior) to a mood induction procedure. Data were evaluated for the full sample and subsample who endorsed current depressive symptoms (n = 46).\n\n\nRESULTS\nFrequent reappraisal was associated with weaker expectancies that smoking alleviates unpleasant feelings, greater positive mood, and fewer depressive symptoms. In contrast, frequent suppression was related to longer smoking history and greater attentional bias to smoking cues on an Emotional Stroop Task. Among the depressed subsample, reappraisal moderated the effect of mood condition on smoking duration, number of cigarette puffs, and carbon monoxide boost.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results provide preliminary support that emotion regulation strategies may be associated with motivational correlates of smoking as well as actual smoking behavior among depressed smokers."", 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 44, 'citationCount': 73, 'journal': {'volume': '12 11', 'pages': '\n          1156-61\n        ', 'name': 'Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Fucito2010CognitiveRA,\n author = {L.

In the United States, the prevalence rate in Asian immigrants is high (26%-70%), with Southeast Asian men having the highest rate. Acculturation has been associated with smoking behavior in this ethnic group. Objective: The purposes of this meta-analysis are to describe the extent to which acculturation affects smoking behavior in Asian immigrants and to compare the direction and magnitude of the effect between subgroups by gender and age. Methods: Databases within PubMed, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO were searched. Twenty-one studies published in English or Korean from 1994 through 2005 met criteria, and 9 of these studies contained sufficient data. Among the 9 studies, 3 presented gender-specific data; thus, these studies were entered separately for men and women, making a total of 12 entries for final analysis. The odds ratio was used as an effect size statistic. The values of odds ratios were calculated from the data in the studies. Results: The average effect size for men was 0.53 (95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.99), indicating that acculturated men are 53% less likely to smoke than nonacculturated or ""traditional"" men. The average effect size for women was 5.26 (2.75-10.05), suggesting that acculturated women are 5 times more likely to smoke than traditional women. In adolescents, the average effect size was 1.92 (1.22-3.01), indicating that acculturated adolescents are almost 2 times more likely to smoke than traditional adolescents. Conclusions: Acculturation may have a protective effect on smoking behavior in Asian men and a harmful effect in Asian women and adolescents. The magnitude of effect is larger in women and adolescents than in men. Smoking cessation programs should target acculturated women, adolescents, and traditional men.', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 29, 'citationCount': 86, 'journal': {'volume': '23', 'pages': '67-73', 'name': 'The Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Choi2008EffectsOA,\n author = {Sarah E.

Their historical underpinnings, native core values, and traditions exert a crucial influence on their mental well-being.

The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is an instrument that factors a number of aspects of real-life decision-making. Although most SDIs are impaired on the IGT, there is a subgroup of them who perform normally on this task. One possible explanation for this differential performance is that impairment in decision-making is largely detected on the IGT when the use of drugs escalates in the face of rising adverse consequences. The aim of this study is to test this hypothesis, by examining if several real-life indices associated with escalation of addiction severity (as measured by the Addiction Severity Index -ASI-) are predictive of risky decisions, as revealed by impaired performance on different versions of the IGT. We administered the ASI and different versions of the IGT (the main IGT version, a variant IGT version, and two parallel versions of each) to a large sample of SDI. We used regression models to examine the predictive effects of the seven real-life domains assessed by the ASI on decision-making performance as measured by the IGT. We included in regression models both ASI-derived objective and subjective measures of each problem domain. Results showed (i) that several aspects of real-life functioning associated with addiction severity were moderate predictors of IGT decision-making performance; (ii) that the combined assessment of decision-making using different versions of the IGT yielded better predictive measures than assessment using isolated versions of the IGT; and (iii) that objective measures of real-life functioning were better predictors of decision-making performance on the IGT than subjective measures based on SDI's insight about their problems. These results support the notion that decision-making deficits as measured by the IGT are associated with a rise in real-life adverse consequences of addiction."", 'year': 2006, 'referenceCount': 39, 'citationCount': 53, 'journal': {'volume': '46', 'pages': '55-78', 'name': 'Psychologica Belgica'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Verdéjo-Garcia2006DecisionMakingAT,\n author = {A.

The assessment was done individually, in two meetings with an interval from 1 to 6 months between test and retest. RESULTS: The findings showed a significant moderate positive correlation between test-retest in the overall calculation. In the analysis by segments, a significant moderate positive correlation was found for blocks 4 and 5, whereas there were no significant correlations for blocks 1, 2 and 3. CONCLUSION: These data corroborate recent studies that found moderate correlations between test-retest measures of executive functions, and suggest that the IGT can be used to assess decision making over time if specific analyses are taken into account.', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 36, 'citationCount': 22, 'journal': {'volume': '59', 'pages': '279-285', 'name': 'Jornal Brasileiro De Psiquiatria'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Cardoso2010EstudoDF,\n author = {C.

Under the background of virtual knowledge community, based on motivation hierarchy model and integrated emotion theory, this paper takes “motivation-emotion-community commitment” as the main framework, and introduces multiple mediation and regulation functions to establish the relationship model of motivation hierarchy, integrated emotions, and community commitment. The results show that the user motivation follows the hierarchical structure of the layer-by-layer influence from the situational level to the personality level, that is, knowledge-seeking motivation and entertainment-seeking motivation at a situational level will positively affect social- interaction motivation at the contextual level, thereby enhancing user self-efficacy at personality level. Users have abundant integrated emotions toward the virtual knowledge community, namely, satisfaction, attachment, and identity, and such multi-integrated emotional model is more conducive for promoting community commitment of users. At the same time, attachment, identity, and satisfaction have an interactive complement, that is, when satisfaction is low, attachment and identity will complement and strengthen community commitment.",2021,71,4,"{'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology', 'volume': '12'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sun2021ResearchOT,\n author = {Bing Sun and Hongying Mao and Min-Yeong Kang},\n booktitle = {Frontiers in Psychology},\n journal = {Frontiers in Psychology},\n title = {Research on the Relationship Between Cross-Level Motivation, Integrated Emotion, and Virtual Knowledge Community Commitment},\n volume = {12},\n year = {2021}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2153220169', 'name': 'Bing Sun'}, {'authorId': '2044351242', 'name': 'Hongying Mao'}, {'authorId': '2111622100', 'name': 'Min-Yeong Kang'}]","[{'paperId': '66afe30cc8b655f21b7fa3d8c48fe9b76a45bd59', 'title': 'The relationships among community experience, community commitment, brand attitude, and purchase intention in social media', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 108, 'citationCount': 132, 'journal': {'volume': '49', 'pages': '475-488', 'name': 'Int.

Yet despite their proclaimed importance, research on their long-term effectiveness is surprisingly scarce. Furthermore, comparative research acknowledging the concepts' different theoretical roots and illuminating the differences in their long-term effectiveness is lacking. In addition, little is known about how competitive actions affect the long-term effectiveness of both concepts. This study makes a first attempt to address these research gaps and offers a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of customer satisfaction and customer–company identification in driving important customer outcomes over time. Latent growth analyses of rich longitudinal data from customers over nine measurement points spanning 43 weeks (n = 6,930) show that customer satisfaction and customer–company identification have positive initial effects on customers' loyalty and willingness to pay but differ in their ability to maintain these positive effects over time. Whereas the positive effects of customer satisfaction decrease more rapidly, the effects of customer–company identification are significantly more persistent. Analysis of the moderating effects of relative competitive advertising suggests that customer–company identification is more effective at immunizing customers against competitive actions."", 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 122, 'citationCount': 143, 'journal': {'volume': '78', 'pages': '102 - 78', 'name': 'Journal of Marketing'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Haumann2014FootprintsIT,\n author = {Till Haumann and Benjamin Quaiser and J.

The Internet makes participant relatively easy to switch for one VC to another VC that provides similar content or services. However, many VCs have failed due to the reluctance of members to continue their participation in these VCs. In volatile cyberspaces, VCs without specific domain knowledge may face challenges such as large populations, unstable memberships, and imperfect information and memory, which also affect knowledge flows within members. The most important aspect of VCs from the members’ perspective is the increase satisfaction, and engage behavioral intention to use VCs, but satisfaction does not always predict continuous usage. This study proposes a conceptual model based on commitment-trust theory (CTT) and investigates the continuance intention in VC. It seeks to theorize the antecedents and consequence of relationship commitment in the VCs and identify how CTT can be adapted in a knowledge sharing environment. The members of Programmer Club, a representative professional community in Taiwan, were chosen to participate in the survey, and 488 usable responses were collected in three months.

In light of these interesting but mixed findings, our research applies the motivation theory to investigate the effects of extrinsic and intrinsic motivators on system-use behavior in utilitarian, hedonic, and dual-purposed contexts. We then construct associated hypotheses and empirically test them by analyzing data collected from the literature. The results generally confirm our prediction that, in the context of utilitarian systems, extrinsic motivators are more important than intrinsic motivators, whereas, in the context of hedonic systems, intrinsic motivators play a more critical role than extrinsic motivators. The results thus substantiate our contention that, when information systems vary from utilitarian to hedonic, the most important determinants shift from extrinsic to intrinsic motivators.

The model builds upon McAdams's three-tier (traits, goals, and selves) conception of personality, adding a foundational level (psychological needs) beneath individual differences and incorporating social relations and cultural factors as higher level influences upon behavior and individual differences. New data (N= 3,665 in 21 cultures) are briefly presented showing that culture, self, motive, and trait variables each have independent effects upon subjective well-being (SWB) and showing that psychological need satisfaction (at the foundational level) mediates these effects as predicted. Consistent with McAdams and Pals's (2006) “fifth principle” of personality, culture had top-down effects upon self-level variables and moderated several of the relations to SWB.

A central concern in designing innovation contests is how many competitors to admit. Using a unique data set of 9,661 software contests, we provide evidence of two coexisting and opposing forces that operate when the number of competitors increases. Greater rivalry reduces the incentives to expend effort by individual solvers across competitors of all skill levels, while at the same time, increases the likelihood that at least one competitor will find an extreme-value solution. We show that the effort-reducing effect of greater rivalry dominates for less uncertain problems whereas the effect on the extreme value prevails for more uncertain problems. Adding competitors thus systematically increases overall contest performance for high-uncertainty problems. We also find that higher uncertainty reduces the negative effect of added competitors on incentives.

In this mode, an EIS may be used to help formulate problems and foster creativity -- thereby improving organizational effectiveness.EISs were found to contribute to gains in efficiency much more frequently than to gains in effectiveness.

We hypothesized that, in an organizational context, the firm-specific resources and organizational motivation of people who provide advice will predict the usefulness of advice.We investigated these theories in a study of employees of a global computer manufacturer. We collected survey and observational data on the relationships between information seekers and information providers; the number, diversity, resources, and motivations of information providers, and subjective ratings of the usefulness of the advice (from both parties in the exchange) and whether or not the advice solved information seekers' problems.We found that information providers gave useful advice and solved the problems of information seekers, despite their lack of a personal connection with the seekers.

In a longitudinal study of 107 users, intentions to use a specific system, measured after a one-hour introduction to the system, were correlated 0.35 with system use 14 weeks later. The intention-usage correlation was 0.63 at the end of this time period. Perceived usefulness strongly influenced peoples' intentions, explaining more than half of the variance in intentions at the end of 14 weeks. Perceived ease of use had a small but significant effect on intentions as well, although this effect subsided over time. Attitudes only partially mediated the effects of these beliefs on intentions.

From a review of prominent discussions of support functions, a rational typology was proposed that included six categories: Material Aid, Behavioral Assistance, Intimate Interaction, Feedback, and Positive Social Interaction. To empirically examine the structure of social support, a factor analysis was conducted on items from a scale of socially supportive behaviors. The four factors that subsequently emerged were labeled Directive Guidance, Non-directive Support, Positive Social Interaction, and Tangible Assistance.

This dependence model asserts that the primary issue in understanding breakup decisions is degree of dependence on a relationship. Dependence is great when important outcomes in the current relationship are not available elsewhere. Need satisfaction dependence measures identify important needs in a relationship and compare satisfaction of those needs in the current relationship to satisfaction in alternative relationships. Two longitudinal studies provide good support for the dependence model. Need satisfaction dependence measures significantly differentiated between subjects who remained in their relationships and those who voluntarily broke up. The studies also compared the model to simpler breakup models and assessed whether commitment mediates the link between dependence and breakup decisions. Why do individuals sometimes remain in relationships that are not terribly satisfying? This article advances a dependence model of breakups. The dependence model clarifies and extends concepts from interdependence theory (Kelley & Thibaut, 1978; Thibaut & Kelley, 1959), proposing that the decision to remain in or voluntarily end a given relationship is strongly related to the degree of dependence on that relationship. Dependence is asserted to be great when the most important needs a relationship fulfills cannot be gratified elsewhere. Thus, we suggest that an individual may sometimes remain in a relationship that is not terribly satisfying because of high dependence on that relationship—dissatisfying as it is, the relationship may nevertheless fulfill important needs that cannot be gratified in alternative relationships. From the outset, it is important to distinguish between the concepts of satisfaction and dependence.

The purpose of the current pilot study was to evaluate the acceptability and preliminary impact of using immersive virtual reality environments (IVREs) paired with a brief emotion regulation and risk reduction intervention (ER + IVRE) relative to this same intervention content paired with role-plays (ER + RP).


METHODS
Eighty-five adolescents attending middle school (grades 6th-8th; ages 12-15 years) in an urban northeast city were recruited and randomized to ER + IVRE (n = 44) or ER + RP (n = 41) and had complete data. Data examining acceptability, feasibility, sexual knowledge and attitudes, and ER were collected at baseline and 3 months after intervention completion. Analyses of covariance controlling for baseline scores were used to evaluate study outcomes. Within and between intervention effect sizes were calculated with effect sizes ≥.20 considered meaningful.


RESULTS
At the 3-month follow-up assessment, several within intervention condition effect sizes were found to exceed d = 0.20 across the measured sexual attitudes and ER outcomes. Between intervention analyses found that adolescents randomized to ER + IVRE attended more intervention sessions, reported less difficulty accessing ER strategies (d = 0.46), and reported higher emotional self-efficacy (d = 0.20) at the 3-month follow-up relative to adolescents randomized to the ER + RP intervention.

This study provides preliminary evidence that using virtual reality environments to enhance ER skill building in risk situations was acceptable, feasible to deliver, and positively impacted ER abilities.",2018,55,36,"{'name': 'Journal of Pediatric Psychology', 'pages': '425–435', 'volume': '44'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hadley2018MovingBR,\n author = {Wendy S Hadley and Christopher Houck and L.

This study explored relationships between adolescent condom use frequency and the brain\'s resting-state functional connectivity, to identify differential patterns of social-affective processing among sexually active youth.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, N\u2009=\u2009143 sexually active adolescents (68.5% male, Mage\u2009=\u200916.2\u2009years, SD\u2009=\u20091.06) completed magnetic resonance imaging and reported past 3-month frequency of condom use. Resting-state connectivity, seeded on a social region of the brain, the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), was assessed to determine its correspondence with protected sex (condom use).\n\n\nResults\nCondom use was associated with positive connectivity between the left TPJ and bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). This relationship was observed in adolescent males only; no connectivity differences were observed with adolescent females.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study reflects functional synchrony between nodes of the ""social brain,"" including the TPJ, and a region of planfulness and control, the IFG. The relationship between these regions suggests that adolescents who have more coordinated systems of communication between these critical components of the brain are more likely to be successful in planning and engaging in safer sexual decision-making; for young males, this differentiated more frequent from less frequent condom use.

The previously identified Stages of Change (or readiness to change) construct is an important dimension of the TTM, as it reflects the model’s critical assumption—behavior change occurs through a series of six stages: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance, and termination. The Processes of Change construct outlines the ten activities that individuals use to progress from stage to stage. Interventions that employ the TTM for behavior change should aim to accurately identify and match an individual’s specific processes of change to their stage of change to maximize efficacy. The Decisional Balance construct refers to an individual’s weighing of the pros and cons of their behavior change. Lastly, the Self-Efficacy construct outlines an individual’s confidence in their ability to not relapse when in high-risk situations that tempt them to engage in a specific behavior. Although the majority of the applications of TTM have focused on smoking cessation, the model has also been applied to other problem behaviors such as alcohol and substance abuse, eating disorders, and domestic violence. In addition to providing a comprehensive overview of the model, this article discusses the various applications of the TTM.

This technology, with its unique ability to simulate complex, real situations and contexts, offers researchers unprecedented opportunities to investigate human behavior in well controlled designs in the laboratory. One important application of VR is the investigation of pathological processes in mental disorders, especially anxiety disorders. Research on the processes underlying threat perception, fear, and exposure therapy has shed light on more general aspects of the relation between perception and emotion. Being by its nature virtual, i.e., simulation of reality, VR strongly relies on the adequate selection of specific perceptual cues to activate emotions. Emotional experiences in turn are related to presence, another important concept in VR, which describes the user’s sense of being in a VR environment. This paper summarizes current research into perception of fear cues, emotion, and presence, aiming at the identification of the most relevant aspects of emotional experience in VR and their mutual relations. A special focus lies on a series of recent experiments designed to test the relative contribution of perception and conceptual information on fear in VR. This strand of research capitalizes on the dissociation between perception (bottom–up input) and conceptual information (top-down input) that is possible in VR. Further, we review the factors that have so far been recognized to influence presence, with emotions (e.g., fear) being the most relevant in the context of clinical psychology. Recent research has highlighted the mutual influence of presence and fear in VR, but has also traced the limits of our current understanding of this relationship. In this paper, the crucial role of perception on eliciting emotional reactions is highlighted, and the role of arousal as a basic dimension of emotional experience is discussed. An interoceptive attribution model of presence is suggested as a first step toward an integrative framework for emotion research in VR.

It has been hypothesized that a mismatch in the timing of maturation between subcortical regions (involved in affect and reward processing) and prefrontal regions (involved in cognitive control) underlies the increase in risk-taking and sensation-seeking behaviors observed during adolescence. Most support for this ‘dual systems' hypothesis relies on cross-sectional data, and it is not known whether this pattern is present at an individual level. The current study utilizes longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to describe the developmental trajectories of regions associated with risk-taking and sensation-seeking behaviors, namely, the amygdala, nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Structural trajectories of gray matter volumes were analyzed using FreeSurfer in 33 participants aged 7-30 years, each of whom had at least three high-quality MRI scans spanning three developmental periods: late childhood, adolescence and early adulthood (total 152 scans). The majority of individuals in our sample showed relatively earlier maturation in the amygdala and/or NAcc compared to the PFC, providing evidence for a mismatch in the timing of structural maturation between these structures. We then related individual developmental trajectories to retrospectively assessed self-reported risk-taking and sensation-seeking behaviors during adolescence in a subsample of 24 participants. Analysis of this smaller sample failed to find a relationship between the presence of a mismatch in brain maturation and risk-taking and sensation-seeking behaviors during adolescence. Taken together, it appears that the developmental mismatch in structural brain maturation is present in neurotypically developing individuals. This pattern of development did not directly relate to self-reported behaviors at an individual level in our sample, highlighting the need for prospective studies combining anatomical and behavioral measures."", 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 51, 'citationCount': 292, 'journal': {'volume': '36', 'pages': '147 - 160', 'name': 'Developmental Neuroscience'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Mills2014TheDM,\n author = {K.

The utility of the model for predicting substance use was tested in two diverse populations of younger adolescents.\n\n\nMETHOD\nA survey was administered in classrooms to middle-school students in Westchester County, New York (N = 601) and Honolulu, Hawaii (N = 881). The New York sample was 8% African American, 5% Asian American, 47% Caucasian, 31% Hispanic, and 9% other ethnicity. The Hawaii sample was 21% Asian American, 8% Caucasian, 26% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 34% Filipino, and 10% other ethnicity. Structural equation modeling analyses tested pathways from the four regulation variables through six hypothesized mediators to a criterion construct of substance use (tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana).\n\n\nRESULTS\nResults were replicated across samples and were consistent with prediction. Unique contributions were found for good self-control and poor regulation, including both behavioral and emotional aspects. Good self-control had an inverse effect on substance use primarily through relations to higher levels of protective factors (e.g., academic competence). Poor regulation independently had a risk-promoting effect on substance use through relations to higher levels of risk factors (e.g., negative life events).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTwo field studies showed the dual-process model is robust across different populations.

Unintended pregnancy is a commonly used proxy measure for reproductive control.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing heterosexually active women participating in the National Survey of Family Growth Cycle 6 (n = 4521), we evaluated unintended pregnancy as a proxy measure for reproductive control. We identified four categories of women by self-reported pregnancy intention: (1) women reporting one unintended pregnancy, (2) women reporting two or more unintended pregnancies, (3) women reporting intentionally having no pregnancies and (4) women who reported that all pregnancies were intended (reference category). Polytomous logistic regression, weighted for the complex sampling design, provided estimates of odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty-one percent of women who reported having one unintended pregnancy went on to experience at least one additional unintended pregnancy. Being black, Hispanic, born to a mother who was <18 years at first birth, having multiple partners and age of first sexual debut (consensual or non-consensual) were significant predictors of multiple unintended pregnancies.

Therapy for people with alcoholism must address coping skills for facing high-risk situations. Therefore, it is important to develop tools to mimic such conditions. Cue exposure therapy (CET) provides high-risk situations during treatment, which raises the individual's ability to recognize that alcohol craving is being induced. Using CET, it is hard to simulate situations that induce alcohol craving. By contrast, virtual reality (VR) approaches can present realistic situations that cannot be experienced directly in CET. Therefore, we hypothesized that is possible to model social pressure situations using VR. We developed a VR system for inducing alcohol craving under social pressure situations and measured both the induced alcohol craving and head gaze of participants. A 2 x 2 experimental model (alcohol-related locality vs. social pressure) was designed. In situations without an avatar (no social pressure), more alcohol craving was induced if alcohol was present than if it was not. And more alcohol craving was induced in situations with an avatar (social pressure) than in situations without an avatar (no social pressure). The difference of angle between the direction of head gazing and the direction of alcohol or avatar was smaller in situations with an avatar alone (social pressure) than in situations with alcohol alone. In situations with both alcohol and an avatar, the angle between the direction of head gaze and the direction of the avatar was smaller than between the direction of head gaze and the direction of the alcohol. Considering the results, this VR system induces alcohol craving using an avatar that can express various social pressure situations."", 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 16, 'citationCount': 48, 'journal': {'volume': '11 3', 'pages': '\n          302-9\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology & behavior : the impact of the Internet, multimedia and virtual reality on behavior and society'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Cho2008DevelopmentAV,\n author = {Sangwoo Cho and J.

Potential use in education was first considered in the early 1990s, when it was suggested that VR technology could provide powerful learning environments not available through other means (M. Bricken, 1991). A growing VR research community has since sought to examine the benefits of using this technology in mainstream and special needs education, as well as other learning environments. This article first presents a brief description of VR technology and its use in teaching and learning. VR can be used as a tool for communication, as a medium through which individuals express ideas, and for learning about communication, through guided training and rehearsal in simulated social scenarios. This article concentrates on the latter application and presents 4 research projects conducted by the Virtual Reality Applications Research Team and associated colleagues in special needs education since 1991.

Younger ages at first intercourse were associated with higher odds of STI in comparison with older ages, but the effect diminished with increasing current age. For example, the odds of having an STI for an 18-year-old who first had intercourse at age 13 were more than twice those of an 18-year-old who first had intercourse at age 17 (prevalence odds ratio = 2.25, 95% confidence interval: 1.42, 3.59).

Adolescent impulsivity and/or novelty seeking as a transitional trait behavior can be explained in part by maturational changes in frontal cortical and subcortical monoaminergic systems. These developmental processes may advantageously promote learning drives for adaptation to adult roles but may also confer greater vulnerability to the addictive actions of drugs.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAn exploration of developmental changes in neurocircuitry involved in impulse control has significant implications for understanding adolescent behavior, addiction vulnerability, and the prevention of addiction in adolescence and adulthood.', 'year': 2003, 'referenceCount': 140, 'citationCount': 1562, 'journal': {'volume': '160 6', 'pages': '\n          1041-52\n        ', 'name': 'The American journal of psychiatry'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Chambers2003DevelopmentalNO,\n author = {R.

To determine the factors associated with the adoption or maintenance of consistent safer sexual behaviors among human immunodeficiency virus-positive adolescents and young adults with hemophilia. Methods. One hundred eleven adolescents at 10 hemophilia care sites participated in an intervention program designed to increase safer sexual behaviors (abstinence, condom use, or nonpenetrative behavior). The theory-based intervention spanned 1 year. Adolescents attended individual sessions, small group activities, and an intensive group retreat. Results. Patients who maintained or improved safer sexual behaviors were compared with those who relapsed or did not improve. Logistic regression analyses found that improvement and maintenance of safer sexual behavior were significantly associated with perceived peer support for outercourse (odds ratio [OR]: 5.47; confidence interval [CI]: 1.4–20.8), perceived peer support for abstinence (OR: 5.08; CI: 1.2–20.1), and decreased general emotional distress (OR: 4.65; CI: 1.04–20.6). Perceived health status and previous sexual behavior were unrelated to change in safer sexual behavior. Conclusions. These longitudinal data indicate that improvement and maintenance of safer sexual behavior among adolescents during an intervention is strongly associated with perceptions of peer support for safer sex and lesser degrees of emotional distress. Programs for human immunodeficiency virus-infected adolescents may require developmentally appropriate social and psychological approaches to impact peer norms and emotional well-being.', 'year': 2000, 'referenceCount': 40, 'citationCount': 26, 'journal': {'volume': '106', 'pages': 'e22 - e22', 'name': 'Pediatrics'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Brown2000SexualBC,\n author = {L.

In the past, equivalence has either been imposed by matching or balancing, or has been assured statistically by randomization. Matching and balancing, while useful in many contexts, nonetheless have important limitations, as does simple randomization. In recent years, a new tool has been developed that represents a compromise between balancing and randomization. This method, urn randomization, gives clinical investigators new options for improving the credibility of studies at a relatively modest cost. Urn randomization is randomization that is systematically based in favor of balancing. It can be used with several covariates, both marginally and jointly, producing optimal multivariate equivalence of treatment groups for large sample sizes. It preserves randomization as the primary basis for assignment to treatment and is less susceptible to experimenter bias or manipulation of the allocation process by staff than is balancing. Disadvantages include the fact that it is more difficult to implement, and that it violates the simple probability model of simple randomization. A number of research studies on addictions, including client-treatment matching trials, have used urn randomization. A summary of the mechanics of urn randomization is presented, and guidelines for its use in treatment studies are discussed.', 'year': 1994, 'referenceCount': 8, 'citationCount': 452, 'journal': {'volume': '12', 'pages': '\n          70-5\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of studies on alcohol.

We compared sexual health outcomes among individuals who had initiated sexual activity at an early or late age versus a normative age.

The last three situations result from an inability to discuss a partner's past sexual history, indicating a need to be very specific in these areas.

Different lines of research are reviewed, show- ing that the self-efficacy mechanism may have wide explanatory power. Perceived self-efficacy helps to ac- count for such diverse phenomena as changes in coping behavior produced by different modes of influence, level of physiological stress reactions, self-regulation of refractory behavior, resignation and despondency to failure experiences, self-debilitating effects of proxy control and illusory inefficaciousness, achievement strivings, growth of intrinsic interest, and career pur- suits.

As a result the processes governing the interrelation- ship between knowledge and action have been largely neglected (Newell, 1978).

An individual who is online manages his/her emotions in a specific manner. Thus, it is highly relevant to analyze and evaluate online socio-emotional competencies. Until now, however, no instruments had been defined or developed for that purpose. This study’s objective was thus to design and validate a questionnaire for the evaluation of socio-emotional competencies in virtual contexts, and to analyze eventual differences according to gender and academic year. Using the model developed by Bisquerra and Pérez (2007) as a theoretical framework, the competencies posited therein were transferred to an online environment. The questionnaire was filled out by 888 adolescents ages 12 to 17 (48% males, M = 13.83 years old, DT = 1.27), all residents of Aragón, Spain. On the basis of their responses, structure analysis, validation, and reliability were carried out. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) yielded a five-dimensional structure with good fit and internal consistency. The five resulting dimensions evaluate (1) emotional e-conscience, (2) emotional e-autonomy, (3) emotional e-regulation, (4) e-self-control of impulsiveness, and (5) social e-competency. Differences among genders were observed in the categories of emotional e-conscience and social e-competency.

Given the high pressure placed on students throughout COVID-19, it is critical to understand the influence of problematic internet use (PIU), psychological stress, academic burnout, and resilience on perceived learning (PL). A cross-sectional analytical study was chosen to collect data from 350 learners pursuing undergraduate and postgraduate business/management degrees in Karnataka, India. The data were analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Science) and Smart PLS 3. The present study reports a non-significant negative total effect of stress on PL, while there was a significant positive direct effect but a significant indirect negative effect of multiple mediators, namely PIU, burnout, and resilience. In the relationship between stress and PL, burnout has full competitive mediation, and the suppressive effect of burnout and resilience wipes out the beneficial benefit of stress on PL, resulting in reduced PL.

However, there are no studies during a confinement stage that analyse the relationships between networks, Emotional Intelligence, and cannabis use. The aim of this paper is to describe and analyse the consumption and friendship networks of an adolescent classroom and their relationship with Emotional Intelligence, cannabis use, and gender during COVID-19 confinement. Participants completed different questionnaires for Emotional Intelligence, cannabis use, and the consumption and friendship network. The sample consisted of 21 students from 10th grade, of which 47.6% were consumers.

For this purpose, we searched for relevant articles in English and Spanish in Medline, PsycINFO, and Scopus, obtaining 17 selectable articles based on the search terms used in research in the adolescent population. These studies provide scientific evidence of the relationship between the level of EI assessed from the three theoretical models of EI (performance-based ability model, self-report ability model, and self-report mixed model) and various aggressive responses, showing that adolescents with higher levels of EI show less aggressive behavior. Implications for interventions and guidelines for future research are discussed.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 68, 'citationCount': 28, 'journal': {'volume': '23', 'pages': '1173 - 1183', 'name': 'Trauma, Violence, & Abuse'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Vega2021EmotionalIA,\n author = {Alberto Vega and R.

The sample was made up of 317 high school students aged 13 to 18, who filled out the Brief Emotional Intelligence Inventory, the Resilience Scale for Adolescents, the APGAR Scale, the Alcohol Expectancy Questionnaire–Adolescents, and the Five-Factor Self-Concept Questionnaire. The results revealed that emotional intelligence and resilience, specifically stress management and family cohesion, were significant in the group of non-users. Family functioning acts as a predictor for the onset of use of tobacco and alcohol. Positive expectancies about drinking alcohol were found to be a risk factor, and the intrapersonal factor was found to be protective. Both stress management and family cohesion were protective factors against smoking. Furthermore, cluster analysis revealed the emotional profiles for users of both substances based on self-concept.

The results from 93 papers with 105 unique samples (N = 36, 215) showed significant and small-to-medium correlations between each facet of impulsivity and aggression across several different forms of aggression, with more impulsivity being associated with more aggression. Moreover, negative urgency (r = .24, 95% [.18, .29]), positive urgency (r = .34, 95% [.19, .44]), and lack of premeditation (r = .23, 95% [.20, .26]) had significantly stronger associations with aggression than the other scales (rs < .18).

Besides face‐to‐face interaction, nowadays, relationships are also initiated and maintained in cyberspace. Some studies suggest that emotional content is present in cyber‐behavior. The objective of this study was to reveal whether emotions are expressed, perceived and managed online ‐ a concept called E‐motions, and to validate an instrument to measure this concept. Method: The E‐motions Questionnaire was designed and together with other instruments, completed by 612 university students. Then, the questionnaire was completed by a representative sample of 2139 students in compulsory secondary education in 22 schools in all Andalusian provinces. The first sample was used for exploratory factor analysis and the second sample for confirmatory factor analysis. Results: The E‐motions Questionnaire was validated with good psychometric properties. Four factors were found showing that emotions are perceived, expressed, used, understood and managed online. This behavior is related to some aspects of emotional intelligence and also to difficulties in identifying feelings. Conclusions: This new promising research field could be useful for further advancement of research into cyber‐behavior. Resumen Contenido emocional en el ciberespacio: desarrollo y validación del Cuestionario E‐mociones en adolescentes y jóvenes. Antecedentes: estudios sobre la inteligencia emocional muestran que algunas de sus dimensiones están relacionadas con el ajuste psicológico y la calidad de relaciones interpersonales. Además de las interacciones cara a cara, las relaciones se inician y mantienen también en el ciberespacio. Algunos estudios sugieren que el contenido emocional está presente en la ciberconducta. El objetivo del estudio fue descubrir si las emociones se expresan, perciben y gestionan online‐ concepto denominado E‐mociones y validar un instrumento para medirlo. Método: se diseñó un Cuestionario de E‐mociones que, con otros instrumentos, fue completado por 612 estudiantes universitarios. Posteriormente, dicho cuestionario fue respondido por una muestra representativa de 2.139 alumnos de la educación secundaria matriculados en 22 escuelas de todas las provincias andaluzas. Se realizaron análisis factoriales ‐ exploratorio con la primera muestra y confirmatorio con la segunda. Resultados: el Cuestionario E‐mociones fue validado mostrando muy buenas propiedades psicométricas con cuatro factores. Las emociones se perciben, expresan, utilizan, comprenden y gestionan en el ciberespacio. Esta conducta se relaciona con algunos aspectos de la inteligencia emocional y también con dificultades emocionales. Conclusiones: esta nueva línea podría ser útil para avanzar en la investigación sobre la ciberconducta.

Further, mediational analyses revealed that decreases in emotional clarity mediated the relationship between emotional neglect and increases in depressive symptoms.

Due to its relationship with psychosocial adjustment, a significant number of instruments have been developed to assess emotion regulation in a reliable and valid manner. Among these, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ; Gross and John, 2003) is one of the most widely used, having shown good psychometric properties with adult samples from different cultures. Studies of validation in children and adolescents are, however, scarce and have only been developed for the Australian and Portuguese populations. The aim of this study was to validate the Spanish version of the ERQ for use in adolescents and determine possible differences according to the gender and age of young people. The sample consisted of 2060 adolescents (52.1% boys). Exploratory and Confirmatory factor analysis (EFA and CFA), multi-group analysis and Two-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) were performed and the percentiles calculated. The results of the AFE and CFA corroborated the existence of two factors related to the emotion regulation strategies of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, showing acceptable internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Both factors also showed good criterion validity with personality traits, self-esteem, and social anxiety. Differences in cognitive reappraisal were found with regard to age, with younger students exhibiting the greatest mastery of this strategy. Gender differences were observed regarding the expressive suppression strategy, with boys being more likely to use this strategy than girls. A gender-age interaction effect was also observed, revealing that the use of the expressive suppression strategy did not vary by age in girls, and was more widely used by boys aged 12–14 years than those aged 15–16 years. However, we found evidence of measurement invariance across sex and age groups. The results suggest that the ERQ is a valid and reliable instrument that can be used to evaluate emotion regulation strategies in adolescents.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 65, 'citationCount': 48, 'journal': {'volume': '6', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Gómez-Ortiz2016AnalysisOE,\n author = {Olga Gómez-Ortiz and E.

Cybervictimization affects areas such as academic performance, social integration and self-esteem, and causes emotions ranging from anger and sadness to more complex problems such as depression. However, not all victims are equally affected, and the differences seem to be due to certain situational and personal characteristics. The objective of this study is to analyze the relationship between perceived emotional intelligence (PEI) and the emotional impact of cybervictimization. We hypothesize that EI, which has previously been found to play a role in traditional bullying and cyberbullying, may also affect the emotional impact of cyberbullying. The participants in our study were 636 university students from two universities in the south of Spain. Three self-report questionnaires were used: the “European Cyberbullying Intervention Project Questionnaire,” the “Cyberbullying Emotional Impact Scale”; and “Trait Meta-Mood Scale-24.” Structural Equation Models were used to test the relationships between the analyzed variables. The results support the idea that PEI, by way of a moderator effect, affects the relationship between cybervictimization and emotional impact. Taken together, cybervictimization and PEI explain much of the variance observed in the emotional impact in general and in the negative dimensions of that impact in particular. Attention and Repair were found to be inversely related to Annoyance and Dejection, and positively related to Invigoration. Clarity has the opposite pattern; a positive relationship with Annoyance and Dejection and an inverse relationship with Invigoration.

There is an urgent need to update the classic criteria. The incorporation of the most suitable criteria will improve the quality of our research. In this work we review the classic criteria and, depending on the case, we also propose current criteria to replace or complement the former. Our objective is to offer the interested applied researcher updated guidance on how to perform an Exploratory Item Factor Analysis, according to the “post-Little Jiffy” psychometrics. This review and the guide with the corresponding recommendations have been articulated in four large blocks: 1) the data type and the matrix of association, 2) the method of factor estimation, 3) the number of factors to be retained, and 4) the method of rotation and allocation of items.

We provide experimental evidence that emotional contagion occurs without direct interaction between people (exposure to a friend expressing an emotion is sufficient), and in the complete absence of nonverbal cues. Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’ positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 15, 'citationCount': 2527, 'journal': {'volume': '111', 'pages': '8788 - 8790', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Kramer2014ExperimentalEO,\n author = {Adam D.

However, before drawing any inferences about construct continuity and change, researchers must establish that the EQi:YV-Brief functions equivalently over time. This study tested configural, metric, scalar, and residual measurement invariance of the EQi:YV-Brief over a 6-year period from late childhood (age 10-11) to adolescence (age 16-17). Longitudinal mean and covariance structures models were fitted to the data from 773 NLSCY participants (51% girls) who completed the EQi:YV-Brief at 4 biennial cycles.

On average, self-esteem is relatively high in childhood, drops during adolescence (particularly for girls), rises gradually throughout adulthood, and then declines sharply in old age.

This type of stability (i.e., rank-order stability) is somewhat lower during childhood and old age than during adulthood, but the overall level of stability is comparable to that found for other personality characteristics.

In attendance were a range of researchers, educators, and advocates with diverse interests related to meeting the developmental, psychological, educational, and general health needs of children. These issues were discussed, and the term social and emotional learning (SEL) was introduced. SEL described a framework for providing opportunities for young people to acquire the skills necessary for attaining and maintaining personal well-being and positive relationships across the lifespan. Out of this 1994 meeting, the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) was formed with the goal of “establishing high-quality, evidence-based SEL as an essential part of preschool through high school education” (Elias et al., 1997; Greenberg et al., 2003; Kress & Elias, 2006). Since its conception, CASEL has defined SEL more specifically and has served as a guide to school-based SEL programming (CASEL, 2003). According to CASEL, SEL describes the acquisition of skills including selfand social awareness and regulation, responsible decision making and problem solving, and relationship management. The first of CASEL’s 39 Guidelines for Educators delineates four primary domains of SEL: “(1) life skills and social competencies, (2) health promotion and problem-prevention skills, (3) coping skills and social support for transitions and crises, and (4) positive, contributory service” (Elias et al., 1997; Kress & Elias, 2006). These skills are critical at all levels of development but vary in their application over the life course. Underlying SEL programming is a theoretical foundation based on the ideas that essential learning takes place in the context of relationships and that similar risk factors are responsible for various maladaptive outcomes', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 64, 'citationCount': 102, 'journal': None, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Elbertson2010SchoolBasedSA,\n author = {Nicole A.

60,01dd8ccb1cc789450d3deb0e3f4beed972098223,A Comparative Study on the Temporal Effects of 2D and VR Emotional Arousal,"Previous research comparing traditional two-dimensional (2D) and virtual reality with stereoscopic vision (VR-3D) stimulations revealed that VR-3D resulted in higher levels of immersion. However, the effects of these two visual modes on emotional stimulus processing have not been thoroughly investigated, and the underlying neural processing mechanisms remain unclear. Thus, this paper introduced a cognitive psychological experiment that was conducted to investigate how these two visual modes influence emotional processing. To reduce fatigue, participants (n = 16) were randomly assigned to watch a series of 2D and VR-3D short emotional videos for two days. During their participation, electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded simultaneously. The results showed that even in the absence of sound, visual stimuli in the VR environment significantly increased emotional arousal, especially in the frontal region, parietal region, temporal region, and occipital region. On this basis, visual evoked potential (VEP) analysis was performed. VR stimulation compared to 2D led to a larger P1 component amplitude, while VEP analysis based on the time course of the late event-related potential component revealed that, after 1200 ms, the differences across visual modes became stable and significant. Furthermore, the results also confirmed that VEP in the early stages is more sensitive to emotions and presumably there are corresponding emotion regulation mechanisms in the late stages.",2022,40,3,"{'name': 'Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)', 'volume': '22'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tian2022ACS,\n author = {F.

Subjective results show that any of the editing methods used would lead to an increased load and reduced immersion. Furthermore, the cognition of event segmentation theory also plays an instructive role in VR editing, with differences mainly focusing on frontal, parietal, and central regions. On this basis, visual evoked potential (VEP) analysis was performed, and the standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography algorithm (sLORETA) traceability method was used to analyze the data.

This approach does not place adequate emphasis on objective measures that are potentially sensitive to processes not feeding into subjective self-report. Numerous studies provide evidence that attitudes and affective content can be processed without leading to verbalised output. This exploratory study aimed to determine whether individuals in the normal population, grouped by self-reported aggression, differed in subjective versus objective affective processing. Participants (N = 52) were grouped based on their responses to the Buss–Durkee Hostility Inventory. They were then presented with affect-inducing images while brain event-related potentials (ERPs) and startle reflex modulation (SRM) were recorded to determine non-language-based processes. Explicit valence and arousal ratings for each image were taken to determine subjective affective effects. Results indicated no significant group differences for explicit ratings and SRM. However, ERP results demonstrated significant group differences between the ‘pleasant’ and ‘violent’ emotion condition in the frontal, central and parietal areas across both hemispheres.

The primary goals of this study are to analyze the possible use of virtual reality (VR) as an affective medium and research the relationship between immersion and emotion. To investigate these objectives, we compared two viewing conditions (HMD vs. No-HMD) and applied two types of emotional content (horror and empathy) to examine whether the level of immersion could influence emotional responses. The results showed that viewers who watched the horror movie using HMD felt more scared than those in the No-HMD condition. However, there were no significant emotional differences between the HMD and No-HMD conditions in the movie groups exposed to empathy. Regarding these results, we may assume that the effect of an immersive viewing experience on emotional responses in VR is deeply related to the degree of arousal and strong perceptual cues. The horror movie used in this study included intense visual and audio stimuli found in the typical horror film format. In contrast, viewers experienced less stimulating perceptual input when they are watching the empathetic movie.

These scenarios should include dynamic stimuli presented concurrently or serially in a manner that allows researchers to assess the integrative processes carried out by perceivers over time. Furthermore, there is growing interest in contextually embedded stimuli that can constrain participant interpretations of cues about a target’s internal states.

This paper assessed three electroencephalography (EEG) activities, θ, α and β, during a monotonous and repetitive random dot stereogram (RDS) based task in a conventional stereoscopic 3D display. Six types of ratio indices were computed based on EEG data and assessed as possible indicators for stereoscopic visual fatigue detection. The results of critical flicker frequency (CFF) and accommodative amplitude (ACC) showed that the proposed experiment setup can induce visual fatigue. According to the subjective ratings, the visual fatigue accumulated in this task was mostly related to the binocular vision stress of 3D display. Results of EEG data showed stable θ activity, a significant increase of α activity, and a significant decrease of β activity over time . In addition, the effectiveness of EEG indices was evaluated to measure stereoscopic visual fatigue by using grey relation analysis (GRA) and verified by correlating with CFF. The results of analysis suggest that among all nine types of EEG indices (θ, α, β, θ/β, α/β, α/θ, θ/(α+β), (α+θ)/β, (α+θ)/(α+β)), α is the most promising indicator for detecting stereoscopic visual fatigue.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 36, 'citationCount': 66, 'journal': {'volume': '11', 'pages': '1076-1083', 'name': 'Journal of Display Technology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Zou2015EEGBasedAO,\n author = {Bochao Zou and Yue Liu and Mei Guo and Yongtian Wang},\n journal = {Journal of Display Technology},\n pages = {1076-1083},\n title = {EEG-Based Assessment of Stereoscopic 3D Visual Fatigue Caused by Vergence-Accommodation Conflict},\n volume = {11},\n year = {2015}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '20218361', 'name': 'Bochao Zou'}, {'authorId': '46399699', 'name': 'Yue Liu'}, {'authorId': '2089780674', 'name': 'Mei Guo'}, {'authorId': '1692621', 'name': 'Yongtian Wang'}]}, {'paperId': 'ff3ac9352702bdf355511edaa1e633273d448dba', 'title': 'The impact of perception and presence on emotional reactions: a review of research in virtual reality', 'abstract': 'Virtual reality (VR) has made its way into mainstream psychological research in the last two decades. This technology, with its unique ability to simulate complex, real situations and contexts, offers researchers unprecedented opportunities to investigate human behavior in well controlled designs in the laboratory. One important application of VR is the investigation of pathological processes in mental disorders, especially anxiety disorders. Research on the processes underlying threat perception, fear, and exposure therapy has shed light on more general aspects of the relation between perception and emotion. Being by its nature virtual, i.e., simulation of reality, VR strongly relies on the adequate selection of specific perceptual cues to activate emotions. Emotional experiences in turn are related to presence, another important concept in VR, which describes the user’s sense of being in a VR environment. This paper summarizes current research into perception of fear cues, emotion, and presence, aiming at the identification of the most relevant aspects of emotional experience in VR and their mutual relations. A special focus lies on a series of recent experiments designed to test the relative contribution of perception and conceptual information on fear in VR. This strand of research capitalizes on the dissociation between perception (bottom–up input) and conceptual information (top-down input) that is possible in VR. Further, we review the factors that have so far been recognized to influence presence, with emotions (e.g., fear) being the most relevant in the context of clinical psychology. Recent research has highlighted the mutual influence of presence and fear in VR, but has also traced the limits of our current understanding of this relationship. In this paper, the crucial role of perception on eliciting emotional reactions is highlighted, and the role of arousal as a basic dimension of emotional experience is discussed. An interoceptive attribution model of presence is suggested as a first step toward an integrative framework for emotion research in VR.

The aim of this study was to test how to optimise the virtual experience by manipulating some of these factors. Specifically, we tested if an immersive technology and/or a meaningful narrative context influence the users\' sense of presence, providing a more compelling experience than a non-immersive and non-contextualized virtual space. Eighty-four students, randomly divided into four groups, were asked to find a blood container inside a virtual hospital in an immersive or non-immersive condition and with or without an emotionally related narrative. Two presence questionnaires and heart-rate variations were used to measure the effects of the four conditions on the users\' sense of presence. Results showed a significant effect of narrative, F(8, 73)\u2009=\u200930.346, p\u2009<\u20090.001, and level of immersion, F (8, 73)\u2009=\u200910.913, p\u2009<\u20090.001, and a significant interaction between narrative and immersion, F(8, 73)\u2009=\u20092.062, p\u2009=\u20090.05, both on the presence questionnaires and on the heart-rate variations. Moreover, considering the factors immersion (I) and narrative (N) together, we found that the I-N condition generated the highest level of presence. We argue that both immersion and narrative are important in creating an effective virtual reality experience because they contribute differently to increasing the sense of presence. Immersion increases the place illusion, while the narrative contributes to generating an emotional response and strengthening the subjects\' sense of inner presence.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 39, 'citationCount': 232, 'journal': {'volume': '14 3', 'pages': '\n          99-105\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Gorini2011TheRO,\n author = {A.

In a previous functional magnetic resonance imaging study utilizing a working memory task, we demonstrated that activity levels in scene-selective VAC (ssVAC) regions can be enhanced above or suppressed below a passive viewing baseline level depending on whether scene stimuli were attended or ignored (Gazzaley, Cooney, McEvoy, et al. 2005). Here, we use functional connectivity analysis to identify possible sources of these modulatory influences by examining how network interactions with VAC are influenced by attentional goals at the time of encoding. Our findings reveal a network of regions that exhibit strong positive correlations with a ssVAC seed during all task conditions, including foci in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG). This PFC region is more correlated with the VAC seed when scenes were remembered and less correlated when scenes were ignored, relative to passive viewing. Moreover, the strength of MFG-VAC coupling correlates with the magnitude of attentional enhancement and suppression of VAC activity. Although our correlation analyses do not permit assessment of directionality, these findings suggest that PFC biases activity levels in VAC by adjusting the strength of functional coupling in accordance with stimulus relevance.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 117, 'citationCount': 263, 'journal': {'volume': '17 Suppl 1', 'pages': '\n          i125-35\n        ', 'name': 'Cerebral cortex'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Gazzaley2007FunctionalIB,\n author = {A.

But what exactly do people seek when they seek emotions? What kinds of gratifications do they obtain from the experience of emotions during media use? An overview of research on emotional gratifications shows that emotions can be gratifying in multiple ways – ranging from simple hedonistic gratifications to more complex gratifications such as feeling competent or morally good. An integrative framework is outlined that aims at a more systematic understanding of emotional gratifications and their influence on selective media use. We suggest that different aspects of an emotion's gratification potential are appraised simultaneously, and integrated into a holistic appraisal outcome that can be conceptualized as ‘meta-emotion’.

In this paper, a method is proposed to approximately standardize the reference of scalp EEG recordings to a point at infinity. This method is based on the fact that the use of scalp potentials to determine the neural electrical activities or their equivalent sources does not depend on the reference, so we may approximately reconstruct the equivalent sources from scalp EEG recordings with a scalp point or average reference. Then the potentials referenced at infinity are approximately reconstructed from the equivalent sources. As a point at infinity is far from all the possible neural sources, this method may be considered as a reference electrode standardization technique (REST). The simulation studies performed with assumed neural sources included effects of electrode number, volume conductor model and noise on the performance of REST, and the significance of REST in EEG temporal analysis. The results showed that REST is potentially very effective for the most important superficial cortical region and the standardization could be especially important in recovering the temporal information of EEG recordings.', 'year': 2001, 'referenceCount': 25, 'citationCount': 412, 'journal': {'volume': '22', 'pages': '693 - 711', 'name': 'Physiological Measurement'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Yao2001AMT,\n author = {D.

This review article presents an introduction into EEG measurement. Its purpose is to help with orientation in EEG field and with building basic knowledge for performing EEG recordings. The article is divided into two parts. In the first part, background of the subject, a brief historical overview, and some EEG related research areas are given. The second part explains EEG recording. Modern medicine applies variety of imaging techniques of the human body. The group of electrobiological measurements comprises items as electrocardiography (ECG, heart), electromyography (EMG, muscular contractions), electroencephalography (EEG, brain), magnetoencephalography (MEG, brain), electrogastrography (EGG, stomach), electrooptigraphy (EOG, eye dipole field). Imaging techniques based on different physical principles include computer tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Electroencephalography is a medical imaging technique that reads scalp electrical activity generated by brain structures. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is defined as electrical activity of an alternating type recorded from the scalp surface after being picked up by metal electrodes and conductive media (1). The EEG measured directly from the cortical surface is called electrocortiogram while when using depth probes it is called electrogram. In this article, we will refer only to EEG measured from the head surface. Thus electroencephalographic reading is a completely non-invasive procedure that can be applied repeatedly to patients, normal adults, and children with virtually no risk or limitation. When brain cells (neurons) are activated, local current flows are produced. EEG measures mostly the currents that flow during synaptic excitations of the dendrites of many pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex. Differences of electrical potentials are caused by summed postsynaptic graded potentials from pyramidal cells that create electrical dipoles between soma (body of neuron) and apical dendrites (neural branches). Brain electrical current consists mostly of Na+, K+, Ca++, and Cl- ions that are pumped through channels in neuron membranes in the direction governed by membrane potential (2). The detailed microscopic picture is more sophisticated, including different types of synapses involving variety of neurotransmitters. Only large populations of active neurons can generate electrical activity recordable on the head surface. Between electrode and neuronal layers current penetrates through skin, skull and several other layers. Weak electrical signals detected by the scalp electrodes are massively amplified, and then displayed on paper or stored to computer memory (3). Due to capability to reflect both the normal and abnormal electrical activity of the brain, EEG has been found to be a very powerful tool in the field of neurology and clinical neurophysiology. The human brain electric activity starts around the 17-23 week of prenatal development. It is assumed that at birth the full number of neural cells is already developed, roughly 10 11 neurons (4). This makes an average density of 10 4 neurons per cubic mm. Neurons are mutually connected into neural nets through synapses. Adults have about 500 trillion (5.10 14 ) synapses. The number of synapses per one neuron with age increases, however the number of neurons with age decreases, thus the total number of synapses decreases with age too. From the anatomical point of view, the brain can be divided into three sections: cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem. The cerebrum consists of left and right hemisphere with highly convoluted surface layer called cerebral cortex.

61,318ee86bc7877d2edf8bd9851da7c2655dc5a5cc,Social-emotional development to learners in primary level of education through “reading” wordless picture books,"The aim of the paper is to demonstrate that selected wordless picture book Sidewalk Flowers (2015) by JonArno Lawson and Sydney Smith develop social-emotional skills to learners in primary level of education in English lessons using specific teaching tools suggested by Mikki Rogers (2020) such as character emotion charts, the character tree, the mood meter, character charts and the ruler approach. These tools are gradually implemented during six consecutive 45 minutes English (virtual) model lessons. The first three lessons primarily support learners’ emotional development. The following three lessons are concentrated on the development of positive feelings and their impact on social relationships, social-emotional development of young learners. Based on the qualitative character of the study, we suggest to use a narrative approach and to use the methods of observation, individual interview and a test as a research tool for data collection. Lessons oriented towards social-emotional development of young learners may possibly contribute to the art of noticing which definitely helps the learners to improve the quality of their social contacts, to verbalize and justify their positive and negative emotions, to increase their vocabulary, to foster their self-regulation at school and outside of it and it teaches them to be emotionally resilient.

Objectives: To develop and evaluate a synchronous online training program on emotional intelligence (EI) for the caregivers of adult patients with cognitive-behavioral impairment due to ABI. Methods: Quasi-experimental study. Ten caregivers attended a one-month virtual synchronous course about EI. The emotional status of the caregivers was registered one-month-previous and one-month-post program using comparative measures: The Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), Caregiver Burden Interview, the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and the Emotional Health Survey. Results: After the training course, the favorable changes related to emotional affect measured with the PANAS questionnaire were found; both positive (increase; Mdn = 39.5; effect size −12.79; adjusted variance 95.75) and negative (decrease; Mdn = 14.5; effect size 0.73; adjusted variance 95.50) presented a statistical significance of p < 0.05. The TMMS-24 post-test showed that 90% of the caregivers reported an adequate or excellent emotional repair (p < 0.05; effect size −0.68; adjusted variance 94.75). No other significant differences were found. Conclusions: After this training in EI, the caregivers had a more positive mood and improved aspects of their emotional intelligence, such as emotional regulation.

This study examined burden of care, social support and emotional intelligence among caregivers of mentally ill patients as correlates of psychological health \nMaterials and Methods: The research sample included two hundred (200) caregivers that were selected from the Federal Neuro-psychiatric hospital Yaba, Nigeia, using simple random sampling. They were individually administered the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), multidimensional scale of perceived social support (MSPSS), emotional intelligence scale (EI) and General Health Questionnaire.

Caregivers may experience a range of physical, emotional, financial and social harms, which are often described collectively as caregiver burden. The degree of burden experienced is associated with characteristics of the caregiver, such as gender, and characteristics of the person with dementia, such as dementia stage, and the presence of behavioural problems or neuropsychiatric disturbances. It is a strong predictor of admission to residential care for people with dementia. Psychoeducational interventions might prevent or reduce caregiver burden. Overall, they are intended to improve caregivers' knowledge about the disease and its care; to increase caregivers' sense of competence and their ability to cope with difficult situations; to relieve feelings of isolation and allow caregivers to attend to their own emotional and physical needs. These interventions are heterogeneous, varying in their theoretical framework, components, and delivery formats. Interventions that are delivered remotely, using printed materials, telephone or video technologies, may be particularly suitable for caregivers who have difficulty accessing face-to-face services because of their own health problems, poor access to transport, or absence of substitute care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, containment measures in many countries required people to be isolated in their homes, including people with dementia and their family carers. In such circumstances, there is no alternative to remote delivery of interventions.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the efficacy and acceptability of remotely delivered interventions aiming to reduce burden and improve mood and quality of life of informal caregivers of people with dementia.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, MEDLINE, Embase and four other databases, as well as two international trials registries, on 10 April 2020. We also examined the bibliographies of relevant review papers and published trials.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included only randomised controlled trials that assessed the remote delivery of structured interventions for informal caregivers who were providing care for people with dementia living at home. Caregivers had to be unpaid adults (relatives or members of the person's community). The interventions could be delivered using printed materials, the telephone, the Internet or a mixture of these, but could not involve any face-to-face contact with professionals. We categorised intervention components as information, training or support. Information interventions included two key elements: (i) they provided standardised information, and (ii) the caregiver played a passive role. Support interventions promoted interaction with other people (professionals or peers). Training interventions trained caregivers in practical skills to manage care. We excluded interventions that were primarily individual psychotherapy. Our primary outcomes were caregiver burden, mood, health-related quality of life and dropout for any reason. Secondary outcomes were caregiver knowledge and skills, use of health and social care resources, admission of the person with dementia to institutional care, and quality of life of the person with dementia.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nStudy selection, data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias in included studies were done independently by two review authors. We used the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) to describe the interventions. We conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model to derive estimates of effect size. We used GRADE methods to describe our degree of certainty about effect estimates.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included 26 studies in this review (2367 participants). We compared (1) interventions involving training, support or both, with or without information (experimental interventions) with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control (12 studies, 944 participants); and (2) the same experimental interventions with provision of information alone (14 studies, 1423 participants). We downgraded evidence for study limitations and, for some outcomes, for inconsistency between studies. There was a frequent risk of bias from self-rating of subjective outcomes by participants who were not blind to the intervention. Randomisation methods were not always well-reported and there was potential for attrition bias in some studies. Therefore, all evidence was of moderate or low certainty. In the comparison of experimental interventions with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control, we found that the experimental interventions probably have little or no effect on caregiver burden (nine studies, 597 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.35 to 0.23); depressive symptoms (eight studies, 638 participants; SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.12); or health-related quality of life (two studies, 311 participants; SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.32). The experimental interventions probably result in little or no difference in dropout for any reason (eight studies, 661 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.53). In the comparison of experimental interventions with a control condition of information alone, we found that experimental interventions may result in a slight reduction in caregiver burden (nine studies, 650 participants; SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.51 to 0.04); probably result in a slight improvement in depressive symptoms (11 studies, 1100 participants; SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.06); may result in little or no difference in caregiver health-related quality of life (two studies, 257 participants; SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.21); and probably result in an increase in dropouts for any reason (12 studies, 1266 participants; RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.20).\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nRemotely delivered interventions including support, training or both, with or without information, may slightly reduce caregiver burden and improve caregiver depressive symptoms when compared with provision of information alone, but not when compared with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control. They seem to make little or no difference to health-related quality of life. Caregivers receiving training or support were more likely than those receiving information alone to drop out of the studies, which might limit applicability. The efficacy of these interventions may depend on the nature and availability of usual services in the study settings."", 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 125, 'citationCount': 27, 'journal': {'volume': '1', 'pages': '\n          CD006440\n        ', 'name': 'The Cochrane database of systematic reviews'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{González-Fraile2021RemotelyDI,\n author = {E.

Materials and methods: This study used semi-structured interviewing and interpretative phenomenological analysis. Results: One theme, “Living in and beyond the loop of fear”, with two subheadings is reported. Participants’ attempts to manage their fears prominently defined their early caregiving. Fears were aggravated by the vulnerability of their spouse’s health which partially owed to brain injury sometimes having no symptoms prior to its onset. Consequently, participants anxiously strove to prevent further harm to their spouse’s health due to what they perceived as the continued “hidden” threat of brain injury. Therefore, participants became hypervigilant, leaving themselves vulnerable to burnout. Over time, some participants modified care practices and managed fears using beliefs accepting their limits to protect their spouses’ health. Conclusions: Findings suggest that beliefs conducive to acceptance helped carers to develop more sustainable, less over-protective, care. Interventions to help carers develop similar beliefs could be provided in therapeutic settings. Recommendations for future research are made. Implications for Rehabilitation Caring for a long-term partner with acquired brain injury has considerable challenges which can threaten an individual’s health and well-being. Our research reports on carers’ experiences of anxiety which they managed through hypervigilant and overprotective practices which put them at risk of burnout. Consequently, we recommend the promotion of care beliefs that reframe caregiving: recognising the carer’s limitations to safeguard a spouse, whilst accepting the vulnerability of the spouse’s health. We propose that promoting such principles in therapeutic settings may better equip carers emotionally to provide sustainable care, something which could benefit the carer and spouse’s rehabilitation alike.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 35, 'citationCount': 11, 'journal': {'volume': '40', 'pages': '2907 - 2915', 'name': 'Disability and Rehabilitation'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Lond2018StuckIA,\n author = {B.

Struggling to deal with those challenges can have a significant impact on the psychological well-being of the partner, and on the quality and stability of the relationship. Compared with the general population, partners generally report higher levels of anxiety, stress and depression [1,2]; and lower levels of positive well-being, quality of life and life satisfaction [1,2]. Although there may be improvements [2], these difficulties can persist for many years after the TBI [3]. In terms of the impact on the relationship, methodological inadequacies in the research mean that there is, as yet, no clear answer to the question of whether TBI increases the rate of marital breakdown compared with the general population [4]. However, on measures of overall marital quality and satisfaction, partners tend to give their current relationship a poorer rating in comparison to the general population and to the preinjury relationship [4,5]. The primary aim of this overview is to summarize research about the partner’s negative experiences of TBI that may explain this damaging impact that the injury can have on their psychological well-being and the relationship. Understanding the experiences that contribute to the impact will highlight issues that need to be addressed in supporting couples after a TBI. The overview describes experiences both in the initial stages and in the longer term. It addresses the partner’s experience of more severe TBI (i.e., one that requires hospitalization and has long-lasting effects) rather than mild TBI. It should be noted that, although all the research papers cited in the review included at least some participants who were the partners of someone with a more severe TBI, a substantial number used mixed samples that contained participants who had other forms of brain injury (e.g., stroke), other familial relationships with the person with the injury (e.g., parents) or experience of mild TBI. Some partners have more positive experiences of TBI and this research, which is more limited in extent, will also be summarized. Understanding positive experiences may shed light on why some partners cope better than others.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 20, 'citationCount': 8, 'journal': {'volume': '1', 'name': 'Concussion'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Riley2016ThePE,\n author = {G.

Research documents inconsistent findings regarding direction of differences. Differences have implications for family support and are germane to clinicians’ treatment planning during rehabilitation. We compared two analytic approaches to patient–family differences in ratings of 30 functional tasks: (a) comparing patients’ and families’ mean scores in domains derived from factor analysis versus (b) examining differences on a task-by-task basis. Method: In-home interviews were conducted with 83 outpatients with TBI at a Veteran Affairs polytrauma clinic and for each a family member, using the Patient Competency Rating Scale with both. Results: Principal components analysis identified three functional domains – cognitive, interpersonal/emotional and physical – with significant patient–family differences in the cognitive domain only (family competency ratings were higher). By contrast, task-by-task examination showed significant veteran–family differences in 12 items, mostly in interpersonal/emotional functioning, with mixed directions of differences. The task-by-task approach thus revealed a different picture of patient–family differences than examination by functional domains. Conclusions: Grouping tasks by domains may obscure important differences in functional ratings. Examination of patient–family differences by task has clinical applications for helping patients and families to manage TBI symptoms and for treatment planning. Implications for Rehabilitation Differences in functional capacity ratings by patients with TBI and their family members are not well understood, with past research demonstrating inconsistencies in direction of difference. Differences in ratings may affect family relationships and may inform clinicians’ treatment plans. The study showed that different approaches to analyzing the same data yield two distinct pictures of patient–family differences. Examining patient–family differences by specific tasks is clinically meaningful. The Competency Rating Scale could be used as a clinical tool with patients and families. Its use may improve family understanding of the patient’s strengths and struggles and also guide treatment planning.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 53, 'citationCount': 14, 'journal': {'volume': '38', 'pages': '1280 - 1290', 'name': 'Disability and Rehabilitation'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Winter2016RatingCI,\n author = {L.

Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with caregivers (n\u2009=\u200920) to explore their support services received, access barriers, utility of services, needed supports, coping strategies and factors promoting life satisfaction. The team recorded, transcribed verbatim and inductively analysed all interviews.

All perspectives from the participants involved are synthesized to provide a rich depiction of caregivers’ support needs and coping strategies. Conclusions: Two specific findings of interest include a negative association between severity of brain injury and caregiver’s desire to direct treatment, as well as a distinct service gap in assistance for caregivers who are caring for someone with violent/offending behaviours.

Design: This study adopted a constructivist grounded theory approach, with data consisting of in-depth interviews conducted with spouses over a 12-month period. Data were analysed through an iterative process of open and focused coding, identification of emergent categories and exploration of relationships between categories. Participants: Participants were four spouses of individuals with severe TBI (with moderate–severe disability). Spouses had shared committed relationships (marriage or domestic partnerships) for at least 4 years at initial interview. Three spouses were in relationships that had commenced following injury. Main outcome and results: Two main themes emerged from the data. The first identified the saliency of the relational space in which decision-making took place. The second revealed the complex nature of decision-making within the spousal relationship. Conclusions: Spouses experience decision-making as a complex multi-stage process underpinned by a number of relational factors. Increased understanding of this process can guide health professionals in their provision of support for couples in exploring decision-making participation after injury.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 64, 'citationCount': 34, 'journal': {'volume': '29', 'pages': '745 - 757', 'name': 'Brain Injury'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Knox2015TheBT,\n author = {Lucy Knox and J.

Previous studies offer limited evidence regarding the impact of physician's EI on patient-physician relationship.\n\n\nPURPOSES\nUsing a multilevel and multisource data approach, the current study aimed to build a model that demonstrated the impact of a physician's EI on the patient's trust and the patient-physician relationship.\n\n\nMETHODOLOGY\nThe survey sample included 983 outpatients and 39 physicians representing 11 specialties.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nResults of path analyses demonstrated that the ratio of patient's follow-up visits (p < .01) and the nurse-rated EI for physicians (p < .05) had positive effects on the patient's trust. The impact of patient's trust on patient's satisfaction was mediated by the patient-physician relationship at a significant level (p < .01). The patient-physician relationship had a significantly positive effect on patient's satisfaction (p < .001). The model accounted for 37% of the variance of patient's trust, 67% of the PDR, and 58% of patient's satisfaction on physician services.\n\n\nPRACTICE IMPLICATIONS\nThis study suggests that nurses had the sensitivity and intellectual skills in assessing the physician's performance and the patient's need.

Tony is a 6-year-old multiracial boy diagnosed as having attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-combined type who is followed in your primary care practice and has started on a stimulant medication. Tony continues to have difficulty with emotion regulation and impulse control both at home and at school. He was asked to leave his private school soon after beginning first grade because of physical fighting, emotional outbursts, and arguing with teachers.His mother made the decision to enroll Tony in online virtual schooling for the remainder of the academic year, with the plan to transition back to traditional school for the next academic year. They have enrolled in a program that offers lessons online and sends materials to the home for the child to use to complete certain types of assignments (e.g., science experiments). Virtual schools are different from traditional home schooling because children receive their instruction from teachers online with parental assistance as opposed to parents being responsible for teaching all material. Tony's mother comes to your practice requesting assistance with setting up an appropriate school environment for her son at home, where she can monitor and support his academic progress.Tony is a bright child, with an Intelligence Quotient in the superior range. He has advanced academic skills, but he becomes dysregulated if he is told he is wrong or that he has answered a question incorrectly. For example, if he answered a question incorrectly in class, he would become verbally abusive toward his teacher and often have temper tantrums. This challenging behavior occurred daily at school and was one of the factors leading to his expulsion. The behavior had predated the introduction of stimulant medication and had remained consistent after he began medication.Tony's parents are highly educated, and both parents hold professional jobs with steady income. His parents have good command of typical behavior management strategies such as the use of rewards, time out, and behavioral contingencies to target noncompliance and temper tantrums. However, Tony's difficulty identifying and regulating his emotions leads to emotional outbursts and shutdowns that have thus far been unresponsive to standard behavior management techniques. Tony continued to have outbursts even when the behavior was ignored. His mother is concerned not only about his learning during the coming year but also about his social relationships and the family dynamic. Tony's outbursts cause significant disruption in the home and are a source of tension among parents and siblings.His mother is asking for advice on how to support his behavior better at home now that he will be spending his entire day there. How might you assist this child and his mother by helping to integrate therapeutic goals into the academic environment?",2017,0,0,"{'name': 'Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP', 'pages': '\n          S41-S43\n        ', 'volume': '38 Suppl 1'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wallace2017AttentionDeficitHyperactivityDB,\n author = {Claire Wallace and C.

It also popularized physics that promoted innovation. The deep popularization of physical science is an important content of science education. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the logical relationship and practical path between science education, college physics curriculum and science popularization, that is, the generalization of physics curriculum to science education and popular science from the perspective of emotional regulation. Subjects and Methods Apply Bruner's cognitive structure learning theory in psychology to college physics teaching, and transform the basic structure of physics into the cognitive structure of physical theories and phenomena in students' minds. In order to coordinate the development of physics courses and the popularization of science, the basic physics courses and majors of the University have been adjusted to help students understand the principles of physics and apply them to engineering. A total of 415 junior middle school students in three grades of an experimental middle school were investigated by cluster stratified sampling. The emotional regulation ability scale compiled by Lu Jiamei and Ji Jiajun (2010), the Chinese version of emotional behavior scale (PBI) revised by Yang Hongjun (2009) and the Chinese version of aggressive behavior (BWAQ) (2008) were used as research tools, and spss17 0 to analyze the data results by descriptive analysis, analysis of variance and linear regression. Results We found that while widely spreading science and technology, cultivating citizens' awareness of science and technology is a necessary condition for further popularizing science. We have identified four aspects of in-depth popularization of science. We have also created a four part physics course and created a teaching method that combines online and offline teaching, large and small classes, as well as theoretical and practical learning. Using various forms of science education, we have constructed three ways to provide ideological education in the curriculum. In the practice of many science education, we have not only proved that the most important part of physics education is scientific and technological literacy, but also formed the soul of basic physics curriculum: “explore laws after encountering phenomena, respond to principles creatively, and pursue loyalty and accuracy”. Based on the teaching philosophy and objectives of Xi University of technology, and taking two innovative points, three characteristic physics courses and popularization as the main line, this paper explores 30 elements of ideological education related to “physics, weapon industry and calligraphy”. These reforms were highly praised by the heads of 15 engineering majors related to the ordnance industry, and helped 13 engineering majors obtain China's higher engineering education certification. Conclusion After 10 years of educational practice, we have developed the physics curriculum to the stage of in-depth popularization of science. In the full combination of physics curriculum and engineering teaching, it embodies the three-stage learning process of acquisition, transformation and evaluation in Bruner's psychological theory. The scientific and technological literacy of Chinese teenagers has improved. In short, we should fully consider the important influence of emotion, actively pay attention to the changes of psychological emotion and behavior in their learning, and strive to become the manager, coordinator and collaborator of curriculum construction. We should actively organize rich activities flexibly according to the psychological characteristics of this part of the group, strive to build a relaxed and harmonious living atmosphere, create a friendly and mutual aid relationship, encourage and guide this part of the group, adjust the psychology to the best state, and promote the healthy growth in a good learning life.

The most notable finding is hybrid exchange, a synergistic hybrid of transaction and gift-giving.Practical implicationsThe authors recommend that both streamers and streaming platforms acknowledge and accommodate both transactional and relational tipping motivations. The authors also recommend platforms to recruit skillful streamers with high emotional intelligence to better convert perfunctory tippers into tippers who tip more generously.Originality/valueThe result of hybrid exchange suggests going beyond the traditional commodity vs gift dichotomy to examine the potential market-gift complementary in a single exchange in the sharing economy.",2022,38,0,"{'name': 'Internet Res.', 'pages': '774-795', 'volume': '33'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sun2022UnravelingHE,\n author = {J.

Drawing on emotional accounting, this research examined the effects of pride-tagged money (PTM) and surprise-tagged money (STM) on online tipping. It examined the mediating role of self-inflation and the moderating role of the perceived importance of money in the proposed relationship.Design/methodology/approachFive experimental studies were conducted to test the hypotheses using ANOVA, SmartPLS3 and bootstrap analyses.FindingsThe results reveal that pride-tagged (vs surprise-tagged) money leads to higher self-inflation, which leads to an increased willingness to engage in online tipping. It illustrates that when the perceived importance of money is low, PTM results in a higher willingness to engage in online tipping than STM. However, when the perceived importance of money is high, the effect of PTM (vs STM) on the willingness to conduct online tipping is attenuated, and no significant difference exists in the willingness to engage in online tipping between people with PTM and those with STM. In addition, it shows that PTM (vs STM) leads to a higher amount of online tipping, and self-inflation mediates the proposed relationship.Practical implicationsPractically, web-based marketing managers should design programs (e.g. content that encourages users to feel pride in their achievements) that cause users to emotionally tag their money with pride as a means of increasing their willingness to engage in online tipping and to increase the amount of such tipping.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study provides the first evidence of how different sources of money influence online tipping.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 48, 'citationCount': 2, 'journal': {'volume': '31', 'pages': '1061-1082', 'name': 'Internet Res.'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Yang2020EffectsOP,\n author = {Pianpian Yang and Qingyu Zhang and Yuanyue Feng},\n journal = {Internet Res.},\n pages = {1061-1082},\n title = {Effects of pride-tagged money and surprise-tagged money on online tipping},\n volume = {31},\n year = {2020}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1852954', 'name': 'Pianpian Yang'}, {'authorId': '49347136', 'name': 'Qingyu Zhang'}, {'authorId': '3282059', 'name': 'Yuanyue Feng'}]}, {'paperId': '9ec967243b615e0c5a074f80c51beddc7733269b', 'title': 'Measuring online live streaming of perceived servicescape', 'abstract': ""This study aimed to develop and validate an online live streaming perceived servicescape (OLSPS) scale that can help platform service providers to develop strategies for new live streaming channel promotions.,This study conceptualized the construct of OLSPS and the four-phase procedure of the 66-item OLSPS scale development, including item generation, item purification, scale validation, measure application and testing of hypotheses.

In response, many proponents of culturalist paradigms have adopted the vernacular of ‘thick data’ to defend their vulnerable position in the marketing research field. However, thick data proselytising fails to challenge several outmoded ontological assumptions that are manifest in the big data myth and it situates socio-cultural modes of marketing thought in a counterproductive technocratic discourse. In building this argument, I first discuss the relevant historical continuities and discontinuities that have shaped the big data myth and the thick data opportunism. Next, I argue that culturally oriented marketing researchers should promote a different ontological frame— the analytics of marketplace assemblages—to address how big data, or more accurately its socio-technical infrastructure, produces new kinds of emergent and hybrid market structures, modes of social aggregation, consumption practices, and prosumptive capacities.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 181, 'citationCount': 31, 'journal': {'volume': '35', 'pages': '207 - 230', 'name': 'Journal of Marketing Management'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Thompson2019TheD,\n author = {Craig J Thompson},\n journal = {Journal of Marketing Management},\n pages = {207 - 230},\n title = {The ‘big data’ myth and the pitfalls of ‘thick data’ opportunism: on the need for a different ontology of markets and consumption},\n volume = {35},\n year = {2019}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '32115604', 'name': 'Craig J Thompson'}]}, {'paperId': '4cea861ebc64a2f054f5c4421d9db58adf8493fb', 'title': 'The Magic of Danmaku: A Social Interaction Perspective of Gift Sending on Live Streaming Platforms', 'abstract': 'Abstract A novel function of live streaming is that viewers can send paid gifts to broadcasters. In addition, viewers can engage with broadcasters by sending danmaku, a type of comment scrolled across the screen in real time. This paper investigates the role of viewers’ social interaction in paid gifting on live streaming platforms. We argue that viewer-viewer interaction can prompt paid gifting by affecting viewers’ arousal level through stimuli extracted from danmaku. Types of danmaku-related stimuli are presence of others, social competition, and emotional stimuli. Specifically, presence of others is measured by total number of words; social competition by debate level; and emotional stimuli by similarity of danmaku, number of excitement-related words, and number of emoji. Using data from a major live streaming platform in China, empirical results show that except for number of emoji, the other four variables positively affect paid gifting.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 56, 'citationCount': 105, 'journal': {'name': 'University of California'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Zhou2018TheMO,\n author = {Jilei Zhou and Jing Zhou and Ying Ding and Hansheng Wang},\n journal = {University of California},\n title = {The Magic of Danmaku: A Social Interaction Perspective of Gift Sending on Live Streaming Platforms},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2206970199', 'name': 'Jilei Zhou'}, {'authorId': '2145787194', 'name': 'Jing Zhou'}, {'authorId': '2111239533', 'name': 'Ying Ding'}, {'authorId': '2113290900', 'name': 'Hansheng Wang'}]}, {'paperId': '6373a705ccad4d75d6c68e182eb8cb898234b844', 'title': 'Social motivations of live-streaming viewer engagement on Twitch', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 48, 'citationCount': 408, 'journal': {'volume': '84', 'pages': '58-67', 'name': 'Comput.

We apply theory from the economics literature to examine gifting behavior in a virtual world in which users' social status is reflected in observable social connections (friendships) and interactions (personal messages). We find strong evidence that gifting is associated with future enhancements of the gift giver's social status, consistent with a social status-seeking motivation, thus confirming a theorized behavior that is difficult to study in the real world. Our study has implications for system proprietors and managers because we show that gift giving increases system use continuance.

However, many of these apparent cases of sharing are better characterized as pseudo-sharing — commodity exchanges wrapped in a vocabulary of sharing. The present paper reviews subsequent research and theorizing as well as controversies that have emerged surrounding sharing and what is best regarded as pseudo-sharing — a wolf-insheep’s-clothing phenomenon whereby commodity exchange and potential exploitation of consumer co-creators present themselves in the guise of sharing. The paper begins with a pair of vignettes that highlight some of the contested meanings of sharing. By detailing four types of pseudo-sharing and four types of sharing that are specifically enabled or enhanced by Internet technologies, the paper argues that pseudo-sharing is distinguished by the presence of profit motives, the absence of feelings of community, and expectations of reciprocity.

In this study, we investigate why these objects are valued, what they mean to people, and how they are used. Through in-depth interviews and ethnographic observations, we identify three occasions that gifts of gold take a prominent role. First, we discuss giving gold coins and bracelets in ritualized occasions and locate this traditional practice within a system of economically embedded solidarity. Second, we explain self-gifting of gold items and discuss how such gift giving enables consumers to exercise self-control. Finally, we look at how gold gifts serve as means for women to build socioeconomic power and discuss traditional and modern versions of gold accumulation. Overall, we observe that, in the context of Turkish consumer culture, gifting of gold contains a bundle of meanings that cannot be polarized into utilitarian or symbolic. Gold gifts serve multiple purposes simultaneously, and economic motives do not necessarily contradict with and jeopardize the social nature of gift-giving behavior. Gold coins and bracelets stand as ambiguous objects that maintain their commodity status and financial value and at the same time gain relational and symbolic value. The appeal of gold gifts lies in their ability to navigate between the economic and the social, without subordinating one to the other.

The paper then examines how corporatized streamer guilds foreground the moneymaking capacity of virtual gifting at the expense of its potential for building communitarian and reciprocal relationships. Based on these structural dynamics, the commodification of virtual relations is further analyzed to demonstrate how the hegemonic construct of virtual gifting is perceived and reproduced at the individual level. The paper concludes by offering a reconsideration of the role of critical communication studies in turning the tide of China’s live streaming industry.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 83, 'citationCount': 49, 'journal': {'volume': '12', 'pages': '340 - 355', 'name': 'Chinese Journal of Communication'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Zhang2019VirtualGO,\n author = {Xiaoxing Zhang and Yu Xiang and Lei Hao},\n journal = {Chinese Journal of Communication},\n pages = {340 - 355},\n title = {Virtual gifting on China’s live streaming platforms: hijacking the online gift economy},\n volume = {12},\n year = {2019}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2108099413', 'name': 'Xiaoxing Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2068337056', 'name': 'Yu Xiang'}, {'authorId': '49953375', 'name': 'Lei Hao'}]}, {'paperId': '03349a298f872ce379889aeedf705bad54668942', 'title': 'China’s livestreaming industry: platforms, politics, and precarity', 'abstract': 'This article examines conditions placing China’s livestreamers as central focal points in the increasing tensions between the cultural politics and economic ambitions of digital China.

As relatively closed technical systems, apps pose new methodological challenges for sociocultural digital media research. This article describes a method, grounded in a combination of science and technology studies with cultural studies, through which researchers can perform a critical analysis of a given app. The method involves establishing an app’s environment of expected use by identifying and describing its vision, operating model and modes of governance. It then deploys a walkthrough technique to systematically and forensically step through the various stages of app registration and entry, everyday use and discontinuation of use. The walkthrough method establishes a foundational corpus of data upon which can be built a more detailed analysis of an app’s intended purpose, embedded cultural meanings and implied ideal users and uses. The walkthrough also serves as a foundation for further user-centred research that can identify how users resist these arrangements and appropriate app technology for their own purposes.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 66, 'citationCount': 460, 'journal': {'volume': '20', 'pages': '881 - 900', 'name': 'New Media & Society'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Light2018TheWM,\n author = {B.

Affordance, adopted from ecological psychology, is now widely used in technology studies, yet the term lacks a clear definition. This is especially problematic for scholars grappling with how to theorize the relationship between technology and sociality for complex socio-technical systems such as machine-learning algorithms, pervasive computing, the Internet of Things, and other such “smart” innovations. Within technology studies, emerging theories of materiality, affect, and mediation all necessitate a richer and more nuanced definition for affordance than the field currently uses. To solve this, we develop the concept of imagined affordance. Imagined affordances emerge between users’ perceptions, attitudes, and expectations; between the materiality and functionality of technologies; and between the intentions and perceptions of designers. We use imagined affordance to evoke the importance of imagination in affordances—expectations for technology that are not fully realized in conscious, rational knowledge. We also use imagined affordance to distinguish our process-oriented, socio-technical definition of affordance from the “imagined” consensus of the field around a flimsier use of the term. We also use it in order to better capture the importance of mediation, materiality, and affect. We suggest that imagined affordance helps to theorize the duality of materiality and communication technology: namely, that people shape their media environments, perceive them, and have agency within them because of imagined affordances.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 67, 'citationCount': 367, 'journal': {'volume': '1', 'name': 'Social Media + Society'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Nagy2015ImaginedAR,\n author = {Péter Nagy and Gina Neff},\n journal = {Social Media + Society},\n title = {Imagined Affordance: Reconstructing a Keyword for Communication Theory},\n volume = {1},\n year = {2015}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144210454', 'name': 'Péter Nagy'}, {'authorId': '37998480', 'name': 'Gina Neff'}]}, {'paperId': '3d717eb64873f0f3e97e601d786ac890eda5a26c', 'title': 'Love as a Fictitious Commodity: Gift-for-Sex Barters as Contractual Carriers of Intimacy', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 40, 'citationCount': 33, 'journal': {'volume': '17', 'pages': '598-616', 'name': 'Sexuality & Culture'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Swader2013LoveAA,\n author = {Christopher S.

Tony is a 6-year-old multiracial boy diagnosed as having attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-combined type who is followed in your primary care practice and has started on a stimulant medication. Tony continues to have difficulty with emotion regulation and impulse control both at home and at school. He was asked to leave his private school soon after beginning first grade because of physical fighting, emotional outbursts, and arguing with teachers.His mother made the decision to enroll Tony in online virtual schooling for the remainder of the academic year, with the plan to transition back to traditional school for the next academic year. They have enrolled in a program that offers lessons online and sends materials to the home for the child to use to complete certain types of assignments (e.g., science experiments). Virtual schools are different from traditional home schooling because children receive their instruction from teachers online with parental assistance as opposed to parents being responsible for teaching all material. Tony's mother comes to your practice requesting assistance with setting up an appropriate school environment for her son at home, where she can monitor and support his academic progress.Tony is a bright child, with an Intelligence Quotient in the superior range. He has advanced academic skills, but he becomes dysregulated if he is told he is wrong or that he has answered a question incorrectly. For example, if he answered a question incorrectly in class, he would become verbally abusive toward his teacher and often have temper tantrums. This challenging behavior occurred daily at school and was one of the factors leading to his expulsion. The behavior had predated the introduction of stimulant medication and had remained consistent after he began medication.Tony's parents are highly educated, and both parents hold professional jobs with steady income. His parents have good command of typical behavior management strategies such as the use of rewards, time out, and behavioral contingencies to target noncompliance and temper tantrums. However, Tony's difficulty identifying and regulating his emotions leads to emotional outbursts and shutdowns that have thus far been unresponsive to standard behavior management techniques. Tony continued to have outbursts even when the behavior was ignored. His mother is concerned not only about his learning during the coming year but also about his social relationships and the family dynamic. Tony's outbursts cause significant disruption in the home and are a source of tension among parents and siblings.His mother is asking for advice on how to support his behavior better at home now that he will be spending his entire day there. How might you assist this child and his mother by helping to integrate therapeutic goals into the academic environment?",2016,8,1,"{'name': 'Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP', 'pages': '\n          254-6\n        ', 'volume': '37 3'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wallace2016AttentionDeficitHyperactivityDB,\n author = {Claire Wallace and C.

This text argues that our view of human intelligence is far too narrow, ignoring a crucial range of abilities that matter immensely in terms of how we do in life. Drawing on brain and behavioural research, the author shows the factors at work when people of high IQ flounder and those of modest IQ do surprisingly well. These factors add up to a different way of succeeding in life - one the author terms ""emotional intelligence"". Emotional intelligence includes self-awareness and impulse control, persistence, zeal and self-motivation, empathy and social deftness. These are the qualities that mark people that excel. They are also the hallmarks of character and self-discipline, of altruism and compassion. As Goleman demonstrates, the personal costs of deficits in emotional intelligence can range from problems in marriage and poor physical health in adults to eating disorders and depression in children. But the news is hopeful. Emotional intelligence is not fixed at birth. Goleman\'s argument gives insights into the brain architecture underlying emotion and rationality. He shows how emotional intelligence can be nurtured and strengthened in all of us.

Th is study reveals the ways in which social media platforms (specifi cally, Douyin and Momo) design their showroom livestreaming interfaces and aff ordances to normalise and commodify the aff ective interactions between female streamers and their male viewers and to establish a gendered power relationship. Using the walkthrough method during two stages of the apps (entry to live-streaming chatrooms and the everyday use of li ve-streaming chatrooms), this study analyses various aff ordances regarding their functional, sensory, and cognitive impacts on users. Th is research thereby demonstrates that the live-streaming interface design constructs two types of subject positions.

This provides an interesting case study to investigate how an emerging internet company adapts its products to better fit divergent expectations, cultures, and policy frameworks in China and abroad.

The strongest point of Noble’s book is that it facilitates a process whereby readers from all fields of knowledge can develop a critically reflective disposition towards information online, and to see how search processes often thought to be the most neutral and stable elements of the web can be understood to be biased and deeply flawed.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 2, 'citationCount': 14, 'journal': {'volume': '22', 'pages': '577 - 579', 'name': 'New Media & Society'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Glatt2020SocialME,\n author = {Zoë Glatt},\n journal = {New Media & Society},\n pages = {577 - 579},\n title = {Social Media Entertainment: The New Intersection of Hollywood and Silicon Valley},\n volume = {22},\n year = {2020}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '118659546', 'name': 'Zoë Glatt'}]}, {'paperId': '636b144bfa1a8e60c991a16957a3d9fb886d4709', 'title': 'Virtual gifting on China’s live streaming platforms: hijacking the online gift economy', 'abstract': 'This paper presents an exploratory case study on the nascent “virtual gifting” feature of China’s live streaming platforms.

The paper then examines how corporatized streamer guilds foreground the moneymaking capacity of virtual gifting at the expense of its potential for building communitarian and reciprocal relationships. Based on these structural dynamics, the commodification of virtual relations is further analyzed to demonstrate how the hegemonic construct of virtual gifting is perceived and reproduced at the individual level.

The walkthrough method establishes a foundational corpus of data upon which can be built a more detailed analysis of an app’s intended purpose, embedded cultural meanings and implied ideal users and uses.

Affordance, adopted from ecological psychology, is now widely used in technology studies, yet the term lacks a clear definition. This is especially problematic for scholars grappling with how to theorize the relationship between technology and sociality for complex socio-technical systems such as machine-learning algorithms, pervasive computing, the Internet of Things, and other such “smart” innovations. Within technology studies, emerging theories of materiality, affect, and mediation all necessitate a richer and more nuanced definition for affordance than the field currently uses. To solve this, we develop the concept of imagined affordance. Imagined affordances emerge between users’ perceptions, attitudes, and expectations; between the materiality and functionality of technologies; and between the intentions and perceptions of designers. We use imagined affordance to evoke the importance of imagination in affordances—expectations for technology that are not fully realized in conscious, rational knowledge. We also use imagined affordance to distinguish our process-oriented, socio-technical definition of affordance from the “imagined” consensus of the field around a flimsier use of the term. We also use it in order to better capture the importance of mediation, materiality, and affect. We suggest that imagined affordance helps to theorize the duality of materiality and communication technology: namely, that people shape their media environments, perceive them, and have agency within them because of imagined affordances.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 67, 'citationCount': 367, 'journal': {'volume': '1', 'name': 'Social Media + Society'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Nagy2015ImaginedAR,\n author = {Péter Nagy and Gina Neff},\n journal = {Social Media + Society},\n title = {Imagined Affordance: Reconstructing a Keyword for Communication Theory},\n volume = {1},\n year = {2015}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144210454', 'name': 'Péter Nagy'}, {'authorId': '37998480', 'name': 'Gina Neff'}]}, {'paperId': '3d717eb64873f0f3e97e601d786ac890eda5a26c', 'title': 'Love as a Fictitious Commodity: Gift-for-Sex Barters as Contractual Carriers of Intimacy', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 40, 'citationCount': 33, 'journal': {'volume': '17', 'pages': '598-616', 'name': 'Sexuality & Culture'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Swader2013LoveAA,\n author = {Christopher S.

 The development of virtual enterprise is inseparable from the support of partners. Due to information asymmetry, the choice of virtual enterprise partners is blind, and simple matching formula is difficult to meet. At the same time, the psychology of the matching subject is based on the maximization of its own interests rather than the maximization of collective interests. There are interest contradictions and conflicts between subjects, and they may eventually fall into a “prisoner's dilemma”. Therefore, how to carry out the research on emotion regulation based on multi-agent heterogeneous game preference and bilateral partner preference is very important.
 
 
 
 Aiming at the contradictions and interest conflicts between subjects in the process of virtual enterprise partner matching, combined with the basic characteristics of subject language preference evaluation, the game idea is introduced into the process of virtual enterprise partner bilateral matching analysis, a bilateral matching game model of heterogeneous multi-attribute preference and subjects' psychological behavior is proposed, and the influence of the changes of subjects' psychological behavior on the evolution law of bilateral matching game system is analyzed, The Nash equilibrium strategy of bilateral matching is discussed. In order to verify the impact of the algorithm on emotion, this study uses relevant scales to investigate. (1) Positive emotion scale. The Panas emotion scale developed by Watson et al. Is widely used to measure emotion. The scale includes two dimensions: positive emotion and negative emotion. There are 6 questions in this dimension, and Likert scores 5 points (1 means “very inconsistent”, 5 means “very consistent”, the same below). The Cronbach coefficient of this questionnaire is 0.90. (2) Motivation. The problem of measuring motivation is mainly the motivation scale compiled by Phan, which has 8 questions and is scored with Likert 5 points. (3) Social support scale. The scale is adapted from the social support scale compiled by Ye Yuemei et al. It has eight questions, using Likert's five points scoring method. Clonbach α the coefficient of the scale is 0.87. (4) Behavioral propensity scale. Propensity dimension in intention measurement. The scale has 6 questions, and Likert scores 5 points. The clonbach coefficient of the scale is 0.95.
 
 
 
 The results of case analysis show that the model can make full use of the multi-attribute preference information of heterogeneous subjects, describe the mechanism of psychological behavior affecting the evolution of game system, and help virtual enterprises match business partners; This has important value and significance for the establishment of virtual enterprises and their industrial agglomeration effect. In the influence process of cooperative anxiety, emotional response plays an intermediary role, psychological elasticity plays a regulatory role, and emotional response to life events plays an intermediary role. That is, the higher the psychological elasticity, the higher the excessive coping style of the game, and vice versa.
 
 
 
 Various stable matching solutions can be obtained by solving the model, and the conclusion is more suitable for the matching decision-making process of both parties in the actual process, which makes the model can be applied to various scenarios, such as the selection of battery suppliers of new energy vehicles and smart phone screen suppliers, which has greater practical value and significance. It should be pointed out that there are some deficiencies in the setting conditions of the model method, mainly because some individuals in the group cooperate to form an alliance, so as to form a community of interests.

A previous case study has demonstrated that the integrity of both amygdalae is essential to regulate interpersonal distances. Despite unilateral lesion to the amygdala, as to other sectors of the medial temporal cortex, are known to also affect social behavior, their role in the regulation of interpersonal distances has never been investigated. Here, we sought to fill this gap by testing three patients with unilateral temporal lesions following surgical resections, including one patient with a lesion mainly centered on the amygdala and two with lesions to adjacent medial temporal cortex, on two versions of the stop distance paradigm (i.e. in a virtual reality environment and in a real setting). Our results showed that all three patients set shorter interpersonal distances compared to neurotypical controls. In addition, compared to controls, none of the patients adjusted such physical distances depending on facial emotional expressions, despite they preserved ability to categorize them. Finally, patients' heart rate responses differed from controls when viewing approaching faces. Our findings bring compelling evidence that unilateral lesions within the medial temporal cortex, not necessarily restricted to the amygdala, are sufficient to alter interpersonal distance, thus shedding new light on the neural circuitry regulating distance in social interactions.",2022,0,0,"{'name': 'Cerebral Cortex Communications', 'volume': '3'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Dureux2022PersonalSR,\n author = {A.

In particular, we describe the Empathic Companion, an animated interface agent that accompanies the user in the setting of a virtual job interview. This interface application takes physiological data (skin conductance and electromyography) of a user in realtime, interprets them as emotions, and addresses the user's affective states in the form of empathic feedback. The Empathic Companion is conceived as an educational agent that supports job seekers preparing for a job interview. We also present results from an exploratory study that aims to evaluate the impact of the Empathic Companion by measuring users' skin conductance and heart rate. While an overall positive effect of the Empathic Companion could not be shown, the outcome of the experiment suggests that empathic feedback has a positive effect on the interviewee's stress level while hearing the interviewer question."", 'year': 2005, 'referenceCount': 30, 'citationCount': 305, 'journal': {'volume': '19', 'pages': '267 - 285', 'name': 'Applied Artificial Intelligence'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': ""@Article{Prendinger2005THEEC,\n author = {H.

Lazarus's cognitive-phenomenological analysis of psychological stress provides the theoreticalframework. Information about recently experienced stressful encounters was elicited through monthly interviews and self-report questionnaires completed between interviews. At the end of each interview and questionnaire, the participant indicated on a 68-item Ways of Coping checklist those coping thoughts and actions used in the specific encounter. A mean of 13.3 episodes was reported by each participant. Two functions of coping, problem-focused and emotion-focused, are analyzed with separate measures. Both problemand emotion-focused coping were used in 98% of the 1,332 episodes, emphasizing that coping conceptualized in either defensive or problem-solving terms is incomplete-both functions are usually involved. Intraindividual analyses show that people are more variable than consistent in their coping patterns. The context of an event, who is involved, how it is appraised, age, and gender are examined as potential influences on coping. Context and how the event is appraised are the most potent factors. Work contexts favor problem-focused coping, and health contexts favor emotionfocused coping.

Relevant conceptual issues concerning both the nature of emotion and the structure of the autonomic nervous system are discussed in the context of the development of research methods appropriate for studying this question. Are different emotional states associated with distinct patterns of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity? This is an old question that is currently enjoying a modest revival in psychology. In the 1950s autonomic specificity was a key item on the agenda of the newly emerging discipline of psychophysiology, which saw as its mission the scientific exploration of the mind-body relationship using the tools of electrophysiological measurement. But the field of psychophysiology had the misfortune of coming of age during a period in which psychology drifted away from its physiological roots, a period in which psychology was dominated by learning, behaviourism, personality theory and later by cognition. Psychophysiology in the period between 1960 and 1980 reflected these broader trends in psychology by focusing on such issues as autonomic markers of perceptual states (e.g. orienting, stimulus processing), the interplay between personality factors and ANS responsivity, operant conditioning of autonomic functions, and finally, electrophysiological markers of cognitive states. Research on autonomic specificity in emotion became increasingly rare. Perhaps as a result of these historical trends in psychology, or perhaps because research on emotion and physiology is so difficult to do well, there 18 SOCIAL PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY AND EMOTION exists only a small body of studies on ANS specificity. Although almost all of these studies report some evidence for the existence of specificity, the prevailing zeitgeist has been that specificity has not been empirically established. At this point in time a review of the existing literature would not be very informative, for it would inevitably dissolve into a critique of methods. Instead, what I hope to accomplish in this chapter is to provide a new framework for thinking about ANS specificity, and to propose guidelines for carrying out research on this issue that will be cognizant of the recent methodological and theoretical advances that have been made both in psychophysiology and in research on emotion. Emotion as organization From the outset, the definition of emotion that underlies this chapter should be made explicit. For me the essential function of emotion is organization. The selection of emotion for preservation across time and species is based on the need for an efficient mechanism than can mobilize and organize disparate response systems to deal with environmental events that pose a threat to survival. In this view the prototypical context for human emotions is those situations in which a multi-system response must be organized quickly, where time is not available for the lengthy processes of deliberation, reformulation, planning and rehearsal; where a fine degree of co-ordination is required among systems as disparate as the muscles of the face and the organs of the viscera; and where adaptive behaviours that normally reside near the bottom of behavioural hierarchies must be instantaneously shifted to the top. Specificity versus undifferentiated arousal In this model of emotion as organization it is assumed that each component system is capable of a number of different responses, and that the emotion will guide the selection of responses from each system. Component systems differ in terms of the number of response possibilities. Thus, in the facial expressive system a selection must be made among a limited set of prototypic emotional expressions (which are but a subset of the enormous number of expressions the face is capable of assuming). A motor behaviour must also be selected from a similarly reduced set of responses consisting of fighting, fleeing, freezing, hiding, etc. All major theories of emotion would accept the proposition that activation of the ANS is one of the changes that occur during emotion. But theories differ as to how many different ANS patterns constitute the set of selection possibilities. At one extreme are those who would argue that there are only two ANS patterns: 'off' and 'on'. The 'on' ANS pattern, according to this view, consists EMOTION AND THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 19 of a high-level, global, diffuse ANS activation, mediated primarily by the sympathetic branch of the ANS. The manifestations of this pattern rapid and forcefulcontractions of the heart, rapid and deep breathing, increased systolic blood pressure, sweating, dry mouth, redirection of blood flow to large skeletal muscles, peripheral vasoconstriction, release of large amounts of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla, and the resultant release of glucose from the liver are well known. Cannon (1927) described this pattern in some detail, arguing that this kind of high-intensity, undifferentiated arousal accompanied all emotions .. Among contemporary theories the notion of undifferentiated arousal is most clearly found in Mandler's theory (Mandler, 1975). However, undifferentiated arousal also played a major role in the extraordinarily influential cognitive/physiological theory of Schachter and Singer (1962). According to this theory, undifferentiated arousal is a necessary precondition for emotionan extremely plastic medium to be moulded by cognitive processes working in concert with the available cues from the social environment. At the other extreme are those who argue that there are a large number of patterns of ANS activation, each associated with a different emotion (or subset of emotions). This is the traditional specificity position. Its classic statement is often attributed to James (1884), although Alexander (1950) provided an even more radical version. The specificity position fuelled a number of experimental studies in the 1950s and 1960s, all attempting to identify some of these autonomic patterns (e.g. Averill, 1969; Ax, 1953; Funkenstein, King and Drolette, 1954; Schachter, 1957; Sternbach, 1962). Despite these studies, all of which reported support for ANS specificity, the undifferentiated arousal theory, especially as formulated by Schachter and Singer (1962) and their followers, has been dominant for a great many years. Is the ANS capable of specific action No matter how appealing the notion of ANS specificity might be in the abstract, there would be little reason to pursue it in the laboratory if the ANS were only capable of producing one pattern of arousal. There is no question that the pattern of high-level sympathetic arousal described earlier is one pattern that the ANS can produce. Cannon's arguments notwithstanding, I believe there now is quite ample evidence that the ANS is capable of a number of different patterns of activation. Whether these patterns are reliably associated with different emotions remains an empirical question, but the potential is surely there. A case in support of this potential for specificity can be based on: (a) the neural structure of the ANS; (b) the stimulation neurochemistry of the ANS; and (c) empirical findings. 20 SOCIAL PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY AND EMOTION"", 'year': 1988, 'referenceCount': 28, 'citationCount': 300, 'journal': {'volume': '', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Levenson1988EmotionAT,\n author = {R.

Specifically, students have been experiencing high-stress levels due to social isolation and virtual learning environments that have caused significant changes to their daily lives. This study explores the emotional perception of music listening to analyze whether listening to self-selected music is an effective coping mechanism.  An online questionnaire consisting of two closed-ended and six open-ended questions was created on Google Forms and sent out to high school students through email and social media platforms to understand the students’ perceptions better. 16 participant responses were thoroughly analyzed and manually coded to create different themes and average values. Findings from the survey revealed that the majority of the students experienced some level of stress due to the pandemic, and the frequency of listening to music increased since social distancing regulations were implemented. Analysis of student responses revealed that their emotions when listening to music were happiness, sadness, motivation, relaxation, and stimulation. Additionally, pop and hip-hop were the most preferred genres of music by students, and listening to music was generally viewed as a positive form of coping. This study explores whether listening to music can be used as a stress therapy in young adults. However, future research needs to be conducted to make broader implications and investigate the reasoning behind the emotional impact of music.",2023,0,0,{'name': 'Journal of Student Research'},"{'bibtex': ""@Article{Lee2023ExploringTE,\n author = {Kebin Lee and Rosemari Nam and Daniele Olivo},\n booktitle = {Journal of student-scientists' research},\n journal = {Journal of Student Research},\n title = {Exploring the Emotional Perception of High School Students When Utilizing Music as a Coping Mechanism during the COVID-19 Pandemic},\n year = {2023}\n}\n""}","[{'authorId': '2211994650', 'name': 'Kebin Lee'}, {'authorId': '2132293157', 'name': 'Rosemari Nam'}, {'authorId': '150079938', 'name': 'Daniele Olivo'}]",[]

Despite evidence of deficits in executive functions in individuals with ASD, little is known about executive dysfunctions as candidate cognitive endophenotypes for ASD. In this study, we investigated executive functions in youths with ASD, their unaffected siblings and typically developing controls (TDC). Methods We recruited 240 youths with a clinical diagnosis of ASD (aged 6–18 years), 147 unaffected siblings of ASD youths, and 240 TDC youths. TDC youths were recruited based on the age and sex distribution of the ASD youths. Participants were assessed using the verbal Digit Span test and four executive function tasks from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, including Intra-dimensional/Extra-dimensional Shift (I/ED), Spatial Span (SSP), Spatial Working Memory (SWM), and Stocking of Cambridge (SoC). Results ASD youths, relative to TDC, performed significantly worse in executive function tasks assessing verbal working memory (forward and backward digit span), set-shifting (I/ED), visuospatial working memory (SSP, SWM), and planning/problem solving (SoC). Furthermore, unaffected siblings, relative to TDC, performed worse in forward and backward digit recalls and made more errors in SWM. These results were independent of the effects of age, sex, IQ, and symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

In doing so, we provide data that address 3 important and often overlooked research questions in the field of autism and technology, working in school-based settings with 31 autistic children from 6 to 16 years of age. First, what type of VR HMD device (and experiences therein) are preferred by children on the autism spectrum using HMDs (given possible sensory concerns). Second, how do children on the autism spectrum report the physical experience, enjoyment, and potential of VR HMDs in their classrooms? Finally, we were interested in exploring what children on the autism spectrum would like to use VR in schools for? Through a mixed methods approach, we found that costly and technologically advanced HMDs were preferred (namely: HTC Vive). In addition, HMDs were reported as being enjoyable, physically and visually comfortable, easy to use, and exciting, and children wanted to use them again. They identified several potential usages for HMDs, including relaxing/feeling calm, being able to explore somewhere virtually before visiting in the real world, and to develop learning opportunities in school.

Methods: Fourteen non-medicated school-aged children with ADHD, received 18 training sessions during 6 weeks. Training included walking on a treadmill while negotiating virtual obstacles. Behavioral symptoms, cognition and gait were tested before and after the training and at 6-weeks follow-up. Results: Based on parental report, there was a significant improvement in children’s social problems and psychosomatic behavior after the training. Executive function and memory were improved post-training while attention was unchanged. Gait regularity significantly increased during dual-task walking. Long-term training effects were maintained in memory and executive function.

The focus of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on real-world data from novel digital sources, and the emergence of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes to reimburse for digital monitoring and neurobehavioral testing suggest an increasing acceptance of the role of technology in augmenting clinical care and research. Empowered Brain is an augmented reality and artificial intelligence-based social-emotional communication aid for students with ASD. In this study, student performance on Empowered Brain is correlated to validated clinical measures of ADHD. Seven high school students with a diagnosis of ASD were recruited from a public high school. All students were assessed for severity of ADHD-related symptoms via three clinical gold-standard assessments, namely the Aberrant Behavioral Checklist (ABC), Social Responsiveness Scale 2 (SRS-2), and Teacher Report Form (TRF). Students used Empowered Brain over a one-week period. We measured the correlation of student in-game performance (as measured by point- and star-based rewards) relative to the hyperactivity subscale of the ABC (ABC-H), and the ADHD-subscale of the TRF. All seven students completed the study and managed to successfully use Empowered Brain. Students received a culminative total of 32 sessions, an average of 4.6 sessions per student (range 2–8). Student in-game performance demonstrated highly significant correlation relative to ABC-H (points: p = 0.0013; stars: p = 0.0013), and significant correlation to TRF ADHD scores (points: p = 0.012; stars: p = 0.012). No adverse effects were noted among students who used Empowered Brain. New technologies may herald novel ways of identifying and characterizing symptoms of ADHD in student populations. This study provides evidence that Empowered Brain in-game performance correlates with ADHD symptom severity in students with ASD. Larger samples are required to validate these findings, with more diverse participants that can also widen the generalizability of these findings to a broader range of brain conditions that manifest with inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Through further research, we may find that such technologies can help us to identify and longitudinally monitor such symptoms, and potentially aid in severity stratification and digital phenotyping.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 51, 'citationCount': 11, 'journal': {'volume': '6', 'name': 'Children'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Keshav2019DigitalAA,\n author = {Neha U.

Virtual reality (VR) is a relatively new intervention that can be used to provide distraction during, or to prepare patients for, medical procedures. This meta-analysis is the first to collate evidence on the effectiveness of VR on reducing pain and anxiety in pediatric patients undergoing medical procedures. METHODS: On April 25, 2018, we searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO with the keywords “VR,” “children,” and “adolescents.” Studies that applied VR in a somatic setting with participants ≤21 years of age were included. VR was defined as a fully immersive 3-dimensional environment displayed in surround stereoscopic vision on a head-mounted display (HMD). We evaluated pain and anxiety outcomes during medical procedures in VR and standard care conditions. RESULTS: We identified 2889 citations, of which 17 met our inclusion criteria. VR was applied as distraction (n = 16) during venous access, dental, burn, or oncological care or as exposure (n = 1) before elective surgery under general anesthesia. The effect of VR was mostly studied in patients receiving burn care (n = 6). The overall weighted standardized mean difference (SMD) for VR was 1.30 (95% CI, 0.68–1.91) on patient-reported pain (based on 14 studies) and 1.32 (95% CI, 0.21–2.44) on patient-reported anxiety (based on 7 studies). The effect of VR on pediatric pain was also significant when observed by caregivers (SMD = 2.08; 95% CI, 0.55–3.61) or professionals (SMD = 3.02; 95% CI, 0.79–2.25). For anxiety, limited observer data were available. CONCLUSIONS: VR research in pediatrics has mainly focused on distraction. Large effect sizes indicate that VR is an effective distraction intervention to reduce pain and anxiety in pediatric patients undergoing a wide variety of medical procedures. However, further research on the effect of VR exposure as a preparation tool for medical procedures is needed because of the paucity of research into this field.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 57, 'citationCount': 205, 'journal': {'volume': '129', 'pages': '1344 - 1353', 'name': 'Anesthesia and Analgesia'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Eijlers2019SystematicRA,\n author = {R.

While mobile technology–based therapy can alleviate wait-lists and scale for increasing demand, few clinical trials exist to support its use for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) care. Objective To evaluate the efficacy of Superpower Glass, an artificial intelligence–driven wearable behavioral intervention for improving social outcomes of children with ASD. Design, Setting, and Participants A randomized clinical trial in which participants received the Superpower Glass intervention plus standard of care applied behavioral analysis therapy and control participants received only applied behavioral analysis therapy. Assessments were completed at the Stanford University Medical School, and enrolled participants used the Superpower Glass intervention in their homes. Children aged 6 to 12 years with a formal ASD diagnosis who were currently receiving applied behavioral analysis therapy were included. Families were recruited between June 2016 and December 2017. The first participant was enrolled on November 1, 2016, and the last appointment was completed on April 11, 2018. Data analysis was conducted between April and October 2018. Interventions The Superpower Glass intervention, deployed via Google Glass (worn by the child) and a smartphone app, promotes facial engagement and emotion recognition by detecting facial expressions and providing reinforcing social cues. Families were asked to conduct 20-minute sessions at home 4 times per week for 6 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures Four socialization measures were assessed using an intention-to-treat analysis with a Bonferroni test correction. Results Overall, 71 children (63 boys [89%]; mean [SD] age, 8.38 [2.46] years) diagnosed with ASD were enrolled (40 [56.3%] were randomized to treatment, and 31 (43.7%) were randomized to control). Children receiving the intervention showed significant improvements on the Vineland Adaptive Behaviors Scale socialization subscale compared with treatment as usual controls (mean [SD] treatment impact, 4.58 [1.62]; P\u2009=\u2009.005). Positive mean treatment effects were also found for the other 3 primary measures but not to a significance threshold of P\u2009=\u2009.0125. Conclusions and Relevance The observed 4.58-point average gain on the Vineland Adaptive Behaviors Scale socialization subscale is comparable with gains observed with standard of care therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized clinical trial to demonstrate efficacy of a wearable digital intervention to improve social behavior of children with ASD. The intervention reinforces facial engagement and emotion recognition, suggesting either or both could be a mechanism of action driving the observed improvement. This study underscores the potential of digital home therapy to augment the standard of care.

We analyzed the newly developed VR continuous performance test (VR-CPT) for Korean children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and typically developing children (TDC). To identify specific features of a virtual environment that influence the attention performance of children, we investigated whether the presence of a virtual teacher and social cues in the VR environment affects their attention performance. A total of 38 participants (18 TDC and 20 ADHD children and adolescents) were recruited for VR-CPT testing. Bivariate correlational analysis was conducted to examine the associations between the results of the VR-CPT and ADHD questionnaires to determine the capacity of VR-CPT to mirror real-life attention behaviors. Mixed-design analysis of variables was conducted to compare the effects of the social aspects of the VR-CPT on attention performance in groups. There were significant associations between ADHD rating scores and the omission error, commission error, reaction time (RT), reaction time variability (RTV), and total accuracy of the VR-CPT in the ADHD group. In addition, the ADHD group exhibited comparable performance with the TDC group for all measures of the VR-CPT. Also there seemed to be a trend of decreasing RTV when a virtual teacher with social cues was present compared with the equipment control condition in the ADHD group. Performance in the VR-CPT program was associated with behavioral measures of ADHD symptoms. Adding social aspects to a VR environment commonly encountered by children and adolescents has the potential to make a difference in the attention performance of youths with ADHD.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 31, 'citationCount': 18, 'journal': {'volume': '22 3', 'pages': '\n          198-204\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Eom2019DevelopmentOV,\n author = {Hyojung Eom and K.

It is also relevant, as some authors claim, that physical exercise may be considered as an adjunctive therapy to improve cognition and memory after strokes. Thus, the integration of physical and cognitive therapies could offer potential benefits. In addition, in general these therapies are usually considered boring, so it is important to include some features that improve the motivation of patients. As a result, computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation systems and serious games for health are more and more present. In order to achieve a continuous, efficient and sustainable rehabilitation of patients, they will have to be carried out as part of the rehabilitation in their own home. However, current home systems lack the therapist’s presence, and this leads to two major challenges for such systems. First, they need sensors and actuators that compensate for the absence of the therapist’s eyes and hands. Second, the system needs to capture and apply the therapist’s expertise. With this aim, and based on our previous proposals, we propose an ambient intelligence environment for cognitive rehabilitation at home, combining physical and cognitive activities, by implementing a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) that gathers, as far as possible, the knowledge of a rehabilitation expert. Moreover, smart sensors and actuators will attempt to make up for the absence of the therapist. Furthermore, the proposed system will feature a remote monitoring tool, so that the therapist can supervise the patients’ exercises. Finally, an evaluation will be presented where experts in the rehabilitation field showed their satisfaction with the proposed system.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 63, 'citationCount': 26, 'journal': {'volume': '18', 'name': 'Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Oliver2018AmbientIE,\n author = {Miguel Oliver and Miguel A.

These challenges hinder academic progress and frequently persist despite educational, behavioral, and medical interventions. An assistive smartglasses technology may aid these individuals, especially if the technology is efficacious in ecologically-valid school settings. This study explored the feasibility and efficacy of Empowered Brain, a computerized smartglasses intervention designed as a socio-emotional behavioral aid for students with ASD. Methods: This two-part six-week study involved four school children with ASD from a public elementary school. The study incorporated an initial three-week feasibility stage followed by a three-week controlled longitudinal efficacy stage. Both stages involved the use of a twice-daily socio-emotional intervention with the smartglasses. Educators completed pre-intervention and post-intervention Aberrant Behavioral Checklist (ABC) ratings at the start of the feasibility stage, and weekly during the efficacy stage. Primary outcome measures were improvements in the ABC subscales of irritability, hyperactivity, and social withdrawal. Results: Students in both feasibility and efficacy stages demonstrated improvements (decreases) in irritability, hyperactivity, and social withdrawal compared to a baseline period and control periods, respectively. Participants in the controlled efficacy stage demonstrated decreased ABC subscale scores of 90% for irritability, 41.6% for hyperactivity, and 45.6% for social withdrawal. An intervention exposure-response improvement in irritability and hyperactivity was found during the efficacy stage. Educators rated the technology as superior or vastly superior compared to other assistive technologies. Conclusion: A substantial number of school children with ASD demonstrate chronic and impairing cognitive and behavioral challenges. This study provides evidence that Empowered Brain, a smartglasses-based socio-emotional aid for autism, is both feasible and efficacious in improving symptoms of social withdrawal, irritability, and hyperactivity in students with autism. The improvement is demonstrated as part of a longitudinal school-based intervention. Further studies involving larger samples and incorporation of randomized controlled trial methodology are underway to further elucidate the impact of this technology.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 82, 'citationCount': 44, 'journal': {'volume': '8', 'name': 'Behavioral Sciences'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Vahabzadeh2018ImprovedSA,\n author = {Arshya Vahabzadeh and Neha U.

For this aim, the research project Vi-SMARt is being conducted for evaluating whether and how different technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), multi-sensorial feedback, or telemonitoring, may be exploited for the development of the next generation of TR systems. Beyond traditional aural and visual feedback, the exploitation of haptic sense by using devices such as haptic gloves or wristbands, can provide patients with additional guidance in the rehabilitation process. For telemonitoring, Electroencephalography (EEG) devices show signs of being a promising approach, not only to monitor patients’ emotions, but also to obtain neuro-feedback useful for controlling his/her interaction with the system and thus to provide a better rehabilitation experience.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 61, 'citationCount': 17, 'journal': {'volume': '12', 'name': 'Frontiers in Neuroinformatics'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Navarro2018AdaptiveMP,\n author = {Elena Navarro and P.

Virtual reality (VR) distraction offers promise for needle-related pain and distress given its highly immersive and interactive virtual environment. This study assessed the usability (ease of use and understanding, acceptability) of a custom VR intervention for children with cancer undergoing implantable venous access device (IVAD) needle insertion. Method: Three iterative cycles of mixed-method usability testing with semistructured interviews were undertaken to refine the VR. Results: Participants included 17 children and adolescents (8-18 years old) with cancer who used the VR intervention prior to or during IVAD access. Most participants reported the VR as easy to use (82%) and understand (94%), and would like to use it during subsequent needle procedures (94%). Based on usability testing, refinements were made to VR hardware, software, and clinical implementation. Refinements focused on increasing responsiveness, interaction, and immersion of the VR program, reducing head movement for VR interaction, and enabling participant alerts to steps of the procedure by clinical staff. No adverse events of nausea or dizziness were reported. Conclusions: The VR intervention was deemed acceptable and safe.

VR provides an immersive experience into a simulated environment. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterised by social communication deficits and repetitive behaviours. Children with ASD often require social skills training while VR provides a safe, controllable environment to practice skills repeatedly. The Centre for Innovative Applications of Internet and Multimedia Technologies (AIMTech Centre) at City University of Hong Kong developed a VR-enabled training program to examine its efficacy on emotional and social skills with six VR scenarios depicting the daily lives of typical children in Hong Kong. 94 children from mainstream primary schools in Hong Kong completed the study and 72 children were included in the analysis. Children from training group scored higher on emotion expression and regulation (M = 20.2, SD = 3.00) than before the training (M = 18.9, SD = 3.57, t(35) = −2.174, p = .037) and higher on social interaction and adaptation after the training (M = 21.8, SD = 2.99) than before training (M = 20.2, SD = 3.43, t(35) = −3.987, p < .0005). There was a statistically significant interaction between group and time on affective expressions, F(1, 70) = 5.223, p = .025, partial η2 = .069, and on social reciprocity, F(1, 70) = 7.769, p = .007, partial η2 = .100. Children were able to engage in VR training despite initial challenges with viewing goggles. Some children declined to participate due to scheduling reasons which may be minimised through the adoption of head-mounted displays as a portable, cost-effective device. VR seems to be a promising asset to traditional training and therapy while the importance trainers’ or therapists’ support has yet to be further investigated.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 7, 'citationCount': 79, 'journal': {'volume': '10', 'pages': '110 - 112', 'name': 'London Journal of Primary Care'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Yuan2018UsingVR,\n author = {Sze Ngar Vanessa Yuan and H.

The total sample was comprised of 508 participants from Grades 7 to 12, 241 males (47.4%) and 267 females (52.6%), each of whom completed the questionnaires on two separate occasions. Three [intrapersonal (α = .83, CR = .86, and McDonald Omega = .86), stress management (α = .83, CR = .86, and McDonald Omega = .85) and adaptability (α = .82, CR = .85, and McDonald Omega = .85)] of the four scales had acceptable internal consistency. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were used with FACTOR and EQS version 6.1 software to examine validity evidence based on internal structure drawn from the scores on the EQ-i: YV-S, supporting the multidimensionality of the questionnaire. Three models were tested; the best fit to the data was the hierarchical model (S-Bχ2 / df = 2.11, CFI = .93 and RMSEA = .047), which hypothesized that the four specific factors (interpersonal, intrapersonal, stress management, and adaptability) were explained with a second-order factor, Emotional-Social-Intelligence (ESI).

Virtual reality-based rehabilitation therapy is effective in motivating children with CP. This study investigated the effects of treadmill training with virtual reality on gait, balance, muscular strength, and gross motor function in children with CP. Eighteen children with spastic CP were randomly divided into the virtual reality treadmill training (VRTT) group (9 subjects, mean age, 10.2 years) and treadmill training (TT) group (9 subjects, mean age, 9.4 years). The groups performed their respective programs as well as conventional physical therapy 3 times/week for 8 weeks. Muscle strength was assessed using a digitalized manual muscle tester. Gross motor function was assessed using the Gross Motor Functional Measure (GMFM). Balance was assessed using the Pediatric Balance Scale (PBS). Gait speed was assessed using the 10-meter walk test (10MWT), and gait endurance was assessed using the 2-minute walk test (2MWT). After training, gait and balance was improved in the VRTT compared to the TT group (P < 0.05). Muscular strength was significantly greater in the VRTT group than the TT group, except for right hamstring strength. The improvements in GMFM (standing) and PBS scores were greater in the VRTT group than the TT group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the VRTT group showed the higher values of 10MWT and 2MWT compared to the TT group (P < 0.05).

These scenarios should include dynamic stimuli presented concurrently or serially in a manner that allows researchers to assess the integrative processes carried out by perceivers over time. Furthermore, there is growing interest in contextually embedded stimuli that can constrain participant interpretations of cues about a target’s internal states.

In fact, hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment is now included in the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. However, there are children with sensory processing differences who do not meet an ASD diagnosis but do show atypical sensory behaviors to the same or greater degree as ASD children. We previously demonstrated that children with Sensory Processing Disorders (SPD) have impaired white matter microstructure, and that this white matter microstructural pathology correlates with atypical sensory behavior. In this study, we use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fiber tractography to evaluate the structural connectivity of specific white matter tracts in boys with ASD (n\u200a=\u200a15) and boys with SPD (n\u200a=\u200a16), relative to typically developing children (n\u200a=\u200a23). We define white matter tracts using probabilistic streamline tractography and assess the strength of tract connectivity using mean fractional anisotropy. Both the SPD and ASD cohorts demonstrate decreased connectivity relative to controls in parieto-occipital tracts involved in sensory perception and multisensory integration. However, the ASD group alone shows impaired connectivity, relative to controls, in temporal tracts thought to subserve social-emotional processing. In addition to these group difference analyses, we take a dimensional approach to assessing the relationship between white matter connectivity and participant function. These correlational analyses reveal significant associations of white matter connectivity with auditory processing, working memory, social skills, and inattention across our three study groups. These findings help elucidate the roles of specific neural circuits in neurodevelopmental disorders, and begin to explore the dimensional relationship between critical cognitive functions and structural connectivity across affected and unaffected children.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 49, 'citationCount': 111, 'journal': {'volume': '9', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Chang2014AutismAS,\n author = {Yishin Chang and J.

Abstract: The executive functions are among the most complex cognitive processes in the human; during development they support the confor- mation of several capacities for organization and control of behavior and cognition. In this article an extensive review on the most relevant scientific literature is presented, with a developmental range from childhood to youthhood. An analysis on the developmental characteristics of the main executive functions is offered. The review indicates that the hypothesis stated by Victoria Anderson a decade ago, is accurate: the executive func- tions develops in a sequential form, with a curvilinear behavior: an intense progression during childhood, with slowness by early adolescence.

Among the fundamental social impairments in the ASD population are challenges in appropriately recognizing and responding to facial expressions. Traditional intervention approaches often require intensive support and well-trained therapists to address core deficits, with many with ASD having tremendous difficulty accessing such care due to lack of available trained therapists as well as intervention costs. As a result, emerging technology such as virtual reality (VR) has the potential to offer useful technology-enabled intervention systems. In this paper, an innovative VR-based facial emotional expression presentation system was developed that allows monitoring of eye gaze and physiological signals related to emotion identification to explore new efficient therapeutic paradigms. A usability study of this new system involving ten adolescents with ASD and ten typically developing adolescents as a control group was performed. The eye tracking and physiological data were analyzed to determine intragroup and intergroup variations of gaze and physiological patterns. Performance data, eye tracking indices and physiological features indicated that there were differences in the way adolescents with ASD process and recognize emotional faces compared to their typically developing peers. These results will be used in the future for an online adaptive VR-based multimodal social interaction system to improve emotion recognition abilities of individuals with ASD.', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 44, 'citationCount': 111, 'journal': {'volume': '19', 'pages': '711-720', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Bekele2013UnderstandingHA,\n author = {Esubalew Bekele and Zhi Zheng and A.

These functions permit the construction, execution, and control of behavior by internally represented information, which removes behavior from control by the immediate context and brings it under the control of time.

The emerging field of computational psychiatry (CP) attempts to meet the needs of precision diagnosis by developing powerful computational and mathematical techniques. A growing scientific activity proposes the use of implicit measures based on biosignals for the classification of ASD. Virtual reality (VR) technologies have demonstrated potential for ASD interventions, but most of the work has used virtual reality for the learning / objective of interventions. Very few studies have used biological signals for recording and detailed analysis of behavioral responses that can be used to monitor or produce changes over time.

This has served to motivate research on how to better develop and disseminate evidence-based treatments for PTSD. One emerging form of treatment for combat-related PTSD that has shown promise involves the delivery of exposure therapy using immersive Virtual Reality (VR). Initial outcomes from open clinical trials have been positive and fully randomized controlled trials are currently in progress to further validate this approach. Based on our research group's initial positive outcomes using VR to emotionally engage and successfully treat persons undergoing exposure therapy for PTSD, we have begun development in a similar VR-based approach to deliver stress resilience training with military service members prior to their initial deployment. The Stress Resilience In Virtual Environments (STRIVE) project aims to create a set of combat simulations (derived from our existing Virtual Iraq/Afghanistan exposure therapy system) that are part of a multi-episode narrative experience. Users can be immersed within challenging combat contexts and interact with virtual characters within these episodes as part of an experiential learning approach for training a range of psychoeducational and cognitive-behavioral emotional coping strategies believed to enhance stress resilience. The STRIVE project aims to present this approach to service members prior to deployment as part of a program designed to better prepare military personnel for the types of emotional challenges that are inherent in the combat environment. During these virtual training experiences users are monitored physiologically as part of a larger investigation into the biomarkers of the stress response.

The practice of emotional education implies the design of programs based on a theory, with the training of the teachers who will implement them; we need curricular materials to support the teacher task; to evaluate the programs we need instruments and strategies, etc. This article is the result of the work of the GROP (Grupo de Recerca en Orientacio Psicopedagogica) of the Department MIDE of the University of Barcelona.', 'year': 2003, 'referenceCount': 134, 'citationCount': 365, 'journal': {'volume': '21', 'pages': '7-43', 'name': ''}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Alzina2003EducaciónEY,\n author = {Rafael Bisquerra Alzina},\n pages = {7-43},\n title = {Educación emocional y competencias básicas para la vida},\n volume = {21},\n year = {2003}\n}\n'}, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2090897358', 'name': 'Rafael Bisquerra Alzina'}]}, {'paperId': None, 'title': 'Competencias Emocionales Para Un Cambio De Paradigma En Educaciã 3 N', 'abstract': None, 'year': None, 'referenceCount': None, 'citationCount': None, 'journal': None, 'citationStyles': None, 'authors': []}]"

The purpose of this narrative review was to look at how these transformations affected teacher identity and the ways relationality shifted during this time. The intention was to bring relationality, care, collaboration, and excellent teaching possibilities, into the centre of our thinking. Whilst recognising the pandemic as a traumatic experience for many, it is a hopeful paper. Method An examination and thematic analysis of literature published from March 2020–November 2020 on ERT. Results The crisis and corresponding shift to teaching online demanded faculty to overcome their bias against online delivery, reimagine teaching, resulting in increased innovation and unexpected positive experiences which continue to rise. Conclusion Teachers already engaging with student-centred approaches, relational pedagogies, reflective practice, community networks, and/or digital technologies managed the transition to online teaching and learning more effectively. Future teacher training requires effective online education, how to design and deliver, how to collaborate, and how to make relational connections with others, and access to resources. KEY POINTS What is already known about this topic: Teacher identity is complex and always changing where fluctuating valence forces a re-evaluation of one’s identity. Teachers experience tension between their “core” ideal teacher identity such as the care and commitment to students and their occasional identity as adapters to external factors. Covid-19 has resulted in a rapid change emergency remote teaching with additional uncertainty and vulnerability. What this topic adds: Skills that enabled teachers to adapt to the rapid shift to remote teaching more effectively were student-centred approaches, relational pedagogies, reflective practice, community networks and/or digital technologies. Teacher identity was reimagined through emergency remote teaching as they worked remotely. Suggestions for further teacher development and support to enhance teacher effectiveness when responding to change and working remotely include strategies to strengthen and maintain digital competence to ensure teachers identity and their core values are recognised.', 'year': 2023, 'referenceCount': 63, 'citationCount': 6, 'journal': {'volume': '40', 'pages': '18 - 26', 'name': 'Educational and Developmental Psychologist'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Foreman-Brown2023ReimaginingTI,\n author = {Gabriella Foreman-Brown and E.

This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of digital eye strain (DES), describe the pattern of gadget usage, and analyse the risk factors for DES. Methods: This online survey analysed 941 responses from students of online classes (688), teachers of online classes (45), and general population (208). A pre-validated questionnaire was used to calculate the DES score. Non-parametric tests of medians were used to compare the median DES score, Chi-square test to compare categorical variables, and binary logistic regression to find the predictors of DES. Results: The prevalence of eye strain was higher among students taking online classes compared to the general public (50.6% vs 33.2%; χ2 = 22.5, df = 1, p < .0001). There was an increase in screen time during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic time. The DES score was highest among students attending online classes (p < .0001), in those with eye diseases (p = .001), greater screen time (p = <0.0001), screen distance <20 cm (p = .002), those who used gadgets in dark (p = .017) and those who took infrequent/no breaks (p = .018). The DES scores were proportional to the increase in the number of hours of gadget usage during the pandemic. Conclusion: There is a need to educate people about limiting overall screen exposure and ergonomic methods of screen viewing. Efforts from policymakers to reduce the duration of online classes for students and online work hours for professionals are warranted to control this epidemic of eye strain.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 31, 'citationCount': 77, 'journal': {'volume': '28', 'pages': '285 - 292', 'name': 'Ophthalmic Epidemiology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Ganne2020DigitalES,\n author = {P.

Yet, its relation to teachers’ emotional experiences and emotional labor (EL) during instruction remains unclear. Thirty-nine German secondary teachers were surveyed about their EE (trait), and via the experience sampling method on their momentary (state; N = 794) emotional experiences (enjoyment, anxiety, anger) and momentary EL (suppression, faking). Teachers reported that in 99 and 39% of all lessons, they experienced enjoyment and anger, respectively, whereas they experienced anxiety less frequently. Teachers reported suppressing or faking their emotions during roughly a third of all lessons. Furthermore, EE was reflected in teachers’ decreased experiences of enjoyment and increased experiences of anger. On an intra-individual level, all three emotions predict EL, whereas on an inter-individual level, only anger evokes EL. Explained variances in EL (within: 39%, between: 67%) stress the relevance of emotions in teaching and within the context of teacher burnout. Beyond implying the importance of reducing anger, our findings suggest the potential of enjoyment lessening EL and thereby reducing teacher burnout.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 69, 'citationCount': 207, 'journal': {'volume': '5', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Keller2014TeachersEE,\n author = {M.

It is now found across a wide range of disciplines (e.g., business, health, psychology, accounting, information technology) and program levels (e.g., from associate degrees to doctorate degrees). Online delivery is also strongly represented in the teacher education sector at many universities. Research of online delivery in higher education generally and teacher education specifically has pointed to a range of benefits and challenges associated with this mode of learning. Within the teacher education literature, many aspects of the online preparation of teachers remain poorly understood. More specifically, there is scant literature on the experiences and beliefs of teacher educators in relation to their readiness and preparation for online teaching as well as their beliefs in relation to the appropriateness of online education for preservice teachers. This article responds to this gap in the literature and reports on an exploratory study that worked with academic staff, teaching in a fully online teacher education course, at a mid-size Australian university. Twenty-seven teacher educators completed a 34-item questionnaire that consisted of closed and open-ended questions. With regards to readiness and preparation for teaching online, the majority of teacher educators reported lacking confidence and competence in the technological and pedagogical skills required to teach online. By and large, the study participants were welcoming of individualized “at-elbow” support that seemed to abate some of their fears of online teaching. The teacher educators were generally divided on whether the online classroom was an appropriate method for preparing preservice teachers. This article concludes with several recommendations for consideration by teacher educators who work in an online environment and sets the stage for a more ambitious study.', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 63, 'citationCount': 129, 'journal': {'volume': '48', 'pages': '109 - 96', 'name': 'The Teacher Educator'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': ""@Article{Downing2013TeacherER,\n author = {Jillian Downing and Janet E.

Emotional labor was shown to play an important role for the health of teachers. In a full two-wave longitudinal study over the period of 1 year, the effect of emotional labor on emotional exhaustion and dedication of 102 teachers was investigated. Teachers who were able to influence their emotions to feel the emotion appropriate in a situation (so called deep acting) felt significantly less emotionally exhausted after 1 year. From this result, deep acting can, thus, be characterized as health-beneficial. Once teachers felt emotionally exhausted, they used more surface acting. More dedicated teachers, on the contrary, did neither engage more in deep acting nor in surface acting at Time 2. This indicates that those teachers who are dedicated to teaching seem less likely to act. To prevent emotional exhaustion of teachers, the development of interventions to promote health-beneficial emotional labor is necessary.

The emotion-management perspective draws on an interactive account of emotion. It differs from the dramaturgical perspective on the one hand and the psychoanalytic perspective on the other. It allows us to inspect at closer range than either of those perspectives the relation among emotive experience, emotion management, feeling rules, and ideology. Feeling rules are seen as the side of ideology that deals with emotion and feeling. Emotion management is the type of work it takes to cope with feeling rules. Meaning-making jobs, more common in the middle class, put more premium on the individual\'s capacity to do emotion work. A reexamination of class differences in child rearing suggest that middle-class families prepare their children for emotion management more and working-class families prepare them less.

76,3a24b6e382c6a821875697c1d2815244dd1ae8b3,Toward Emotionally Adaptive Virtual Reality for Mental Health Applications,"Here, we introduce the design and preliminary validation of a general-purpose architecture for affective-driven procedural content generation in virtual reality (VR) applications in mental health and wellbeing. The architecture supports seven commercial physiological sensing technologies and can be deployed in immersive and non-immersive VR systems. To demonstrate the concept, we developed the “The Emotional Labyrinth,” a non-linear scenario in which navigation in a procedurally generated three-dimensional maze is entirely decided by the user, and whose features are dynamically adapted according to a set of emotional states. During navigation, affective states are dynamically represented through pictures, music, and animated visual metaphors chosen to represent and induce affective states. The underlying hypothesis is that exposing users to multimodal representations of their affective states can create a feedback loop that supports emotional self-awareness and fosters more effective emotional regulation strategies. We carried out a first study to, first, assess the effectiveness of the selected metaphors in inducing target emotions, and second, identify relevant psycho-physiological markers of the emotional experience generated by the labyrinth. Results show that the Emotional Labyrinth is overall a pleasant experience in which the proposed procedural content generation can induce distinctive psycho-physiological patterns, generally coherent with the meaning of the metaphors used in the labyrinth design. Furthermore, collected psycho-physiological responses such as electrocardiography, respiration, electrodermal activity, and electromyography are used to generate computational models of users’ reported experience. These models enable the future implementation of the closed loop mechanism to adapt the Labyrinth procedurally to the users’ affective state.",2019,71,43,"{'name': 'IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics', 'pages': '1877-1887', 'volume': '23'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Badia2019TowardEA,\n author = {S.

To answer this question, a meta-review was conducted to assess the meta-analyses and systematic and narrative reviews published in this field in the last twenty-two months. Twenty-five different articles demonstrated the clinical potential of this technology in both the diagnosis and the treatment of mental health disorders: VR compares favorably to existing treatments in anxiety disorders, eating and weight disorders, and pain management, with long-term effects that generalize to the real world. But why is VR so effective? Here, the following answer is suggested: VR shares with the brain the same basic mechanism: embodied simulations. According to neuroscience, to regulate and control the body in the world effectively, the brain creates an embodied simulation of the body in the world used to represent and predict actions, concepts, and emotions. VR works in a similar way: the VR experience tries to predict the sensory consequences of an individual's movements, providing to him/her the same scene he/she will see in the real world. To achieve this, the VR system, like the brain, maintains a model (simulation) of the body and the space around it. If the presence in the body is the outcome of different embodied simulations, concepts are embodied simulations, and VR is an embodied technology, this suggests a new clinical approach discussed in this article: the possibility of altering the experience of the body and facilitating cognitive modeling/change by designing targeted virtual environments able to simulate both the external and the internal world/body."", 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 169, 'citationCount': 249, 'journal': {'volume': '22', 'pages': '82 - 96', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology, Behavior and Social Networking'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Riva2019NeuroscienceOV,\n author = {G.

Post-treatment outcomes of this study were previously published and details of its design can be found at clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: NCT02237300). This article focuses on the evolution of symptoms assessed after 6 months of followup in a subgroup of 58 patients from the original study. In this study 64 patients with eating disorders (EDs) (35 with BN and 29 with BED), who still showed active episodes of binge eating by the end of a structured CBT program (first-level treatment), were randomly assigned to one of two second-level treatments (A-CBT or VR-CET). Frequency of binge and purge episodes, and attitudinal features of binge-related EDs (bulimia, drive for thinness, and body dissatisfaction) were assessed before starting the second-level treatment (n\u2009=\u200964), at the end (n\u2009=\u200964), and at 6-month followup (n\u2009=\u200958). Mixed between-within subject analyses of variance were used to compare outcomes of both second-level treatments over time. Although both treatment conditions showed statistically significant improvements at the end and after 6-month followup, obtained reductions were greater after VR-CET, regarding binge and purge episodes, as well as the decrease of self-reported tendency to engage in overeating episodes. Accordingly, abstinence from binge episodes were higher in VR-CET than A-CBT at followup (70 percent vs. 26 percent, respectively; χ2\u2009=\u200911.711, p\u2009=\u20090.001).

Exposure therapy is so far considered to be the most effective treatment, and research suggests that it is mainly based on a habituation process. Based on learning theories, it appears that a passive systemic exposure to traumatic stimuli should not be the best option for the treatment of PTSD. We hypothesis that an active learning of safer and healthier coping strategies combined with systematic exposure should be more effective in reducing the psychological distress associated with PTSD. In this paper, we describe the theoretical foundations of this approach that focuses on the action and activity of the patient in his or her exposure environment. In this approach, we take advantage of Virtual Reality technologies and learning mechanics of serious games to allow the patient to learn new safe associations while promoting the empowerment. We named this action-centered exposure therapy (ACET). This approach exploits behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism learning theories. With the different benefits of virtual reality technologies, this approach would easily integrate with in-virtuo exposure therapy and would allow us to exploit as much as possible the enormous potential of these technologies. As a first step toward validation, we present a case study that supports the ACET approach.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 64, 'citationCount': 14, 'journal': {'volume': '8', 'name': 'Behavioral Sciences'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Kengne2018ActionCenteredET,\n author = {Sorelle Audrey Kamkuimo Kengne and Mathilde Fossaert and B.

A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis', 'abstract': 'Introduction The development and use of serious games for mental health disorders are on the rise. Yet, little is known about the impact of these games on clinical mental health symptoms. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of serious games on symptoms of mental disorder. Method We conducted a systematic search in the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase databases, using mental health and serious games-related keywords. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review, and nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. Results All of the serious games were provided via personal computer, mostly on CD-ROM without the need for an internet connection. The studies targeted age groups ranging from 7 to 80\u2009years old. The serious games focused on symptoms of depression (n\u2009=\u20092), post-traumatic stress disorder (n\u2009=\u20092), autism spectrum disorder (n\u2009=\u20092), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (n\u2009=\u20091), cognitive functioning (n\u2009=\u20092), and alcohol use disorder (n\u2009=\u20091). The studies used goal-oriented (n\u2009=\u20094) and cognitive training games (n\u2009=\u20096). A total of 674 participants were included in the meta-analysis (380 in experimental and 294 in control groups). A meta-analysis of 9 studies comprising 10 comparisons, using a random effects model, showed a moderate effect on improvement of symptoms [g\u2009=\u20090.55 (95% confidence interval 0.28–0.83); P\u2009<\u20090.001], favoring serious games over no intervention controls. Discussion/conclusion Though the number of comparisons in the meta-analysis was small, these findings suggest that serious gaming interventions may be effective for reducing disorder-related symptoms. More studies are needed in order to attain deeper knowledge of the efficacy for specific mental disorders and the longer term effects of this new type of treatment for mental disorders.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 94, 'citationCount': 230, 'journal': {'volume': '7', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychiatry'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Lau2017SeriousGF,\n author = {Ho Ming Lau and J.

To investigate the feasibility of a novel collaborative multiplayer methodology, we created Space Connection, a videogame to promote empathy in teenagers. Space Connection depicts a futuristic adventure aboard a spaceship in which players have to jointly use their powers to solve a set of physics-based puzzles. The game relies on the use of physiological self-regulation to activate the playing partner powers. Using a low-cost brain computer interface and a respiration rate sensor we provided players with two game powers, namely telekinesis and timemanipulation which are mapped to changes in attention and relaxation. In this paper we describe the game mechanics in three different scenarios: i) the cryogenic room, ii) the space ship corridor and iii) the cargo hold. Finally, we performed a feasibility study with 10 users (aged 22.2 ± 5.6) to evaluate the game experience. Results revealed high scores in enjoyment and empathy but low scores on interface control.

Greater negative arousal causes the game and its horror-themed settings to become more disturbing. As a result, Nevermind challenges players to improve their emotion regulation skills by encouraging them to healthily down-regulate their negative affective states in the face of stressful situations.

A randomized controlled trial (n = 138) was conducted to test the effectiveness of a biofeedback video game (Dojo) for adolescents with elevated levels of anxiety. Adolescents (11–15 years old) were randomly assigned to play Dojo or a control game (Rayman 2: The Great Escape). Initial screening for anxiety was done on 1,347 adolescents in five high schools; only adolescents who scored above the “at-risk” cut-off on the Spence Children Anxiety Survey were eligible. Adolescents’ anxiety levels were assessed at pre-test, post-test, and at three month follow-up to examine the extent to which playing Dojo decreased adolescents’ anxiety. The present study revealed equal improvements in anxiety symptoms in both conditions at follow-up and no differences between Dojo and the closely matched control game condition. Latent growth curve models did reveal a steeper decrease of personalized anxiety symptoms (not of total anxiety symptoms) in the Dojo condition compared to the control condition. Moderation analyses did not show any differences in outcomes between boys and girls nor did age differentiate outcomes. The present results are of importance for prevention science, as this was the first full-scale randomized controlled trial testing indicated prevention effects of a video game aimed at reducing anxiety.

It is also linked to deficits in emotional regulation and frequently co-occurs with anxiety and depression symptoms. There is also evidence that emotional dysregulation may play a mediatory role between GD and psychopathological symptomatology. Few studies have reported the outcomes of psychological interventions that specifically address these underlying processes. Objectives: To assess the utility of the Playmancer platform, a serious video game, as an additional therapy tool in a CBT intervention for GD, and to estimate pre-post changes in measures of impulsivity, anger expression and psychopathological symptomatology. Method: The sample comprised a single group of 16 male treatment-seeking individuals with severe GD diagnosis. Therapy intervention consisted of 16 group weekly CBT sessions and, concurrently, 10 additional weekly sessions of a serious video game. Pre-post treatment scores on South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), I7 Impulsiveness Questionnaire (I7), State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory 2 (STAXI-2), Symptom Checklist-Revised (SCL-90-R), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S-T), and Novelty Seeking from the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R) were compared. Results: After the intervention, significant changes were observed in several measures of impulsivity, anger expression and other psychopathological symptoms. Dropout and relapse rates during treatment were similar to those described in the literature for CBT. Conclusion: Complementing CBT interventions for GD with a specific therapy approach like a serious video game might be helpful in addressing certain underlying factors which are usually difficult to change, including impulsivity and anger expression.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 115, 'citationCount': 67, 'journal': {'volume': '6', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Tarrega2015ASV,\n author = {S.

The extracted skin conductance features from this analysis are used to profile each individual player in terms of stress response. We observe a large degree of variation across the 13 veterans which further validates the idiosyncratic nature of PTSD physiological manifestations. Further to game data and skin conductance signals we ask PTSD patients to indicate the most stressful event experienced (class-based annotation) and also compare the stress level of all events in a pairwise preference manner (rank-based annotation). We compare the two annotation stress schemes by correlating the self-reports to individual event-based stress manifestations. The self-reports collected through class-based annotation exhibit no correlation to physiological responses, whereas, the pairwise preferences yield significant correlations to all skin conductance features extracted via continuous decomposition analysis.

Among these, an emerging approach is the use of virtual reality (VR) within exposure-based protocols for anxiety disorders, and in particular posttraumatic stress disorder. However, no systematically tested VR protocols are available for the management of psychological stress. Objective Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy of a new technological paradigm, Interreality, for the management and prevention of psychological stress. The main feature of Interreality is a twofold link between the virtual and the real world achieved through experiential virtual scenarios (fully controlled by the therapist, used to learn coping skills and improve self-efficacy) with real-time monitoring and support (identifying critical situations and assessing clinical change) using advanced technologies (virtual worlds, wearable biosensors, and smartphones). Methods The study was designed as a block randomized controlled trial involving 121 participants recruited from two different worker populations—teachers and nurses—that are highly exposed to psychological stress. Participants were a sample of teachers recruited in Milan (Block 1: n=61) and a sample of nurses recruited in Messina, Italy (Block 2: n=60). Participants within each block were randomly assigned to the (1) Experimental Group (EG): n=40; B1=20, B2=20, which received a 5-week treatment based on the Interreality paradigm; (2) Control Group (CG): n=42; B1=22, B2=20, which received a 5-week traditional stress management training based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); and (3) the Wait-List group (WL): n=39, B1=19, B2=20, which was reassessed and compared with the two other groups 5 weeks after the initial evaluation. Results Although both treatments were able to significantly reduce perceived stress better than WL, only EG participants reported a significant reduction (EG=12% vs CG=0.5%) in chronic “trait” anxiety. A similar pattern was found for coping skills: both treatments were able to significantly increase most coping skills, but only EG participants reported a significant increase (EG=14% vs CG=0.3%) in the Emotional Support skill. Conclusions Our findings provide initial evidence that the Interreality protocol yields better outcomes than the traditionally accepted gold standard for psychological stress treatment: CBT. Consequently, these findings constitute a sound foundation and rationale for the importance of continuing future research in technology-enhanced protocols for psychological stress management.

Since it has been recognized that emotions have a pivotal role for the human mind, an ever increasing number of laboratories and research centers are interested in affective sciences, affective neuroscience, affective psychology and affective psychopathology. Therefore, this paper presents multidisciplinary research results of Laboratory for Interactive Simulation System at Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb in the stress resilience. Patient's distortion in emotional processing of multimodal input stimuli is predominantly consequence of his/her cognitive deficit which is result of their individual mental health disorders. These emotional distortions in patient's multimodal physiological, facial, acoustic, and linguistic features related to presented stimulation can be used as indicator of patient's mental illness. Real-time processing and analysis of patient's multimodal response related to annotated input stimuli is based on appropriate machine learning methods from computer science. Comprehensive longitudinal multimodal analysis of patient's emotion, mood, feelings, attention, motivation, decision-making, and working memory in synchronization with multimodal stimuli provides extremely valuable big database for data mining, machine learning and machine reasoning. Presented multimedia stimuli sequence includes personalized images, movies and sounds, as well as semantically congruent narratives. Simultaneously, with stimuli presentation patient provides subjective emotional ratings of presented stimuli in terms of subjective units of discomfort/distress, discrete emotions, or valence and arousal. These subjective emotional ratings of input stimuli and corresponding physiological, speech, and facial output features provides enough information for evaluation of patient's cognitive appraisal deficit. Aggregated real-time visualization of this information provides valuable assistance in patient mental state diagnostics enabling therapist deeper and broader insights into dynamics and progress of the psychotherapy."", 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 46, 'citationCount': 19, 'journal': {'volume': '25 3', 'pages': '\n          340-6\n        ', 'name': 'Psychiatria Danubina'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Ćosić2014ComputeraidedPB,\n author = {K.

In particular, according to the allocentric lock hypothesis, individuals with obesity may be locked to an allocentric (observer view) negative memory of the body that is no longer updated by contrasting egocentric representations driven by perception. In other words, these patients may be locked to an allocentric negative representation of their body that their sensory inputs are no longer able to update even after a demanding diet and a significant weight loss. Objective To test the brief and long-term clinical efficacy of an enhanced cognitive-behavioral therapy including a virtual reality protocol aimed at unlocking the negative memory of the body (ECT) in morbidly obese patients with binge eating disorders (BED) compared with standard cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and an inpatient multimodal treatment (IP) on weight loss, weight loss maintenance, BED remission, and body satisfaction improvement, including psychonutritional groups, a low-calorie diet (1200 kcal/day), and physical training. Methods 90 obese (BMI>40) female patients with BED upon referral to an obesity rehabilitation center were randomly assigned to conditions (31 to ECT, 30 to CBT, and 29 to IP). Before treatment completion, 24 patients discharged themselves from hospital (4 in ECT, 10 in CBT, and 10 in IP). The remaining 66 inpatients received either 15 sessions of ECT, 15 sessions of CBT, or no additional treatment over a 5-week usual care inpatient regimen (IP). ECT and CBT treatments were administered by 3 licensed psychotherapists, and patients were blinded to conditions. At start, upon completion of the inpatient treatment, and at 1-year follow-up, patients' weight, number of binge eating episodes during the previous month, and body satisfaction were assessed by self-report questionnaires and compared across conditions. 22 patients who received all sessions did not provide follow-up data (9 in ECT, 6 in CBT, and 7 in IP). Results Only ECT was effective at improving weight loss at 1-year follow-up. Conversely, control participants regained on average most of the weight they had lost during the inpatient program. Binge eating episodes decreased to zero during the inpatient program but were reported again in all the three groups at 1-year follow-up. However, a substantial regain was observed only in the group who received the inpatient program alone, while both ECT and CBT were successful in maintaining a low rate of monthly binge eating episodes. Conclusions Despite study limitations, findings support the hypothesis that the integration of a VR-based treatment, aimed at both unlocking the negative memory of the body and at modifying its behavioral and emotional correlates, may improve the long-term outcome of a treatment for obese BED patients. As expected, the VR-based treatment, in comparison with the standard CBT approach, was able to better prevent weight regain but not to better manage binge eating episodes.

This paper investigates the potential of physiological signals as reliable channels for emotion recognition. All essential stages of an automatic recognition system are discussed, from the recording of a physiological data set to a feature-based multiclass classification. In order to collect a physiological data set from multiple subjects over many weeks, we used a musical induction method that spontaneously leads subjects to real emotional states, without any deliberate laboratory setting. Four-channel biosensors were used to measure electromyogram, electrocardiogram, skin conductivity, and respiration changes. A wide range of physiological features from various analysis domains, including time/frequency, entropy, geometric analysis, subband spectra, multiscale entropy, etc., is proposed in order to find the best emotion-relevant features and to correlate them with emotional states. The best features extracted are specified in detail and their effectiveness is proven by classification results. Classification of four musical emotions (positive/high arousal, negative/high arousal, negative/low arousal, and positive/low arousal) is performed by using an extended linear discriminant analysis (pLDA). Furthermore, by exploiting a dichotomic property of the 2D emotion model, we develop a novel scheme of emotion-specific multilevel dichotomous classification (EMDC) and compare its performance with direct multiclass classification using the pLDA. An improved recognition accuracy of 95 percent and 70 percent for subject-dependent and subject-independent classification, respectively, is achieved by using the EMDC scheme.', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 55, 'citationCount': 942, 'journal': {'volume': '30', 'pages': '2067-2083', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Kim2008EmotionRB,\n author = {Jonghwa Kim and E.

The accessibility model provides an organizing framework for understanding self-reports of emotion and suggests some new directions for research.', 'year': 2002, 'referenceCount': 258, 'citationCount': 1584, 'journal': {'volume': '128 6', 'pages': '\n          934-60\n        ', 'name': 'Psychological bulletin'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Robinson2002BeliefAF,\n author = {Michael D.

Design: Qualitative study with semistructured interviews. Setting: The stroke unit of an inner city teaching hospital. Participants: 22 patients with stroke who were undergoing rehabilitation; 14 with high motivation for rehabilitation and eight with low motivation. Results: All patients thought rehabilitation was important for recovery. High motivation patients were more likely to view rehabilitation as the most important means of recovery and to accord themselves an active role in rehabilitation. These patients were also more likely to understand rehabilitation and in particular to understand the specialist role of the nursing staff. Many patients reported independence at home as a personal goal, though few low motivation patients related this goal to success in rehabilitation. Information from professionals about rehabilitation, favourable comparisons with other stroke patients, and the desire to leave hospital had a positive effect on motivation. Conversely, overprotection from family members and professionals, lack of information or the receipt of “mixed messages” from professionals, and unfavourable comparisons with other patients had a negative effect. Conclusions: There are some differences in beliefs between stroke patients identified as having low or high motivation for rehabilitation. These beliefs seem to be influenced by the environment in which the patient is rehabilitated. Professionals and carers should be made aware of the ways in which their behaviour can positively and negatively affect motivation.', 'year': 2000, 'referenceCount': 21, 'citationCount': 442, 'journal': {'volume': '321', 'pages': '1051 - 1054', 'name': 'BMJ : British Medical Journal'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': ""@Article{Maclean2000QualitativeAO,\n author = {N.

In this framework, emotions are seen as basic because their biological and social functions are essential in evolution and adaptation. Particular emotions are called basic because they are assumed to have innate neural substrates, innate and universal expressions, and unique feeling-motivational states.

All children with CP first underwent one intensive session of EMG feedback (30 minutes), followed by one session of the EMG-VR feedback (30 minutes) after a 1-week washout period. Clinical tests included elbow extension range of motion (ROM), biceps muscle strength, and box and block test. EMG triceps and biceps (T:B) muscle activity imbalance and reaching movement acceleration coordination were concurrently determined by EMG and 3-axis accelerometer measurements respectively. Independent t-test and one-way repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed at p\u200a<\u200a0.05.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe one-way repeated ANOVA was revealed to be significantly effective in elbow extension ROM (p\u200a=\u200a0.01), biceps muscle strength (p\u200a=\u200a0.01), and box and block test (p\u200a=\u200a0.03). The one-way repeated ANOVA also revealed to be significantly effective in the peak triceps muscle activity (p\u200a=\u200a0.01). However, one-way repeated ANOVA produced no statistical significance in the composite 3-dimensional movement acceleration coordination data (p\u200a=\u200a0.12).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe present study is a first clinical trial that demonstrated the superior benefits of the EMG biofeedback when augmented by virtual reality exercise games in children with spastic CP.

The forthcoming mental health crisis has opened the debate about the need to broaden the therapeutic horizons with the implementation of digitally assisted mindfulness practices within psychotherapeutic interventions. Mindfulness training is developing into a promising intervention for a variety of health problems and a booster of well-being. At the same time, virtual reality (VR) and especially immersive technologies are increasingly being used as assistive tools in the training of people with special education needs and disabilities (SEND). Μeta-competences refer to a set of self-development skills that incorporate meta-cognitive and meta-emotional attributes, enabling individuals to be self-conscious, self-regulated, and flexible in every aspect of human life. The current review aims to investigate (i) the efficacy of mindfulness strategies in meta-competence training for SEND and (ii) the role of VR as an assistive technology in mindfulness training. The PRISMA 2020 methodology was utilized to respond to the objectives and research questions. The database search provided 1380 records, and 29 studies met the inclusion criteria. The results showed that mindfulness training has the potential to train meta-cognitive and meta-emotional competences among people with different mental disorders, including Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Intellectual Disability (ID), Depressive Disorder, Stress Disorder, and Specific Learning Disorder. VR was found to be an effective assistive technology, providing significant advantages compared to conventional mindfulness interventions. Mindfulness training assisted by immersive technologies was found to significantly improve a wide range of cognitive and socio-emotional meta-competences, including self-awareness, inhibition control, attention regulation, flexibility, positive thinking, and emotional regulation. The results of this systematic review may provide positive feedback for creating inclusive digital training environments.",2023,118,0,{'name': 'Psychiatry International'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Mitsea2023VirtualRM,\n author = {Eleni Mitsea and Athanasios Drigas and C.

When implemented effectively, virtual reality technologies may enable highly engaging learning activities and interactive simulations. However, implementation processes present challenges, and the key to successful implementation is identifying barriers and facilitators as well as finding strategies to address them. Objective This scoping review aimed to identify the literature on virtual reality implementation in health professions education, identify barriers to and facilitators of implementation, and highlight gaps in the literature in this area. Methods The scoping review was conducted based on the Joanna Briggs Institute Evidence Synthesis methodologies. Electronic searches were conducted in the Academic Search Elite, Education Source, and CINAHL databases on January 5, 2022, in Google Scholar on February 2 and November 18, 2022, and in PubMed database on November 18, 2022. We conducted hand searches of key items, reference tracking, and citation tracking and searches on government webpages on February 2, 2022. At least 2 reviewers screened the identified literature. Eligible studies were considered based on predefined inclusion criteria. The results of the identified items were analyzed and synthesized using qualitative content analysis. Results We included 7 papers and identified 7 categories related to facilitators of and barriers to implementation—collaborative participation, availability, expenses, guidelines, technology, careful design and evaluation, and training—and developed a model that links the categories to the 4 constructs from Carl May’s general theory of implementation. All the included reports provided recommendations for implementation, including recommendations for careful design and evaluation, training of faculty and students, and faculty presence during use. Conclusions Virtual reality implementation in health professions education appears to be a new and underexplored research field. This scoping review has several limitations, including definitions and search words, language, and that we did not assess the included papers’ quality. Important implications from our findings are that ensuring faculty’s and students’ competence in using virtual reality technology is necessary for the implementation processes. Collaborative participation by including end users in the development process is another factor that may ensure successful implementation in higher education contexts. To ensure stakeholders’ motivation and potential to use virtual reality, faculty and students could be invited to participate in the development process to ensure that the educational content is valued. Moreover, technological challenges and usability issues should be resolved before implementation to ensure that pedagogical content is the focus. This accentuates the importance of piloting, sufficient time resources, basic testing, and sharing of experiences before implementation.

Current treatments are limited and there is increasing interest in the use of mindfulness, which is growing in popularity. Previous systematic reviews have typically focused on specific ages, outcome measures or interventions. The current review aimed to take a more comprehensive approach. Title and abstract searches were performed in five databases for randomized and non-randomized controlled trials or pre-post studies with participants with an ADHD diagnosis or a score above a clinically relevant cut-off on a validated ADHD measure. Studies had to measure symptoms of ADHD, global or social functioning. Extraction of key information including participant status (i.e., diagnosis, scale scores, comorbidities, medication use), study design, and outcome measures was conducted. Effect sizes (Hedge’s g) were calculated and where a measure had been used in at least three studies with the same population, meta-analyses were considered. Twenty-nine studies were initially identified, with seven deemed poor quality and removed from further analysis leaving, 22 studies containing data from 1237 children and adults with ADHD along with data from 525 family members. The data indicate possible benefits of mindfulness on self-compassion, quality of life, wellbeing, depression, and anxiety. The findings also suggest that mindfulness may also improve ADHD symptoms, executive function, problematic behaviours, and emotional dysregulation, although results vary by age of patient and measures used. Parent stress and parenting style have received limited attention, highlighting the need for more studies in these areas. Whilst the data presented suggest that mindfulness may be beneficial, the evidence base is not as strong as the popularity of the approach. Many of the studies lacked blind assessment, adequate randomization, or suitable control conditions. As such high-quality controlled studies considering medication, other psychosocial interventions, use of active and in active controls and comorbidity as well as longer follow-up periods, are needed to confirm this.', 'year': 2022, 'referenceCount': 119, 'citationCount': 1, 'journal': {'name': 'Psychiatry International'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Kretschmer2022MindfulnessIF,\n author = {Clara Kretschmer and Burcu Göz Tebrizcik and E.

In a hospital setting, their purpose is to introduce a relaxing environment to increase well-being as well as to decrease anxiety and aggressive behaviors. Calm rooms can also be used as a tool to provide self-help through a convenient environment for the patients and, at the same time, strengthen the therapeutic relationship between the patient and the professional. Recent developments in virtual reality (VR) have made virtual calm rooms possible, but these have not yet been evaluated in psychiatric inpatient care. Objective This study aimed to compare the effects of VR and physical calm rooms on self-reported well-being and physiological markers of arousal. Methods The study was conducted in 2 inpatient psychiatric wards specializing in bipolar disorder from March 2019 to February 2021. Patients who were already admitted were asked if they were interested in using a calm room and willing to provide ratings. This study relied on the quasi-randomized allocation of patients to the wards, which either had a physical or VR calm room. Self-assessment scales (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale-Self Assessment [MADRS-S], Beck Anxiety Scale, and Clinical Global Impression) were used to determine the participants' baseline level of depressive and anxiety symptoms before their use of the physical or VR calm room. The study determined the state of well-being measured using an 11-point visual analog scale (VAS) as well as arousal measured by blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and heart rate before and after the use of the calm rooms. The primary end point was self-reported well-being using the VAS. Results A total of 60 participants were included—40 used the VR calm room and 20 used the physical calm room. The mean age of participants was 39 years and the majority were women (35/60, 58%). Analysis of VAS measurement showed improved well-being at the group level from before to after the intervention (P<.05), with no statistically significant difference in effects between the 2 different interventions. Effects were not moderated by baseline depression levels (dichotomized as MADRS-S >20 or ≤20) despite an overall difference in reported well-being between subgroups. Conclusions Although the power in this study was low, the findings of this first study indicate comparable effects with respect to well-being and arousal of a VR calm room and a physical calm room. This suggests that a VR calm room can be a viable alternative when the use of a physical calm room is not an option for logistic or other reasons.

Social training and intervention work still dominates the research area, in spite of recent calls from the autism community to broaden the scientific understanding of neurodivergent experiences and daily living behaviours. Although, autism is often characterised by difficulties with social interactions, it is just one part of the presentation. Sensory differences, motor difficulties and repetitive behaviours are also important facets of the condition, as well as various wider aspects of health, wellbeing and quality of life. However, many of these topics appear to be understudied in research on VR applications for autism.Originality/valueVR stands out from other representational technologies because of its immersion, presence and interactivity and has grown into its own niche. The question of what constitutes a truly immersive experience has resurfaced. We can no longer deny that VR has established itself in autism research.

Virtual reality exposure therapy is an emerging treatment for specific phobias. Most virtual reality studies have investigated high-end virtual reality devices, typically only available in research and limited clinical settings for a single phobia. This study evaluated the effectiveness of oVRcome, a mobile health application combining self-guided virtual reality exposure and cognitive behaviour therapy, for five specific phobias. Methods: This is a 2-arm 6-week randomised controlled trial, with a waitlist control group and follow-up at week 12. Participants were required to live in New Zealand; be aged 18–64\u2009years; have a fear of flying, heights, spiders, dogs and needles; score above 4 on the Brief Standard Self-rating scale for phobic patients; and have access to a smartphone and Internet. oVRcome consists of six modules of psychoeducation, relaxation, mindfulness, cognitive techniques, exposure through virtual reality and relapse prevention over 6\u2009weeks. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to week 6 on the Severity Measures for Specific Phobia – Adults. All analyses were performed on intention-to-treat set. Results: A total of 126 participants were randomised, and 109 completed the follow-up at week 6, for a retention rate of 86.5%. The mean change in Severity Measures for Specific Phobia – Adults score from baseline to week 6 was greater in the active group compared with the waitlist group (active group −20.53 [standard deviation\u2009=\u20098.24]; waitlist group: − 12.31 [standard deviation\u2009=\u200910.66]; p\u2009<\u20090.001). The effect size for this difference was 0.86.

Combining mindfulness with immersive virtual reality (VR) has been proven to be especially effective for a wide range of mood disorders for which traditional mindfulness has proven valuable. However, the vast majority of immersive VR-enhanced mindfulness applications have focused on clinical settings, with little evidence on healthy subjects. This narrative review evaluates the real effectiveness of state-of-the-art mindfulness interventions mediated by VR systems in influencing mood and physiological status in non-clinical populations. Only studies with an RCT study design were considered. We conclude that most studies were characterized by one single meditation experience, which seemed sufficient to induce a significant reduction in negative mood states (anxiety, anger, depression, tension) combined with increased mindfulness skills. However, physiological correlates of mindfulness practices have scarcely been investigated. The application of VR-enhanced mindfulness-based interventions in non-clinical populations is in its infancy since most studies have several limitations, such as the poor employment of the RCT study design, the lack of physiological measurements (i.e., heart rate variability), as well as the high heterogeneity in demographical data, technological devices, and VR procedures. We thus concluded that before applying mindfulness interventions mediated by VR in clinical populations, more robust and reliable methodological procedures need to be defined.', 'year': 2022, 'referenceCount': 51, 'citationCount': 5, 'journal': {'volume': '10', 'name': 'Healthcare'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Failla2022MediatingMI,\n author = {Chiara Failla and Flavia Marino and Luca Bernardelli and A.

Specifically, we examined whether and how respiration can provoke alterations in attentional states. Secondly, we investigated the benefits of breath-control training techniques in attention. Furthermore, we explored the effectiveness of virtual reality breathing training in improving respiration along with attention. Finally, we discussed the role of metacognition in the conscious synchronization of respiration with attention. It was revealed that every time respiration loses stability, attention fluctuates. Every time respiration is stabilized, attention finds steadiness. The results confirmed that respiration, attention, and as a result consciousness are characterized by bidirectional synchronization since their systems present coupling functions and dynamical interactions. It was also confirmed that breath control practices guarantee instant as well as long-lasting attentional improvements regulating all those mechanisms that strengthen mental alertness firing either the pathways of relaxation or excitation. Conscious-breath training is a practice of mindful metacognition that supports the coupling of attention with respiration. Metacognition in breathing utilizes respiration to improve attention but at the same time attention is used as a tool to consciously control breathing. Finally, breathing control training in virtual reality not only improves attention along with respiration but may finetune internal and external attention. This study concludes that breathing and attention are two ‘giant’ mechanisms that go hand-in-hand and carry on their ‘shoulders’ the whole cognition. Training conscious breathing via advanced technologies should be incorporated into the dialogue of education as methods for brain rewiring assuring better inclusion and academic achievement, especially for those with disabilities.', 'year': 2022, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 48, 'journal': {'name': 'Technium Social Sciences Journal'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Mitsea2022BreathingA,\n author = {Eleni Mitsea and A.

Methods: A total of 41 healthy volunteers of both genders with age 23.21 ± 2.81 years were recruited. All participants underwent baseline assessment, followed by 2 weeks of training in Trataka (including eye exercise). Each training session lasted for 20 min/day for 6 days a week. After completion of the training period, a 1-week washout period was given. Each participant then was assessed in two sessions in Trataka and in eye exercise on two separate days, maintaining the same time of the day. Repeated measure analysis of variance with Holm’s adjustment was performed to check the difference between the sessions. Results: Significant within-subjects effects were observed for forward Corsi span andforward total score (p < 0.001), and also for backward Corsi span (p < 0.05) and backward total score (p < 0.05).

The rapid advancement of technology has reached generating artificial intelligence and artificial realities. So, virtual reality is an emerging technology and is applicable in education as well. Virtual reality is a computer-generated simulation, where people can interact within an artificial environment. Moreover, in an educational setting, such an environment provides students with a chance to get experiential learning. This paper has a systematic literature review on emerging technologies, such as virtual reality as a pedagogical tool for enhancing students’ experiential learning. This review aims to explore and understand the effect of virtual reality on students’ experiential learning by reviewing twenty-six selected articles. The selected studies have followed various methodologies and are from different contexts. This review study aims to present a systematic literature review for understanding and exploring the effect of virtual reality as a pedagogical tool for enhancing students’ experiential learning. Nine themes were identified, which are (a) virtual reality as pedagogical tool, (b) virtual reality as emerging educational technology tool, (c) virtual reality as digital transformation, (d) virtual reality as teaching-learning model, (e) virtual reality as architectural pedagogy, (f) virtual reality for communication skills, (g) virtual reality for reading and writing skills, (h) virtual reality for social learning, and (i) virtual reality for experiential learning. Thus, it is found that virtual reality is used as a pedagogical tool for various subject areas for encouraging involvement. It is helpful in medical, engineering, language, and social learning, as it provides a chance to get first-hand experience of the environment. Also, it helps learners to engage in a presented virtual environment and experience the sense of presence in it and enhances students’ experiential learning.

We describe in detail the cognitive and metacognitive processes involved in each layer, while particular emphasis is placed on the relation between the control processes as well as the special role of attention. According to our model, each layer of metacognition describes a higher-order control system which operates under the rule of a series of attention processes at an ever more refined, abstract, united and holistic level. The same applies to the cognitive processes and abilities such as attention, memory, perception, pattern recognition. At each higher level, they display more advanced attributes and functions responding to the necessity of creating more abstract mental representations and upper class motivations, thoughts and emotions. \xa0In addition, we recommend a number of strategies that support the metacognitive development at each level of the hierarchy.

We examined three different, commonly used approaches to stress relaxation—progressive muscle relaxation, deep breathing, and guided imagery—and evaluated them in a head-to-head comparison against each other and a control condition. Sixty healthy undergraduate participants were randomized to one of the four conditions and completed 20 minutes of progressive muscle relaxation, deep breathing, or guided imagery training that was delivered by recorded audio instruction. Baseline and follow-up assessment of psychological relaxation states were completed. Physiological relaxation was also assessed continuously using measures of electrodermal activity and heart rate. Results showed that progressive muscle relaxation, deep breathing, and guided imagery all increased the state of relaxation for participants in those groups, compared to participants in the control group. In each case, the increase was statistically significant and although the groups did not differ on relaxation before training, all groups were significantly higher on relaxation after training, as compared to the control group. Progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery showed an immediate linear trend toward physiological relaxation, compared to the control group, and the deep breathing group showed an immediate increase in physiological arousal followed quickly by a return to initial levels.

Mindfulness meditation has proved to be effective in increasing the wellbeing of those who practice it, leading to better mental health, self-care and job satisfaction. This paper aims to identify the recent evidence on the relationship between mindfulness and emotional intelligence among healthcare professionals and students. A systematic review was conducted including the databases PubMed, Cinhal, PsycINFO and Web of Science. The main variables were emotional intelligence skills and mindfulness practice. Data were extracted according to the following outcomes: authors, year of publication, country, study design, participants, mindfulness training intervention, tools used in data collection and main results. The following inclusion criteria were applied: peer-reviewed articles; published in English or Spanish; published between 2010 and 2020; quantitative methodology; a study population of healthcare professionals or students; the relationship with the aim of the study. The Joanna Briggs Institute criteria were followed for assessing the methodological quality of the selected studies. Three researchers were involved in the review. After the selection process, 10 studies were selected out of the 197 references initially identified. These studies revealed a positive relationship between mindfulness and emotional intelligence, particularly the capacity to regulate emotions. Furthermore, mindfulness is negatively related to emotional exhaustion. Training interventions based on mindfulness have proved to be useful in promoting emotional balance, emotional awareness, emotional acceptance, emotion recognition, expressive suppression and a reduction in emotional exhaustion.

Consequently, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has investigated approaches that strengthen mindfulness, i.e., by inventing multimedia technologies to support mindfulness meditation. These approaches often use smartphones, tablets, or consumer-grade desktop systems to allow everyday usage in users' private lives or in the scope of organized therapies. Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality (VR, AR, MR; in short: XR) significantly extend the design space for such approaches. XR covers a wide range of potential sensory stimulation, perceptive and cognitive manipulations, content presentation, interaction, and agency. These facilities are linked to typical XR-specific perceptions that are conceptually closely related to mindfulness research, such as (virtual) presence and (virtual) embodiment. However, a successful exploitation of XR that strengthens mindfulness requires a systematic analysis of the potential interrelation and influencing mechanisms between XR technology, its properties, factors, and phenomena and existing models and theories of the construct of mindfulness. This article reports such a systematic analysis of XR-related research from HCI and life sciences to determine the extent to which existing research frameworks on HCI and mindfulness can be applied to XR technologies, the potential of XR technologies to support mindfulness, and open research gaps. Fifty papers of ACM Digital Library and National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine (PubMed) with and without empirical efficacy evaluation were included in our analysis. The results reveal that at the current time, empirical research on XR-based mindfulness support mainly focuses on therapy and therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, most of the currently investigated XR-supported mindfulness interactions are limited to vocally guided meditations within nature-inspired virtual environments. While an analysis of empirical research on those systems did not reveal differences in mindfulness compared to non-mediated mindfulness practices, various design proposals illustrate that XR has the potential to provide interactive and body-based innovations for mindfulness practice. We propose a structured approach for future work to specify and further explore the potential of XR as mindfulness-support. The resulting framework provides design guidelines for XR-based mindfulness support based on the elements and psychological mechanisms of XR interactions."", 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 112, 'citationCount': 29, 'journal': {'volume': '2'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Döllinger2021ChallengesAO,\n author = {Nina Döllinger and C.

We developed an easy-to-use VR self-management relaxation tool (VRelax) with immersive 360° nature videos and interactive animated elements. Objective To investigate the immediate effects of VR relaxation on negative and positive affective states and short-term effects on perceived stress and symptoms in patients with a psychiatric disorder, compared to standard relaxation exercises. Methods A randomized crossover trial was conducted in 50 patients receiving ambulatory treatment for anxiety, psychotic, depressive, or bipolar disorder. Participants were randomly assigned to start with VRelax or standard relaxation and used both interventions for 10 days at home. They completed 8 visual analog scales of momentary negative and positive affective states before and after each session. Global perceived stress and psychiatric symptoms were measured before and after both intervention periods. Treatment effects were analyzed with multilevel mixed model regression analyses and 2-way analysis of variance. Results Both VRelax and standard relaxation exercises led to a statistically significant immediate improvement of all negative and positive affective states. Compared to standard relaxation, VRelax resulted in a significantly greater reduction of total negative affective state (change 16.2% versus 21.2%; t1684=−2.02, 95% CI −18.70 to −0.28; P=.04). Specifically, VRelax had a stronger beneficial effect on momentary anxiety (t1684=−3.24, 95% CI −6.86 to −1.69), sadness (t1684=−2.32, 95% CI −6.51 to −0.55), and cheerfulness (t1684=2.35, 95% CI 0.51 to 5.75). There were no significant differences between short-term effects of the two treatments on global perceived stress and symptoms. Conclusions If the results of this trial are replicated and extended, VRelax may provide a much-needed, effective, easy-to-use self-management relaxation intervention to enhance psychiatric treatments.

De-spite the indisputable scientific interest, there are various unanswered questions concerning the identity of metacognition, its fundamental mechanisms and its limits. In this study, a holistic and multi-disciplinary approach is attempted by collecting and utilizing data from sciences such as cognitive psychology and neuropsychology, and philosophy. The research has led us to the 8 pillars that underpin metacognition. These pillars follow the model of the hierarchical or-ganization of knowledge. According to this approach, cognitive and metacogni-tive skills evolve progressively depending on the effort an individual exerts. It is worth noting that some cognitive functions such as attention and working memory seem to surpass the rest, since they operate simultaneously as cognitive and metacognitive abilities, affecting the functioning of the pillars, other cogni-tive functions, and in particular the higher mental abilities. Among the conclu-sions of greatest importance we can cite that the metacognition pillars are, like reality itself, a field of multiple readings. They contribute to the proper func-tioning of the cognitive and psychophysiological mechanism, the melioration of intelligence in all fields (physical, intellectual, emotional and spiritual), the emergence of consciousness and self-knowledge. In practical terms, the pillars of metacognition are the most valuable tool of self-learning, self-development, self-treatment and self-knowledge. Metacognition, also, constitutes a key factor in effective leadership, in medical and health professions.

Results: Participants reported more PA and greater perceived satisfaction-credibility following the VR as compared to non-VR-guided meditations primarily when the VR meditation was practiced first, before the non-VR meditation, as opposed to vice versa. The experience of NA during meditation practice was infrequent, although persons with increased PTSD symptoms reported increased distress during both VR and non-VR meditation. Conclusions: Further study of therapeutic applications of VR as an aid to meditation practice among people with PTSD symptoms is warranted.

Mindfulness-based interventions that include meditation and mindfulness skills training reduce stress and symptoms of anxiety or depression. However, engaging high-risk youth in interventions is challenging. Virtual reality is a more flexible platform for delivering meditation and may be appealing to youth. Objective The study objectives were to evaluate the feasibility of delivering virtual reality meditation and of collecting outcome measures, including anxiety and physiologic stress. Methods A sample of 30 youth experiencing homelessness was enrolled in the study. Youth were randomized to receive 10 minutes of one of three interventions: (1) virtual reality meditation, (2) audio meditation (through a web-based platform), or (3) virtual reality imagery of historical pictures and text. Subjects who consented to the study attended two research visits. The first visit collected survey measures of demographics, mental health, and substance use, and oriented subjects to the intervention platforms. The second visit (1-3 days later) delivered the intervention and collected pre and post outcome measures of anxiety and physiologic stress (salivary cortisol). Changes in anxiety and cortisol at the second visit were compared across groups using a linear regression model in which the primary analysis compared virtual reality meditation to audio meditation and secondary analyses compared virtual reality meditation to virtual reality imagery. Results Anxiety scores decreased in all groups, with a larger reduction among the virtual reality meditation group (difference=10.8) compared to the web-based meditation or virtual reality images groups (difference=5.8 and 5.0, respectively). After controlling for baseline values, there were no significant group differences in changes in anxiety scores or cortisol levels. In comparing virtual reality meditation and audio meditation, the effect size for anxiety was moderate (Cohen d=0.58) while the effect size for cortisol was small (Cohen d=0.08). Conclusions Preliminary results suggest that virtual reality meditation has a moderate benefit for anxiety but not physiologic stress. Future research is needed to confirm these results in a larger sample and to investigate whether the effects are sustained or increase with repeated use of virtual reality mediation. Virtual reality meditation appears feasible to deliver among homeless youth and merits further study.

Anxiety leads to substantial long-term problems and may underlie disruptive behaviors in the classroom as a result of the individual’s inability to tolerate anxiety-provoking situations. Thus, interventions in special needs schools that help adolescents cope with anxiety and, in turn, diminish disruptive classroom behaviors are needed. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a virtual reality biofeedback game, DEEP, on daily levels of state-anxiety and disruptive classroom behavior in a clinical sample. In addition, the study also aimed to examine the duration of the calm or relaxed state after playing DEEP. Methods A total of 8 adolescents attending a special secondary school for students with behavioral and psychiatric problems participated in a single-case experimental ABAB study. Over a 4-week period, participants completed 6 DEEP sessions. In addition, momentary assessments (ie, 3 times a day) of self-reported state-anxiety and teacher-reported classroom behavior were collected throughout all A and B phases. Results From analyzing the individual profiles, it was found that 6 participants showed reductions in anxiety, and 5 participants showed reductions in disruptive classroom behaviors after the introduction of DEEP. On a group level, results showed a small but significant reduction of anxiety (d=–0.29) and a small, nonsignificant reduction of disruptive classroom behavior (d=−0.16) on days when participants played DEEP. Moreover, it was found that the calm or relaxed state of participants after playing DEEP lasted for about 2 hours on average. Conclusions This study demonstrates the potential of the game, DEEP, as an intervention for anxiety and disruptive classroom behavior in a special school setting. Future research is needed to fully optimize and personalize DEEP as an intervention for the heterogeneous special school population.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 85, 'citationCount': 37, 'journal': {'volume': '7', 'name': 'JMIR Mental Health'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Bossenbroek2020EfficacyOA,\n author = {Rineke Bossenbroek and A.

Virtual reality (VR) may address these challenges by providing an immersive environment for practicing mindfulness and by supporting the user to orient attention to the present moment within a tailored virtual setting. However, there is currently a limited understanding of the ways in which VR can support or hinder mindfulness practice. Such an understanding is required to design effective VR apps while ensuring that VR-supported mindfulness is acceptable to end users. Objective This study aimed to explore how VR can support mindfulness practice and to understand user experience issues that may affect the acceptability and efficacy of VR mindfulness for users in the general population. Methods A sample of 37 participants from the general population trialed a VR mindfulness app in a controlled laboratory setting. The VR app presented users with an omnidirectional video of a peaceful forest environment with a guided mindfulness voiceover that was delivered by a male narrator. Scores on the State Mindfulness Scale, Simulator Sickness Questionnaire, and single-item measures of positive and negative emotion and arousal were measured pre- and post-VR for all participants. Qualitative feedback was collected through interviews with a subset of 19 participants. The interviews sought to understand the user experience of mindfulness practice in VR. Results State mindfulness (P<.001; Cohen d=1.80) and positive affect (P=.006; r=.45) significantly increased after using the VR mindfulness app. No notable changes in negative emotion, subjective arousal, or symptoms of simulator sickness were observed across the sample. Participants described the user experience as relaxing, calming, and peaceful. Participants suggested that the use of VR helped them to focus on the present moment by using visual and auditory elements of VR as attentional anchors. The sense of presence in the virtual environment (VE) was identified by participants as being helpful to practicing mindfulness. Interruptions to presence acted as distractors. Some uncomfortable experiences were discussed, primarily in relation to video fidelity and the weight of the VR headset, although these were infrequent and minor. Conclusions This study suggests that an appropriately designed VR app can support mindfulness practice by enhancing state mindfulness and inducing positive affect. VR may help address the challenges of practicing mindfulness by creating a sense of presence in a tailored VE; by allowing users to attend to visual and auditory anchors of their choice; and by reducing the scope of the content in users’ mind-wandering. VR has the unique capability to combine guided mindfulness practice with tailored VEs that lend themselves to support individuals to focus attention on the present moment.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 70, 'citationCount': 79, 'journal': {'volume': '22', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Seabrook2019UnderstandingHV,\n author = {E.

Most patients with GAD never seek treatment, and those who do seek treatment often drop out before completing treatment. Although it is an understudied treatment, Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) indicate preliminary efficacy for the treatment of GAD symptoms, but many patients with GAD present other associated symptoms (e.g., attention deficits) that complicate the treatment. Virtual Reality DBT® Mindfulness Skills learning has recently been developed to make learning mindfulness easier for patients with emotion dysregulation who have trouble concentrating. Virtual Reality (VR) might serve as a visual guide for practicing mindfulness as it gives patients the illusion of “being there” in the 3D computer generated world. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of two MBIs (a MBI in a group setting alone and the same MBI plus 10 min VR DBT® Mindfulness skills training) to reduce GAD symptoms. A secondary aim was to explore the effect in depression, emotion regulation, mindfulness, and interoceptive awareness. Other exploratory aims regarding the use of VR DBT® Mindfulness skills were also carried out. The sample was composed of 42 patients (roughly half in each group) with GAD attending PC visits. After treatment, both groups of patients showed significant improvements in General Anxiety Disorder measured by the GAD-7 using mixed regression models [MBI alone (B = -5.70; p < 0.001; d = -1.36), MBI+VR DBT® Mindfulness skills (B = -4.38; p < 0.001; d = -1.33)]. Both groups also showed significant improvements in anxiety, depression, difficulties of emotion regulation and several aspects of mindfulness and interoceptive awareness. Patients in the group that received additional 10 min VR DBT Mindfulness Skills training were significantly more adherent to the treatment than those receiving only standard MBI (100% completion rate in MBI + VR vs. 70% completion rate in MBI alone; Fisher = 0.020). Although randomized controlled studies with larger samples are needed, this pilot study shows preliminary effectiveness of MBI to treat GAD, and preliminary evidence that adjunctive VR DBT® Mindfulness Skills may reduce dropouts.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 60, 'citationCount': 83, 'journal': {'volume': '10', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Navarro-Haro2019EvaluationOA,\n author = {M.

However, the identification of mechanisms linking breath control to its psychophysiological effects is still under debate. This systematic review is aimed at unveiling psychophysiological mechanisms underlying slow breathing techniques (<10 breaths/minute) and their effects on healthy subjects. Methods: A systematic search of MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases, using keywords related to both breathing techniques and to their psychophysiological outcomes, focusing on cardio-respiratory and central nervous system, has been conducted. From a pool of 2,461 abstracts only 15 articles met eligibility criteria and were included in the review. The present systematic review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: The main effects of slow breathing techniques cover autonomic and central nervous systems activities as well as the psychological status. Slow breathing techniques promote autonomic changes increasing Heart Rate Variability and Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia paralleled by Central Nervous System (CNS) activity modifications. EEG studies show an increase in alpha and a decrease in theta power. Anatomically, the only available fMRI study highlights increased activity in cortical (e.g., prefrontal, motor, and parietal cortices) and subcortical (e.g., pons, thalamus, sub-parabrachial nucleus, periaqueductal gray, and hypothalamus) structures. Psychological/behavioral outputs related to the abovementioned changes are increased comfort, relaxation, pleasantness, vigor and alertness, and reduced symptoms of arousal, anxiety, depression, anger, and confusion. Conclusions: Slow breathing techniques act enhancing autonomic, cerebral and psychological flexibility in a scenario of mutual interactions: we found evidence of links between parasympathetic activity (increased HRV and LF power), CNS activities (increased EEG alpha power and decreased EEG theta power) related to emotional control and psychological well-being in healthy subjects. Our hypothesis considers two different mechanisms for explaining psychophysiological changes induced by voluntary control of slow breathing: one is related to a voluntary regulation of internal bodily states (enteroception), the other is associated to the role of mechanoceptors within the nasal vault in translating slow breathing in a modulation of olfactory bulb activity, which in turn tunes the activity of the entire cortical mantle.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 123, 'citationCount': 265, 'journal': {'volume': '12', 'name': 'Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Zaccaro2018HowBC,\n author = {A.

Different recent papers have reviewed the VR-based treatments in ASD, but they have an important limitation because they only use clinical databases and do not include important technical indexes such as the Web of Science index or the Scimago Journal & Country Rank. To our knowledge, this is the first contribution that has carried out an evidence-based systematic review including both clinical and technical databases about the effectiveness of VR-based intervention in ASD. The initial search identified a total of 450 records. After the exclusion of the papers that are not studies, duplicated articles, and the screening of the abstract and full text, 31 articles met the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison and Outcomes) criteria and were selected for analysis. The studies examined suggest moderate evidence about the effectiveness of VR-based treatments in ASD.

EEG activity was analyzed as a function of global power shifts in Alpha and Beta activity, and with sLORETA current source density estimates of cingulate cortex regions of interest. Results demonstrated that both a quiet rest control condition and the VR meditation significantly reduced subjective reports of anxiety and increased Alpha power. However, the VR intervention uniquely resulted in shifting proportional power from higher Beta frequencies into lower Beta frequencies, and significantly reduced broadband Beta activity in the anterior cingulate cortex.

Despite the growing use of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy® (DBT®) by clinical psychologists, to date, there are no published studies using standard DBT® or DBT® skills learning for severe burn patients. The current study explored the feasibility and clinical potential of using Immersive Virtual Reality (VR) enhanced DBT® mindfulness skills training to reduce negative emotions and increase positive emotions of a patient with severe burn injuries. The participant was a hospitalized (in house) 21-year-old Spanish speaking Latino male patient being treated for a large (>35% TBSA) severe flame burn injury. Methods: The patient looked into a pair of Oculus Rift DK2 virtual reality goggles to perceive the computer-generated virtual reality illusion of floating down a river, with rocks, boulders, trees, mountains, and clouds, while listening to DBT® mindfulness training audios during 4 VR sessions over a 1 month period. Study measures were administered before and after each VR session. Results: As predicted, the patient reported increased positive emotions and decreased negative emotions. The patient also accepted the VR mindfulness treatment technique. He reported the sessions helped him become more comfortable with his emotions and he wanted to keep using mindfulness after returning home. Conclusions: Dialectical Behavioral Therapy is an empirically validated treatment approach that has proved effective with non-burn patient populations for treating many of the psychological problems experienced by severe burn patients. The current case study explored for the first time, the use of immersive virtual reality enhanced DBT® mindfulness skills training with a burn patient. The patient reported reductions in negative emotions and increases in positive emotions, after VR DBT® mindfulness skills training.

Access to psychology services is limited, with some estimates suggesting that over 50% of sufferers are not accessing the existing services available to them for reasons such as inconvenience, embarrassment, or stigmatization concerns around mental health. Health service providers have increasingly been turning to drug-free therapies, such as mindfulness programs, as complementary treatments. Objective Virtual reality (VR) as a new delivery method for meditation-based stress and anxiety reduction therapy offers configurable environments and privacy protection. Our objective was to design a serious learning-meditation environment and to test the feasibility of the developed telemindfulness approach based on cloud technologies. Methods We developed a cloud-based system, which consisted of a Web interface for the mindfulness instructor and remote clients, who had 3D VR headsets. The mindfulness instructor could communicate over the Web interface with the participants using the headset. Additionally, the Web app enabled group sessions in virtual rooms, 360-degree videos, and real interactions or standalone meditation. The mindfulness program was designed as an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction course specifically for the developed virtual environments. The program was tested with four employees and four patients with TBI. The effects were measured with psychometric tests, the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) and the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). Patients also carried out the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). An additional objective evaluation has also been carried out by tracking head motion. Additionally, the power spectrum analyses of similar tasks between sessions were tested. Results The patients achieved a higher level of life satisfaction during the study (SWLS: mean 23.0, SD 1.8 vs mean 18.3, SD 3.9) and a slight increase of the MAAS score (mean 3.4, SD 0.6 vs mean 3.3, SD 0.4). Particular insight into the MAAS items revealed that one patient had a lower MAAS score (mean 2.3). Employees showed high MAAS scores (mean 4.3, SD 0.7) and although their SWLS dropped to mean 26, their SWLS was still high (mean 27.3, SD 2.8). The power spectrum showed that the employees had a considerable reduction in high-frequency movements less than 0.34 Hz, particularly with the 360-degree video. As expected, the patients demonstrated a gradual decrease of high-frequency movements while sitting during the mindfulness practices in the virtual environment.

It has repercussions on the functioning of those suffering from it, who also have low therapy compliance and generate a significant cost both at a personal level and for society. Mindfulness is a psychological treatment that has proved to be effective for ADHD. Virtual reality is widely used as treatment in cases of phobias and other pathologies, with positive results.\n\n\nAIMS\nTo develop the first treatment for ADHD in adults based on virtual reality and mindfulness, while also resulting in increased treatment adherence and reduced costs.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nWe conducted a pilot study with 25 patients treated by means of virtual reality, in four 30-minute sessions, and 25 treated with psychostimulants. Measures will be taken pre-treatment, post-treatment and at 3 and 12 months post-treatment, to evaluate both ADHD and also depression, anxiety, functionality and quality of life. Data will be later analysed with the SPSS v. 20 statistical program. An ANOVA of independent groups will be performed to see the differences between treatments and also a test-retest to detect whether the changes will be maintained.\n\n\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS\nIt is necessary to use treatments that are effective, reduce costs and increase therapy adherence.

Mindfulness-based interventions have been tried out in a wide range of mental disorders, with the strongest evidence for use in depression and anxiety.

Some find home practice too demanding and a barrier to effective utilisation of mindfulness.

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT®) is the most effective treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder, but demand for DBT® far exceeds existing clinical resources. Most patients with BPD never receive DBT®. Incorporating computer technology into the DBT® could help increase dissemination. Immersive Virtual Reality technology (VR) is becoming widely available to mainstream consumers. This case study explored the feasibility/clinical potential of using immersive virtual reality technology to enhance DBT® mindfulness skills training of a 32 year old female diagnosed with BPD. Prior to using VR, the patient experienced difficulty practicing DBT® mindfulness due to her emotional reactivity, and difficulty concentrating. To help the patient focus her attention, and to facilitate DBT® mindfulness skills learning, the patient looked into virtual reality goggles, and had the illusion of slowly “floating down” a 3D computer-generated river while listening to DBT® mindfulness training audios. Urges to commit suicide, urges to self harm, urges to quit therapy, urges to use substances, and negative emotions were all reduced after each VR mindfulness session and VR mindfulness was well accepted/liked by the patient. Although case studies are scientifically inconclusive by nature, results from this feasibility study were encouraging. Future controlled studies are needed to quantify whether VR-enhanced mindfulness training has long term benefits e.g., increasing patient acceptance and/or improving therapeutic outcome.

Various types of dyslexia exist, characterized by different error types. We examined a question that has not been tested so far: which types of errors (and dyslexias) are affected by MBSR training. To do so, we tested, using an extensive battery of reading tests, whether each participant had dyslexia, and which errors types s/he makes, and then compared the rate of each error type before and after the MBSR workshop. We used a similar approach to attention disorders: we evaluated the participants’ sustained, selective, executive, and orienting of attention to assess whether they had attention-disorders, and if so, which functions were impaired. We then evaluated the effect of MBSR on each of the attention functions. Psychological measures including mindfulness, stress, reflection and rumination, lifesatisfaction, depression, anxiety, and sleep-disturbances were also evaluated. Nineteen Hebrew-readers completed a 2-month mindfulness workshop. The results showed that whereas reading errors of letter-migrations within and between words and vowelletter errors did not decrease following the workshop, most participants made fewer reading errors in general following the workshop, with a significant reduction of 19% from their original number of errors. This decrease mainly resulted from a decrease in errors that occur due to reading via the sublexical rather than the lexical route. It seems, therefore, that mindfulness helped reading by keeping the readers on the lexical route. This improvement in reading probably resulted from improved sustained attention: the reduction in sublexical reading was significant for the dyslexic participants who also had attention deficits, and there were significant correlations between reduced reading errors and decreases in impulsivity. Following the meditation workshop, the rate of commission errors decreased, indicating decreased impulsivity, and the variation in RTs in the CPT task decreased, indicating improved sustained attention. Significant improvements were obtained in participants’ mindfulness, perceived-stress, rumination, depression, state-anxiety, and sleep-disturbances. Correlations were also obtained between reading improvement and increased mindfulness following the workshop. Thus, whereas mindfulness training did not affect specific types of errors and did not improve dyslexia, it did affect the reading of adults with developmental dyslexia and ADHD, by helping them to stay on the straight path of the lexical route while reading. Thus, the reading improvement induced by mindfulness sheds light on the intricate relation between attention and reading. Mindfulness reduced impulsivity and improved sustained attention, and this, in turn, improved reading of adults with developmental dyslexia and ADHD, by helping them to read via the straight path of the lexical route.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 121, 'citationCount': 17, 'journal': {'volume': '7', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}, 'citationStyles': {'bibtex': '@Article{Tarrasch2016MindfulRM,\n author = {R.

The program was delivered by school teachers within a regular school curriculum. Emotional well-being was measured using self-report questionnaires at baseline, post-training and 3 months follow-up, and informant reports were collected at baseline and follow-up. Seventy one participants aged 7–9 years were recruited from three primary schools in the UK (training group n = 33; control group n = 38). Acceptability of the program was high with 76% of children in the training group reporting ‘liking’ practicing mindfulness at school, with a strong link to wanting to continue practicing mindfulness at school (p < 0.001). Self-report comparisons revealed that relative to controls, the training group showed significant decreases in negative affect at follow-up, with a large effect size (p = 0.010, d = 0.84). Teacher reports (but not parental ratings) of meta-cognition also showed significant improvements at follow-up with a large effect size (p = 0.002, d = 1.08).

Yet, there remains a lack of clarity in the operationalization of this construct, and underlying mechanisms. Here, we provide an integrative theoretical framework and systems-based neurobiological model that explains the mechanisms by which mindfulness reduces biases related to self-processing and creates a sustainable healthy mind. Mindfulness is described through systematic mental training that develops meta-awareness (self-awareness), an ability to effectively modulate one's behavior (self-regulation), and a positive relationship between self and other that transcends self-focused needs and increases prosocial characteristics (self-transcendence). This framework of self-awareness, -regulation, and -transcendence (S-ART) illustrates a method for becoming aware of the conditions that cause (and remove) distortions or biases. The development of S-ART through meditation is proposed to modulate self-specifying and narrative self-networks through an integrative fronto-parietal control network. Relevant perceptual, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral neuropsychological processes are highlighted as supporting mechanisms for S-ART, including intention and motivation, attention regulation, emotion regulation, extinction and reconsolidation, prosociality, non-attachment, and decentering. The S-ART framework and neurobiological model is based on our growing understanding of the mechanisms for neurocognition, empirical literature, and through dismantling the specific meditation practices thought to cultivate mindfulness.

Mindfulness meditation has therefore increasingly been incorporated into psychotherapeutic interventions. Although the number of publications in the field has sharply increased over the last two decades, there is a paucity of theoretical reviews that integrate the existing literature into a comprehensive theoretical framework. In this article, we explore several components through which mindfulness meditation exerts its effects: (a) attention regulation, (b) body awareness, (c) emotion regulation (including reappraisal and exposure, extinction, and reconsolidation), and (d) change in perspective on the self. Recent empirical research, including practitioners’ self-reports and experimental data, provides evidence supporting these mechanisms. Functional and structural neuroimaging studies have begun to explore the neuroscientific processes underlying these components. Evidence suggests that mindfulness practice is associated with neuroplastic changes in the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, temporo-parietal junction, fronto-limbic network, and default mode network structures. The authors suggest that the mechanisms described here work synergistically, establishing a process of enhanced self-regulation.

Mindfulness is defined as the awareness that arises out of intentionally attending in an open and discerning way to whatever is arising in the present moment. Two decades of empirical research have generated considerable evidence supporting the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions across a wide range of clinical and nonclinical populations, and these interventions have been incorporated into a variety of health care settings. Still, there are many unanswered questions and potential horizons to be investigated. This special issue endeavors to assist in this exploration.

Esto ha despertado el interés de los y las docentes por el silencio como un acto educativo crucial para un proceso formativo menos saturado de información y más harmónico en naturaleza. Así, el presente artículo revisa literatura científica sobre el concepto de silencio como un potenciador de la neurofisiología, por ejemplo, la neurogénesis y estado basal del cerebro; pero también el desarrollo psicosocial, las habilidades auto regulativas atencionales y la calidad del procesamiento del lenguaje, sugiriendo así que su práctica posee las condiciones necesarias para ser considerada como una herramienta pedagógica, tarea a la cual este artículo está dedicado. Se expone una breve revisión de la orientación contemplativa en la enseñanza y el aprendizaje, como aquel enfoque teórico y práctico interesado en el silencio como una estrategia de uso y alcance pedagógico, potenciadora del crecimiento psicológico y la transformación social, a través del desarrollo de la conciencia y la promoción del comportamiento ético-relacional.
