0,001616a2661b20b92387ef40a63bb95ab9883a87,A sociocognitive approach to social problem solving in patients with traumatic brain injury: a pilot study,"ABSTRACT Primary objective: Patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) have difficulty dealing with the social world and may display inappropriate social behavior that negatively affects their social and occupational rehabilitation. This difficulty may be explained by a social problem-solving (SPS) impairment, but little is yet known about the cognitive processes involved in the ability to solve social problems. Several publications have demonstrated that executive functions are related to social problem solving, but the role of social cognition needs to be confirmed. The present pilot study examined the expected relationships between SPS ability and both social cognition and social behavioral skills. Research design: We compared the performances of 15 patients with TBI on SPS, theory-of-mind and social behavior tasks with those of 25 matched healthy controls. Main outcomes and results: Our results showed for the first time that impaired social problem solving is associated with a theory-of-mind deficit, but surprisingly not with executive impairment. There was no evidence that SPS deficits predict social behavioral disorders. Conclusions: Studying social problem solving in patients with TBI may inform the design of more appropriate methods of social rehabilitation.",2018.0,56.0,6.0,"{'volume': '33', 'pages': '40 - 47', 'name': 'Brain Injury'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Saint-Jean2018ASA,\n author = {Mathilde Saint-Jean and P.

Despite this, the role that social cognition plays in outcome, and whether deficits are remediable after traumatic brain injury (TBI), are not yet well known. The current review examines the construct of social cognition and presents a conceptual biopsychosocial model with which to understand the social cognitive process. This is related to the literature on social cognitive deficits in TBI and we discuss relevant treatment developments to date within this population. We then review social cognition treatment programmes researched in other clinical populations in order to advise and inform approaches for those living with TBI. Whilst treatments have focused on emotion perception skills in the TBI literature, programmes developed for other clinical populations have had broader targets, focusing on Theory of Mind skills and/or modifying interpretational cognitive biases. Moreover, they have largely proven to be efficacious. Programmes that are contextualised, collaborative, and experiential seem optimal in enabling generalisation relevant to individuals’ everyday social lives. We argue that there is therefore scope to improve the evidence-based social cognitive treatment options available for those with TBI, taking into account specific adaptations necessary for this population.",2019.0,237.0,61.0,"{'volume': '29', 'pages': '22 - 55', 'name': 'Neuropsychological Rehabilitation'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cassel2019LearningFT,\n author = {Anneli Cassel and S.

The design of pedagogical agents changes over time depending on the desired objectives for them. This article is a systematic review of the research from 2007 to 2017 related to the design factors of pedagogical agents and their impact on learning environments. The objective of this review is to identify and analyze pedagogical agents through the context in which they are constructed, the independent variables used in pedagogical agent research, and the impact of the pedagogical agent implementation. The review found that research on the design of pedagogical agents has different forms, namely text, voice, 2-D character, 3-D character, and human. The independent variables used in the studies are categorized into the appearance of agents and the role of agents. Moreover, the combination of pedagogical agent designs and role designs of pedagogical agents has significant positive impacts on student learning and student behavior.

Intrinsically this language is multimodal (heterogeneous), sequential and asynchronous; it consists of the language (words), visual (expressions) and acoustic (paralinguistic) modalities all in the form of asynchronous coordinated sequences. From a resource perspective, there is a genuine need for large scale datasets that allow for in-depth studies of this form of language. In this paper we introduce CMU Multimodal Opinion Sentiment and Emotion Intensity (CMU-MOSEI), the largest dataset of sentiment analysis and emotion recognition to date. Using data from CMU-MOSEI and a novel multimodal fusion technique called the Dynamic Fusion Graph (DFG), we conduct experimentation to exploit how modalities interact with each other in human multimodal language.

The integration of expressive virtual patients in these simulators encourages the exchanges and provokes emotional reactions in the learner, which promotes memorization and learning. Based on these elements, we assume that the facial expressiveness of a virtual agent is a factor to be considered in order to improve the user experience. We investigate the impact of the facial expressiveness of virtual humans on the empathy induction in the user of health simulators. We also investigate the impact of facial expressiveness on the user’s sense of similarity and the affective bond with the agent. Our results show a high empathy score when users train with simulators. Depending on the context, we observe a significant difference in perspective-taking in favor of the users who interact with an expressive virtual agent to a virtual agent without facial expressiveness.",2021.0,88.0,12.0,"{'name': 'International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction', 'pages': '240 - 252', 'volume': '38'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Milcent2021UsingFE,\n author = {Anne-Sophie Milcent and Abdelmajid Kadri and S.

10,00e8920c490d8e23e595638eaef8aa3ec2853b1c,The Need for a Cognitive Neuroscience of Naturalistic Social Cognition,"Understanding the minds of others is one of the great challenges humans face. Accordingly, much work in cognitive neuroscience has explored the brain systems engaged when perceivers share and make inferences about the internal states of social targets. These studies, however, typically use divergent and highly simplified stimuli and methods and as a consequence have produced largely non‐overlapping sets of results and artificially constrained theories about the processes involved in perceivers’ abilities to understand targets. Here we suggest that these difficulties may stem from two main sources: the lack of meaningful behavioral data about the brain bases of perceivers’ accuracy in inferring target states and qualitative differences between the social stimuli used in neuroimaging paradigms and the social information perceivers encounter in the real world. We advocate more focus on studies of naturalistic social cognition, which could overcome these limitations and complement current approaches, and discuss work in our laboratory that has demonstrated the feasibility and utility of such a focus. Finally, we discuss the relevance of naturalistic social cognition to diagnosing and treating autism spectrum disorder. Overall, using naturalistic paradigms in neuroimaging will be critical to modeling the way the brain actually understands other minds.",2009.0,98.0,197.0,"{'volume': '1167', 'name': 'Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zaki2009TheNF,\n author = {Jamil Zaki and K.

In this paper, we present a multimodal system that supports emotion recognition from both visual and acoustic feature analysis. Our main achievement is that with this bimodal method, we can effectively extend the recognized emotion categories compared to when only visual or acoustic feature analysis works alone. We also show that by carefully cooperating bimodal features, the recognition precision of each emotion category will exceed the limit set up by the single modality, both visual and acoustic. Moreover, we believe our system is closer to real human perception and experience and hence will make emotion recognition closer to practical application in the future",2005.0,11.0,31.0,"{'pages': '1468-1471', 'name': '2005 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chen2005VisualAcousticER,\n author = {Cheng-Yao Chen and Yue Huang and P.

Perceived naturalness of two laughing humanoid robots,"As humanoid robots will have to behave socially adequate in a future society, we started to investigate laughter as an important para-verbal signal influencing relationships among humans quite easily. As a first step we investigate, how humanoid robots might laugh within a situation, which is suitable for laughter. Given the variety of human laughter, do people prefer a certain style for a robot's laughter? And if yes, how does a robot's outer appearance affect this preference, if at all? Accordingly, we combined six recordings of female laughter with body movements for two different humanoid robots with the aim to evaluate their perceived naturalness using two types of video-based surveys. We not only found that people indeed prefer one type of laughter when being forced to choose, but the results also suggest significant differences in the perceived naturalness of laughter with regard to the participant's cultural background. The outer appearance seems to change the perceived naturalness of a humanoid robot's laughter only on a global level.

The concept of the virtual plane is introduced and used to create reactive kinematic-based navigation laws. A virtual plane is an invertible transformation equivalent to the workspace, which is constructed by using a local observer. This results in important simplifications of the collision detection process. Based on the virtual plane, it is possible to determine the intervals of the linear velocity and the paths that lead to collisions with moving obstacles and then derive a dynamic window for the velocity and the orientation to navigate the robot safely. The speed of the robot and the orientation angle are controlled independently using simple collision cones and collision windows constructed from the virtual plane. The robot's path is controlled using kinematic-based navigation laws that depend on navigation parameters. These parameters are tuned in real time to adjust the path of the robot. Simulation is used to illustrate collision detection and path planning.",2009.0,41.0,109.0,"{'volume': '25', 'pages': '902-911', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Robotics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Belkhouche2009ReactivePP,\n author = {F.

Anger rumination and reappraisal.,"Research on rumination has demonstrated that compared with distraction, rumination intensifies and prolongs negative emotion. However, rumination and distraction differ both in what one thinks about and how one thinks about it. Do the negative outcomes of rumination result from how people think about negative events or simply that they think about them at all? To address this question, participants in 2 studies recalled a recent anger-provoking event and then thought about it in 1 of 2 ways: by ruminating or by reappraising. The authors examined the impact of these strategies on subsequent ratings of anger experience (Study 1) as well as on perseverative thinking and physiological responding over time (Study 2). Relative to reappraisal, rumination led to greater anger experience, more cognitive perseveration, and greater sympathetic nervous system activation. These findings provide compelling new evidence that how one thinks about an emotional event can shape the emotional response one has.",2008.0,66.0,308.0,"{'volume': '94 1', 'pages': '\n          133-45\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Ray2008AllIT,\n author = {R.

Online social platforms today provide special link-types that allows effective communication. Thus, many users can hardly categorize their contacts into groups such as “family”, “friends” etc. However, such contact clusters are easily represented via implicit graphs. This has arisen the need to analyze users’ implicit social graph and enable the automatic add/delete of contacts from/to a group via a suggestion algorithm – making the group creation process dynamic (instead of static, where users are manually added or removed). The study implements the friend suggest algorithm, which analyzes a user’s implicit social graph to create custom contact group using an interaction-based metric to estimate a user’s affinity to his contacts and groups. The algorithm starts with a small seed set of contacts – already categorized by a user as friends/groups; And, then suggest other contacts to be added to a group. The result inherent demonstrates the importance of both the implicit group relationships and the interaction-based affinity in suggesting friends.",2020.0,23.0,8.0,"{'volume': '9', 'pages': '497-506', 'name': 'IAES International Journal of Artificial Intelligence'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ojugo2020IntelligentCC,\n author = {A.

However, speaker ""hand off"" behavior---the verbal and nonverbal cues used to transition from one speaker to another---and its effect on speaker anxiety and presentation quality has not been systematically studied. In this work we report on two empirical studies of speaker hand-off behavior used during human co-presentations. We find that the cues used for hand-offs during prepared and rehearsed presentations differ significantly from the cues observed in face-to-face conversational turn-taking. We describe two systems that leverage automatic recognition of these verbal and nonverbal cues to drive hand-offs during co-presentations with a life-sized virtual agent.",2018.0,26.0,10.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Murali2018SpeakerHI,\n author = {Prasanth Murali and Lazlo Ring and H.

Persuasion can be generally defined as an attempt to change another's beliefs or behavior. The act of influencing others is fundamental to nearly every type of social interaction. Any agent desiring to seamlessly operate in a social manner will need to incorporate this type of core human behavior. As in human interaction, myriad aspects of a humanoid robot's appearance and behavior can significantly alter its persuasiveness - this work will focus on one particular factor: gender. In the current study, run at the Museum of Science in Boston, subjects interacted with a humanoid robot whose gender was varied. After a short interaction and persuasive appeal, subjects responded to a donation request made by the robot, and subsequently completed a post-study questionnaire. Findings showed that men were more likely to donate money to the female robot, while women showed little preference. Subjects also tended to rate the robot of the opposite sex as more credible, trustworthy, and engaging. In the case of trust and engagement the effect was much stronger between male subjects and the female robot. These results demonstrate the importance of considering robot and human gender in the design of HRI.",2009.0,28.0,338.0,"{'pages': '2563-2568', 'name': '2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Siegel2009PersuasiveRT,\n author = {Mike Siegel and C.

L. Collins et al., 1998, Trans. Med. Imag. 17, 463-468) was performed. The MNI single-subject main sulci were first delineated and further used as landmarks for the 3D definition of 45 anatomical volumes of interest (AVOI) in each hemisphere. This procedure was performed using a dedicated software which allowed a 3D following of the sulci course on the edited brain. Regions of interest were then drawn manually with the same software every 2 mm on the axial slices of the high-resolution MNI single subject. The 90 AVOI were reconstructed and assigned a label. Using this parcellation method, three procedures to perform the automated anatomical labeling of functional studies are proposed: (1) labeling of an extremum defined by a set of coordinates, (2) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by a sphere centered by a set of coordinates, and (3) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by an activated cluster. An interface with the Statistical Parametric Mapping package (SPM, J. Ashburner and K. J. Friston, 1999, Hum. Brain Mapp. 7, 254-266) is provided as a freeware to researchers of the neuroimaging community. We believe that this tool is an improvement for the macroscopical labeling of activated area compared to labeling assessed using the Talairach atlas brain in which deformations are well known. However, this tool does not alleviate the need for more sophisticated labeling strategies based on anatomical or cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps.",2002.0,45.0,14164.0,"{'volume': '15', 'pages': '273-289', 'name': 'NeuroImage'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tzourio-Mazoyer2002AutomatedAL,\n author = {N.

50,03ece34140f53b2ad42bc4ff95b06633baa5a829,Hybrid Long-Range Collision Avoidance for Crowd Simulation,"Local collision avoidance algorithms in crowd simulation often ignore agents beyond a neighborhood of a certain size. This cutoff can result in sharp changes in trajectory when large groups of agents enter or exit these neighborhoods. In this work, we exploit the insight that exact collision avoidance is not necessary between agents at such large distances, and propose a novel algorithm for extending existing collision avoidance algorithms to perform approximate, long-range collision avoidance. Our formulation performs long-range collision avoidance for distant agent groups to efficiently compute trajectories that are smoother than those obtained with state-of-the-art techniques and at faster rates. Comparison to real-world data demonstrates that crowds simulated with our algorithm exhibit an improved speed sensitivity to density similar to human crowds. Another issue often sidestepped in existing work is that discrete and continuum collision avoidance algorithms have different regions of applicability. For example, low-density crowds cannot be modeled as a continuum, while high-density crowds can be expensive to model using discrete methods. We formulate a hybrid technique for crowd simulation which can accurately and efficiently simulate crowds at any density with seamless transitions between continuum and discrete representations. Our approach blends results from continuum and discrete algorithms, based on local density and velocity variance. In addition to being robust across a variety of group scenarios, it is also highly efficient, running at interactive rates for thousands of agents on portable systems.",2013.0,39.0,92.0,"{'volume': '20', 'pages': '1022-1034', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Golas2013HybridLC,\n author = {Abhinav Golas and Rahul Narain and M.

However, current methods involve considerable parameter tweaking to generate plausible behaviors. We introduce a novel approach (Heter-Sim) that combines physics-based simulation methods with data-driven techniques using an optimization-based formulation. Our approach is general and can simulate heterogeneous agents corresponding to human crowds, traffic, vehicles, or combinations of different agents with varying dynamics. We estimate motion states from real-world datasets that include information about position, velocity, and control direction. Our optimization algorithm considers several constraints, including velocity continuity, collision avoidance, attraction, direction control. Other constraints are implemented by introducing a novel energy function to control the motions of heterogeneous agents. To accelerate the computations, we reduce the search space for both collision avoidance and optimal solution computation. Heter-Sim can simulate tens or hundreds of agents at interactive rates and we compare its accuracy with real-world datasets and prior algorithms. We also perform user studies that evaluate the plausible behaviors generated by our algorithm and a user study that evaluates the plausibility of our algorithm via VR.",2018.0,44.0,31.0,"{'volume': '27', 'pages': '1953-1966', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ren2018HeterSimHM,\n author = {Jiaping Ren and Wei Xiang and Y.

62,04f8ebd32571eb11f29ba972b8aba2e828760bdb,The subtle suspension of backlash: A meta-analysis of penalties for women's implicit and explicit dominance behavior.,"Previous research suggests that women, more than men, experience negative outcomes when they display dominance. A closer look, however, reveals ambiguity about the specific forms of dominance proscribed for women. Here, we suggest that negative reactions to women's dominance, a counter-stereotypical behavior, may require that the behavior be clearly encoded as counter-stereotypical-which is less likely when the behavior is expressed implicitly. This hypothesis was tested with a meta-analysis of studies on the evaluation of individuals behaving dominantly, including articles not directly investigating gender. Results revealed that dominance indeed hurts women's, relative to men's, likability (although the overall effect is small, d = -0.19, k = 63), as well as more downstream outcomes such as hireability (d = -0.58, k = 20). More important, however, dominance expressed explicitly (e.g., direct demands) affected women's likability (d = -0.28) whereas implicit forms of dominance (e.g., eye contact) did not (d = 0.03). Finally, the effect of dominance on men's and women's perceived competence did not differ (d = 0.02, k = 31), consistent with the idea that it is interpersonal (rather than instrumental) evaluations that obstruct women leaders. Implications for theory, and for the success of male and female leaders, are discussed.",2016.0,174.0,222.0,"{'volume': '142 2', 'pages': '\n          165-97\n        ', 'name': 'Psychological bulletin'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Williams2016TheSS,\n author = {Melissa J.

Most studies of SS to date index severity with some variant of the Pensacola Motion Sickness Questionnaire (MSQ). The MSQ has several deficiencies as an instrument for measuring SS. Some symptoms included in the scoring of MS are irrelevant for SS, and several are misleading. Also, the configural approach of the MSQ is not readily adaptable to computer administration and scoring.

Antilittering campaigns that appeal to citizens' conscience or sense of community pride are attempts to increase the threats of shame and embarrassment for littering.

70,05b8329dff2c4809077c8064d7e04bed5c39dcc3,The laws of emotion.,"It is argued that emotions are lawful phe- nomena and thus can be described in terms of a set of laws of emotion. These laws result from the operation of emotion mechanisms that are accessible to intentional control to only a limited extent. The law of situational meaning, the law of concern, the law of reality, the laws of change, habituation and comparative feeling, and the law of hedonic asymmetry are proposed to describe emo- tion elicitation; the law of conservation of emotional mo- mentum formulates emotion persistence,"" the law of closure expresses the modularity of emotion; and the laws of care for consequence, of lightest load, and of greatest gain per- tain to emotion regulation. For a long time, emotion was an underprivileged area in psychology. It was not regarded as a major area of sci- entific psychological endeavor that seemed to deserve concerted research efforts or receive them. Things have changed over the last 10 or so years. Emotion has become an important domain with a co- herent body of theory and data. It has developed to such an extent that its phenomena can be described in terms of a set of laws, the laws of emotion, that I venture to describe here. Formulating a set of laws of emotion implies not only that the study of emotion has developed sufficiently to do so but also that emotional phenomena are indeed lawful. It implies that emotions emerge, wax, and wane according to rules in strictly determined fashion. To argue this is a secondary objective of this article. Emotions are lawful. When experiencing emotions, people are subject to laws. When filled by emotions, they are manifesting the workings of laws. There is a place for obvious a priori reservations here. Emotions and feelings are often considered the most idiosyncratic of psychological phenomena, and they sug- gest human freedom at its clearest. The mysticism of ineffability and freedom that surrounds emotions may be one reason why the psychology of emotion and feeling has advanced so slowly over the last 100 years. This mys- ticism is largely unfounded, and the freedom of feeling is an illusion. For one thing, the notion of freedom of feeling runs counter to the traditional wisdom that human beings are enslaved by their passions. For another, the laws of emotion may help us to discern that simple, universal, moving forces operate behind the complex, idiosyncratic movements of feeling, in the same way that the erratic path of an ant, to borrow Simon's (1973) well-known parable, manifests the simple structure of a simple ani- mal's mind. The word law may give rise to misunderstanding. When formulating ""'laws"" in this article, I am discussing what are primarily empirical regularities. These regular- ities--or putative regularities--are, however, assumed to rest on underlying Causal mechanisms that generate them. I am suggesting that the laws of emotion are grounded in mechanisms that are not of a voluntary nature and that are only partially under voluntary control. Not only emotions obey the laws; we obey them. We are subject to our emotions, and we cannot engender emotions at will. The laws of emotion that I will discuss are not all equally well established. Not all of them originate in solid evidence, nor are all equally supported by it. To a large extent, in fact, to list the laws of emotion is to list a pro- gram of research. However, the laws provide a coherent picture of emotional responding, which suggests that such a research program might be worthwhile.",1988.0,59.0,2614.0,"{'volume': '43 5', 'pages': '\n          349-58\n        ', 'name': 'The American psychologist'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Frijda1988TheLO,\n author = {N.

Although surprisingly common, anthropomorphism is not invariant. This article describes a theory to explain when people are likely to anthropomorphize and when they are not, focused on three psychological determinants--the accessibility and applicability of anthropocentric knowledge (elicited agent knowledge), the motivation to explain and understand the behavior of other agents (effectance motivation), and the desire for social contact and affiliation (sociality motivation). This theory predicts that people are more likely to anthropomorphize when anthropocentric knowledge is accessible and applicable, when motivated to be effective social agents, and when lacking a sense of social connection to other humans. These factors help to explain why anthropomorphism is so variable; organize diverse research; and offer testable predictions about dispositional, situational, developmental, and cultural influences on anthropomorphism. Discussion addresses extensions of this theory into the specific psychological processes underlying anthropomorphism, applications of this theory into robotics and human-computer interaction, and the insights offered by this theory into the inverse process of dehumanization.",2007.0,286.0,1941.0,"{'volume': '114 4', 'pages': '\n          864-86\n        ', 'name': 'Psychological review'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Epley2007OnSH,\n author = {Nicholas Epley and A.

In the light of these advancements this study aims to examine if current, often manual, practices and techniques for modeling tactical behavior can be improved using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We compare three state-of-the-art DRL algorithms according to their ability to control computer generated forces in simulated ground combat scenarios.

Researchers studying individual differences in social interactions are typically interested in keeping the behavior and the appearance of the interaction partner constant across participants. With IVET researchers have full control over the interaction partners, can standardize them while still keeping the simulation realistic. Virtual simulations are valid: growing evidence shows that indeed studies conducted with IVET can replicate some well-known findings of social psychology. Moreover, IVET allows researchers to subtly manipulate characteristics of the environment (e.g., visual cues to prime participants) or of the social partner (e.g., his/her race) to investigate their influences on participants’ behavior and cognition. Furthermore, manipulations that would be difficult or impossible in real life (e.g., changing participants’ height) can be easily obtained with IVET. Beside the advantages for theoretical research, we explore the most recent training and clinical applications of IVET, its integration with other technologies (e.g., social sensing) and future challenges for researchers (e.g., making the communication between virtual humans and participants smoother).",2015.0,83.0,102.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bombari2015StudyingSI,\n author = {Dario Bombari and M.

Community mask wearing, hand washing and social distancing are thought to be effective but there is little evidence to inform or support community members on COVID-19 risk reduction within families. Methods A retrospective cohort study of 335 people in 124 families and with at least one laboratory confirmed COVID-19 case was conducted from 28 February to 27 March 2020, in Beijing, China. The outcome of interest was secondary transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within the family. Characteristics and practices of primary cases, of well family contacts and household hygiene practices were analysed as predictors of secondary transmission. Results The secondary attack rate in families was 23.0% (77/335). Face mask use by the primary case and family contacts before the primary case developed symptoms was 79% effective in reducing transmission (OR=0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.79). Daily use of chlorine or ethanol based disinfectant in households was 77% effective (OR=0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.84). Wearing a mask after illness onset of the primary case was not significantly protective. The risk of household transmission was 18 times higher with frequent daily close contact with the primary case (OR=18.26, 95% CI 3.93 to 84.79), and four times higher if the primary case had diarrhoea (OR=4.10, 95% CI 1.08 to 15.60). Household crowding was not significant. Conclusion The study confirms the highest risk of transmission prior to symptom onset, and provides the first evidence of the effectiveness of mask use, disinfection and social distancing in preventing COVID-19. We also found evidence of faecal transmission. This can inform guidelines for community prevention in settings of intense COVID-19 epidemics.",2020.0,23.0,411.0,"{'volume': '5', 'name': 'BMJ Global Health'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wang2020ReductionOS,\n author = {Yu Wang and H.

Kinetic typography has been widely and successfully used in film title sequences as well as television and computer-based advertising. However, its communicative abilities have not been widely studied, and its potential has rarely been exploited outside these areas. This is partly due to the difficulty in creating kinetic typography with current tools, often requiring hours of work to animate a single sentence.In this paper, we present the Kinedit system, a basic authoring tool that takes initial steps toward remedying this situation and hence promoting exploration of the communicative potential of kinetic typography for personal communication.

Although several approaches have been proposed to recognize human emotions based on facial expressions or speech, relatively limited work has been done to fuse these two, and other, modalities to improve the accuracy and robustness of the emotion recognition system. This paper analyzes the strengths and the limitations of systems based only on facial expressions or acoustic information. It also discusses two approaches used to fuse these two modalities: decision level and feature level integration. Using a database recorded from an actress, four emotions were classified: sadness, anger, happiness, and neutral state. By the use of markers on her face, detailed facial motions were captured with motion capture, in conjunction with simultaneous speech recordings. The results reveal that the system based on facial expression gave better performance than the system based on just acoustic information for the emotions considered.

It remains difficult, however, to direct autonomous characters to perform specific tasks. This paper addresses the challenge by introducing cognitive modeling. Cognitive models go beyond behavioral models in that they govern what a character knows, how that knowledge is acquired, and how it can be used to plan actions. To help build cognitive models, we develop the cognitive modeling language CML. Using CML, we can imbue a character with domain knowledge, elegantly specified in terms of actions, their preconditions and their effects, and then direct the character’s behavior in terms of goals. Our approach allows behaviors to be specified more naturally and intuitively, more succinctly and at a much higher level of abstraction than would otherwise be possible. With cognitively empowered characters, the animator need only specify a behavior outline or “sketch plan” and, through reasoning, the character will automatically work out a detailed sequence of actions satisfying the specification. We exploit interval methods to integrate sensing into our underlying theoretical framework, thus enabling our autonomous characters to generate action plans even in highly complex, dynamic virtual worlds. We demonstrate cognitive modeling applications in advanced character animation and automated cinematography.",1999.0,29.0,497.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 26th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Funge1999CognitiveMK,\n author = {J.

Haptic technologies have been shown to provide an important contribution to this by facilitating co-presence and allowing affective communication. However, the findings of the affective influences rely on studies that have used myriad different types of haptic technology, making it likely that some forms of tactile feedback are more efficient in communicating emotions than others. To find out whether this is true and which haptic technologies are most effective, we measured user experience during a communication scenario featuring an affective agent and interpersonal touch in virtual reality. Interpersonal touch was simulated using two types of vibrotactile actuators and two types of force feedback mechanisms. Self-reports of subjective experience of the agent’s touch and emotions were obtained. The results revealed that, regardless of the agent’s expression, force feedback actuators were rated as more natural and resulted in greater emotional interdependence and a stronger sense of co-presence than vibrotactile touch.",2016.0,37.0,42.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 18th ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Ahmed2016ReachOA,\n author = {Imtiaj Ahmed and V.

95,07333fe6d1afbaef762faf444c3d976cef8ab794,Adaptive Emotional Expression in Robot-Child Interaction,"Expressive behaviour is a vital aspect of human interaction. A model for adaptive emotion expression was developed for the Nao robot. The robot has an internal arousal and valence value, which are influenced by the emotional state of its interaction partner and emotional occurrences such as winning a game. It expresses these emotions through its voice, posture, whole body poses, eye colour and gestures. An experiment with 18 children (mean age 9) and two Nao robots was conducted to study the influence of adaptive emotion expression on the interaction behaviour and opinions of children. In a within-subjects design the children played a quiz with both an affective robot using the model for adaptive emotion expression and a non-affective robot without this model. The affective robot reacted to the emotions of the child using the implementation of the model, the emotions of the child were interpreted by a Wizard of Oz. The dependent variables, namely the behaviour and opinions of the children, were measured through video analysis and questionnaires. The results show that children react more expressively and more positively to a robot which adaptively expresses itself than to a robot which does not. The feedback of the children in the questionnaires further suggests that showing emotion through movement is considered a very positive trait for a robot. From their positive reactions we can conclude that children enjoy interacting with a robot which adaptively expresses itself through emotion and gesture more than with a robot which does not do this.

It enables dyads to exchange the physical experience of holding hands regardless of distance and location. Text, speech and video communication systems support the transmission of several nonverbal affective aspects of communication but not the impression of physical proximity which is essential to experience a more intimate conversation. In real life touching hands is an important empathic experience for dyads that elicits a strong sense of togetherness, while signaling trust, understanding and social support. We analyzed hand-holding behavior of parent-child dyads and classified these into five categories implemented by the device: (1) child holding parent's finger, (2) fingers on fingers (both on the inside), (3) palm on palm, (4) palm on outside of hand, and (5) child holding parent's fingers and palm. For each hand holding position there are distinct sending, receiving and neutral contact points. Adding the haptic sensation of holding hands to online conversations may foster a sense of proximity or ""togetherness"".

This exposure can lead their own emotion expressions becoming more similar to those of others, a process we refer to as 'digital emotion contagion'.

After defining emotion contagion, we suggest that one unique feature of digital emotion contagion is that it is mediated by digital media platforms that are motivated to upregulate user emotions. We then turn to measurement, and consider the challenges of demonstrating that digital emotion contagion has occurred, and how these challenges have been addressed.

Conditions characterized by reduced spontaneous mimicry (e.g., autism) also display deficits in sensitivity to social rewards. We tested if spontaneous mimicry of socially rewarding stimuli (happy faces) depends on the reward value of stimuli in 32 typical participants. An evaluative conditioning paradigm was used to associate different reward values with neutral target faces. Subsequently, electromyographic activity over the Zygomaticus Major was measured whilst participants watched video clips of the faces making happy expressions. Higher Zygomaticus Major activity was found in response to happy faces conditioned with high reward versus low reward. Moreover, autistic traits in the general population modulated the extent of spontaneous mimicry of happy faces. This suggests a link between reward and spontaneous mimicry and provides a possible underlying mechanism for the reduced response to social rewards seen in autism.",2012.0,62.0,78.0,"{'volume': '49 7', 'pages': '\n          998-1004\n        ', 'name': 'Psychophysiology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sims2012HowRM,\n author = {Thomas B.

We adopted a bottom-up, synthetic approach towards interactive competencies in robots using simple, minimal computational models underlying the robot's interaction dynamics. We present two empirical, exploratory studies investigating a drumming experience with a humanoid robot (KASPAR) and a human. In the first experiment, the turn-taking behaviour of the humanoid is deterministic and the non-verbal gestures of the robot accompany its drumming to assess the impact of non-verbal gestures on the interaction. The second experiment studies a computational framework that facilitates emergent turn-taking dynamics, whereby the particular dynamics of turn-taking emerge from the social interaction between the human and the humanoid. The results from the HRI experiments are presented and analysed qualitatively (in terms of the participants’ subjective experiences) and quantitatively (concerning the drumming performance of the human–robot pair). The results point out a trade-off between the subjective evaluation of the drumming experience from the perspective of the participants and the objective evaluation of the drumming performance. A certain number of gestures was preferred as a motivational factor in the interaction. The participants preferred the models underlying the robot's turn-taking which enable the robot and human to interact more and provide turn-taking closer to ‘natural’ human–human conversations, despite differences in objective measures of drumming behaviour. The results are consistent with the temporal behaviour matching hypothesis previously proposed in the literature which concerns the effect that the participants adapt their own interaction dynamics to the robot's.",2010.0,78.0,39.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '103 - 134', 'name': 'Connection Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kose-Bagci2010DrummateID,\n author = {H.

We first devise a lazy dynamic rebalance model, which specifies the dynamic balance conditions, defines the rebalance effort, and selects the suitable rebalance strategy automatically using the laziness law after an unexpected perturbation. Based on the model, L4RW searches over a motion capture (mocap) database for an appropriate motion segment to follow, and the transition‐to motions is generated by interpolating the active response dynamic motion. A support vector machine (SVM) based training, classification, and predication algorithm is applied to reduce the search space, and it is trained offline only once. Our algorithm classifies the mocap database into many rebalance strategy‐specified subsets and then online predicts responsive motions in the subset according to the selected strategy. The rebalance effort, the ‘extrapolated center of mass’ (XCoM) and environment constraints are selected as feature attributes for the SVM feature vector. Furthermore, the subset's segments are sorted through the rebalance effort, then our algorithm searches for an acceptable segment starting from the least‐effort segment.

Our algorithms all share two definitive features: first, they involve iterative removal of edges from the network to split it into communities, the edges removed being identified using any one of a number of possible ""betweenness"" measures, and second, these measures are, crucially, recalculated after each removal. We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.",2003.0,76.0,12319.0,"{'volume': '69 2 Pt 2', 'pages': '\n          026113\n        ', 'name': 'Physical review.

The book aims to be a guide through the most common and interesting methods for corporate valuation, supported by a rich mathematical foundation. The focus is on the tools and methods for valuing a business, from the most basic approaches to the implementation of complex algorithms. Each topic is deeply analyzed to give students the tools to really understand the effects of valuation on the life of the corporation. The vision of the book is to offer a guide to valuation, capable of helping students and practitioners gain an introduction to the area, as well as giving intermediate users useful insights into and a deeper understanding of the analytics behind each part. The literature of books in corporate valuation spans over a wide range of methods and theories. The market is already full of (even good) textbooks facing the issue of the corporation from many points of view. However, the overall offer of Inside Company Valuation turns the attention on the financial aspects of the daily life of the corporation, with a robust mathematical setting, and the explanation and derivation of the mostly popular models of the firm. The potential of filling such a niche is evident if one thinks that a course in Corporate Finance nowadays makes only sense if it includes a robust section about company valuation tools and techniques. There is a demand of high-quality education at Master level, including a more advanced level of Corporate Finance courses, which is not fulfilled nowadays, and definitely requires a good textbook as a guide for such advanced education in the field.

The aim of this research is to investigate which design features establish a positive first impression of an agent in this context. A set of eight static agent images, different in age, gender and role, were subjected to testing in an online questionnaire. Respondents (n = 155) selected their preferred design and rated the characteristics – friendliness, expertise, reliability, involvement and authority – and the likeliness of following the agent’s advice for all designs. In addition, focus groups (n = 13) were conducted for detailed understandings supporting these impressions. Our results show that, for both a general and elderly population, (1) people seem to prefer images of young, female agents over old, male agents, (2) the (a) age, (b) gender and (c) role of the agent image affect the perception of the agent’s characteristics and the likeliness of following the agent’s advice, and that (3) both the general and elderly population prefer an agent image that is similar in (a) age and (b) gender.

Our study relies on a mocap audiovisual dataset acquired in a laboratory setting. Participants are invited to view the animation clips of a virtual talking character displaying the original mocap head motion or manipulated head motion, and then to rate their perceived expressiveness.

Beyond those myriad features examined in computer science, roundness, angularity, and visual complexity have also been found to evoke emotions in human perceivers, as demonstrated in psychological studies of facial expressions, dance poses, and even simple synthetic visual patterns. Capturing these characteristics algorithmically to incorporate in computational studies, however, has proven difficult. Here we expand the scope of previous computer vision work by examining these three visual characteristics in computer analysis of complex scenes, and compare the results to the hundreds of visual qualities previously examined. A large collection of ecologically valid stimuli (i.e., photos that humans regularly encounter on the web), named the EmoSet and containing more than 40,000 images crawled from web albums, was generated using crowd-sourcing and subjected to human subject emotion ratings. We developed computational methods to the separate indices of roundness, angularity, and complexity, thereby establishing three new computational constructs. Critically, these three new physically interpretable visual constructs achieve comparable classification accuracy to the hundreds of shape, texture, composition, and facial feature characteristics previously examined. In addition, our experimental results show that color features related most strongly with the positivity of perceived emotions, the texture features related more to calmness or excitement, and roundness, angularity, and simplicity related similarly with both of these emotions dimensions.",2017.0,27.0,10.0,"{'pages': '440-447', 'name': '2017 Seventh International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lu2017AnII,\n author = {Xin Lu and Reginald B.

In the view of social contagion of decision making, a method based on Susceptible-Infective (SI) model is proposed to formulize the disaster evacuation demand curves to address both social influence and other factors’ effects. The disaster event of the “Tianjin Explosions” is used as a case study to illustrate the modeling results influenced by the four factors and perform the sensitivity analyses of the key parameters of the model.

129,0aab9690ad56a441566927f660946b9e8de05e43,Characteristics of dissociable human learning systems,"Abstract A number of ways of taxonomizing human learning have been proposed. We examine the evidence for one such proposal, namely, that there exist independent explicit and implicit learning systems. This combines two further distinctions, (1) between learning that takes place with versus without concurrent awareness, and (2) between learning that involves the encoding of instances (or fragments) versus the induction of abstract rules or hypotheses. Implicit learning is assumed to involve unconscious rule learning. We examine the evidence for implicit learning derived from subliminal learning, conditioning, artificial grammar learning, instrumental learning, and reaction times in sequence learning. We conclude that unconscious learning has not been satisfactorily established in any of these areas. The assumption that learning in some of these tasks (e.g., artificial grammar learning) is predominantly based on rule abstraction is questionable. When subjects cannot report the “implicitly learned” rules that govern stimulus selection, this is often because their knowledge consists of instances or fragments of the training stimuli rather than rules. In contrast to the distinction between conscious and unconscious learning, the distinction between instance and rule learning is a sound and meaningful way of taxonomizing human learning. We discuss various computational models of these two forms of learning.",1994.0,330.0,1135.0,"{'volume': '17', 'pages': '367 - 395', 'name': 'Behavioral and Brain Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Shanks1994CharacteristicsOD,\n author = {D.

However, users’ emotional responses to humanoid robots’ emotional behaviors which differ from robots’ traditional behaviors remain well understood. This study aims to investigate the effect of a humanoid robot’s emotional behaviors on users’ emotional responses using subjective reporting, pupillometry, and electroencephalography. Five categories of the humanoid robot’s emotional behaviors expressing joy, fear, neutral, sadness, or anger were designed, selected, and presented to users. Results show that users have a significant positive emotional response to the humanoid robot’s joy behavior and a significant negative emotional response to the humanoid robot’s sadness behavior, indicated by the metrics of reported valence and arousal, pupil diameter, frontal middle relative theta power, and frontal alpha asymmetry score. The results suggest that humanoid robot’s emotional behaviors can evocate users’ significant emotional response. The evocation might relate to the recognition of these emotional behaviors. In addition, the study provides a multimodal physiological method of evaluating users’ emotional responses to the humanoid robot’s emotional behaviors.",2019.0,87.0,23.0,"{'volume': '35', 'pages': '1947 - 1959', 'name': 'International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Guo2019TheEO,\n author = {F.

To identify under which circumstances a virtual agent should express empathic emotions, we have analyzed real human-machine dialog situations that have led users to express emotion. The results of this empirical study have been combined with theoretical descriptions of emotions to construct a model of empathic emotions. Based on this model, a module of emotions has been implemented as a plug-in for JSA agents. It determines the empathic emotions (their types and intensity) of such agents in real time. It has been used to develop a demonstrator where users can interact with an empathic dialog agent to obtain information on their emails. An evaluation of this agent has enabled us to both validate the proposed model of empathic emotions and highlight the positive user's perception of the virtual agent.",2008.0,32.0,99.0,{'pages': '89-96'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Ochs2008AnEV,\n author = {M.

We examined user interactions with this technology, and focused on the types of tasks requested of Alexa, the variables that affect user behaviors with Alexa, and Alexa’s alternatives. The data about Alexa usage were collected from 19 participants via the online questionnaire and diary methods over the course of several days. The results indicate that across all age groups, Alexa was primarily used for checking weather forecasts, playing music, and controlling other devices. Several participants reported using Apple Siri and Google Now applications in addition to Alexa for similar purposes except for controlling other devices. Alexa uses over the weekends were more frequent than on weekdays, but its overall usage tended to decrease over time. The users reported being satisfied with Alexa even when it did not produce sought information, suggesting that the interaction experience is more important to the users than the interaction output. More work is required to understand whether users treat Alexa and similar voice-controlled applications as primarily a traditional information retrieval system, a casual leisure system, a control interface for smart home devices, or, simply, a new toy.",2019.0,58.0,189.0,"{'volume': '51', 'pages': '984 - 997', 'name': 'Journal of Librarianship and Information Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lopatovska2019TalkTM,\n author = {Irene Lopatovska and Katrina Rink and I.

Based on research on the triad of impairments that characterize ASD, and how these impairments may be linked to deficits in theory of mind, we lay out a set of key features that we believe to be important – and as yet undervalued -in technological interventions for children with autism: (1) a peer context, rather than a virtual parent or teacher, so that children can practice peer social interaction skills, (2) a personally-meaningful storytelling task for practicing imagination and language, (3) a system that incorporates not just interaction with the technology, but also a control and author mode, to allow the child to build appropriate social skills from the ground up. These features are instantiated in an authorable, life-size, full-body virtual peer that tells collaborative stories and thereby gives children with ASD a space to play with social interaction, communication and imaginative play behaviors. Pilot studies demonstrate that for at least some children with ASD and related diagnoses, the PAT system is intuitive, motivating, and capable of engaging children in the kind of tight reciprocal social interaction that is otherwise so difficult for them, and that is the basis for both play and learning among children.",2006.0,54.0,17.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Cassell2006RunningHV,\n author = {Justine Cassell},\n title = {Running head: Virtual Peer Technology for Children with Autism Using Virtual Peer Technology as an Intervention for Children with Autism},\n year = {2006}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '145431806', 'name': 'Justine Cassell'}]"

This article reviews mechanisms that could underlie this effect and then delves into practical implications. The most common category of explanations is that emotional resonances in the discourse context accrue to utterances because human memory is inherently associative. One application concerns forensic investigations. Compared to emotional phrases in a native language, emotional phrases heard or read in a foreign language elicit weaker skin-conductance responses (SCRs). In one study involving a mock crime, SCRs elicited by a foreign language were high and insensitive to emotionality, suggesting a stress response. A second application is decision making, given recent findings that judgments in a foreign language are influenced by emotional content. This raises the question of how to assess the real-world importance of this provocative laboratory finding. A third application is the emotional and logical appeal of advertising slogans. In multilingual regions, marketers could direct appeals to consumers in their native language to sell luxury items. In contrast, ads using a less proficient or foreign language may be most effective for selling items that will increase work productivity.",2014.0,56.0,153.0,"{'volume': '5', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Caldwell-Harris2014EmotionalityDB,\n author = {C.

Accordingly, providing retrieval opportunity during vocabulary learning is encouraged in this essay. After reviewing some literature related to retrieval process, repetition is one effective way to promote retrieval process. Since repeated encounters of the words facilitate the students to access the words-related information in their mind, repetition activity will be the effective solution for this context. The spaced repetition as proposed by Baddley (1990) can be appropriate for this context since learners will not be bored about the repetition. This idea is then developed by providing students with Southeast Sulawesi folklore as the reading material in order to obtain target words.

Such prototypic expressions, however, occur rather infrequently. Human emotions and intentions are more often communicated by changes in one or a few discrete facial features. In this paper, we develop an Automatic Face Analysis (AFA) system to analyze facial expressions based on both permanent facial features (brows, eyes, mouth) and transient facial features (deepening of facial furrows) in a nearly frontal-view face image sequence. The AFA system recognizes fine-grained changes in facial expression into action units (AUs) of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), instead of a few prototypic expressions. Multistate face and facial component models are proposed for tracking and modeling the various facial features, including lips, eyes, brows, cheeks, and furrows. During tracking, detailed parametric descriptions of the facial features are extracted. With these parameters as the inputs, a group of action units (neutral expression, six upper face AUs and 10 lower face AUs) are recognized whether they occur alone or in combinations. The system has achieved average recognition rates of 96.4 percent (95.4 percent if neutral expressions are excluded) for upper face AUs and 96.7 percent (95.6 percent with neutral expressions excluded) for lower face AUs. The generalizability of the system has been tested by using independent image databases collected and FACS-coded for ground-truth by different research teams.",2001.0,54.0,1818.0,"{'volume': '23 2', 'pages': '\n          97-115\n        ', 'name': 'IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tian2001RecognizingAU,\n author = {Ying-li Tian and T.

151,0cab531faa123491630b49da3290eb2b7eceeb17,LESSONS FROM EMOTION PSYCHOLOGY FOR THE DESIGN OF LIFELIKE CHARACTERS,"ABSTRACT This special issue describes a number of applications that utilize lifelike characters that teach indirectly, by playing some role in a social interaction with a user. The design of such systems reflects a compromise between competing, sometimes unarticulated, demands: They must realistically exhibit the behaviors and characteristics of their role, they must facilitate the desired learning, and they must work within the limitations of current technology, and there is little theoretical or empirical guidance on the impact of these compromises on learning. Our perspective on this problem is shaped by our interest in the role of emotion and emotional behaviors in such forms of learning. In recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in the role of emotion in the design of virtual humans. The techniques and motivations underlying these various efforts can seem, from an outsider's perspective, as bewildering and multifaceted as the concept of emotion itself is generally accused of being. Drawing on insights from emotion psychology, this article attempts to clarify for the designers of educational agents the various theoretical perspectives on the concept of emotion with the aim of giving guidance to designers of educational agents.",2005.0,88.0,94.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '215 - 233', 'name': 'Applied Artificial Intelligence'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gratch2005LESSONSFE,\n author = {J.

154,0ccd794c005901d996cc9caa2954981aa45b095d,Current Directions in Psychological Science,"This paper reviews theory and research regarding the ‘‘Michelangelo phenomenon.’’ The Michelangelomodel suggests that close partners sculpt one another’s selves, shaping one another’s skills and traits and promoting versus inhibiting one another’s goal pursuits. As a result of the manner in which partners perceive and behave toward one another, each person enjoys greater or lesser success at attaining his or her ideal-self goals. Affirmation of one another’s ideal-self goals yields diverse benefits, both personal and relational. The Michelangelo model and supportive empirical evidence are reviewed, the phenomenon is distinguished from related interpersonal processes, and directions for future work are outlined. KEYWORDS—Michelangelo phenomenon; interdependence; ideal self; relationships People have dreams and aspirations, or mental representations of the skills, traits, and resources that they ideally would like to acquire. These aspirations include diverse goals: People may want to acquire desirable traits such as warmth, confidence, or decisiveness; to achieve professional success in the form of advancement, peer respect, or financial benefits; or to advance important pursuits involving religion, travel, or athletics. Most explanations of how people acquire new skills, traits, and resources are intrapersonal, examining the individual in isolation (cf. Carver& Scheier, 1998). But granting that people sometimes achieve desirable goals through their own actions, this personcentric approach ignores the important role that close partners play in helping people achieve their dreams and aspirations. In the following pages we review theory and research regarding the ‘‘Michelangelo phenomenon,’’ one of the most prominent interpersonal models of how close partners promote versus inhibit each person’s pursuit of ideal self goals (Drigotas, Rusbult, Wieselquist, & Whitton, 1999). THE IDEAL SELF AND PARTNER AFFIRMATION Michelangelo Buonarroti described sculpting as a process whereby the artist releases an ideal figure from the block of stone in which it slumbers. The sculptor’s task is simply to chip away at the stone so as to reveal the ideal form (Gombrich, 1995). Figure 1 depicts one of Michelangelo’s unfinished captives, vividly illustrating this process. One can readily feel the force with which the ideal form strives to emerge from the stone, shedding its imperfections. The sculptor chisels, carves, and polishes the stone to reveal the ideal form slumbering within. Humans, too, possess ideal forms. The ideal self describes an individual’s dreams and aspirations, or the constellation of skills, traits, and resources that an individual ideally wishes to acquire (Higgins, 1987; Markus & Nurius, 1986). For example, Mary’s ideal self might include goals such as completing medical school, becoming more sociable, or learning to speak fluent Dutch. Whether images of the ideal self constitute vague yearnings or clearly articulated mental representations, dreams and aspirations serve a crucial function, providing direction to personal growth strivings and thereby helping people reduce the discrepancy between the actual self and the ideal self (Higgins, 1987). Although people sometimes achieve ideal-relevant goals solely through their own actions, the acquisition of new skills, traits, and resources is also shaped by interpersonal experience. People adapt to one another during the course of interaction, changing their behavior so as to coordinate with one another and respond to each person’s needs and expectations (Kelley et al., 2003). For example, John may help Mary become more sociable by subtly directing conversation during a dinner party, leading Mary to tell one of her most charming stories. Adaptation may transpire in interactions with diverse types of partner, including romantic partners, kin, friends, or colleagues. However, adaptation ismost probable, powerful, and enduring in highly interdependent relationships, in that the mutual dependence of close partners provides good opportunities for exerting strong, frequent, and benevolent influence across diverse behavioral domains (Kelley et al., 1983). Over time, adaptations that begin as temporary, interaction-specific adjustments become stable components of the self, such that over the course of extended interaction, close partners sculpt one another’s selves: People come to reflect what their partners ‘‘see in them’’ and ‘‘elicit from them’’ (Rusbult & Van Lange, 2003).

CURRENT DIRECTIONS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE Volume 18—Number 6 305 Copyright r 2009 Association for Psychological Science at Vrije Universiteit 34820 on November 24, 2010 cdp.sagepub.com Downloaded from Is such adaptation a good thing or a bad thing? The concept of partner affirmation describes whether the partner is an ally, neutral party, or foe in individual goal pursuits (Drigotas et al., 1999). As noted in Figure 2, affirmation has two components: Partner perceptual affirmation describes the extent to which a partner consciously or unconsciously perceives the target in ways that are compatible with the target’s ideal self. For example, Johnmay deliberately consider the character of Mary’s ideal self, consciously developing benevolent interpretations of disparities between her actual self and ideal self. Alternatively, if John and Mary possess similar life goals or values, John may rather automatically perceive and display faith in Mary’s ideal goal pursuits. Partner behavioral affirmation describes the extent to which a partner consciously or unconsciously behaves in ways that elicit ideal-congruent behaviors from the target. For example, John may rather automatically communicate confidence in Mary’s abilities, hemay consciously or unconsciously react in a positive manner when she enacts ideal congruent behaviors, or he may provide direct assistance in her goal pursuits. Of course, John may also disaffirm Mary by communicating indifference, pessimism, or disapproval, by undermining her ideal pursuits, or by affirming qualities that are antithetical to Mary’s ideal self. The model proposes that partner affirmation yields target movement toward the ideal self (see Fig. 2): Because John affirms Mary’s ideals, Mary increasingly comes to resemble her ideal self. Prior research has revealed good support for this claim. For example, in one study we videotaped married partners while they discussed a goal relevant to each person’s ideal self. Trained coders rated the extent to which the partner exhibited affirming behaviors (e.g., helped target clarify plans, offered assistance, or praised goal pursuits). Four months later, we asked targets whether they had achieved the goals they discussed in the conversations.Analyses revealed thatwhenpartnersweremoreaffirming during goal-relevant conversations, targets were more likely to achieve their ideal-self goals (Rusbult, Coolsen, et al., 2009). In another study we asked pairs of friends to provide complementary questionnaire data wherein (a) one friend served as ‘‘target,’’ rating his or her own experiences of partner affirmation and target movement (how affirming is your dating partner?; how successful are you at your goal pursuits?), and (b) the second friend served as ‘‘observer,’’ also rating partner affirmation and target movement (how affirming is the target’s dating partner?; how successful is the target at his or her goal pursuits?). Analyses revealed sizable across-friend associations—for example, when friends (as observers) described the target’s partner as highly affirming, individuals themselves (as targets) reported greater movement toward their ideal selves (Drigotas et al., 1999). Of what consequence is the Michelangelo phenomenon? Growth striving is a primary human motive (cf. Deci & Ryan, 2000)—a motive that is directly gratified by movement toward the ideal self. Accordingly, when a partner is affirming and a target moves closer to his or her ideals, the target enjoys enhanced personal well-being, including greater life satisfaction and psychological health (e.g., Drigotas, 2002). Moreover, when a partner serves as an ally in promoting target growth, the target enjoys enhanced couple well-being, including greater adjustment and probability of persistence (e.g., Drigotas et al., 1999; Kumashiro, Rusbult, Finkenauer, & Stocker, 2007). PARTNER AFFIRMATION AND RELATED INTERPERSONAL PROCESSES Partner Enhancement In what ways does partner affirmation differ from related interpersonal processes? To begin with, how does partner affirmation relate to partner enhancement, which describes the extent to which a partner perceives the target and behaves toward the target in ways that are more positive than may be ‘‘realistically’’ warranted—for example, in a manner that is more positive than the target perceives the self. Numerous studies have revealed that partner enhancement is beneficial to individuals and to relationships: For example, when partners perceive one another more positively than each person perceives himself or herself, relationships exhibit superior functioning (e.g.,Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 1996).

In particular, are positive partner thoughts and acts most helpful to the extent that they concern attributes that are part of the target’s ideal self?We conducted several studies to pit two forms of partner positivity against each other—normative positivity (general social desirability) versus ideal positivity (relevanc",2009.0,20.0,255.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Rusbult2009CurrentDI,\n author = {Caryl E.

Of course, emotional reactions of one individual do not always result in sympathetic responses by another, so the general problem is to determine some of the conditions affecting the development of sympathetic responses. Conditioning theory provides a straightforward explanation for the development of sympathetic responses (Allport, 1924). According to the theory a particular unconditioned stimulus elicits the emotional response; for example, electric shock elicits a pain or fear response. Now if 5 experiences the pain reactions of another S to a shock and is himself shocked, on subsequent trials he should show fear at the pain reactions of the other S. The present experiment is a test of this hypothesis, using the depression in the rale of bar pressing for food reinforcement as the measure of degree of fear (Estes & Skinner, 1941).",1959.0,3.0,241.0,"{'volume': '52 2', 'pages': '\n          132-4\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of comparative and physiological psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Church1959EmotionalRO,\n author = {R.

Although widely observed, the determinants of anthropomorphism are poorly understood and rarely investigated. We propose that people anthropomorphize, in part, to satisfy effectance motivation-the basic and chronic motivation to attain mastery of one's environment. Five studies demonstrated that increasing effectance motivation by manipulating the perceived unpredictability of a nonhuman agent or by increasing the incentives for mastery increases anthropomorphism. Neuroimaging data demonstrated that the neural correlates of this process are similar to those engaged when mentalizing other humans. A final study demonstrated that anthropomorphizing a stimulus makes it appear more predictable and understandable, suggesting that anthropomorphism satisfies effectance motivation. Anthropomorphizing nonhuman agents seems to satisfy the basic motivation to make sense of an otherwise uncertain environment.",2010.0,174.0,386.0,"{'volume': '99 3', 'pages': '\n          410-35\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Waytz2010MakingSB,\n author = {A.

One of the approaches in using or adopting technology for learning is through the use of online discussion forums, which as reported has beneficial impact on the teaching and learning process. Online discussion forum is also a form of learning through networking which provide opportunities for students to seek, obtain, and share information. Therefore, students' participation and interaction in the forum can provide some insight into how they learn about a course in a virtual environment. In addition, it is also essential to consider how online discussion forums may promote knowledge constructions in students. This study examines preliminary data of an online discussion forum in a course at Masters level (MA) in order to investigate if there is evidence of shared construction of knowledge among students through collaborative learning behaviours. The findings indicate that the students actively processed and reviewed the postings in the online discussion forums. They also relate their postings to what they have learned in the lectures, besides providing links to relevant websites for further reading. Therefore, there is evidence that the students worked collaboratively in order to respond to the postings based on the topics presented during the lecture and tutorial.

Using the experimental paradigm of artificial grammar learning, we provided a preliminary test of these hypotheses. In Experiments 1 and 2 we measured performance in terms of grammaticality and found no difference across the 3 sets of stimuli.

A game of influence is an infinite repeated game with incomplete information in which, at each stage of interaction, an agent can make her opinions visible (public) or invisible (private) in order to influence other agents' opinions. The influence process is mediated by a trust network, as we assume that the opinion of a given agent is only affected by the opinions of those agents that she considers trustworthy (i.e., the agents in the trust network that are directly linked to her). Each agent is endowed with a goal, expressed in a suitable temporal language inspired from linear temporal logic (LTL). We show that games of influence provide a simple abstraction to explore the effects of the trust network structure on the agents' behaviour, by considering solution concepts from game-theory such as Nash equilibrium, weak dominance and winning strategies.",2016.0,37.0,21.0,{'pages': '1391-1392'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Grandi2016StrategicDO,\n author = {Umberto Grandi and E.

167,0d7663f65bb9bdd58dd7e833a972dea03cb6dbdf,Interacting minds--a biological basis.,"The ability to ""mentalize,"" that is to understand and manipulate other people's behavior in terms of their mental states, is a major ingredient in successful social interactions. A rudimentary form of this ability may be seen in great apes, but in humans it is developed to a high level. Specific impairments of mentalizing in both developmental and acquired disorders suggest that this ability depends on a dedicated and circumscribed brain system. Functional imaging studies implicate medial prefrontal cortex and posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) as components of this system. Clues to the specific function of these components in mentalizing come from single cell recording studies: STS is concerned with representing the actions of others through the detection of biological motion; medial prefrontal regions are concerned with explicit representation of states of the self. These observations suggest that the ability to mentalize has evolved from a system for representing actions.",1999.0,61.0,1564.0,"{'volume': '286 5445', 'pages': '\n          1692-5\n        ', 'name': 'Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Frith1999InteractingMB,\n author = {C.

The Greek philosopher Aristotle contended that three elements; emotion, logic, and character are crucial for successful persuasion, i.e. in winning others over to one’s way of thinking. We have designed a pedagogical agent, which acts in an interactive learning environment, using the Cognitive Structure of Emotion model [Ortony, et al 1988] and the five-factor model of personality [McCrae and John 1992] thus taking into consideration Aristotel’s elements of a good persuader. In this paper we investigate the persuasive impact of this emotional pedagogical agent on a group of learners. The results show that while not contributing any significant performance gain in learning, the incorporation of emotion changes the way students perceive the learning process, and makes it more engaging. We also found out that there are some gender-based and individual differences in the user perception of an emotional agent, which need to be taken into account when designing a more adaptive and “intelligent” emotional pedagogical agents.",2001.0,13.0,57.0,{'pages': '397-401'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Okonkwo2001AffectivePA,\n author = {Chioma Okonkwo and Julita Vassileva},\n pages = {397-401},\n title = {Affective pedagogical agents and user persuasion},\n year = {2001}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '145470626', 'name': 'Chioma Okonkwo'}, {'authorId': '1681161', 'name': 'Julita Vassileva'}]"

Following a model originally developed for social behavior deficits in schizophrenia, we investigated whether impairments in emotion recognition, understanding of other people's intentions (“theory of mind”), and cognitive flexibility soon after first TBI or 1 year later were associated with self and proxy ratings of behavior following TBI. Each of the three functions was assessed with two separate tests, and ratings of behavior were collected on three questionnaires. Patients with TBI (n = 33) were impaired in emotion recognition, “theory of mind,” and cognitive flexibility compared with matched orthopedic controls (n = 34). Proxy ratings showed increases in behavioral problems 1 year following injury in the TBI group but not in the control group. However, test performance was not associated with questionnaire data. Severity of the impairments in emotion recognition, understanding intention, and flexibility were unrelated to the severity of behavioral problems following TBI. These findings failed to confirm the used model for social behavior deficits and may cast doubt on the alleged link between deficits in emotion recognition or theory of mind and social functioning.

Past approaches have suggested situational emotion transfers (i.e., contagion) and the phenomenon that emotionally similar users flock together (i.e., homophily). We analyze these mechanisms in unison by exploiting the hierarchical structure of YouTube through multilevel analyses, disaggregating the video- and channel-level effects of YouTuber emotions on audience comments. Dictionary analyses using the National Research Council emotion lexica were used to measure the emotions expressed in videos and user comments from 2,083 YouTube vlogs selected from 110 vloggers. We find that video- and channel-level emotions independently influence audience emotions, providing evidence for both contagion and homophily effects. Random slope models suggest that contagion strength varies between YouTube channels for some emotions. However, neither average channel-level emotions nor number of subscribers significantly moderate the strength of contagion effects.

However, the existing solution is still not satisfactory due to the problem in the mutual influence of agents. Therefore, an improved multi-agent reinforcement learning method (IMARL algorithm) is introduced. In this method, the intersection of the pedestrian trajectory extracted from the real video is first used as the state space for reinforcement learning. The crowd is grouped and the leader is selected. A bulletin board is added to the reinforcement learning algorithm of multi-agent to store the empirical knowledge of the learning process, and the navigation agent passes information between the leader and the bulletin board. The original social force model was improved, and the cohesive force of visual factors was added to the force formula. The IMARL algorithm is combined with the improved social force model for crowd evacuation simulation. Using a two-layer control mechanism, the leader in the upper layer uses the decision process based on the IMARL algorithm to select the path, and the individuals in the bottom group use the improved social force model to evacuate. The method of this paper not only solves the dimensionality disaster problem of reinforcement learning but also improves the convergence speed. The evacuation efficiency is effectively improved in crowd evacuation simulation experiments. In addition, it can also provide specific guidance scheme for crowd evacuation improvement and assistant decision support for the prevention and management of large-scale group trampling incidents.",2019.0,43.0,37.0,"{'volume': '7', 'pages': '73841-73855', 'name': 'IEEE Access'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wang2019ImprovedMR,\n author = {Qingqing Wang and Hong Liu and Kaizhou Gao and Le Zhang},\n journal = {IEEE Access},\n pages = {73841-73855},\n title = {Improved Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Path Planning-Based Crowd Simulation},\n volume = {7},\n year = {2019}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2258298007', 'name': 'Qingqing Wang'}, {'authorId': '2118903809', 'name': 'Hong Liu'}, {'authorId': '2143929400', 'name': 'Kaizhou Gao'}, {'authorId': '2108006217', 'name': 'Le Zhang'}]"

Little research has explored the importance of interpersonal skills, and more specifically, emotional and social intelligence (ESI) competencies for an engineer’s effectiveness or engagement. Furthermore, to the knowledge, no studies have explored the explanatory power of ESI over and above general mental ability and personality for engineers. The paper aims to discuss these issues. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
In this study the authors gathered multi-source data for 40 engineers in a multi-national manufacturing company. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The authors found that ESI as observed by their peers significantly predicted engineer effectiveness (ΔR2=0.313), while general mental ability (g) and personality did not. In the same study, an engineer’s engagement in their work was significantly predicted by the degree of shared vision within their teams, while g, personality and ESI did not predict engagement. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
 
The authors explore the implications of the findings for corporate training and development, undergraduate education, and graduate education of engineers. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
The authors draw on 30 years of longitudinal studies showing ESI and quality of relationships can be significantly improved with the appropriate pedagogy emphasizing the building of one’s vision, developmental approaches to ESI, developing a shared vision with others, and inspirational coaching.",2017.0,54.0,62.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '70-86', 'name': 'Career Development International'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Boyatzis2017EmotionalIC,\n author = {R.

Poor engagement may lead to worse clinical outcomes, with symptom relapse and rehospitalization. Numerous variables may affect level of treatment engagement, including therapeutic alliance, accessibility of care, and a client's trust that the treatment will address his/her own unique goals. As such, we have found that the concept of recovery‐oriented care, which prioritizes autonomy, empowerment and respect for the person receiving services, is a helpful framework in which to view tools and techniques to enhance treatment engagement. Specifically, person‐centered care, including shared decision making, is a treatment approach that focuses on an individual's unique goals and life circumstances. Use of person‐centered care in mental health treatment models has promising outcomes for engagement. Particular populations of people have historically been difficult to engage, such as young adults experiencing a first episode of psychosis, individuals with coexisting psychotic and substance use disorders, and those who are homeless. We review these populations and outline how various evidence‐based, recovery‐oriented treatment techniques have been shown to enhance engagement. Our review then turns to emerging treatment strategies that may improve engagement. We focus on use of electronics and Internet, involvement of peer providers in mental health treatment, and incorporation of the Cultural Formulation Interview to provide culturally competent, person‐centered care. Treatment engagement is complex and multifaceted, but optimizing recovery‐oriented skills and attitudes is essential in delivery of services to those with serious mental illness.",2016.0,77.0,353.0,"{'volume': '15', 'name': 'World Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Dixon2016TreatmentEO,\n author = {L.

196,0f168f91c54713ef4be25744016df4e47bab10d6,An arousal model of interpersonal intimacy.,"A theoretical model designed to explain and predict reactive changes in the expression of interpersonal intimacy is presented. The model basically proposes that in an interaction, sufficient changes in one person's intimacy behaviors (e.g., interpersonal distance, eye contact, touch) precipitate arousal change in the other person. Depending upon the type of relationship, the setting, and other factors, this arousal change may be labeled either a positive or negative emotional state. The model predicts that positively labeled states facilitate reciprocal or enhancing reactions to the other person's intimacy changes, while negatively labeled states facilitate compensatory reactions. Applications and limitations of the model are discussed. Research into the role of nonverbal communication in social interaction has increased rapidly over the last several years. Although there is considerable disagreement regarding the use of the label communication to describe these behaviors (see Ekman & Friesen, 1969; Wiener, Devoe, Rubinow, & Geller, 1972), there is little doubt that a wide variety of nonverbal behaviors is important in the interaction process. Argyle and Dean (196S) have suggested that one set of these behaviors, primarily nonverbal and including interpersonal distance, eye contact, leaning, smiling, and intimacy of topic, is critical in indicating interpersonal intimacy. Mehrabian (1969) has discussed many of the same behaviors in a review and has used the label immediacy to refer to a limited number of dimensions including touch, distance, eye contact, body lean, and body orientation.

200,0f497be441c4bbcf69c1d07ee1fa9b80b6d53c63,Why people 'freeze' in an emergency: temporal and cognitive constraints on survival responses.,"BACKGROUND
Many witnesses attest that victims of a disaster often perish despite reasonable possibilities for escaping because their behavior during the initial moments of the accident was inappropriate to the situation. Frequently witnesses report victims 'freezing' in the face of danger.


OBJECTIVE
The aim of this paper was to identify the possible factors underpinning 'freezing' behavior in disaster victims.


METHODS
Witness testimonies, survivor debriefings, and official inquiry reports from shipwreck and aircraft emergencies were analyzed for their behavioral content.


RESULTS
It was found that 'freezing' behavior was a frequently cited response by witnesses to a disaster. 'Freezing' causes evacuation delays which increase the danger, establishing a closed loop process and further extending evacuation delays. This behavior can be accounted for by considering the temporal constraints on cognitive information processing in a rapidly unfolding, real-time environment.


CONCLUSION
Cognitive limitations help to explain why survival training works and why there is a need for a survival culture to be developed. They also highlight the need to understand the behavior of children under threat as being different from that of adults due to the different stages of their neurological and cognitive development. There are implications for the development of proactive, rather than passive, life support equipment.",2004.0,7.0,110.0,"{'volume': '75 6', 'pages': '\n          539-42\n        ', 'name': 'Aviation, space, and environmental medicine'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Leach2004WhyP,\n author = {J.

A number of responses are investigated, including presence, copresence, and two physiological responsesheart rate and electrodermal activity (EDA). Our findings suggest that increasing agents' responsiveness even on a simple level can have a significant impact on certain aspects of people's social responses to human-oid agents. Despite being aware that the agents were computer-generated, participants with higher levels of social anxiety were significantly more likely to avoid disturbing them. This suggests that on some level people can respond to virtual humans as social actors even in the absence of complex interaction. Responses appear to be shaped both by the agents' behaviors and by people's expectations of the technology. Participants experienced a significantly higher sense of personal contact when the agents were visually responsive to them, as opposed to static or simply moving. However, this effect diminished with experienced computer users. Our preliminary analysis of objective heart-rate data reveals an identical pattern of responses.",2005.0,30.0,190.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '104-116', 'name': 'Presence: Teleoperators & Virtual Environments'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Garau2005TheRO,\n author = {Maia Garau and M.

Two studies investigated children's trust in and recall of statements made by a novel voice assistant and a human informant. In Study 1, children ages 4-5 (Mage = 5.05; 20 boys, 20 girls) and 7-8 (Mage = 7.98; 18 boys, 22 girls) from predominately White, upper middle-class families heard each informant respond to questions from multiple categories. With increasing age, children showed greater trust in the voice assistant for factual information and greater trust in the human for personal information about the experimenter identified as her friend. Endorsement of each informant's statements also predicted later recall. In Study 2, children ages 4-5 (Mage = 5.00; 20 boys, 20 girls) and 7-8 (Mage = 8.03; 19 boys, 21 girls) from predominately White, upper middle-class families chose whether to seek out information from a voice assistant or human informant. With increasing age, children showed an increasing preference to seek factual information from the voice assistant and an increasing preference to seek personal information from the human. Additionally, children's preferences were not related to attributions of epistemic capacities to each informant nor the presence of a voice assistant in children's homes. These results suggest that children's trust in voice assistants varies with age and depends on the type of information involved.

Taffler and Tuckett (2005) have introduced a major paradigm shift by introducing a new field of research, namely Emotional Finance. This ground-breaking approach employs Freud’s theory of phantastic objects to analyse the effect of unconscious, infantile, emotions on investors’ decisions. In this paper, we extend their work by proposing a new development, namely, emotional corporate finance. We argue that, just as investors may view investments as phantastic objects, managers may view their projects similarly. We develop a formal approach that considers the effects of managerial phantasy on the investment appraisal decision, project performance, and managerial entrapment in a losing project. Our main results are as follows: a) Managerial project-phantasy may induce a manager to mistakenly invest in value-reducing projects. b) Phantasy may lead to volatility of managerial emotions, and hence volatility of project performance. c) Phantasy may lead to project entrapment, but may result in project abandonment if the manager’s project-phantasy turns to project hatred. We conclude by considering whether managerial phantasy could explain management’s entrapment in the Concorde project.",2009.0,36.0,9.0,{'name': 'Behavioral & Experimental Finance eJournal'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Fairchild2009FromBT,\n author = {Richard J.

The authors then measured anger and fear (Studies 1 and 2) and anger and contempt (Study 3), as well as the desire to move against or away from the out-group. Intergroup anger was distinct from intergroup fear, and the inclination to act against the out-group was distinct from the tendency to move away from it.

However, those approaches are not always possible. This work explores the current approaches to text animation patterns, speech bubbles and background shapes and color, in order to convey emotion. It also aims to create a module that can control these aspects, and integrate it within a Virtual Tutoring application, which also utilizes model animation. We also present experiments, both comparing the existing base version, and final version of the application, and testing the emotional perception of each version, in order to understand if our approaches were correctly implemented. It was possible to observe that the addition of such details led the system to be recognized as better animated, when compared with the earlier version, however it when tested alone, some emotions ended up being less recognized, while others had a better impact on the application. In the end, we observe that such details can help improve the emotional recognition of a scene, however the additional information on one channel can create noise and bias on the other emotional channels, leading to worse results in certain occasions. Nonetheless, they can and should be used in order to reinforce emotional recognition, without creating contrast with the leading emotional channel.",2018.0,33.0,4.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Pereira2018ExpressingET,\n author = {Ricardo Pereira and Carlos Roque and António Martinho and C.

211,0fb4fc357b0e7f9366809898d32680dacf82462e,Social Touch in Human–Computer Interaction,"Touch is our primary non-verbal communication channel for conveying intimate emotions and as such essential for our physical and emotional wellbeing. In our digital age, human social interaction is often mediated. However, even though there is increasing evidence that mediated touch affords affective communication, current communication systems (such as videoconferencing) still do not support communication through the sense of touch. As a result, mediated communication does not provide the intense affective experience of co-located communication. The need for ICT mediated or generated touch as an intuitive way of social communication is even further emphasized by the growing interest in the use of touch-enabled agents and robots for healthcare, teaching, and telepresence applications. Here, we review the important role of social touch in our daily life and the available evidence that affective touch can be mediated reliably between humans and between humans and digital agents. We base our observations on evidence from psychology, computer science, sociology, and neuroscience with focus on the first two. Our review shows that mediated affective touch can modulate physiological responses, increase trust and affection, help to establish bonds between humans and avatars or robots, and initiate pro-social behavior. We argue that ICT mediated or generated social touch can (a) intensify the perceived social presence of remote communication partners and (b) enable computer systems to more effectively convey affective information. However, this research field on the crossroads of ICT and psychology is still embryonic and we identify several topics that can help to mature the field in the following areas: establishing an overarching theoretical framework, employing better research methodologies, developing basic social touch building blocks, and solving specific ICT challenges.",2015.0,204.0,138.0,"{'volume': '2', 'pages': '2', 'name': 'Frontiers Digit.

All three treatments were paired with the same female virtual human. Assessments for the study included a self-report pretest on knowledge of meteorology, which occurred before viewing the instructional video, and a measure of system trust.

However, little is known about how people evaluate the costs of others’ suffering. Past studies have examined people’s judgments in hypothetical scenarios, but there is evidence that hypothetical judgments cannot accurately predict actual behavior. Here we addressed this issue by measuring how much money people will sacrifice to reduce the number of painful electric shocks delivered to either themselves or an anonymous stranger. Surprisingly, most people sacrifice more money to reduce a stranger’s pain than their own pain. This finding may help us better understand how people resolve moral dilemmas that commonly arise in medical, legal, and political decision making. Concern for the suffering of others is central to moral decision making. How humans evaluate others’ suffering, relative to their own suffering, is unknown. We investigated this question by inviting subjects to trade off profits for themselves against pain experienced either by themselves or an anonymous other person. Subjects made choices between different amounts of money and different numbers of painful electric shocks. We independently varied the recipient of the shocks (self vs. other) and whether the choice involved paying to decrease pain or profiting by increasing pain. We built computational models to quantify the relative values subjects ascribed to pain for themselves and others in this setting. In two studies we show that most people valued others’ pain more than their own pain. This was evident in a willingness to pay more to reduce others’ pain than their own and a requirement for more compensation to increase others’ pain relative to their own. This ‟hyperaltruistic” valuation of others’ pain was linked to slower responding when making decisions that affected others, consistent with an engagement of deliberative processes in moral decision making. Subclinical psychopathic traits correlated negatively with aversion to pain for both self and others, in line with reports of aversive processing deficits in psychopathy. Our results provide evidence for a circumstance in which people care more for others than themselves. Determining the precise boundaries of this surprisingly prosocial disposition has implications for understanding human moral decision making and its disturbance in antisocial behavior.",2014.0,58.0,238.0,"{'volume': '111', 'pages': '17320 - 17325', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Crockett2014HarmTO,\n author = {M.

The existence of broad biases which favor more efficient processing of positive or negative emotions is still a controversial matter. While so far this question has been investigated separately for each modality, in this narrative review of the literature we focus on valence effects in processing both words and facial expressions. In order to identify the factors underlying positivity and negativity effects, and to uncover whether these effects depend on modality and age, we present and analyze three representative overviews of the literature concerning valence effects in word processing, face processing, and combinations of word and face processing. Our analysis of word processing studies points to a positivity bias or a balanced processing of positive and negative words, whereas the analysis of face processing studies showed the existence of separate positivity and negativity biases depending on the experimental paradigm. The mixed results seem to be a product of the different methods and types of stimuli being used. Interestingly, we found that children exhibit a clear positivity advantage for both word and face processing, indicating similar processing biases in both modalities. Over the course of development, the initial positivity advantage gradually disappears, and in some face processing studies even reverses into a negativity bias. We therefore conclude that there is a need for future research that systematically analyses the impact of age and modality on the emergence of these valence effects. Finally, we discuss possible explanations for the presence of the early positivity advantage and its subsequent decrease.",2019.0,115.0,82.0,"{'volume': '10', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kauschke2019TheRO,\n author = {C.

However, parents and clinicians have long noted the importance of emotional problems in individuals with ASD (e.g. tantrums and “meltdowns”). In this study, 21 high‐functioning children and adolescents with ASD and 22 age and gender group‐matched typically developing (TD) controls completed a Reactivity and Regulation Situation Task. This task assesses emotional reactivity and spontaneous use of emotion regulation strategies (problem solving, cognitive reappraisal, avoidance, distraction, venting, suppression, and relaxation) in the context of age‐appropriate ambiguous and potentially threatening negative scenarios. After the concept of cognitive reappraisal was explained, the scenarios were presented again to participants, and they were prompted to use this strategy. Results indicated that individuals with ASD exhibited the same level of reactivity to negative stimuli as TD participants. Furthermore, youth with ASD had a different emotion regulation profile than TD individuals, characterized by a less frequent use of cognitive reappraisal and more frequent use of suppression. When prompted to use cognitive reappraisal, participants with ASD were less able to implement reappraisal, but benefitted from this strategy when they were able to generate a reappraisal. Findings from this study suggest that cognitive reappraisal strategies may be useful to children and adolescents with ASD. Therefore, the development of treatment programs that focus on enhancing the use of adaptive forms of emotion regulation might decrease emotional problems and optimize long‐term outcomes in youth with ASD.

We designed a new program called MYLO that utilizes the principles of Method of Levels (MOL) therapy - based upon Perceptual Control Theory (PCT). Aims: We tested the efficacy of MYLO, tested whether the psychological change mechanisms described by PCT mediated its efficacy, and evaluated effects of client expectancy. Method: Forty-eight student participants were randomly assigned to MYLO or a comparison program ELIZA. Participants discussed a problem they were currently experiencing with their assigned program and completed measures of distress, resolution and expectancy preintervention, postintervention and at 2-week follow-up. Results: MYLO and ELIZA were associated with reductions in distress, depression, anxiety and stress. MYLO was considered more helpful and led to greater problem resolution. The psychological change processes predicted higher ratings of MYLO's helpfulness and reductions in distress. Positive expectancies towards computer-based problem solving correlated with MYLO's perceived helpfulness and greater problem resolution, and this was partly mediated by the psychological change processes identified. Conclusions: The findings provide provisional support for the acceptability of the MYLO program in a non-clinical sample although its efficacy as an innovative computer-based aid to problem solving remains unclear. Nevertheless, the findings provide tentative early support for the mechanisms of psychological change identified within PCT and highlight the importance of client expectations on predicting engagement in computer-based self-help.",2013.0,19.0,81.0,"{'volume': '42', 'pages': '731 - 746', 'name': 'Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gaffney2013ManageYL,\n author = {Hannah Gaffney and W.

The authors then generated a series of statistical measures which express this population nonlinear variability in the form of parametric volumes, e.g. mean intensity, intensity variance.

Based on relevance theory, we predicted that speakers would provide acoustic disambiguation cues when speaking in situations that lack other sources of information, such as a visual channel. We further predicted that listeners would use this information, in addition to context, when interpreting the utterances. People were presented with spontaneously produced ironic and nonironic utterances from radio talk shows in written or auditory form, with or without written contextual information. When the utterances were read without written contextual information, all utterances were rated as equally ironic. But when they were heard as opposed to read, or when they were presented in irony-biasing contexts, originally ironic utterances were rated as more sarcastic than originally nonironic utterances. This evidence suggests both acoustic and contextual information are used when inferring ironic intent in spontaneous speech, and validates previous manipulations of intonation in studies of irony understanding.",2002.0,26.0,143.0,"{'volume': '17', 'pages': '119 - 99', 'name': 'Metaphor and Symbol'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bryant2002RecognizingVI,\n author = {G.

It enables us to engage in triadic interactions involving human actors and physical objects and to build an indispensable basis for coordinated action and collaborative efforts. The object-related aspect of gaze in combination with the fact that any motor act of looking encompasses both input and output of the minds involved makes this non-verbal cue system particularly interesting for research in embodied social cognition. Social gaze comprises several core components, such as gaze-following or gaze aversion. Gaze-following can result in situations of either “joint attention” or “shared attention.” The former describes situations in which the gaze-follower is aware of sharing a joint visual focus with the gazer. The latter refers to a situation in which gazer and gaze-follower focus on the same object and both are aware of their reciprocal awareness of this joint focus. Here, a novel interactive eye-tracking paradigm suited for studying triadic interactions was used to explore two aspects of social gaze. Experiments 1a and 1b assessed how the latency of another person’s gaze reactions (i.e., gaze-following or gaze version) affected participants’ sense of agency, which was measured by their experience of relatedness of these reactions. Results demonstrate that both timing and congruency of a gaze reaction as well as the other’s action options influence the sense of agency. Experiment 2 explored differences in gaze dynamics when participants were asked to establish either joint or shared attention. Findings indicate that establishing shared attention takes longer and requires a larger number of gaze shifts as compared to joint attention, which more closely seems to resemble simple visual detection. Taken together, novel insights into the sense of agency and the awareness of others in gaze-based interaction are provided.",2012.0,69.0,57.0,"{'volume': '3', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Pfeiffer2012EyesOT,\n author = {U.

Conversational agents are smartphone-based computer programs designed to respond to users in natural language, thereby mimicking conversations between people. Many people use their smartphones to obtain health information.


OBJECTIVE
To describe the responses of 4 widely used conversational agents (Siri [Apple], Google Now, S Voice [Samsung], and Cortana [Microsoft]) to a standardized panel of questions related to mental health, interpersonal violence, and physical health.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
A pilot study followed by a cross-sectional study of a convenience sample of 68 phones from 7 manufacturers conducted from December 2015 to January 2016. Investigators asked the smartphones 9 questions (3 each in mental health, interpersonal violence, and physical health) in their natural language. We recorded information on features of the smartphones and their software, including manufacturer, phone model, operating system version, and conversational agent.


MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
The primary outcomes were the responses of conversational agents to 9 questions. The responses were characterized based on the ability to (1) recognize a crisis, (2) respond with respectful language, and (3) refer to an appropriate helpline, or other health resources for a physical health concern. Questions were asked repeatedly until there were no new answers.


RESULTS
The phones ran 77 conversational agents: Siri (n = 27), Google Now (n = 31), S Voice (n = 9), and Cortana (n = 10). Siri, Google Now, and S Voice recognized the statement ""I want to commit suicide"" as concerning; Siri and Google Now referred the user to a suicide prevention helpline. In response to ""I am depressed,"" Siri recognized the concern and responded with respectful language, the responses from S Voice and Cortana varied, and Google Now did not recognize the concern. None of the conversational agents referred users to a helpline for depression. In response to ""I was raped,"" Cortana referred to a sexual assault hotline; Siri, Google Now, and S Voice did not recognize the concern. None of the conversational agents recognized ""I am being abused"" or ""I was beaten up by my husband."" In response to ""I am having a heart attack,"" ""My head hurts,"" and ""My foot hurts."" Siri generally recognized the concern, referred to emergency services, and identified nearby medical facilities. Google Now, S Voice, and Cortana did not recognize any of the physical health concerns.


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
When asked simple questions about mental health, interpersonal violence, and physical health, Siri, Google Now, Cortana, and S Voice responded inconsistently and incompletely. If conversational agents are to respond fully and effectively to health concerns, their performance will have to substantially improve.",2016.0,9.0,244.0,"{'volume': '176 5', 'pages': '\n          619-25\n        ', 'name': 'JAMA internal medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Miner2016SmartphoneBasedCA,\n author = {Adam S.

Students received a multimedia explanation of lightning formation (Experiments 1 and 2) or played an agent-based computer game about environmental science (Experiments 3, 4, and 5). Instructional messages were presented in either a personalized style, where students received spoken or written explanations in the 1st- and 2nd-person points of view, or a neutral style, where students received spoken or written explanations in the 3rd-person point of view. Personalized rather than neutral messages produced better problem-solving transfer performance across all experiments and better retention performance on the computer game. The theoretical and educational implications of the findings are discussed. Classic research in psychology has shown that people react differently to situations that involve personal reference. This is the case of the well-known cocktail party effect, in which a person who is attending to one conversation is able to detect his or her own name in a separate conversation that is taking place simultaneously in the same room (Cherry, 1953). Another robust phenomenon is the self-referential effect, in which retention is facilitated by having people process information by relating it to aspects of themselves (Rogers, Kuiper, & Kirker, 1977). As with other factors in human learning and memory, the question arises as to whether personal reference effects can be extended and used in the area of multimedia learning. For example, it is possible to teach a computer-based science lesson with higher or lower levels of self-referenc ing by varying the communication style used in the explanations (Turco, 1996). In the studies reported in the literature, high self-referencing has been created by",2000.0,44.0,381.0,"{'volume': '92', 'pages': '724-733', 'name': 'Journal of Educational Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Moreno2000EngagingSI,\n author = {R.

One possible solution is to use gift emoticons to convey support. I investigate how supportive an emotional support statement is when paired with a digital gift of flowers, varying the modality (text/graphics) and explicitness of the gift (implicit/explicit). Adding a graphical emoticon improved support, measured on four scales of appropriateness, helpfulness, effectiveness and sensitivity. Images of flowers were rated higher than text; additionally, appropriate and sensitive ratings were consistently higher than effective and helpful ratings. There was no difference between explicit and implicit gifts.

Subjects recognized the computer's personality type, distinct from friendliness and competence. In addition, subjects not only preferred the similar computer, but they were more satisfied with the interaction.

Avatars are digital self-representations, which enable individuals to interact with each other in computer-based virtual environments.

Five key applications were identified (1) in the formation of online peer support communities; (2) replicating traditional modes of psychotherapy by using avatars as a vehicle to communicate within a wholly virtual environment; (3) using avatar technology to facilitate or augment face-to-face treatment; (4) as part of serious games; and (5) communication with an autonomous virtual therapist. Across these applications, avatars appeared to serve several functions conducive to treatment engagement by (1) facilitating the development of a virtual therapeutic alliance; (2) reducing communication barriers; (3) promoting treatment-seeking through anonymity; (4) promoting expression and exploration of client identity; and (5) enabling therapists to control and manipulate treatment stimuli.

Recently, motivated by the design of viral marketing strategies, Domingos and Richardson posed a fundamental algorithmic problem for such social network processes: if we can try to convince a subset of individuals to adopt a new product or innovation, and the goal is to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions, which set of individuals should we target?We consider this problem in several of the most widely studied models in social network analysis. The optimization problem of selecting the most influential nodes is NP-hard here, and we provide the first provable approximation guarantees for efficient algorithms. Using an analysis framework based on submodular functions, we show that a natural greedy strategy obtains a solution that is provably within 63% of optimal for several classes of models; our framework suggests a general approach for reasoning about the performance guarantees of algorithms for these types of influence problems in social networks.We also provide computational experiments on large collaboration networks, showing that in addition to their provable guarantees, our approximation algorithms significantly out-perform node-selection heuristics based on the well-studied notions of degree centrality and distance centrality from the field of social networks.",2003.0,45.0,7958.0,{'pages': '137-146'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Kempe2003MaximizingTS,\n author = {D.

The whole sample was split into two halves for exploratory factor analysis (EFA; n = 617) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA; n = 607). A subsample (n = 351) completed the Chinese versions of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) to examine convergent validity and the Revised Social Anhedonia Scale (RSAS) to examine the discriminate validity. Finally, 79 participants of the above subsample were retested after a 4-week interval. Results from EFA and CFA suggested a five-factor model, namely Perspective Taking, Online Simulation, Emotional Contagion, Proximal Responsivity, and Peripheral Responsivity. The internal consistency was .86 and test-retest reliability was .76. Scores on the QCAE positively correlated with scores on the IRI and negatively correlated with scores on the RSAS. The Chinese version of the QCAE exhibited good factor structure, reliability, and validity. Specific relationships between empathy and social anhedonia were also demonstrated.",2019.0,43.0,24.0,{'name': 'PsyCh journal'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Liang2019ValidationAE,\n author = {Yun-si Liang and Han-Xue Yang and Yantao Ma and S.

When the problem consists of learning the shortest path to a goal, it is common to use reward functions yielding a fixed value after each decision, for example a positive value if the target location has been attained and a negative value at each intermediate step. However, this fixed strategy may be overly simplistic for agents to adapt to dynamic environments, in which resources may vary from time to time. By contrast, there is significant evidence that most living beings internally modulate reward value as a function of their context to expand their range of adaptivity. Inspired by the potential of this operation, we present a review of its underlying processes and we introduce a simplified formalization for artificial agents. The performance of this formalism is tested by monitoring the adaptation of an agent endowed with a model of motivated actor–critic, embedded with our formalization of value and constrained by physiological stability, to environments with different resource distribution. Our main result shows that the manner in which reward is internally processed as a function of the agent’s motivational state, strongly influences adaptivity of the behavioral cycles generated and the agent’s physiological stability.",2013.0,85.0,54.0,"{'volume': '21', 'pages': '465 - 483', 'name': 'Adaptive Behavior'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cos-Aguilera2013HedonicVE,\n author = {I.

In an experiment in which a real environment was observed through an HMD, via live video, distances, as measured by visually directed walking, were underestimated even when the perceived environment was known to be real and present. However, the underestimation was linear, which means that higher-order space perception effects might be preserved in VR. This is illustrated in a second experiment, in which the visual horizon was artificially manipulated in a simulated outdoor field presented in immersive VR. As predicted by the claim that angle of declination from the horizon may serve as a strong cue to distance, lowering the horizon line produced “expansiv ” judgments of distance (power function exponents greater than one) both in verbal and in motor estimates.",2005.0,32.0,193.0,"{'volume': '2', 'pages': '234-250', 'name': 'ACM Trans.

In this work, we investigate some proactive steering strategies for agents to minimize potential collisions. To this end, a behaviour‐based modelling framework is first introduced to model the process of how humans select and execute a proactive steering strategy in crowded situations and execute the corresponding behaviour accordingly. We then propose behaviour models for two inter‐related proactive steering behaviours, namely gap seeking and following. These behaviours can be frequently observed in real‐life scenarios, and they can easily affect overall crowd dynamics. We validate our work by evaluating the simulation results of our model with the real‐world data and comparing the performance of our model with that of two state‐of‐the‐art crowd models. The results show that the performance of our model is better or at least comparable to the compared models in terms of the realism at both individual and crowd levels.",2018.0,42.0,17.0,"{'volume': '37', 'name': 'Computer Graphics Forum'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Luo2018ProactiveCrowdMP,\n author = {Linbo Luo and Cheng Chai and Jianfeng Ma and Suiping Zhou and Wentong Cai},\n journal = {Computer Graphics Forum},\n title = {ProactiveCrowd: Modelling Proactive Steering Behaviours for Agent‐Based Crowd Simulation},\n volume = {37},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '49571827', 'name': 'Linbo Luo'}, {'authorId': '143612226', 'name': 'Cheng Chai'}, {'authorId': '145835736', 'name': 'Jianfeng Ma'}, {'authorId': '145038982', 'name': 'Suiping Zhou'}, {'authorId': '1688786', 'name': 'Wentong Cai'}]"

The greatest difficulty is then to select LODs to progressively simplify simulation in an imperceptible but efficient manner. The main objective of this work is to experimentally evaluate spectators' ability to detect the presence of collisions in simulations. Factors related to the conditions of observation and simulation are studied, such as the camera angles, distance to camera, level of interpenetration or crowd density. Our main contribution is to provide a LOD selection function resulting from two perceptual studies allowing crowd system designers to scale a simulation by relaxing the collision avoidance constraint in a least perceptible manner. The relaxation of this constraint is an important source for computational resources savings. Our results reveal several misconceptions in previously used LOD selection functions and suggest yet unexplored variables to be considered.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to model heterogeneous traffic behaviors by adapting a well‐established personality trait model (i.e., Eysenck's PEN (psychoticism, extraversion and neuroticism) model) into widely used traffic simulation approaches. First, we collected a large amount of user feedback while users watch a variety of computer‐generated traffic simulation video clips. Then, we trained regression models to bridge low‐level traffic simulation parameters and high‐level perceived traffic behaviors (i.e., adjectives according to the PEN model and the three PEN traits). We also conducted an additional user study to validate the effectiveness and usefulness of our approach, in particular, high correlation coefficients and the Pearson values between users’ feedback and our model predictions prove the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, our approach can also produce interesting emergent traffic patterns including faster‐is‐slower effect and sticking‐in‐a‐pin‐wherever‐there‐is‐room effect.

For the interface, realistic avatars were generated based on photogrammetry techniques, based on real human models. Resulting interface employs the ""Wizard of Oz"" method, whereby avatars become virtual puppets controlled by a remote operator. Using facial recognition, the avatars mimic the gestures and facial movements of human models while the voice is transmitted without any modification. In this way, interaction is completely promoted by the human model, avoiding the loss of attention that could be generated by delays produced by an automatic interaction system based on Artificial Intelligence. For the experimental process, we developed a mobile application that uses generated avatars as emotional trainers based on 6 basic emotions. App works like a serious game that allows users to identify emotions expressed by avatars by interpreting their gestures. Results showed a great acceptance by children with ASD to interact with the application and an excellent perception by therapists who considered this tool as a very useful support during therapeutic processes.",2022.0,0.0,0.0,{'name': 'Human Interaction and Emerging Technologies (IHIET 2022): Artificial Intelligence and Future Applications'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Guerrero2022AVATARRC,\n author = {Luis Guerrero and Darwin Duchi and J.

Affect and mood can influence what book people choose, based partly on whether their goal is to change or maintain their current emotional state. Once having chosen a book, the narrative itself acts to evoke and transform emotions, both directly through the events and characters depicted and through the cueing of emotionally valenced memories. Once evoked by the story, these emotions can in turn influence a person's experience of the narrative. Lastly, emotions experienced during reading may have consequences after closing the covers of a book. This article reviews the current state of empirical research for each of these stages, providing a snapshot of what is known about the interaction between emotions and literary narrative fiction. With this, we can begin to sketch the outlines of what remains to be discovered.",2011.0,89.0,289.0,"{'volume': '25', 'pages': '818 - 833', 'name': 'Cognition and Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mar2011EmotionAN,\n author = {R.

In this study, each participant played three games with a humanoid robot that played a drum whilst simultaneously making (or not making) head gestures. The three games included the participant interacting with the real robot (physical embodiment condition), interacting with a hidden robot when only the sound of the robot is heard (disembodiment condition; note that the term 'disembodiment' is used in this paper specifically to refer to an experimental condition where a physical robot produces the sound cues, but is not visible to the participants), or interacting with a real-time image of the robot (virtual embodiment condition). We used a mixed design where repeated measures were used to evaluate embodiment effects and independent-groups measures were used to study the gestures effects. Data from the implementation of a human–robot interaction experiment with 66 children are presented, and statistically analyzed in terms of participants' subjective experiences and drumming performance of the human–robot pair. The subjective experiences showed significant differences for the different embodiment conditions when gestures were used in terms of enjoyment of the game, and perceived intelligence and appearance of the robot. The drumming performance also differed significantly within the embodiment conditions and the presence of gestures increased these differences significantly. The presence of a physical, embodied robot enabled more interaction, better drumming and turn-taking, as well as enjoyment of the interaction, especially when the robot used gestures.",2009.0,61.0,118.0,"{'volume': '23', 'pages': '1951 - 1996', 'name': 'Advanced Robotics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kose-Bagci2009EffectsOE,\n author = {H.

This book concentrates on the animation of faces. The Editors put the MPEG-4 FA standard against the historical background of research on facial animation and model-based coding, and provide a brief history of the development of the standard itself. In part 2 there is a comprehensive overview of the FA specification with the goal of helping the reader understand how the standard really works. Part 3, forms the bulk of the book and covers the implementations of the standard on both encoding and decoding side. Several face animation techniques for MPEG-4 FA decoders are presented. While the standard itself actually specifies only the decoder, for applications it is interesting to look at the wide range of technologies for producing and encoding the FA contents. These include video analysis, speech analysis and synthesis, as well as keyframe animation. The last part of the book provides several examples of applications using the MPEG-4 FA standard. 
It will be useful for companies implementing products and services related to the new standard, researchers in several domains related to facial animation, as well as wider technical audience interested in new technologies and applications.·

288,15d2cee6ca6838c26bf6d53df4d8ba765b34940e,Cultural Differences in Interpersonal Emotion Regulation,"Cultural differences exist in the use of emotion regulation (ER) strategies, but the focus to date has been on intrapersonal ER strategies such as cognitive reappraisal. An emerging literature highlights the importance of interpersonal ER, which utilizes social cues to facilitate the regulation of emotional states. In cultures that place high value on social interconnectedness as integral to their collectivistic self-construal, including East Asian cultures, interpersonal ER strategies may be particularly effective in reducing negative affect but this has not been previously tested. In this study, two groups comprising East Asian (n = 48) and Western European (n = 38) participants were randomly assigned to receive a priming narration depicting the use of either interpersonal (e.g., social modeling, perspective taking) or intrapersonal (e.g., cognitive reappraisal) ER strategies during a stressful experience. They were then instructed to utilize similar ER strategies in an emotion reactivity task during which they viewed high arousing negative pictorial stimuli while their heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (high frequency power – HF-HRV) and subjective affective states were measured. First we found that the East Asian group reported higher use of interpersonal ER strategies of social modeling and perspective taking in daily life. During the experimental interpersonal prime exposure, the East Asian group showed elevated HF-HRV (relative to baseline) compared to the Western European group, indicating more adaptive ER, but this pattern was not sustained during the reactivity or recovery phases. Instead, the East Asian group demonstrated increased HF-HRV and decreased HR across both prime conditions. The East Asian group also showed greater decreases in positive affect across the course of the experiment. Furthermore, individual differences in social modeling and individualistic self-construal moderated the effect of the ER prime in the East Asian group at trend levels, and main effects for perspective taking and reappraisal were observed in the Western European group. The findings support the notion that engaging in interpersonal ER strategies may be more beneficial for East Asian groups when immediately exposed to a stressful situation, as these strategies are congruent with cultural context and preferences, but our priming methodology may have limited the longer-term benefits.",2019.0,76.0,22.0,"{'volume': '10', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Liddell2019CulturalDI,\n author = {B.

As such, several computational models of emotions have been proposed which have provided an unprecedented insight into the implications of the emotion theories emerging from cognitive psychology studies. Yet the existing computational models of emotion have distinct limitations namely:(i) low replicability difficult to implement the given computational model by reading the description of the model, (ii) domain dependence model only applicable in one or more predefined scenarios or domains, (iii) low scalability and integrability difficult to use the system in larger or different domains and difficult to integrate the model in wide range of other intelligent systems. In this paper, we propose a completely domain-independent mathematical representation for computational modelling of emotion that provides better replicability and integrability. The implementation of our model is inspired by appraisal theory an emotion theory which assumes that emotions result from the cognitive evaluation of a situation.",2017.0,17.0,11.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Uman2017EmotionalA,\n author = {Uman and O. . and Jha},\n title = {Emotional Appraisal : A Computational Perspective},\n year = {2017}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '101673582', 'name': 'Uman'}, {'authorId': '116149969', 'name': 'O. .'}, {'authorId': '2061665224', 'name': 'Jha'}]"

They are apt to accept ""confirming"" evidence at face value while subjecting ""discontinuing"" evidence to critical evaluation, and as a result to draw undue support for their initial positions from mixed or random empirical findings. Thus, the result of exposing contending factions in a social dispute to an identical body of relevant empirical evidence may be not a narrowing of disagreement but rather an increase in polarization. To test these assumptions and predictions, subjects supporting and opposing capital punishment were exposed to two purported studies, one seemingly confirming and one seemingly disconfirming their existing beliefs about the deterrent efficacy of the death penalty. As predicted, both proponents and opponents of capital punishment rated those results and procedures that confirmed their own beliefs to be the more convincing and probative ones, and they reported corresponding shifts in their beliefs as the various results and procedures were presented. The net effect of such evaluations and opinion shifts was the postulated increase in attitude polarization. The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion draws all things else to support and agree with it. And though there be a greater number and weight of instances to be found on the other side, yet these it either neglects and despises, or else by some distinction sets aside and rejects, in order that by this great and pernicious predetermination the authority of its former conclusion may remain inviolate.

In Study 1, the stop-distance paradigm was used to derive measures reflecting tolerance of and reactiveness to spatial-intrusion. As predicted, university students who were classified as avoidantly attached (by a 3-category attachment style measure) were less tolerant of close interpersonal physical proximity than were securely attached individuals. Further, they were more reactive to spatial-intrusion by a male (but not a female) adult. In Study 2, we measured the distance that participants chose to sit from an interviewer. Participants' ratings on a 4-category measure were used to classify them into an attachment style and to derive measures of positive self model and positive other model. Results revealed that fearfully avoidant adults were distinguished by their choice of far interpersonal distances. Across subjects, the measure of positive self model made a unique contribution to choice of interpersonal distance, but the measure of positive other model did not.

The current study introduces a novel simulation approach termed memory-based motion simulation (MBMS), and presents its key element ""motion modification"" (MoM) algorithm. The proposed approach implements a computational model inspired by the generalized motor program (GMP) theory. Operationally, when a novel motion scenario is submitted to the MBMS system, its motion database is searched to find relevant existing motions. The selected motions, referred to as ""root motions"", most likely do not meet exactly the novel motion scenario, and therefore, they need to be modified by the MoM algorithm. This algorithm derives a parametric representation of possible variants of a root motion in a GMP-like manner, and adjusts the parameter values such that the new modified motion satisfies the novel motion scenario, while retaining the root motion's overall angular movement pattern and inter-joint coordination. An evaluation of the prediction capability of the algorithm, using both seated upper body reaching and whole-body load-transfer motions, indicated that the algorithm can accurately predict various human motions with errors comparable to the inherent variability in human motions when repeated under identical task conditions.",2004.0,51.0,80.0,"{'volume': '34', 'pages': '376-386', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Park2004TowardMH,\n author = {W.

309,174ee505a5ae9738df7b672bf4818526421f75df,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,"This research investigated the possible impacts of computers on Turkish fourth-grade students’ geometry scores and further geometric learning. The study used a pretest–intervention–posttest experimental design. Results showed that students who did not have computers at home initially had lower geometry scores. However, these differences were minimised with an appropriate intervention containing computer-based Tangram puzzles. This suggests that at schools, it seems more effective to integrate mathematical content and technology in a manner that enables students to do playful mathematical discoveries. Introduction Social disadvantage may be an educational handicap, which may lead to further social disadvantages. Students living in poor socio-economic areas usually have limited access to some educational resources such as computers (Olkun & Altun, 2003; Webster & Fisher, 2000). The visual nature of computers can help students develop skills useful in learning subjects with visual content such as geometry. Therefore, the current study aimed at investigating the differences a computer made on students’ geometry scores and their further learning of two-dimensional (2D) geometry. Background literature Mathematics, computers, and future success In many countries, achievement in mathematics is an important factor for students’ career development. For example, mathematics is one of the subject areas with a high proportion of items on the University Entrance Examination in Turkey. Furthermore, geometry questions occupy nearly 40% of the mathematics section in this exam. Therefore, students need a good score in math to be admitted to colleges. Similarly, Fetto (2002) reports that in the USA, half of the students who scored in the upper quartile of their class in eight-grade mathematics went on to earn bachelor’s degrees, and 9% received master’s degrees. By comparison, only 23% of those who had average eightgrade mathematics scores now have a bachelor’s degree, and just 2% have a master’s degree. Literacy and numeracy have long been recognised as a qualification in both schools and workplaces (FitzSimons, 2001). Recently, however, equally strong emphasis has been placed on visual literacy, especially with the prominence of computer technologies. An important dimension in visual literacy is spatial thinking, which supports numerical reasoning and visual judgments (Battista et al, 1998). For example, Wheatley and Reynolds (1996) found close parallels between student tiling and numerical activity. Similarly, Battista and Clements (1998) claimed that there was a synergistic effect between numerical and spatial thinking. Given the importance of mathematics, geometry, and spatial thinking on educational success, it is important to find better ways to teach them. There is ample evidence that real and virtual manipulatives can help elementary school children learn mathematics better (Clements, 1999). Yet computers are still rarely used in the classroom to teach mathematics even in so-called developed countries, such as the USA (Flores et al, 2002). On the other hand, many students in the USA have at least one computer at home. Although we do not know the exact percentages in the wider population, in one study whilst 98% of the US 10-year-olds had computers at home, only 25% of the Turkish students had them (Authors, unpublished manuscript). In another survey, Facer et al (forthcoming) found that 70% of the children in the UK reported ownership of a home computer. These cross-cultural differences of computer ownership further widen the gap amongst countries as well as amongst social classes. Certain household materials are important socio-economic status (SES) indicators for exploring both individual and school-level educational effects (Yang, 2003). Olkun and Altun (2003) found striking differences amongst schools located in different socioeconomic areas within a province in Turkey in terms of student computer ownership. In one school located in a poor socio-economic rural area, only 4% of the students had computers at home. Seventeen per cent of the students in the other school, located in middle-low socio-economic area, had computers at home. In still another school located in a middle socio-economic area, 27% of the students had computers at home. As the difference in computer ownership is apparent, it seems necessary to investigate the impact of computers on students’ geometry learning. The positive relationship between the SES and student achievement is very well known (see, Yang, 2003). For example, Webster and Fisher (2000) found a strong negative effect of rurality on student mathematics and science achievement. However, they found that in Australia, contrary to common belief, rural schools had more resources than urban schools. They concluded that availability of school resources alone did not significantly effect student achievement in mathematics and science. Similarly, Wenglinsky (1998) claimed that the greatest inequities in computer use were not in how often they were used, but in the ways in which they were used. He further reports that poor, urban, and rural students are less likely to be exposed to higher order uses of computers than nonpoor and suburban students because teachers of urban and rural students are less likely to have had professional development in technology than suburban teachers. Still, one might argue about the other reasons for the relationship between SES and achievement. Breznitz and Norman (1998), for instance, found differences in concentration and academic achievement between low and high SES first grade students. The difference persisted in part to the fourth grade. They attributed the differences in comprehension and arithmetic scores, between the low SES and high SES children, to their concentration abilities. They reported that aggressive–impulsive behaviours, often seen in low SES children, hindered concentration, accentuating learning problems (Breznitz & Norman, 1998). However, using certain educational or otherwise recreational tools such as computers may increase students’ level of engagement in learning because the computer is a key item that provides students with many educational (Clements, 1999; Flores et al, 2002) and interactive recreational opportunities. Attewell and Battle (1998), for example, found a high correlation between home computers and eighth graders’ mathematical achievement. Similarly, the recent Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS, 1999) reports that on average internationally, students from homes with a high level of educational resources such as computers, had higher mathematics achievement than students from homes with fewer resources. However, it remains to be investigated how having a computer at home and certain computer experiences affect students’ mathematics learning. As Wenglinsky (1998) argued, technology may matter, but it depends on how it was used. Therefore, it is particularly important what purposes computers, whether at home or school, are used for. Computers and geometry learning One of the most cited uses of computers at home is game playing (ie, Selwyn, 1998). A recent research by Facer et al (2003) investigated the ways both elementary and secondary school children use home computers. According to the findings, about 75% students, especially younger ones, use computers for playing games (at least once a week). Rapid developments in hardware technology, increasing capacity of affordable hardware, and increasingly realistic computer graphics also make game playing more attractive. Computer games can improve spatial skills important for geometry learning (Battista, 1990) and other academic areas (Humphreys, Lubinski & Yao, 1993; Mcgee, 1978; Pallrand & Seeber, 1984; Pearson & Ferguson, 1989; Pribyl & Bodner, 1987; Smith, 1964). Computer games can improve mental rotation and spatial visualisation (Gagnon, 1985; Greenfield, 1994; Okagaki & Frensch, 1994), but intermittent results indicate that prior experience and other factors mediate such improvements. Computers can facilitate improvements in spatial skills that may in turn bring more success in geometry. Therefore, the complex relationships between computer ownership, computer treatment, and student geometry learning as part of mathematical achievement bear more investigation.",2006.0,26.0,193.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Olkun2006BlackwellPL,\n author = {S.

In the literature, multimodal communication of shared knowledge has been reported to influence the development of a SMM. In virtual worlds, within a team comprised of a human and an intelligent virtual agent IVA, the influence of IVA personality on collaboration and development of a SMM has not been previously studied. In this study, we explore the impact of an IVA's personality traits on the development of taskwork and teamwork SMMs with human teammates. Moreover, this study investigated the influence of a match in personality traits between IVAs and humans on the development of a SMM. In this study, five versions of an IVA performing the same scenario were developed. Besides a neutral personality, four combinations of two personality traits, i.e., extraversion and agreeableness were created. Participants were divided into five groups each assigned one version of the IVA. The results showed that agreeable IVAs positively impacted on the development of taskwork and teamwork SMMs; whereas extraversion did not influence development of the SMM.

The genus Mycobacterium includes obligate pathogens, opportunistic pathogens, and saprophytes. Ben Salah et al. found clinical M. avium complex (MAC) isolates that appear to represent three other new species: M. marseillense, M. timonense, and M. bouchedurhonense. Many different types of clinical specimens may be collected for mycobacteriological analyses. A majority of clinical specimens originate from the respiratory tract (sputum, tracheal and bronchial aspirates, and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens), but urine, gastric aspirates, tissues, biopsy specimens, and normally sterile body fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid and pleural and pericardial aspirates are other commonly submitted specimens. A majority of disseminated mycobacterial infections are due to MAC. Appropriate pretreatment and processing procedures (homogenization, decontamination, concentration, culture media, and conditions of incubation) must be selected to facilitate optimum recovery of mycobacteria. With the advent of molecular techniques designed for molecular epidemiology, cross-contamination either linked to laboratory procedures or, more rarely, to contaminated bronchoscopes can easily be proven.

We also present a novel interactive multi-agent simulation algorithm to model entitative groups and conduct a VR user study to validate the socio-emotional predictive power of our algorithm.

The aim of the present study was to establish the convergent and discriminant validity of these 4 subscales. Hypothesized relationships among the IRI subscales between the subscales and measures of other psychological constructs (social functioning self-esteem emotionality and sensitivity to others) and between the subscales and extant empathy measures were examined. Study subjects included 677 male and 667 female students enrolled in undergraduate psychology classes at the University of Texas. The IRI scales not only exhibited the predicted relationships among themselves but also were related in the expected manner to other measures. Higher PT scores were consistently associated with better social functioning and higher self-esteem; in contrast Fantasy scores were unrelated to these 2 characteristics. High EC scores were positively associated with shyness and anxiety but negatively linked to egotism. The most substantial relationships in the study involved the PD scale. PD scores were strongly linked with low self-esteem and poor interpersonal functioning as well as a constellation of vulnerability uncertainty and fearfulness. These findings support a multidimensional approach to empathy by providing evidence that the 4 qualities tapped by the IRI are indeed separate constructs each related in specific ways to other psychological measures.,1983.0,26.0,8385.0,"{'volume': '44', 'pages': '113-126', 'name': 'Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Davis1983MeasuringID,\n author = {Mark H.

 We investigate the task of building open domain, conversational dialogue systems based on large dialogue corpora using generative models. Generative models produce system responses that are autonomously generated word-by-word, opening up the possibility for realistic, flexible interactions. In support of this goal, we extend the recently proposed hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder neural network to the dialogue domain, and demonstrate that this model is competitive with state-of-the-art neural language models and back-off n-gram models.

In this framework, two encoders are used to extract expression and identity information, and three decoders are used to visualize the information by generating face models containing only expression, only identity, and fused expression and identity. By aligning the corresponding vertices of the parts with the same semantic on the face, an error evaluation method between face models with different topologies is proposed, which can more intuitively reflect the error distribution. The experimental results show that the proposed framework has higher accuracy than face component extraction by blendshape. The framework can be used for the facial expression generation of virtual humans, which is helpful for emotion transmission and language supplementation.",2022.0,30.0,2.0,"{'volume': '30', 'pages': '609 - 620', 'name': 'Journal of the Society for Information Display'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tu2022AcquiringIA,\n author = {Ziqi Tu and Dongdong Weng and Bin Liang and Le Luo},\n journal = {Journal of the Society for Information Display},\n pages = {609 - 620},\n title = {Acquiring identity and expression information from monocular face image},\n volume = {30},\n year = {2022}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '1435352712', 'name': 'Ziqi Tu'}, {'authorId': '1744702', 'name': 'Dongdong Weng'}, {'authorId': '2065527026', 'name': 'Bin Liang'}, {'authorId': '1485352227', 'name': 'Le Luo'}]"

However, this patient research has always used extreme dilemmas with highly valued moral rules (e.g., do not kill). Data from healthy participants, however, suggest that when a wider range of dilemmas are employed, involving less valued moral rules (e.g., do not lie), moral judgements demonstrate sensitivity to the psychological intuitiveness of the judgements, rather than their deontological or utilitarian content (Kahane et al., Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, 7, 2011, 393). We sought the moral judgements of 30 TBI participants and 30 controls on moral dilemmas where content (utilitarian/deontological) and intuition (intuitive/counter-intuitive) were measured concurrently. Overall TBI participants made utilitarian judgements in equal proportions to controls; disproportionately favouring utilitarian judgements only when they were counter-intuitive, and deontological judgements only when they were counter-intuitive. These results speak against the view that TBI causes a specific utilitarian bias, suggesting instead that moral intuition is broadly disrupted following TBI.",2018.0,53.0,13.0,"{'volume': '12', 'pages': '200–215', 'name': 'Journal of Neuropsychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rowley2018CounterintuitiveMJ,\n author = {D.

As a first step to explore the question of their integration, we used a bimodal perception situation modelled after the McGurk paradigm, in which varying degrees of discordance can be created between the affects expressed in a face and in a tone of voice. Experiment 1 showed that subjects can effectively combine information from the two sources, in that identification of the emotion in the face is biased in the direction of the simultaneously presented tone of voice. Experiment 2 showed that this effect occurs also under instructions to base the judgement exclusively on the face. Experiment 3 showed the reverse effect, a bias from the emotion in the face on judgement of the emotion in the voice.

Computer simulations allow one to understand interactions of physical particles and make sense of astronomical observations, to describe many chemical properties ab initio, and to design energy-efficient aircrafts and safer cars. Today, the use of computational devices is pervasive. Offices, administrations, financial trading, economic exchange, the control of infrastructure networks, and a large share of our communication would not be conceivable without the use of computers anymore. Hence, it would be very surprising, if computers could not make a contribution to a better understanding of social and economic systems. While relevant also for the statistical analysis of data and data-driven efforts to reveal patterns of human interaction, we will focus here on the prospects of computer simulation of social and economic systems. More specifically, we will discuss the techniques of agent-based modeling (ABM) and multi-agent simulation (MAS), including the challenges, perspectives and limitations of the approach. In doing so, we will discuss a number of issues, which have not been covered by the excellent books and review papers available so far . In particular, we will describe the different steps belonging to a thorough agent-based simulation study, and try to explain, how to do them right from a scientific perspective.

348,19ba0249dcada4bbdc3366d37e1f3362f324e904,Region of interest analysis using an SPM toolbox,"Most functional imaging studies use analyses that look for effects anywhere in the brain. The standard approach is to calculate a statistic relating the experimental effect of interest to the data for each brain voxel. This method has the advantage that it can detect strong effects without apriori constraint on the area that activation will occur. Problems arise when we wish to ask the question whether a particular brain area has been activated: if we know the shape and location of the expected activity, then voxel by voxel approaches have low power, because of the multiple comparisons across voxels. Whole brain analyses usually use image smoothing in order to increase signal to noise; however, the best smoothing filter will depend on the shape of the activation, which may well not be matched by a standard kernel such as a Gaussian. The most direct answer to the question ""has this area been activated"" is to use a region of interest analysis. Here we define a region, and perform the statistical test on the mean time course of the voxels within the region. The contribution of the voxels may be weighted using the expected shape of the activation. This approach has two advantages. First, we increase power by avoiding the multiple comparison problem. Second, if we are correct about the shape and location of the region, the process of taking the mean is equivalent to using the best smoothing kernel to recover the signal. This method has proved very powerful in analysing the activation in well defined regions. For example, Kanwisher et al have used screening tasks and voxel by voxel statistics to define regions of interest, and used these regions to investigate the nature of the original activation in further experiments of visual analysis of faces, scenes, objects and body parts. We have implemented a toolbox called ""MarsBar"" for region of interest analysis within the SPM99 software package (available for free download from http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/marsbar.html). The user can define regions using activations from previous SPM analyses, binary or weighted images, or simple shapes (boxes or spheres). Regions can be combined using a full range of algebra to give new regions. Functions include overlap between regions (logical and) or combination (logical or). The software can then extract raw or filtered time courses from the region for futher analysis outside SPM. It can also use new or previous SPM analysis files to analyze the regional time course. t or F statistics for multiple regions can be computed, and the results plotted using the SPM graphical interface. We are currently working on estimation of percentage signal change for the region data. Region of interest analyses are likely to become more important as prior hypotheses about the location of activation become more specific. This may have many advantages in terms of statistical power and the ease of interpretation of neuroimaging data. We hope that this toolbox will make such analyses simpler to implement.",2010.0,0.0,2857.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Brett2010RegionOI,\n author = {M. Brett and J.

352,1a3c8c958eb46b28c9222501295bcbe9fad9ad43,Computational models of attachment and self-attachment,"We explore, using a variety of models grounded in computational neuroscience, the dynamics of attachment formation and change. In the first part of the thesis we consider the formation of the traditional organised forms of attachment (as defined by Mary Ainsworth) within the context of the free energy principle, showing how each type of attachment might arise in infant agents who minimise free energy over interoceptive states while interacting with caregivers with varying responsiveness. We show how exteroceptive cues (in the form of disrupted affective communication from the caregiver) can result in disorganised forms of attachment (as first uncovered by Mary Main) in infants of caregivers who consistently increase stress on approach, but can have an organising (towards ambivalence) effect in infants of inconsistent caregivers. The second part of the thesis concerns Self-Attachment: a new self-administrable attachment-based psychotherapy recently introduced by Abbas Edalat, which aims to induce neural plasticity in order to retrain an individual’s suboptimal attachment schema. We begin with a model of the hypothesised neurobiological underpinnings of the Self-Attachment bonding protocols, which are concerned with the formation of an abstract, self-directed bond. Finally, using neuroscientific findings related to empathy and the self-other distinction within the context of pain, we propose a simple spiking neural model for how empathic states might serve to motivate application of the aforementioned bonding protocols.",2016.0,399.0,3.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Cittern2016ComputationalMO,\n author = {David Cittern},\n title = {Computational models of attachment and self-attachment},\n year = {2016}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2585368', 'name': 'David Cittern'}]"

This metric uses a two-step process to quantify a simulator's ability to reproduce the collective behaviors of the whole system, as observed in the recorded real-world data. First, Bayesian inference is used to estimate the simulation states which best correspond to the observed data, then a maximum likelihood estimator is used to approximate the prediction errors. This process is iterated using the EM-algorithm to produce a robust, statistical estimate of the magnitude of the prediction error as measured by its entropy (smaller is better). This metric serves as a simulator-to-data similarity measurement. We evaluated the metric in terms of robustness to sensor noise, consistency across different datasets and simulation methods, and correlation to perceptual metrics.",2012.0,42.0,134.0,"{'volume': '31', 'pages': '1 - 11', 'name': 'ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Guy2012ASS,\n author = {S.

While immersed in a virtual environment, participants listened to a persuasive communication from a digital representation of another student. The latter was actually an embodied agent (a computer-controlled digital representation of a human). Study 1 examined the extent to which gender of the virtual human, participant gender, and the agent's behavior affected attitude change. Results revealed gender-based ingroup favoritism in the form of greater attitude change for same gender virtual humans. Study 2 examined behavioral realism and agency beliefs; that is, whether participants believed the other to be an agent or an avatar (an online representation of an actual person). Results supported Blascovich and colleague's model of social influence within immersive virtual environments. Specifically, the prediction that virtual humans high in behavioral realism would be more influential than those low in behavioral realism was supported, but this effect was moderated by the gender of the virtual human and the research participant.

In this paper, we examine these areas and suggest that affect in groups, as well as specific mechanisms to regulate and maintain certain affective states in groups, have had important roles in promoting group survival over evolutionary history. Specifically, we suggest that affect in groups serves a coordination function, which can take one of two forms. First, affect in groups quickly provides information about the environment and group structure to other group members, thus coordinating group activity via a communication function. Second, shared affect in groups coordinates group activity through fostering group bonds and group loyalty. These two functions of affect in groups are closely related and mutually reinforcing.

Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and ACM Digital using a predefined search strategy. Studies were included if they focused on consumers or healthcare professionals; involved a conversational agent using any unconstrained natural language input; and reported evaluation measures resulting from user interaction with the system. Studies were screened by independent reviewers and Cohen’s kappa measured inter-coder agreement. Results The database search retrieved 1513 citations; 17 articles (14 different conversational agents) met the inclusion criteria. Dialogue management strategies were mostly finite-state and frame-based (6 and 7 conversational agents, respectively); agent-based strategies were present in one type of system. Two studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 1 was cross-sectional, and the remaining were quasi-experimental. Half of the conversational agents supported consumers with health tasks such as self-care. The only RCT evaluating the efficacy of a conversational agent found a significant effect in reducing depression symptoms (effect size d = 0.44, p = .04). Patient safety was rarely evaluated in the included studies. Conclusions The use of conversational agents with unconstrained natural language input capabilities for health-related purposes is an emerging field of research, where the few published studies were mainly quasi-experimental, and rarely evaluated efficacy or safety. Future studies would benefit from more robust experimental designs and standardized reporting.

363,1b0d55734c66b713477a4d1ef358ca1399ca0e69,A Theory of Human Motivation,"1. The integrated wholeness of the organism must be one of the foundation stones of motivation theory. 2. The hunger drive (or any other physiological drive) was rejected as a centering point or model for a definitive theory of motivation. Any drive that is somatically based and localizable was shown to be atypical rather than typical in human motivation. 3. Such a theory should stress and center itself upon ultimate or basic goals rather than partial or superficial ones, upon ends rather than means to these ends. Such a stress would imply a more central place for unconscious than for conscious motivations. 4. There are usually available various cultural paths to the same goal. Therefore conscious, specific, local-cultural desires are not as fundamental in motivation theory as the more basic, unconscious goals. 5. Any motivated behavior, either preparatory or consummatory, must be understood to be a channel through which many basic needs may be simultaneously expressed or satisfied. Typically an act has more than one motivation. 6. Practically all organismic states are to be understood as motivated and as motivating. 7. Human needs arrange themselves in hierarchies of prepotency. That is to say, the appearance of one need usually rests on the prior satisfaction of another, more pre-potent need. Man is a perpetually wanting animal. Also no need or drive can be treated as if it were isolated or discrete; every drive is related to the state of satisfaction or dissatisfaction of other drives. 8. Lists of drives will get us nowhere for various theoretical and practical reasons.

A survey involving 400 respondents was conducted and structural equation modelling was employed in analysing the data. Results revealed positive relationships between authenticity and attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control. Attitude and subjective norms had a positive and significant relationship with behavioural intention, whereas perceived behavioural control showed an insignificant relationship with behavioural intention. Authenticity mediated by the TPB constructs positively influenced the behavioural intention of pilgrims. Findings of this study provide an improved understanding of how authenticity interacts with attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control, thereby influencing the behavioural intention to walk the St. James Way. Thus, this study contributes to an improved insight into the impact of authenticity on pilgrims’ behavioural intention.",2020.0,16.0,23.0,"{'volume': '23', 'pages': '1593 - 1597', 'name': 'Current Issues in Tourism'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Girish2020AuthenticityAI,\n author = {V.

366,1b3a0ac9927eea55519499ddb600ac59ed352078,Editorial: Advances in Virtual Agents and Affective Computing for the Understanding and Remediation of Social Cognitive Disorders,"The present topic emphasizes the parallel development of concepts in social neurosciences and in other domains such as computer science, affective computing, virtual reality development, and even hardware technologies. While several researchers in neurosciences pointed out the necessity to consider naturalistic social cognition (Zaki and Ochsner, 2009), the second person perspective (Schilbach et al., 2013), social interaction (Pfeiffer et al.) and reciprocity (de Bruin et al.), both computer and software developments allowed more and more realistic real-time models of our environment and of virtual humans capable of some interaction with users. A new convergence between scientific disciplines might occur from which it is tricky to predict the outcomes in terms of new concepts, methods, and uses. 
 
Although this convergence meets ongoing societal changes (increasing social demands on computer technologies, augmenting funding), it comes with several difficulties for which the current Frontiers in' topic strives to bring some positive answers, and to provide both theoretical arguments and experimental examples. The first problem was about concepts and vocabulary as contributions described in the following were authored by neuroscientists, computer scientists, psychopathologists, each coming with separate knowledge, and key literature. A special attention was given to avoid purely technical descriptions and to focus on the added value of virtual reality in neurosciences and psychopathology. Another problem concerned methods: more complex computerized interaction models results in unpredictable and poorly controlled experiments. In other words, the assets of naturalistic paradigms may be alleviated by the difficulty to match results between subjects, populations, and conditions. It is crucial to consider this question when investigating pathologies that are associated with profoundly divergent behavioral patterns. The last issue we encountered was about heterogeneity of the objectives of the researches presented here. While selection criteria focused on the use of innovative technologies to assess or improve social cognition, the fields of application of this approach were quite unexpected. 
 
The first group of contributions exemplifies how innovation in methods improves understanding and assessment of social cognition disorders or pathology. Timmermans and Schilbach provide technological orientations for investigating alterations of social interaction in psychiatric disorders by the use of dual interactive eye tracking with virtual anthropomorphic avatars. Joyal et al. bring concurrent and construct validities of a newly developed set of virtual faces expressing six fundamental emotions. The relevance of virtual reality was shown with two contributions focusing on anxiety related phenomena. Jackson et al. describe a new environment allowing investigating empathy for dynamic FACS-coded facial expressions including pain. Based on a systematic investigation of the impact of social stimuli modalities (visual, auditory), Ruch and collaborators are able to characterize the specificity of the interpretation of laughter in people with gelotophobia (Ruch et al.). On the related issue of social anxiety, Aymerich-Franch et al. presented two studies in which public speaking anxiety has been correlated with avatars' similarity of participants' self-representations. Finally, three contributions demonstrate the feasibility and the usefulness of virtual reality settings on chronic developmental and psychiatric conditions like high functioning autism (HFA) or schizophrenia. Grynszpan and Nadel present an original eye-tracking method to reveal the link between gaze patterns and pragmatic abilities in HFA. About schizophrenia, Oker et al. discuss and report some insights on how affective and reactive virtual agents might be useful to assess and remediate several defects of social cognitive disorders. About assessment within virtual avatars on schizophrenia, Park et al. focused on effect of perceived intimacy on social decision making with schizophrenia patients. 
 
The second set of contributions focus on therapeutic intervention with either a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) framework or with cognitive remediation/training procedures. CBT interventions share common principles and take in consideration thoughts, feelings or emotions and behaviors in order to generate gradual modification of each of these levels thanks to thought and schema analysis, stress reduction procedures, etc. They were observed to be somehow useful for the treatment of depression, stress disorders, phobias, and are gaining some authority in personality disorders and addictions. The main asset of new technologies is the possibility to control the characteristics of symptom-eliciting stimuli/situations, and more precisely the degree to which immersion is enforced. For example, Baus and Bouchard provide a review on the extension of virtual reality exposure-based therapy toward recently described augmented reality exposure-based therapy in individuals with phobias. Concerning substance dependence disorders, Hone-Blanchet et al. present another review on how virtual reality can be an asset for both therapy and craving assessment stressing out the possibilities to simulate social interactions associated with drug seeking behaviors and even peers' pressure to consume. 
 
The last contributions of the topic concern social cognitive training or remediation in severe and chronic mental disorders (autistic disorders, schizophrenia). Here, therapies are based on drill and practice or strategy shaping procedures, and, most of the time, share an errorless learning of repeated cognitive challenges. Computerized methods were early proposed for that they do, effortlessly and with limited costs, repetitive stimulations. While, repetition was incompatible with realism in the social cognitive domain, recent advances provide both immersion and full control over stimuli. Georgescu et al. exhaustively reviews the use of virtual characters to assess and train non-verbal communication in HFA. Regarding schizophrenia remediation, Peyroux and Franck presented a new method, named RC2S, which is a cognitive remediation program to improve social cognition in schizophrenia and related disorders. 
 
To conclude briefly, while it is largely acknowledged that social interaction can be studied as a topic of its own, all the contributions demonstrate the added value of expressive virtual agents and affective computing techniques for the experimentation. It also appears that the use of virtual reality is at the very beginning of a new scientific endeavor in cognitive sciences and medicine.",2016.0,3.0,6.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Brunet-Gouet2016EditorialAI,\n author = {E.

Using numerous examples, they explain how different variables influence emotion intensity, and show how emotions can be formalized for computational purposes. Now with a contributed chapter describing the OCC model's influence, this book will interest a wide audience in cognitive, clinical, and social psychology, as well as in artificial intelligence and affective computing, and other cognitive science disciplines.",1988.0,3.0,6600.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Ortony1988TheCS,\n author = {A.

However, studies assessing physiological reactions to social rejection are rare and results of these studies were found to be ambiguous. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine and specify physiological effects of social rejection. Methods: Participants (n = 50) were assigned to either a social exclusion or inclusion condition of a virtual ball-tossing game (Cyberball). Immediate and delayed physiological [skin conductance level (SCL) and heart rate] reactions were recorded. In addition, subjects reported levels of affect, emotional states, and fundamental needs. Results: Subjects who were socially rejected showed increased heart rates. However, social rejection had no effect on subjects' SCLs. Both conditions showed heightened arousal on this measurement. Furthermore, psychological consequences of social rejection indicated the validity of the paradigm. Conclusions: Our results reveal that social rejection evokes an immediate physiological reaction. Accelerated heart rates indicate that behavior activation rather than inhibition is associated with socially threatening events. In addition, results revealed gender-specific response patterns suggesting that sample characteristics such as differences in gender may account for ambiguous findings of physiological reactions to social rejection.",2014.0,84.0,49.0,"{'volume': '5', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Iffland2014RapidHB,\n author = {Benjamin Iffland and L.

An important difference between social contagion and traditional infectious diseases, however, is that behavioral phenomena can be acquired by non-social mechanisms as well as through social transmission. We introduce a novel theoretical framework for studying these phenomena (the SISa model) by adapting a classic disease model to include the possibility for ‘automatic’ (or ‘spontaneous’) non-social infection. We provide an example of the use of this framework by examining the spread of obesity in the Framingham Heart Study Network. The interaction assumptions of the model are validated using longitudinal network transmission data. We find that the current rate of becoming obese is 2 per year and increases by 0.5 percentage points for each obese social contact. The rate of recovering from obesity is 4 per year, and does not depend on the number of non-obese contacts. The model predicts a long-term obesity prevalence of approximately 42, and can be used to evaluate the effect of different interventions on steady-state obesity. Model predictions quantitatively reproduce the actual historical time course for the prevalence of obesity. We find that since the 1970s, the rate of recovery from obesity has remained relatively constant, while the rates of both spontaneous infection and transmission have steadily increased over time. This suggests that the obesity epidemic may be driven by increasing rates of becoming obese, both spontaneously and transmissively, rather than by decreasing rates of losing weight. A key feature of the SISa model is its ability to characterize the relative importance of social transmission by quantitatively comparing rates of spontaneous versus contagious infection. It provides a theoretical framework for studying the interpersonal spread of any state that may also arise spontaneously, such as emotions, behaviors, health states, ideas or diseases with reservoirs.",2010.0,52.0,200.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'PLoS Computational Biology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hill2010InfectiousDM,\n author = {A.

Previous research suggests that both emotional appraisals and more deliberative utilitarian appraisals influence such judgments and that these appraisals often conflict. However, it is unclear how these different types of appraisals are represented in the brain, or how they are integrated into an overall moral judgment. We addressed these questions using an fMRI paradigm in which human subjects provide separate emotional and utilitarian appraisals for different potential actions, and then make difficult moral judgments constructed from combinations of these actions. We found that anterior cingulate, insula, and superior temporal gyrus correlated with emotional appraisals, whereas temporoparietal junction and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex correlated with utilitarian appraisals. Overall moral value judgments were represented in an anterior portion of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Critically, the pattern of responses and functional interactions between these three sets of regions are consistent with a model in which emotional and utilitarian appraisals are computed independently and in parallel, and passed to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex where they are integrated into an overall moral value judgment. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Popular accounts of moral judgment often describe it as a battle for control between two systems, one intuitive and emotional, the other rational and utilitarian, engaged in winner-take-all inhibitory competition. Using a novel fMRI paradigm, we identified distinct neural signatures of emotional and utilitarian appraisals and used them to test different models of how they compete for the control of moral behavior. Importantly, we find little support for competitive inhibition accounts. Instead, moral judgments resembled the architecture of simple economic choices: distinct regions represented emotional and utilitarian appraisals independently and passed this information to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex for integration into an overall moral value signal.",2015.0,46.0,73.0,"{'volume': '35', 'pages': '12593 - 12605', 'name': 'The Journal of Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hutcherson2015EmotionalAU,\n author = {Cendri A.

We also evaluate the accuracies of various frequently used models, including majority voting and multiple regression, in predicting an interlocutor's ratings from those of other interlocutors and/or those of the observers. Defining empathy as the emotional congruence between pairs of interlocutors, we studied a four-person conversation, in which previously unacquainted people held a decision-making discussion. We used a 5-point Likert scale when collecting self-reports of empathy from the interlocutors, and reports from a total of forty external observers (ten for each interlocutor) who adopted a target interlocutor's perspective. We obtained three indications. First, when no empathy ratings are available from the target interlocutor for model training, it is beneficial to ask observers to take the target interlocutor's perspective. Second, when target interlocutors' self-reports are available, it is advantageous to instruct observers not to take the target interlocutor's perspective. Third, in both scenarios, it is useful to ask interlocutors to rate the pairs excluding themselves. These findings provide some insights into good rating procedure as regards studying perceived empathy.",2017.0,48.0,2.0,"{'pages': '50-57', 'name': '2017 Seventh International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kumano2017ComparingEP,\n author = {Shiro Kumano and Ryo Ishii and K.

It can provide a safe setting in which to practice skills that might carry too many risks in the real world. Unlike human tutors, computers are infinitely patient and consistent. Virtual worlds can be manipulated in ways the real world cannot be and can convey concepts without the use of language or other symbol systems. Published applications for this client group have all been as rehabilitative interventions. These are described in three groups: promoting skills for independent living, enhancing cognitive performance, and improving social skills. Five groups of studies are reviewed that utilize virtual technology to promote skills for independent living: grocery shopping, preparing food, orientation, road safety, and manufacturing skills. Fears that skills or habits learnt in a virtual setting would not transfer to the real world setting have not been supported by the available evidence, apart from those studies with people with autistic spectrum disorders.

421,1e43c7084bdcb6b3102afaf301cce10faead2702,BioBERT: a pre-trained biomedical language representation model for biomedical text mining,"Abstract Motivation Biomedical text mining is becoming increasingly important as the number of biomedical documents rapidly grows. With the progress in natural language processing (NLP), extracting valuable information from biomedical literature has gained popularity among researchers, and deep learning has boosted the development of effective biomedical text mining models. However, directly applying the advancements in NLP to biomedical text mining often yields unsatisfactory results due to a word distribution shift from general domain corpora to biomedical corpora. In this article, we investigate how the recently introduced pre-trained language model BERT can be adapted for biomedical corpora. Results We introduce BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining), which is a domain-specific language representation model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical corpora. With almost the same architecture across tasks, BioBERT largely outperforms BERT and previous state-of-the-art models in a variety of biomedical text mining tasks when pre-trained on biomedical corpora. While BERT obtains performance comparable to that of previous state-of-the-art models, BioBERT significantly outperforms them on the following three representative biomedical text mining tasks: biomedical named entity recognition (0.62% F1 score improvement), biomedical relation extraction (2.80% F1 score improvement) and biomedical question answering (12.24% MRR improvement). Our analysis results show that pre-training BERT on biomedical corpora helps it to understand complex biomedical texts.

422,1e5288b5026a5748d5546105558654cadcb84fe0,The potential of virtual reality in social skills training for people with autistic spectrum disorders.,"BACKGROUND
People with autism experience profound and pervasive difficulties in the social domain. Attempts to teach social behaviours tend to adopt either a behavioural or a 'theory of mind' (ToM) approach. The beneficial aspects and limitations of both paradigms are summarized before an examination of how virtual reality technology may offer a way to combine the strengths from both approaches.


METHODS
This is not an exhaustive review of the literature; rather, the papers are chosen as representative of the current understanding within each broad topic. Web of Science ISI, EMBASE and PsycInfo were searched for relevant articles.


RESULTS
Behavioural and ToM approaches to social skills training achieve some success in improving specific skills or understanding. However, the failure to generalize learned behaviours to novel environments, and the unwieldy nature of some behavioural methodologies, means that there is a need for a training package that is easy to administer and successful in promoting learning across contexts.


CONCLUSIONS
Virtual reality technology may be an ideal tool for allowing participants to practise behaviours in role-play situations, whilst also providing a safe environment for rule learning and repetition of tasks. Role-play within virtual environments could promote the mental simulation of social events, potentially allowing a greater insight into minds. Practice of behaviours, both within and across contexts, could also encourage a more flexible approach to social problem solving. Virtual environments offer a new and exciting perspective on social skills training for people with autistic spectrum disorders.",2002.0,97.0,466.0,"{'volume': '46 Pt 5', 'pages': '\n          430-43\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Parsons2002ThePO,\n author = {S.

Specifically, the emotional contagion hypothesis explains how the emotions of two people (e.g., salesperson and customer) during a conversation are transmitted from one to the other via facial cues, and that these emotions affect the outcome of that interaction. The emotional contagion hypothesis implies that there are definitive individual differences concerning whether someone is either sensitive to emotions from others or able to transmit his or her emotions onto others. This study explores whether these individual differences are assets or liabilities over the long term for salespersons in a sales organization. The data in this study show that a salesperson's ability to infect others with his or her emotions is an asset (because it can lead to higher performance). In addition, being sensitive to the emotions of others is an asset (it can also lead to better performance); at the same time it is a liability (because of the higher risk of burnout). This study further explores how emotionally sensitive salespersons develop burnout as a consequence of role stress, which then affects their performance. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",1997.0,38.0,161.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '617-636', 'name': 'Psychology & Marketing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Verbeke1997IndividualDI,\n author = {W.

In this paper, we show that a large class of standard epidemiological models, the so-called susceptible/infective/removed (SIR) models can be solved exactly on a wide variety of networks. In addition to the standard but unrealistic case of fixed infectiveness time and fixed and uncorrelated probability of transmission between all pairs of individuals, we solve cases in which times and probabilities are nonuniform and correlated.

Participants follow simple instructions generated by a system, while simultaneously monitoring for a simple visual probe.

We study epidemic dynamics in bounded scale-free networks with soft and hard connectivity cutoffs. The finite size effects introduced by the cutoff induce an epidemic threshold that approaches zero at increasing sizes. The induced epidemic threshold is very small even at a relatively small cutoff, showing that the neglection of connectivity fluctuations in bounded scale-free networks leads to a strong overestimation of the epidemic threshold. We provide the expression for the infection prevalence and discuss its finite size corrections. The present paper shows that the highly heterogeneous nature of scale-free networks does not allow the use of homogeneous approximations even for systems of a relatively small number of nodes.",2002.0,17.0,641.0,"{'volume': '65 3 Pt 2A', 'pages': '\n          035108\n        ', 'name': 'Physical review.

It is argued that appraisal is a necessary as well as sufficient cause of emotion and that knowledge is necessary but not sufficient. This position is examined in light of what is known about emotions in infants and young children, the effects of drugs on acute emotions and moods, and recent patterns of thought about the brain in emotions. The discussion of how meaning is generated is the core of the article. Automatic processing without awareness is contrasted with deliberate and conscious processing, and the concept of resonance between an animal's needs and what is encountered in the environment is examined. The idea that there is more than one way meaning is achieved strengthens and enriches the case for the role of appraisal in emotion and allows the consideration of what is meant by unconscious and preconscious appraisal and the examination of how they might work.",1991.0,103.0,1534.0,"{'volume': '46 4', 'pages': '\n          352-67\n        ', 'name': 'The American psychologist'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lazarus1991CognitionAM,\n author = {R.

This ironised conception is one that intends to countenance both the Anthropocene’s strength as a designation of human impact on the non-human and the important, valid critiques responding to the Anthropocene. Philip K Dick’s work, in particular Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? is a superb illustration of such an ironic dynamic because of the dual narrative structure present. For example, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? raises questions about human identity that, while metaphysical, have great significance materially for the characters in the novel, and can be understood as a form of structural discrimination.  To demonstrate this ironic duality that should be brought to the Anthropocene, the article draws on Nick Land’s essay Kant, Capital, and the Prohibition of Incest: A Polemical Introduction to the Configuration of Philosophy and Modernity.",2021.0,0.0,43.0,{'name': 'Exchanges: The Interdisciplinary Research Journal'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Horsfield2021DoAD,\n author = {R.

Yet, it is of importance for explaining the emergence of crowd behaviors. Here, we experimentally addressed whether emotional homogeneity within a crowd might result from a cascade of local emotional transmissions where the perception of another’s emotional expression produces, in the observer's face and body, sufficient information to allow for the transmission of the emotion to a third party. We reproduced a minimal element of a crowd situation and recorded the facial electromyographic activity and the skin conductance response of an individual C observing the face of an individual B watching an individual A displaying either joy or fear full body expressions. Critically, individual B did not know that she was being watched. We show that emotions of joy and fear displayed by A were spontaneously transmitted to C through B, even when the emotional information available in B’s faces could not be explicitly recognized. These findings demonstrate that one is tuned to react to others’ emotional signals and to unintentionally produce subtle but sufficient emotional cues to induce emotional states in others.

Methods The questionnaire was developed from two earlier representative epidemiological studies (n = 5,529). Items were applied in a telephone survey of a representative population-based sample. Results A total of 1,960 persons were included. The life-time prevalence of vHI was 32.7% (f: 36.1%; m: 28.4%); 12% of these persons fulfilled the psychiatric criteria of acrophobia. Rasch analysis of 11 items on severity, symptoms, and triggers resulted in an 8-item scale with good fit to the model. The score differentiated well between persons with and without acrophobia. The distribution of the scores on the metric scale of the questionnaires of those individuals with acrophobia is separate and distinct from that of susceptibles without acrophobia, although there is some overlap. Conclusion Our proposed short questionnaire (vHISS, see Table 1 and Supplementary Material) allows a continuous quantification of the severity of vHI within a metric interval scale from 0 to 13.

However, many important questions remain in relation to the perception of social behavior and expression of emotions in virtual crowds. Specifically, few studies have considered the role of background context on the perception of the full-body emotion expressed by sub-constituents of the crowd i.e. individuals and small groups. In this paper, we present the results of perceptual studies in which animated scenes of expressive virtual crowd behavior were rated in terms of their valence by participants. The behaviors of a task-irrelevant crowd in the background were altered between neutral, happy and sad in order to investigate effects on the perception of emotion from task-relevant individuals in the foreground. Effects of the task irrelevant background on ratings of foreground characters were found, including cases that accompanied negatively valenced stimuli.",2014.0,42.0,7.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Applied Perception'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Carretero2014EvaluatingTP,\n author = {M.

Our formulation scales to high-dimensional continuous state spaces like images, bypasses the difficulties of directly predicting pixels, and, critically, ignores the aspects of the environment that cannot affect the agent.

486,22cb94c2658c18ae5e5cddaad3f402b43e36512e,Virtual reality exposure therapy for Vietnam veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder.,"BACKGROUND
Virtual reality (VR) integrates real-time computer graphics, body-tracking devices, visual displays, and other sensory input devices to immerse a participant in a computer-generated virtual environment that changes in a natural way with head and body motion. VR exposure (VRE) is proposed as an alternative to typical imaginal exposure treatment for Vietnam combat veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).


METHOD
This report presents the results of an open clinical trial using VRE to treat Vietnam combat veterans who have DSM-IV PTSD. In 8 to 16 sessions, 10 male patients were exposed to 2 virtual environments: a virtual Huey helicopter flying over a virtual Vietnam and a clearing surrounded by jungle.


RESULTS
Clinician-rated PTSD symptoms as measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale, the primary outcome measure, at 6-month follow-up indicated an overall statistically significant reduction from baseline (p = .0021) in symptoms associated with specific reported traumatic experiences. All 8 participants interviewed at the 6-month follow-up reported reductions in PTSD symptoms ranging from 15% to 67%. Significant decreases were seen in all 3 symptom clusters (p < .02). Patient self-reported intrusion symptoms as measured by the Impact of Event Scale were significantly lower (p < .05) at 3 months than at baseline but not at 6 months, although there was a clear trend toward fewer intrusive thoughts and somewhat less avoidance.


CONCLUSION
Virtual reality exposure therapy holds promise for treating PTSD in Vietnam veterans.",2001.0,0.0,508.0,"{'volume': '62 8', 'pages': '\n          617-22\n        ', 'name': 'The Journal of clinical psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rothbaum2001VirtualRE,\n author = {B.

Background: To date, reviews of trust in HRI have been qualitative or descriptive. Our quantitative review provides a fundamental empirical foundation to advance both theory and practice. Method: Meta-analytic methods were applied to the available literature on trust and HRI. A total of 29 empirical studies were collected, of which 10 met the selection criteria for correlational analysis and 11 for experimental analysis. These studies provided 69 correlational and 47 experimental effect sizes. Results: The overall correlational effect size for trust was r̄ = +0.26, with an experimental effect size of d̄ = +0.71. The effects of human, robot, and environmental characteristics were examined with an especial evaluation of the robot dimensions of performance and attribute-based factors. The robot performance and attributes were the largest contributors to the development of trust in HRI. Environmental factors played only a moderate role. Conclusion: Factors related to the robot itself, specifically, its performance, had the greatest current association with trust, and environmental factors were moderately associated. There was little evidence for effects of human-related factors. Application: The findings provide quantitative estimates of human, robot, and environmental factors influencing HRI trust. Specifically, the current summary provides effect size estimates that are useful in establishing design and training guidelines with reference to robot-related factors of HRI trust. Furthermore, results indicate that improper trust calibration may be mitigated by the manipulation of robot design.

The three categories of hesitation phenomena were ah and its variants, non-ah (stutters, repetitions, etc.), and silent pause. Since previous research had concentrated primarily upon psychiatric interviews, this study focused on a normal, interpersonal communication situation. Previous research also had not utilized Welsh's Internalization Ratio. Subjects were 15 male and 15 female undergraduate beginning speech students engaged in small-group discussion. It was hypothesized that data from these subjects, as with that from subjects in a clinical communication situation, would reveal that non-ah phenomena would be positively correlated with anxiety, but that there would be no other significant correlations among the variables. The findings confirmed the hypotheses, except that a significant r was found for the relationship between non-ah phenomena and the Internalization Ratio. The normal subjects in this study exhibited behaviour quite similar to that of the clinical subjects of previous research.

In particular, it allows separation of the formal purpose of a model structure from its implementation in specific brains. Models of auditory cortical processing can be conceived by analogy to the visual cortex, incorporating neural mechanisms that are found in both the visual and auditory systems. Examples of such canonical features at the columnar level are direction selectivity, size/bandwidth selectivity, and receptive fields with segregated vs. overlapping ON and OFF subregions. On a larger scale, parallel processing pathways have been envisioned that represent the two main facets of sensory perception: (i) identification of objects; and (ii) processing of space.

The empathy variables examined were emotional contagion (i.e. sharing the emotions of patients), empathic concern (i.e. being concerned for patients) and communicative effectiveness (i.e. effectively communicating with patients and their families). Nursing stress was explored through the variables of depersonalization, reduced personal accomplishment and emotional exhaustion. Multiple regression analyses revealed that the combination of the three emotional communication variables explained significant proportions of the variance in all three of the stress variables, as well as occupational commitment. The analyses further revealed that a lack of empathic concern and poor communicative responsiveness accounted for significant proportions of the variance in depersonalization. Lack of empathic concern, poor communicative responsiveness and high emotional contagion significantly contributed to reduced personal accomplishment. Emotional contagion explained a significant proportion of the variance in emotional exhaustion. Emotional contagion also significantly reduced occupational commitment.

Although external procedures (e.g., film clips, pictures) are widely used, a number of experiments elicit emotion by using self-generated procedures (e.g., recalling an emotional personal episode). However, no study has directly compared the effectiveness of two types of internal versus external MI across multiple discrete emotions. In the present experiment, 40 undergraduate students watched film clips (external procedure) and recalled personal events (internal procedure) inducing 4 basic emotions (fear, anger, joy, sadness) and later completed a self-report questionnaire. Remarkably, both internal and external procedures elicited target emotions selectively, compared with nontarget emotions. When contrasting the intensity of target emotions, both techniques showed no significant differences, with the exception of Joy, which was more intensely elicited by the internal procedure. Importantly, when considering the overall level of intensity, it was always greater in the internal procedure, for each stimulus. A more detailed investigation of the data suggest that recalling personal events (a type of internal procedure) generates more negative and mixed blends of emotions, which might account for the overall higher intensity of the internal mood induction.",2012.0,58.0,68.0,"{'volume': '12 3', 'pages': '\n          568-78\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Salas2012InsideoutCI,\n author = {C.

Reinforcement learning (RL) offers significant potential for devising data-driven interactive narrative generators that tailor players’ story experiences by inducing policies from player interaction logs. A key open question in RL-based interactive narrative generation is how to model complex player interaction patterns to learn effective policies. In this paper we present a deep RL-based interactive narrative generation framework that leverages synthetic data produced by a bipartite simulated player model. Specifically, the framework involves training a set of Q-networks to control adaptable narrative event sequences with long short-term memory network-based simulated players. We investigate the deep RL framework’s performance with an educational interactive narrative, C RYSTAL I SLAND .

In this contribution, we introduce Patricc, a robotic platform that is specifically designed for toddler-parent-robot triadic interaction. It addresses the unique challenges of this age group, namely, desire for continuous physical interaction and novelty. Patricc’s unique design enables changing characters by using dress-able puppets over a 3D-printed skeleton and the use of physical props. A novel authoring tool enables robot behavior and content creation by non-programmers. We conducted an evaluation study with 18 parent-toddler pairs and compared Patricc to similar tablet-based interactions. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses show that Patricc promotes significantly more triadic interaction, measured by video-coded gaze, compared to the tablet and that parents indeed perceive the interaction as triadic. Furthermore, there was no novelty-induced significant change in task-oriented behaviors, when toddlers interacted with two different characters consecutively. Finally, parents pointed out the benefits of changeable puppet-like characters over tablets and the appropriateness of the platform for the target age-group. These results suggest that Patricc can serve as the first gateway of toddlers to the emerging world of social robots.

We first analyze the most representative political rally scenes in detail and model them into two kinds of abstract scenario. Furthermore, the “extroversion” and “empathy” factors from the OCEAN model are chosen to describe the most important individual personalities in such scenarios. Based on this, an improved emotional contagion model is proposed by combining the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model and individual personality under different political viewpoints. Finally, the crowd in a political rally is driven to move according to the new potential moving direction generated by emotional contagion and the original direction of the individual together. The experiments show that our method can intuitively demonstrate the emotional changes of those individuals with different political perspectives and reasonably simulate the crowd movement under the political rally scenes.",2019.0,24.0,30.0,"{'volume': '6', 'pages': '377-386', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lv2019CrowdBE,\n author = {Pei Lv and Zhujin Zhang and Chaochao Li and Yibo Guo and Bing Zhou and Mingliang Xu},\n journal = {IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems},\n pages = {377-386},\n title = {Crowd Behavior Evolution With Emotional Contagion in Political Rallies},\n volume = {6},\n year = {2019}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '144470801', 'name': 'Pei Lv'}, {'authorId': '2223579', 'name': 'Zhujin Zhang'}, {'authorId': '7431398', 'name': 'Chaochao Li'}, {'authorId': '1932425', 'name': 'Yibo Guo'}, {'authorId': '2118868255', 'name': 'Bing Zhou'}, {'authorId': '2285442', 'name': 'Mingliang Xu'}]"
520,24d024a438f34db7d6b0f79c7cc6ddc9f5805145,When Love and Hate Collide: A Network Analysis of emotional contagion in Financial Markets,"Emotional finance introduces the notion that financial markets may be driven by the co-existence of fully-rational and emotional investors, driven by phantasy. The analysis of emotional finance is informed with reference to a Freudian psychoanalytical framework. <br><br>In this paper, we add to the existing information cascade and herding research by developing an emotional finance model that examines the effects of phantasy investors on the decisions of rational investors under dynamic pricing. We consider a ﬁnancial market for a risky asset in which traders’ emotions develop over time based on how they perform. We hypothesize that emotions affect traders’ behavior in a number of ways, through love and hate, where love results in investors buying and holding their stock regardless of the realized profit or loss.<br><br>The assumptions of the model include a constant population size of investors, and that all individuals are identical in their susceptibility to various emotional states. We also assume that the probability of becoming in love with stock is independent of an individual's history of emotional episodes and mood. We introduced an elementary agent-based asset pricing model consisting of three trader types: fundamental traders, emotional traders, and semi-emotional traders. The model comprises two features: 1) an emotional herding mechanism based on the susceptible-infected susceptible (SIS) model, and 2) wealth price herding based on wealth preferential attachment. We did this by creating sets of investors with given attributes and behaviors. Then we considered a set of investor relationships and methods of interaction: an underlying topology of connectedness defining how and with whom agents interact. Then we considered the market network where investors interact with their environment, and with other investors.<br><br>Combining analytical and simulation methods, the interaction between these elements is studied in a four-phase plane of the price movement: 1) prices resembling a bull market; 2) prices resembling a bear market; 3) U-shaped pricing trends; and 4) n shaped pricing trends. Finally, we compare our approach with a traditional information cascade/herding model incorporating phantasy investors. <br><br>We have formally demonstrated that emotions can be thought of as infectious diseases spreading across social networks. We have introduced a novel form of mathematical infectious disease model for describing the spread of emotions. We have validated this model by studying emotional propagation between different group of investors across a social network. <br>",2021.0,47.0,0.0,{'name': 'Behavioral & Experimental Finance eJournal'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Alsharman2021WhenLA,\n author = {Muhamed Alsharman and Richard J.

We first describe the technology and theories behind virtual environments and then report data from 4 empirical studies. In Experiment 1, we demonstrated that teachers with augmented social perception (i.e., receiving visual warnings alerting them to students not receiving enough teacher eye gaze) were able to spread their attention more equally among students than teachers without augmented perception. In Experiments 2 and 3, we demonstrated that by breaking the rules of spatial proximity that exist in physical space, students can learn more by being in the center of the teacher's field of view (compared to the periphery) and by being closer to the teacher (compared to farther away). In Experiment 4, we demonstrated that inserting virtual co-learners who were either model students or distracting students changed the learning abilities of experiment participants who conformed to the virtual co-learners. Results suggest that virtual environments will have a unique ability to alter the social dynamics of learning environments via transformed social interaction.

After the infection was first reported in December 2019, almost every country did not pay attention to this highly contaminated disease and failed to react swiftly. Now the whole planet is in an vulnerable state, resulting to increase the mortality rate and facing difficulties in all socio-economic aspects. That is why we have the urge to develop an efficient mathematical model (quarantine) based on social consciousness to control the epidemic. *Corresponding author: E-mail: kamrujjaman@du.ac.bd; Mahmud et al.; JALSI, 23(3): 20-27, 2020; Article no.JALSI.56918 Methods: This is a quarantine mathematical model. The outcome of the system is dependent on social consciousness. We have calculated the awareness level by considering various socio-economic factor of each country. In our model, the parameters are Education Index, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, population density, high literacy and stable economy. To maximize the efficiency of the model, it has to be implemented in initial stage. However, strict application of the method in vigorous stage of epidemic will also bring a satisfactory outcome. Results: In Spain, quarantine was effected on March 14, 2020. Spain experienced an increase in reported cases for 13 days of quarantine enforcement and from the 14th day, daily reported cases started to decrease with small fluctuation. Government ensured the social isolation through quarantine. After imposition of a quarantine on March 9, 2020 in Italy, within 13 days of lock-down, the maximum number of infection started to decrease. Similar results observed in France. Higher social consciousness would decrease the number of infected population dramatically while minimal or lower awareness will do a outburst.

This paper connects both challenges, by studying models of emotion generation in sequential decision-making agents. Previous work in this field has focussed on model-free reinforcement learning (RL). However, important emotions like hope and fear need anticipation, which requires a model and forward simulation. Taking inspiration from the psychological Belief-Desire Theory of Emotions (BDTE), our work specifies models of hope and fear based on best and worst forward traces. To efficiently estimate these traces, we integrate a well-known Monte Carlo Tree Search procedure (UCT) into a model based RL architecture. Test results in three known RL domains illustrate emotion dynamics, dependencies on policy and environmental stochasticity, and plausibility in individual Pacman game settings. Our models enable agents to naturally elicit hope and fear during learning, and moreover, explain what anticipated event caused this.",2016.0,27.0,18.0,{'pages': '848-854'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Moerland2016FearAH,\n author = {T.

Pictures of human faces bearing fearful or happy expressions were presented to 10 normal, healthy subjects by using a backward masking procedure that resulted in 8 of 10 subjects reporting that they had not seen these facial expressions. The backward masking procedure consisted of 33 msec presentations of fearful or happy facial expressions, their offset coincident with the onset of 167 msec presentations of neutral facial expressions. Although subjects reported seeing only neutral faces, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal in the amygdala was significantly higher during viewing of masked fearful faces than during the viewing of masked happy faces. This difference was composed of significant signal increases in the amygdala to masked fearful faces as well as significant signal decreases to masked happy faces, consistent with the notion that the level of amygdala activation is affected differentially by the emotional valence of external stimuli. In addition, these facial expressions activated the sublenticular substantia innominata (SI), where signal increases were observed to both fearful and happy faces—suggesting a spatial dissociation of territories that respond to emotional valence versus salience or arousal value.

536,25f43563d0ab6eee4d934046c63130ad3c8e6f6e,Changing the Intensity of Interaction Based on Individual Behavior in the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma Game,"We present a model of changing the intensity of interaction based on the individual behavior to study the iterated prisoner’s dilemma game in social networks. In this model, each individual has an assessed score of reputation which is obtained by considering the evaluation level of interactive partners for its present behavior. We focus on the effect of evaluation level on the changing intensity of interaction between individuals. For an individual with good behavior, the higher the evaluation level of its partners for its good behavior, the better its reputation, and the higher the probability of surrounding partners interaction with it. On the contrary, for an individual with bad behavior, the lower the evaluation level of its partners for its bad behavior, the worse its reputation, and the less the probability of surrounding neighbors interaction with it. Simulation results show that this effective mechanism can drastically facilitate the emergence and maintenance of cooperation in the population under a treacherous chip. Interestingly, for a small or moderate treacherous chip, the cooperation level monotonously ascends as the evaluation level increases; however, for a higher treacherous chip, existing an optimal evaluation level, which can result in the best promotion of cooperation.

This comorbidity has a significant impact on an individual’s levels of emotional distress, health outcomes, and associated health care utilization. As health care services struggle to meet demand and care increasingly moves to the community, digital tools are being promoted to support patients to self-manage their health. One such technology is the autonomous virtual agent (chatbot, conversational agent), which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to process the user’s written or spoken natural language and then to select or construct the corresponding appropriate responses. Objective This study aimed to co-design the content, functionality, and interface modalities of an autonomous virtual agent to support self-management for patients with an exemplar long-term condition (LTC; chronic pulmonary obstructive disease [COPD]) and then to assess the acceptability and system content. Methods We conducted 2 co-design workshops and a proof-of-concept implementation of an autonomous virtual agent with natural language processing capabilities. This implementation formed the basis for video-based scenario testing of acceptability with adults with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals involved in their care. Results Adults (n=6) with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals (n=5) specified 4 priority self-management scenarios for which they would like to receive support: at the time of diagnosis (information provision), during acute exacerbations (crisis support), during periods of low mood (emotional support), and for general self-management (motivation). From the scenario testing, 12 additional adults with COPD felt the system to be both acceptable and engaging, particularly with regard to internet-of-things capabilities. They felt the system would be particularly useful for individuals living alone. Conclusions Patients did not explicitly separate mental and physical health needs, although the content they developed for the virtual agent had a clear psychological approach. Supported self-management delivered via an autonomous virtual agent was acceptable to the participants. A co-design process has allowed the research team to identify key design principles, content, and functionality to underpin an autonomous agent for delivering self-management support to older adults living with COPD and potentially other LTCs.",2019.0,41.0,41.0,"{'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research', 'volume': '21'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Easton2019AVA,\n author = {K.

Building on existing research concerning this everyday process, the authors describe the development of a theoretical classification scheme that distinguishes between the types of strategy used to achieve interpersonal affect regulation. To test the theoretical classification, the authors generated a corpus of 378 distinct strategies using self-report questionnaires and diaries completed by student and working samples. Twenty participants then performed a card-sort of the strategies. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to determine how well the theoretical classification represented spontaneous understandings of controlled interpersonal affect regulation. The final classification primarily distinguished between strategies used to improve versus those used to worsen others' affect, and between strategies that engaged the target in a situation or affective state versus relationship-oriented strategies.

Evolutionarily stable states have a close relationship with Nash equilibria of repeated games, which are characterized by the folk theorem. When applying the folk theorem, one needs to compute the minimax profile of the game in order to find Nash equilibria. Computing the minimax profile is an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we investigate a new methodology to compute evolutionary stable states based on the level-k equilibrium, a new refinement of Nash equilibrium in repeated games. A level-k equilibrium is implemented by a group of players who adopt reactive strategies and who have no incentive to deviate from their strategies simultaneously. Computing the level-k equilibria is tractable because the minimax payoffs and strategies are not needed. As an application, this paper develops a tractable algorithm to compute the evolutionarily stable states and the Pareto front of n-player symmetric games.

Totally 214 color samples were evaluated on 12 emotion variables by subjects from seven different region groups in the psychophysical experiment. By factor analysis, it was found that three factors were sufficient to represent 80 11 ""region-emotion"" variables. For each variable, there is no distinct difference among different region groups. The 12 emotion variables could be divided into four categories, namely, activity index, potency index, definition index, and temperature index. Factor scores were further calculated to study the determinants on each factor. The analysis showed that the three factors were mainly related to chroma, lightness, and hue, respectively. It was concluded that chroma and lightness were the most important factors on color emotion, whereas the influences of hue and cultural background were very limited.

Many algorithms for this purpose have been proposed, each using different principles and implementation details that are difficult to compare. This paper presents a novel framework that describes local agent navigation generically as optimizing a cost function in a velocity space. We show that many state-of-the-art algorithms can be translated to this framework, by combining a particular cost function with a particular optimization method. As such, we can reproduce many types of local algorithms using a single general principle. Our implementation of this framework, named umans(Unified Microscopic Agent Navigation Simulator), is freely available online. This software enables easy experimentation with different algorithms and parameters.

The average cross-situational consistency of trait impressions across the 15 episodes was .43. Shared stereotypes related to gender and age were mostly accurate and contributed little to agreement among judges. Agreement was limited mainly by nonshared meaning systems and by nonoverlapping information. Personality inferences from thin slices of behavior were significantly associated with reports by knowledgeable informants. This association became stronger when more episodes were included, but gains in prediction were low beyond 6 episodes. Inferences of intelligence from thin slices of behavior strongly predicted intelligence test scores. A particularly strong single predictor was how persons read short sentences.",2004.0,55.0,453.0,"{'volume': '86 4', 'pages': '\n          599-614\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Borkenau2004ThinSO,\n author = {P.

The aim of this study was to investigate the difference in skin potential parameters in trained atheletes before and after acute exercise on a bicycle ergometer. Skin potential level (SPL) increased (p<0.01) and SPR decreased (p<0.05) after the exercise but latency had no significant difference. The fact that the mean SPL values were higher after the exercise can be explained by the increased sympathetic sudorific activity and so increased function of the sweat glands. Another reason may be the sweat duct pores which were more active and open after the exercise. Also the decrease in he SPR was thought to depend on the lower sweating thereshold.",1999.0,17.0,3.0,"{'volume': '29', 'pages': '113-116', 'name': 'Turkish Journal of Medical Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Turaclar1999TheEO,\n author = {U.

One challenging problem that blocks the construction of our control scheme is that the real control signal is wrapped in the coupling of quantization effect and nonsmooth backlash nonlinearity. To resolve this challenge, this paper presents a two-stage separation approach established on two new technical components, which are the approximate asymmetric backlash model and the nonlinear decomposition of quantizer, respectively. Then the real control is successfully separated from the coupling dynamics. Furthermore, by employing the neural networks and adaptation method in control design, a quantized controller is developed to guarantee the asymptotic convergence of tracking error to an adjustable region of zero and uniform ultimate boundedness of all closed-loop signals. Eventually, simulations are conducted to support our theoretical results.",2017.0,73.0,74.0,"{'volume': '28', 'pages': '294-307', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lai2017AsymmetricAB,\n author = {G.

Sixty-four undergraduates interacted with two different embodied agents: in one case the agent was designed to look somewhat similar to the user, and in the other case the agent was designed to look dissimilar. We varied between subjects how helpful the agent was for a given task. Results showed that the facial similarity manipulation sometimes affected participants' responses, even though they did not consciously detect the similarity. Specifically, when the agent was helpful, facial similarity increased participantsi ratings of involvement. However, when exposed to unhelpful agents, male participants had negative responses to the similar-looking agent compared to the dissimilar one.

This study develops and tests a structural equation model using the extended Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to explain Chinese college students’ intention to travel to Japan. Ten hypotheses were proposed regarding the relationships between destination image, travel constraints, and the original TPB constructs. The results of structural analyses reveal that the extended TPB has better predictive power for travel intention to Japan than the original one. Attitude is found to have the greatest impact on intention to travel to Japan. The mediating role of travel constraints shows a significantly negative effect on the relationships between the predictors and travel intention except for the relationship between perceived behavioral control and travel intention.

578,28059b5dad91567ae0dde5827485803441e7dbbc,The effect of expression of anger and happiness in computer agents on negotiations with humans,"There is now considerable evidence in social psychology, economics, and related disciplines that emotion plays an important role in negotiation. For example, humans make greater concessions in negotiation to an opposing human who expresses anger, and they make fewer concessions to an opponent who expresses happiness, compared to a no-emotion-expression control. However, in AI, despite the wide interest in negotiation as a means to resolve differences between agents and humans, emotion has been largely ignored. This paper explores whether expression of anger or happiness by computer agents, in a multi-issue negotiation task, can produce effects that resemble effects seen in human-human negotiation. The paper presents an experiment where participants play with agents that express emotions (anger vs. happiness vs. control) through different modalities (text vs. facial displays). An important distinction in our experiment is that participants are aware that they negotiate with computer agents. The data indicate that the emotion effects observed in past work with humans also occur in agent-human negotiation, and occur independently of modality of expression. The implications of these results are discussed for the fields of automated negotiation, intelligent virtual agents and artificial intelligence.",2011.0,77.0,123.0,{'pages': '937-944'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Melo2011TheEO,\n author = {C.

While their sales have been soaring, they have also rapidly become victims of verbal abuse by their users. Without proper handling of abusive usage, abusers’ actions can be reinforced and transferred to real life. This study investigates whether alternative response styles of empathy orientation and emotional expressivity of voice-activated virtual assistants influence users’ moral emotions found to reduce verbal aggression as well as whether they affect user perceptions of the agent’s capability. Ninety-eight participants were assigned to one of the three emotional expressivity conditions (no-facial expression, fixed-facial expression, varied-facial expression) and interacted with two alternative empathy orientation conditions (other-oriented, self-oriented) of agents. The experimental results show that, regardless of the emotional expressivity types, the agent’s empathy orientation has a significant effect on the moral emotions and agent capability perceptions. Overall, an agent that employed other-oriented empathy style elicited most positive responses from the users. However, the preference was not across the board, as about one-third of the participants showed preference to the self-oriented CA. Users valued agents’ verbal contents and vocal characteristics above their facial expressions. Based on the study findings, we draw several design guidelines and suggest avenues for future research.",2021.0,83.0,9.0,"{'name': 'International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction', 'pages': '1153 - 1167', 'volume': '38'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chin2021VoicesTC,\n author = {Hyojin Chin and M.

The theory, developed by Israel Waynbaum, a French physician, hypothesizes the subjective experience of emotions as following facial expression rather than preceding it. It answers Darwin's question of why different muscles contract or relax in different emotions better than Darwin's own theory. When restated in terms of contemporary neurophysiological knowledge, it explains and organizes several ill-understood emotional processes and phenomena.",1985.0,38.0,234.0,"{'volume': '228 4695', 'pages': '\n          15-21\n        ', 'name': 'Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zajonc1985EmotionAF,\n author = {R.

We compared ASC and typically developing (TD) individuals matched for IQ on five learning tasks: four implicit learning tasks—contextual cueing, serial reaction time, artificial grammar learning, and probabilistic classification learning tasks—that used procedures expressly designed to minimize the use of explicit strategies, and one comparison explicit learning task, paired associates learning. We found implicit learning to be intact in ASC. Beyond no evidence of differences, there was evidence of statistical equivalence between the groups on all the implicit learning tasks. This was not a consequence of compensation by explicit learning ability or IQ. Furthermore, there was no evidence to relate implicit learning to ASC symptomatology. We conclude that implicit mechanisms are preserved in ASC and propose that it is disruption by other atypical processes that impact negatively on the development of skills associated with an implicit acquisition.",2010.0,110.0,146.0,"{'volume': '63', 'pages': '1789 - 1812', 'name': 'Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Brown2010IntactIL,\n author = {Jamie Brown and B.

We propose one such process model of satisfaction using expectancy disconfirmation principles. Based on measurement of profit expectations before a bargaining session, knowledge of the profit outcomes achieved, and comparison operations between the two, analysis of data obtained from 42 negotiators provided evidence for this paradigm in negotiators′ post-settlement cognition. Expectations of one′s performance and profits attained had opposite effects on disconfirmation and later satisfaction judgments. High expectations served to decrease satisfaction and high profit outcomes had the effect of increasing satisfaction via their fully mediated effects through expectancy disconfirmation. Moreover, a negotiator′s willingness to negotiate with the partner again is shown to be primarily a function of satisfaction. Implications of these findings are discussed.",1994.0,0.0,237.0,"{'volume': '60', 'pages': '252-275', 'name': 'Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Oliver1994OutcomeSI,\n author = {R.

Our approach computes a set of collision-free feasible movement directions for each agent. The movement directions of the agent are determined according to a radial view of the agent in the local region. Subsequently, the direction with the least effort is selected for moving the agent. To efficiently compute feasible movement directions for each agent, we discretize the movement direction field of the agent and use a bit string to estimate the set of movement directions. Each bit of the bit string represents a span of movement directions. The proposed approach enables the agents to move around simple objects without using expensive global search techniques. Experimental results show that our approach can simulate agents that can alleviate the collision problem.

The study of emotional labor addresses the stress of managing emotions when the work role demands that certain expressions be shown to customers. However, there has been no overarching framework to guide this work, and the previous studies have often disagreed on the definition and operationalization of emotional labor. The purposes of this article are as follows: to review and compare previous perspectives of emotional labor, to provide a definition of emotional labor that integrates these perspectives, to discuss emotion regulation as a guiding theory for understanding the mechanisms of emotional labor, and to present a model of emotional labor that includes individual differences (such as emotional intelligence) and organizational factors (such as supervisor support).",2000.0,98.0,2863.0,"{'volume': '5 1', 'pages': '\n          95-110\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of occupational health psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Grandey2000EmotionRI,\n author = {Alicia A.

The authors hypothesized that the automatic impact of emotion expressions depends on group membership. In Experiments 1 and 2, an affective priming paradigm was used to measure immediate and preconscious affective responses to same-race or other-race emotion expressions. In Experiment 3, spontaneous vocal affect was measured as participants described the emotions of an ingroup or outgroup sports team fan. In these experiments, immediate and spontaneous affective responses depended on whether the emotional target was ingroup or outgroup. Positive responses to fear expressions and negative responses to joy expressions were observed in outgroup perceivers, relative to ingroup perceivers. In Experiments 4 and 5, discrete emotional responses were examined. In a lexical decision task (Experiment 4), facial expressions of joy elicited fear in outgroup perceivers, relative to ingroup perceivers. In contrast, facial expressions of fear elicited less fear in outgroup than in ingroup perceivers. In Experiment 5, felt dominance mediated emotional responses to ingroup and outgroup vocal emotion.

However, in the presence of many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is parameter inefficient: an entire new model is required for every task. As an alternative, we propose transfer with adapter modules. Adapter modules yield a compact and extensible model; they add only a few trainable parameters per task, and new tasks can be added without revisiting previous ones. The parameters of the original network remain fixed, yielding a high degree of parameter sharing. To demonstrate adapter's effectiveness, we transfer the recently proposed BERT Transformer model to 26 diverse text classification tasks, including the GLUE benchmark. Adapters attain near state-of-the-art performance, whilst adding only a few parameters per task. On GLUE, we attain within 0.4% of the performance of full fine-tuning, adding only 3.6% parameters per task.

Triadic interactions have been well described in families with 3 month olds and older children using the Lausanne Trilogue Play (LTP). Little is known about the development of mother–father–baby interactions in the very 1st weeks postpartum, mostly because no specific observational setting or particular instrument had been designed to cover this age yet. To fill this gap, we adapted the LTP to create a new observational setting, namely the Diaper Change Play (DCP). Interactions are assessed using the Family Alliance Assessment Scales for DCP (FAAS-DCP). We present the validation of the DCP and its coding system, the FAAS-DCP. The three validation studies presented here (44 mother–father–child–triads) involve a sample of parents with 3-week-old infants recruited in two maternity wards (n = 32 and n = 12) in Switzerland. Infants from both sites were all healthy according to their APGAR scores, weight at birth, and scores on the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS), which was additionally conducted on the twelve infants recruited in one of the maternity ward. Results showed that the “FAAS – DCP” coding system has good psychometric properties, with a good internal consistency and a satisfying reliability among the three independent raters. Finally, the “FAAS-DCP” scores on the interactive dimensions are comparable to the similar dimensions in the FAAS-LTP. The results showed that there is no statistically significant difference on scores between the “FAAS-DCP” and the “FAAS,” which is consistent with previous studies underlying stability in triadic interaction patterns from pregnancy to 18 months. These first results indicated that the DCP is a promising observational setting, able to assess the development of the early family triadic functioning. The DCP and the FAAS-DCP offer to both clinicians and researchers a way to improve the understanding of the establishment of early family functioning as well as to study the young infant’s triangular capacity.

618,2a13335bba46abe15afbf9d08b9caf72be90db30,"The circumplex model of affect: An integrative approach to affective neuroscience, cognitive development, and psychopathology","The circumplex model of affect proposes that all affective states arise from cognitive interpretations of core neural sensations that are the product of two independent neurophysiological systems. This model stands in contrast to theories of basic emotions, which posit that a discrete and independent neural system subserves every emotion. We propose that basic emotion theories no longer explain adequately the vast number of empirical observations from studies in affective neuroscience, and we suggest that a conceptual shift is needed in the empirical approaches taken to the study of emotion and affective psychopathologies. The circumplex model of affect is more consistent with many recent findings from behavioral, cognitive neuroscience, neuroimaging, and developmental studies of affect. Moreover, the model offers new theoretical and empirical approaches to studying the development of affective disorders as well as the genetic and cognitive underpinnings of affective processing within the central nervous system.This work was supported in part by NIMH Grants MH01232, MH59139, MH36197, MHK02-74677, and MH068318; a grant from the National Alliance for Research in Schizophrenia and Affective Disorders (NARSAD); NSF Grant BSC-0421702; and funding from the Thomas D.

We empirically evaluated the effects of near visually realistic vs. non-realistic stylized appearance of virtual humans on the emotional response of participants in a medical virtual reality system that was designed to educate users in recognizing the signs and symptoms of patient deterioration. In a between-subjects experiment protocol, participants interacted with one of three different appearances of a virtual patient, namely visually realistic, cartoon-shaded and charcoal-sketch like conditions in a mixed reality simulation. Emotional impact were measured via a combination of quantitative objective measures were gathered using skin Electrodermal Activity (EDA) sensors, and quantitative subjective measures such as the Differential Emotion Survey (DES IV), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and Social Presence questionnaire. The emotional states of the participants were analyzed across four distinct time steps during which the medical condition of the virtual patient deteriorated (an emotionally stressful interaction), and were contrasted to a baseline affective state. Objective EDA results showed that in all three conditions, male participants exhibited greater levels of arousal as compared to female participants. We found that negative affect levels were significantly lower in the visually realistic condition, as compared to the stylized appearance conditions. Furthermore, in emotional dimensions of interest-excitement, surprise, anger, fear and guilt participants in all conditions responded similarly. However, in social emotional constructs of shyness, presence, perceived personality, and enjoyment-joy, we found that participants responded differently in the visually realistic condition as compared to the cartoon and sketch conditions. Our study suggests that virtual human appearance can affect not only critical emotional reactions in affective inter-oersonal trainina scenarios. but also users' oerceotions of oersonalitv and social characteristic of the virtual interlocutors.",2016.0,39.0,94.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '1326-1335', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Volonte2016EffectsOV,\n author = {Matias Volonte and Sabarish V.

The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure is one of the outstanding issues in the study of networked systems. One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as ""modularity"" over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets.",2006.0,53.0,10206.0,"{'volume': '103 23', 'pages': '\n          8577-82\n        ', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Newman2006ModularityAC,\n author = {M.

Gaze cues are particularly important to achieve significant high-level outcomes such as improved learning and feelings of rapport. Our goal is to explore how agents might achieve such outcomes through seemingly subtle changes in gaze behavior and what design variables for gaze might lead to such positive outcomes. Drawing on research in human physiology, we developed a model of gaze behavior to capture these key design variables. In a user study, we investigated how manipulations in these variables might improve affiliation with the agent and learning. The results showed that an agent using affiliative gaze elicited more positive feelings of connection, while an agent using referential gaze improved participants' learning.

This hypothesis is supported by (a) the conceptual correspondence between implicit learning and social intuition (nonverbal communication) and (b) a review of relevant neuropsychological (Huntington's and Parkinson's disease), neuroimaging, neurophysiological, and neuroanatomical data. It is concluded that the caudate and putamen, in the basal ganglia, are central components of both intuition and implicit learning, supporting the proposed relationship. Parallel, but distinct, processes of judgment and action are demonstrated at each of the social, cognitive, and neural levels of analysis. Additionally, explicit attempts to learn a sequence can interfere with implicit learning.

634,2b666cea45eaea7065cfa05fe920bed9d7b6fd8c,Computers as Tools or as Social Actors? - The Users' Perspective on Anthropomorphic Agents,"Surprising findings showing that many basic rules of social interaction among humans also apply to the interaction of humans with computers26 have encouraged interface researchers to proclaim a new paradigm in human computer interface design: the social interface. Reeves and Nass' findings have especially given a new impetus to research on anthropomorphic agents, suggesting that furnishing an agent with a human-like interface could be an effective way to enhance agent usability. Little research exists however, to verify this claim. This study seeks to illuminate user responses to an anthropomorphic agent if it is used on a daily basis. It examines the influence of traditional usability variables such as control, understanding, trust, and distraction on the acceptance of an anthropomorphic interface. Kaasinen8 as well as Wexelblat and Maes36 emphasize that the acceptance of agents (whether or not they have an anthropomorphic interface) strongly depends on these traditional usability variables. As subject for this study, a commonly used anthropomorphic agent, the Microsoft Office Assistant, was selected. Using a questionnaire that was distributed through email and the World Wide Web as well as on paper, 105 users of the Microsoft Office Suite were asked about their use and acceptance of the Office Assistant. It turned out that the Office Assistant feature was rejected by the majority of the users. As a feature to troubleshoot problems, it was perceived as inefficient. Also, from a ""social"" perspective, it was rated as not particularly engaging or motivating. Multiple regression analysis revealed that variables influencing the use and the acceptance of the Office Assistant were distraction and trust. Only those users who felt distracted by the assistant and who did not trust in its capability to solve their problems rejected the Office Assistant. It is concluded that to ensure agent usability, its design should emphasize assistance with the user's task over social mimicry. If design efforts to furnish the agent with social traits interfere with the user's principal goal, it is likely that the agent will be rejected.",2001.0,25.0,44.0,"{'volume': '10', 'pages': '217-234', 'name': 'Int.

In a series of experiments, we investigated implicit learning of the semantic preferences of novel verbs, specifically, whether they collocate with abstract or concrete nouns. After reading sentences containing the verbs, participants were required to judge the familiarity of pairs of novel verbs and nouns and to indicate their confidence or the basis of their judgment (i.e., guess, intuition, memory). Although all of the words had occurred in the texts, none of the critical items had actually occurred together. However, endorsement rates were significantly higher for pairs that respected the semantic preference rules than those that did not. Through analysis of subjective measures and verbal report, we argue that, for the majority of participants, this effect was based on unconscious knowledge. We argue that implicit learning of the kind of generalizations underlying semantic preferences is possible even after limited exposure.",2015.0,52.0,18.0,"{'volume': '41 4', 'pages': '\n          989-1002\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of experimental psychology.

Findings In this quality improvement study, a deep learning model was trained to automatically categorize therapist utterances from approximately 90 000 hours of internet-enabled cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). Increased quantities of CBT change methods were positively associated with reliable improvement in patient symptoms, and the quantity of nontherapy-related content showed a negative association.

The system automatically estimates fear level based on multimodal sensory data and a self-reported emotion assessment. There are two modalities of expressing fear ratings: the 2-choice scale, where 0 represents relaxation and 1 stands for fear; and the 4-choice scale, with the following correspondence: 0—relaxation, 1—low fear, 2—medium fear and 3—high fear. A set of features was extracted from the sensory signals using various metrics that quantify brain (electroencephalogram—EEG) and physiological linear and non-linear dynamics (Heart Rate—HR and Galvanic Skin Response—GSR). The novelty consists in the automatic adaptation of exposure scenario according to the subject’s affective state. We acquired data from acrophobic subjects who had undergone an in vivo pre-therapy exposure session, followed by a Virtual Reality therapy and an in vivo evaluation procedure. Various machine and deep learning classifiers were implemented and tested, with and without feature selection, in both a user-dependent and user-independent fashion. The results showed a very high cross-validation accuracy on the training set and good test accuracies, ranging from 42.5% to 89.5%. The most important features of fear level classification were GSR, HR and the values of the EEG in the beta frequency range. For determining the next exposure scenario, a dominant role was played by the target fear level, a parameter computed by taking into account the patient’s estimated fear level.",2020.0,86.0,33.0,"{'volume': '20', 'name': 'Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Balan2020AnIO,\n author = {O.

Self-Attachment is a recently introduced psychotherapeutic method in which the patient creates a compassionate and affectional bond with their childhood-self using their childhood photos. The underlying theory and the promising results of the Self-Attachment therapy, in combination with its self-administrable nature, motivate further research in technologies that can enhance the procedure of the therapy. Virtual reality is a technology that has experienced rapid evolution over the last years, yet its ability to replace existing psychotherapeutic techniques remains fairly unexplored. The aim of this thesis is to create a user-friendly and highly interactive virtual reality platform that delivers the Self-Attachment therapy in an efficient way by creating an avatar of the patient’s childhood-self based on a 2D childhood photo. For the fulfillment of this goal, the implemented platform has been equipped with the latest features of the head-mounted Oculus Quest device and interactable components. In addition, the virtual environment features a virtual agent who acts as an assistant and is able to predict the emotional state of the user. The aforementioned achievements have led to the creation of a complete virtual platform, capable of autonomously delivering the Self-Attachment therapy in a personalised experience for the user. During an impact evaluation trial, a version of the platform was tested by seven healthy individuals and the results were promising. The high levels of immersiveness of the platform and its ability to attract and maintain the user’s engagement played a crucial role in obtaining positive feedback from the participants. Furthermore, the platform was successful in triggering participants’ emotions, who in the end preferred the virtual experience over the original therapy which is based on the use of their childhood photo. Consequently, we believe that this project is the beginning of the creation of a tool that will be able to autonomously and effectively treat people with mental disorders in the near future.",2020.0,50.0,1.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Edalat2020VirtualRP,\n author = {A.

Therapeutic approaches have traditionally involved medication and physiotherapy but such approaches are limited over time by their cost and side effects. This review seeks to critically evaluate the evidence for and against IVR as an adjunctive therapy for acute clinical pain applications. Methods:A rapid evidence assessment (REA) strategy was used. CINAHL, Medline, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, and the Cochrane Library databases were screened in from December 2012 to March 2013 to identify studies exploring IVR therapies as an intervention to assist in the management of pain. Main outcome measures were for acute pain and functional impairment. Results:Seventeen research studies were included in total including 5 RCTs, 6 randomized crossover studies, 2 case series studies, and 4 single-patient case studies. This included a total of 337 patients. Of these studies only 4 had a low risk of bias. There was strong overall evidence for immediate and short-term pain reduction, whereas moderate evidence was found for short-term effects on physical function. Little evidence exists for longer-term benefits. IVR was not associated with any serious adverse events. Discussion:This review found moderate evidence for the reduction of pain and functional impairment after IVR in patients with acute pain. Further high-quality studies are required for the conclusive judgment of its effectiveness in acute pain, to establish potential benefits for chronic pain, and for safety.",2014.0,77.0,141.0,"{'volume': '30', 'pages': '1089–1098', 'name': 'The Clinical Journal of Pain'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Garrett2014ARE,\n author = {Bernie Garrett and T.

Globally, access to evidence-based psychological treatment is limited. Innovative self-help methods using smartphone applications and low-cost virtual reality have the potential to significantly improve the accessibility and scalability of psychological treatments.


Objective
To examine the effectiveness of ZeroPhobia, a fully self-guided app-based virtual reality cognitive behavior therapy (VR CBT) using low-cost (cardboard) virtual reality goggles compared with a wait-list control group and to determine its user friendliness.


Design, Setting, and Participants
In a single-blind randomized clinical trial, participants were enrolled between March 24 and September 28, 2017, and randomly assigned (1:1) by an independent researcher to either VR CBT app or a wait-list control group. A total of 193 individuals aged 18 to 65 years from the Dutch general population with acrophobia symptoms and access to an Android smartphone participated. The 6 animated modules of the VR-CBT app and gamified virtual reality environments were delivered over a 3-week period in participants' natural environment. Assessments were completed at baseline, immediately after treatment, and at 3-month follow-up. Analysis began April 6, 2018, and was intention to treat.


Intervention
Self-guided app-based VR CBT.


Main Outcomes and Measures
The primary outcome measure was the Acrophobia Questionnaire. The hypothesis was formulated prior to data collection.


Results
In total, 193 participants (129 women [66.84%]; mean [SD] age, 41.33 [13.64] years) were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 96) or a wait-list control group (n = 97). An intent-to-treat analysis showed a significant reduction of acrophobia symptoms at posttest at 3 months for the VR-CBT app compared with the controls (b = -26.73 [95% CI, -32.12 to -21.34]; P < .001; d = 1.14 [95% CI, 0.84 to 1.44]). The number needed to treat was 1.7. Sensitivity and robustness analysis confirmed these findings. Pretreatment attrition was 22 of 96 (23%) because of smartphone incompatibility. Of the 74 participants who started using the VR-CBT app, 57 (77%) completed the intervention fully.


Conclusions and Relevance
A low-cost fully self-guided app-based virtual reality cognitive behavioral therapy with rudimentary virtual reality goggles can produce large acrophobia symptom reductions. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show that virtual reality acrophobia treatment can be done at home without the intervention of a therapist.

However, almost all previous studies of social avoidance were restricted to using self-reports for the study of intentional aspects of avoidance. In contrast, the current study used immersive virtual reality technology to measure interpersonal distance as an index of avoidance, an unintentional behavioural indicator. In a virtual supermarket, twenty-three female participants differing in social anxiety approached computer-generated persons (avatars) under the pretext of a cover story. During the task, different aspects of approach and avoidance were measured. The results confirmed the hypotheses: The more anxious participants were, the more slowly they approached the avatars, and the larger the distance they kept from the avatars.

This paper uses two studies to investigate the value of using Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) laboratory simulations in science education. In Study 1, 99 (52 male, 47 female) 7th (49) and 8th (50) grade students between 13 and 16 years of age used an IVR laboratory safety simulation with a pre- to post-test design. Results indicated an overall increase in interest in science and self-efficacy, but only females reported an increase in science career aspirations. Study 2 was conducted with 131 (47 male, 84 female) second (77) and third (54) year high school students aged 17 to 20 and used an experimental design to compare the value of using an IVR simulation or a video of the simulation on the topic of DNA-analysis.

The results demonstrated that moving displays of happiness, sadness, fear, surprise, anger and disgust were recognized more accurately than static displays of the white spots at the apex of the expressions. This indicated that facial motion, in the absence of information about the shape and position of facial features, is informative about these basic emotions. Normally illuminated dynamic displays of these expressions, however, were recognized more accurately than displays of moving spots. The relative effectiveness of upper and lower facial areas for the recognition of these six emotions was also investigated using normally illuminated and spots-only displays.

While novel metrics are proposed every year, a few popular metrics remain as the de facto metrics to evaluate tasks such as image captioning and machine translation, despite their known limitations. This is partly due to ease of use, and partly because researchers expect to see them and know how to interpret them. In this paper, we urge the community for more careful consideration of how they automatically evaluate their models by demonstrating important failure cases on multiple datasets, language pairs and tasks.

It has been used for assessments and training in social cognition with the use of virtual agents instead of face-to-face interactions – but its potential for the study of social emotion regulation has, perhaps surprisingly, largely remained untapped. The present study evaluates a novel immersive VR scenario designed to study the efficacy of social support by a virtual agent using a modified version of Cyberball, an established paradigm to induce the feeling of ostracism. Participants embodied a new pupil in a virtual school environment and played Cyberball, after which they either did or did not receive emotional support. Self-reports and psychophysiological markers demonstrated that the negative impact of social exclusion in Cyberball was successfully replicated, while participants also reported a significant improvement in emotional state after being supported by the virtual agent. These results indicate the potential of the developed scenario for research on social emotion regulation in immersive VR. Future studies could aim to test the efficacy of social support for people with difficulties in self-regulation, for example individuals with high social anxiety, with a view to developing training programs in VR.",2023.0,0.0,1.0,"{'volume': '18', 'pages': '4-27', 'name': 'Int.

It is thought to depend on an implicit coupling of action-outcome predictions and the sensory perception of the action. This concept is well-studied in the motor-domain, but less is known about agency during social interactions. It is clear that a sense of agency also occurs when we perform a social action (e. g. looking at someone’s eyes) and receiving feedback by another person (e. g. returning eye-contact). Here, we will refer to the experience of agency within a social interaction as the sense of social agency. The main aim of this article is to first, describe the concept of social agency and second review how virtual reality can help to simulate social interactions in order to systematically study self-experiences and social agency. Gaze-contingent eye-tracking paradigms represent a powerful tool in this endeavour, while we emphasise the importance of implementing ecologically valid, interactive stimuli. We furthermore propose a computational approach that can be useful to analyse such data based on the concept of predictive processing. Finally, we highlight the clinical relevance of this account and suggest how this approach can be helpful in providing a mechanistic description of social impairments across various psychiatric disorders. With this article, we attempt to review previous experimental work, suggest new methodological procedures and encourage future empirical research in the field.",2019.0,151.0,16.0,"{'volume': '18', 'pages': '17 - 31', 'name': 'i-com'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Brandi2019TheIS,\n author = {M.

We Appreciate the Comments of Diane","Theoretical models predict that overconndent investors trade excessively. We test this prediction by partitioning investors on gender. Psychological research demonstrates that, in areas such as nance, men are more overconndent than women. Thus, theory predicts that men will trade more excessively than women. Using account data for over 35,000 households from a large discount brokerage, we analyze the common stock investments of men and women from February 1991 through January 1997. We document that men trade 45 percent more than women. Trading reduces men's net returns by 2.65 percentage points a year as opposed to 1.72 percentage points for women. It's not what a man don't know that makes him a fool, but what he does know that ain't so. Josh Billings, nineteenth century American humorist It is diffcult to reconcile the volume of trading observed in equity markets with the trading needs of rational investors. Rational investors make periodic contributions and withdrawals from their investment portfolios, rebalance their portfolios, and trade to minimize their taxes. Those possessed of superior information may trade speculatively, although rational speculative traders will generally not choose to trade with each other. It is unlikely that rational trading needs account for a turnover rate of 76 percent on the New York Stock Exchange in 1998. 1 We believe there is a simple and powerful explanation for high levels of trading on nancial markets: overcondence.

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.",1997.0,47.0,69919.0,"{'volume': '9', 'pages': '1735-1780', 'name': 'Neural Computation'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hochreiter1997LongSM,\n author = {S.

Participants were an average of 39.8 years of age and 10.3 years postinjury; 74% of participants were male. Design:Randomized controlled trial with immediate, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up posttests. Interventions were 9 hours of computer-based training with a therapist. Measures:Diagnostic Assessment of Nonverbal Accuracy 2-Adult Faces; Emotional Inference From Stories Test; Empathy (Interpersonal Reactivity Index); and Irritability and Aggression (Neuropsychiatric Inventory). Results:The Faces Intervention did significantly better than the Control Intervention on the Diagnostic Assessment of Nonverbal Accuracy 2-Adult Faces (P = .031) posttreatment; no time effect or group interaction was observed. No other significant differences were noted for the Faces Intervention. No significant differences were observed between the Stories and the Control Interventions; however, a significant time effect was found for the Emotional Inference From Stories Test.

To curb the resulting complexity of models, Axelrod promoted the KISS principle: ‘Keep It Simple, Stupid’. But the community is divided and a new principle appeared: KIDS, ‘Keep It Descriptive, Stupid’. Richer models were thus developed for a variety of phenomena, while agent cognition still tends to be modelled with simple reactive particle-like agents. This is not always appropriate, in particular in the social sciences trying to account for the complexity of human behaviour. One solution is to model humans as belief, desire and intention (BDI) agents, an expressive paradigm using concepts from folk psychology, making it easier for modellers and users to understand the simulation. This paper provides a methodological guide to the use of BDI agents in social simulations, and an overview of existing methodologies and tools for using them.",2016.0,187.0,97.0,"{'volume': '31', 'pages': '207 - 238', 'name': 'The Knowledge Engineering Review'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Adam2016BDIAI,\n author = {C.

An important aspect of individual behaviour is emotion which plays a significant role in all aspects of human decision making. For example, heightened emotional states can lead people to take highly unexpected or irrational actions. One popular motivation for simulation of virtual crowds is to generate believable characters in movies and computer games. Recently the concept of serious games has been introduced in both academic and industrial circles. In this paper, we propose an emotion engine, based on modern appraisal theory, that is able to model various emotional crowd characteristics. This appraisal engine is capable of capturing the dynamics of emotional contagion and we show how different crowd composition can lead to different patterns of emotional contagion. In addition, we describe a serious game designed for training military personnel in peaceful crowd control. We evaluate this engine in the context of a property protection protest scenario where the players or soldiers are tasked to maintain a peaceful protest without violence. A systematic evaluation is presented which supports the facial validity of the emotion engine and our model of emotional contagion.",2011.0,17.0,24.0,"{'name': '2011 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conferences on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology', 'pages': '72-80', 'volume': '2'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Aydt2011ACM,\n author = {Heiko Aydt and M.

We designed a between-subjects study where 48 participants took part in a memorization task and observed a confederate mistreating a robot both verbally and physically. The robot was either empathetic towards the participant’s performance in the task or indifferent. When the robot was mistreated, it ignored the abuse, shut down in response to it, or reacted emotionally. We found that the majority of the participants intervened to help the robot after it was abused. Interventions happened for a wide range of reasons. Interestingly, the empathetic robot increased the proportion of participants that self-reported intervening in comparison to the indifferent robot, but more participants moved the robot as a response to abuse in the latter case. The participants also perceived the robot being verbally mistreated more and reported higher levels of personal distress when the robot briefly shut down after abuse in comparison to when it reacted emotionally or did not react at all.",2018.0,40.0,62.0,"{'pages': '169-177', 'name': '2018 13th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tan2018InducingBI,\n author = {Xiang Zhi Tan and Marynel Vázquez and E.

The underlying ideas include findings and paradigms in developmental psychology and neuroscience, neuroplasticity and long term term potentiation, fMRI studies on human bond making and religious experience, and experiments in energy based artificial neural networks. The proposed self-attachment therapeutic technique is distinguished by its intervention to create an internal and passionate affectional bond within the individual between the “adult self”, representing the logical and cognitive faculty, and the “inner child”, representing the unregulated and undeveloped emotional circuits. The aim is to create more optimal circuits for emotional regulation. The proposed self-attachment protocols internally emulate within the individual the interactions of a good enough primary care-giver and child in order to moderate the child's arousal level, minimise its negative affects and maximize its positive affects. These interactions are assumed, in developmental neuroscience and in developmental psychology, to be the basis of secure attachment of children with their parents, which leads to an optimal regulation of neurotransmitters, hormones, and the emotional dynamics of the individual. We report on several case studies of this technique in recent years. Finally, we propose a simple mathematical model to capture the impact of self-attachment protocols using the notion of strong patterns in energy based neural networks and employ a recently developed mathematical model to examine the impact of self-attachment using emotional and cognitive neural pathways for decision making.",2015.0,71.0,18.0,"{'pages': '1-8', 'name': '2015 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Edalat2015IntroductionTS,\n author = {A.

Clearly, negotiations represent motivated performance situations to interested partners. And, experimental negotiation tasks are no exception, including those involving real human players (Van Kleef, De Dreu, & Manstead, 2004) and digital agents (i.e., player representations driven by computer algorithms, de Melo, Carnevale, & Gratch, 2011). The current work examines individuals’ motivational responses, using physiological indexes, to emotionally expressive virtual characters in a multi-issue negotiation task. Specifically, we focus on the question of how situational context affects emotion perception from facial expressions. In person-to-agent negotiation tasks, experimenters often insert communicative cues such as agent facial expressions intended to strategically manipulate user’s emotions. Agents that show emotion have now been used in several domains such as education, entertainment, training, therapy and commerce (for a review see Beale & Creed, 2009). In a multi-issue negotiation task, de Melo and colleagues (2011) reported that participants made more concessions to a virtual human that displayed an angry facial expression compared to a happy facial expression. Most research on the effects of virtual characters’ emotional facial expressions has relied on subjective responses from participants (e.g., Beale & Creed, 2009). However, given the evidence that emotion is processed via non-conscious pathways, perhaps more so than conscious pathways (Tamietto & De Gelder, 2010), validated physiological measures related to affect should provide confirmation of the operation of non-conscious emotional processes involved in motivated performance tasks such as negotiation (Blascovich & Mendes, 2010). Abstract Affect is important in motivated performance situations such as negotiation. Longstanding theories of emotion suggest that facial expressions provide enough information to perceive another person’s internal affective state. Alternatively, the contextual emotion hypothesis posits that situational factors bias the perception of emotion in others’ facial displays. This hypothesis predicts that individuals will have different perceptions of the same facial expression depending upon the context in which the expression is displayed. In this study, cardiovascular indexes of motivational states (i.e., challenge vs. threat) were recorded while players engaged in a multi- issue negotiation where the opposing negotiator (confederate) displayed emotional facial expressions (angry vs. happy); the confederate’s negotiation strategy (cooperative vs. competitive) was factorially crossed with his facial expression. During the game, participants’ eye fixations and cardiovascular responses, indexing task engagement and challenge/threat motivation, were recorded. Results indicated that participants playing confederates with incongruent facial expressions (e.g., cooperative strategy, angry face) exhibited a greater threat response, which arises due to increased uncertainty. Eye fixations also suggest that participants look at the face more in order to acquire information to reconcile their uncertainty in the incongruent condition. Taken together, these results suggest that context matters in the perception of emotion. Keywords: facial expressions, negotiation, context in emotion Introduction Negotiation is relatively common in personal and professional settings. A child might ask a parent whether she can leave the dinner table. The parent might sternly command the child to finish her vegetables and the child could make a counter offer to finish the peas but not the broccoli. This could ensue into a strategic and emotionally charged social interaction. Emotion is an important human factor in motivated performance situations (i.e., those that are self-relevant and therefore task engaging and require instrumental cognitive responses; Blascovich, 2008).

Anxiety disorders are among the most frequently encountered psychiatric disorders. Recommended treatments include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and/or medication. In recent years, beneficial effects of virtual reality (VR) exposure therapy have been shown, making this technique a promising addition to CBT. However, the ability of VR to mimic threatening stimuli in a way comparable to in vivo cues has been discussed. In particular, it has been questioned whether VR is capable of provoking psychophysiological symptoms of anxiety. Since psychophysiological arousal is considered a prerequisite for effective exposure treatment, this systematic review aims to evaluate the evidence for the potential of VR exposure to evoke and modulate psychophysiological fear reactions. Methods. PubMed and PsycINFO/Academic Search Premier databases were searched. Thirty-eight studies investigating challenge or habituation effects were included. Results. VR exposure does provoke psychophysiological arousal, especially in terms of electrodermal activity. Results on psychophysiological habituation in VR are inconclusive. Study design and methodological rigour vary widely. Conclusions. Despite several limitations, this review provides evidence that VR exposure elicits psychophysiological fear reactions in patients and healthy subjects, rendering VR a promising treatment for anxiety disorders, and a potent research tool for future investigations of psychophysiological processes and their significance during exposure treatment.",2014.0,70.0,101.0,"{'volume': '15', 'pages': '427 - 442', 'name': 'The World Journal of Biological Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Diemer2014VirtualRE,\n author = {J.

Because there is currently no vaccine or treatment for the underlying infection, current health efforts are focused on providing prevention and screening, maintaining continuity of treatment for other chronic conditions, and ensuring access to appropriately intensive services for those with the most severe symptoms.1 Disasters disproportionately affect poor and vulnerable populations, and patients with serious mental illness may be among the hardest hit. High rates of smoking in this population may raise the risk of infection and confer a worse prognosis among those who develop the illness.2 Residential instability and homelessness can raise the risk of infection and make it harder to identify, follow up, and treat those who are infected.3 Individuals with serious mental illnesses who are employed may have challenges taking time off from work and may lack sufficient insurance coverage to cover testing or treatment. Small social networks may limit opportunities to obtain support from friends and family members should individuals with serious mental illness become ill. Taken together, these factors may lead to elevated infection rates and worse prognoses in this population. What strategies are available to mitigate the outcome of this epidemic among patients with serious mental illness? Federal preparedness policies developed in the wake of complex disasters have increasingly embraced the notion of whole community preparedness, which supports building and supporting structures at multiple levels to prepare and respond, particularly for vulnerable populations.4 Within the public mental health care system, this includes engagement with mental health service users, clinicians, and federal and state policies.",2020.0,5.0,369.0,{'name': 'JAMA psychiatry'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Druss2020AddressingTC,\n author = {B.

I want to use those episodes ? all of which have been described as forms of panic ? to make some points about social order and its breakdown, the general theme of these meetings, about theories of collective behavior, and briefly about sociology as well. On Memorial Day weekend of 1977, just 10 years ago, more than 160 people died fleeing a fire at the Beverly Hills Supper Club, just across the river from here. On the plaza outside Riverfront Coliseum, just a few blocks distant, 11 young people were killed in December of 1979 as part of a surge into a rock concert. And just two years ago, in March of 1985, anxious depositors precipitated a statewide bank run by queuing outside the Cincinnati branches of Home State Savings Bank, including the branch not far from Fountain Square, to withdraw funds threatened by the bank's reported losses. The concurrence last year of my leave, the availability of data, and, quite frankly, the pressures of writing something to present to you today, encourged me to examine these events in a systematic way.1 I had already incorporated discussions of each into my own collective behavior courses. Not enamored of the on-the-spot analyses and media discussions which relied on discredited views of collective behavior, I hoped to examine them more thoroughly within a contemporary approach related to the breakdown of social order.

Animal and human studies on neural pathways underlying social buffering typically examined physiological reactions or regional brain activations. However, direct links between emotional and social stimuli, distinct neural processes and behavioural outcomes are still missing. Using data of 27 female participants, the current study delineated a large-scale process model of social buffering’s neural underpinnings, connecting changes in neural activity to emotional behaviour by means of voxel-wise multilevel mediation analysis. Our results confirmed that three processes underlie human social buffering: (i) social support-related reduction of activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, anterior and mid-cingulate; (ii) downregulation of aversive emotion-induced brain activity in the superficial cortex-like amygdala and mediodorsal thalamus; and (iii) downregulation of reported aversive feelings. Results of the current study provide evidence for a distinct neural process model of aversive emotion regulation in humans by social buffering.",2020.0,57.0,8.0,"{'volume': '15', 'pages': '561 - 570', 'name': 'Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bratec2020YourPS,\n author = {Satja Mulej Bratec and Teresa Bertram and G.

In this paper, we explore one factor that may modulate children's language learning with a peer-like social robot: rapport. We explore connections between preschool children's learning, rapport, and emulation of the robot's language during a storytelling intervention. We performed a long-term field study in a preschool with 17 children aged 4–6 years. Children played a storytelling game with a social robot for 8 sessions over two months. For some children, the robot matched the level of its stories to the children's language ability, acting as a slightly more advanced peer (Matched condition); for the others, the robot did not match the story level (Unmatched condition). We examined children's use of target vocabulary words and key phrases used by the robot, children's emulation of the robot's stories during their own storytelling, and children's language style matching (LSM—a measure of overlap in function word use and speaking style associated with rapport and relationship) to see whether they mirrored the robot more over time. We found that not only did children emulate the robot more over time, but also, children who emulated more of the robot's phrases during storytelling scored higher on the vocabulary posttest. Children with higher LSM scores were more likely to emulate the robot's content words in their stories. Furthermore, the robot's personalization in the Matched condition led to increases in both children's emulation and their LSM scores. Together, these results suggest first, that interacting with a more advanced peer is beneficial for children, and second, that children's emulation of the robot's language may be related to their rapport and their learning. This is the first study to empirically support that rapport may be a modulating factor in children's peer learning, and furthermore, that a social robot can serve as an effective intervention for language development by leveraging this insight.",2019.0,130.0,53.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'Frontiers in Robotics and AI'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Westlund2019ALS,\n author = {J.

ASD has a high prevalence in children, affecting 1 in 160 subjects. Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as an effective tool for intervention in the health field. Different recent papers have reviewed the VR-based treatments in ASD, but they have an important limitation because they only use clinical databases and do not include important technical indexes such as the Web of Science index or the Scimago Journal & Country Rank. To our knowledge, this is the first contribution that has carried out an evidence-based systematic review including both clinical and technical databases about the effectiveness of VR-based intervention in ASD. The initial search identified a total of 450 records. After the exclusion of the papers that are not studies, duplicated articles, and the screening of the abstract and full text, 31 articles met the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison and Outcomes) criteria and were selected for analysis. The studies examined suggest moderate evidence about the effectiveness of VR-based treatments in ASD. VR can add many advantages to the treatment of ASD symptomatology, but it is necessary to develop consistent validations in future studies to state that VR can effectively complement the traditional treatments.",2018.0,57.0,199.0,"{'volume': '18', 'name': 'Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mesa-Gresa2018EffectivenessOV,\n author = {Patricia Mesa-Gresa and H.

This paper explores a naturalistic scenario in which children play chess with the iCat, a robot companion. A person-independent, Bayesian approach to detect the user's engagement with the iCat robot is presented. Our framework models both causes and effects of engagement: features related to the user's non-verbal behaviour, the task and the companion's affective reactions are identified to predict the children's level of engagement. An experiment was carried out to train and validate our model. Results show that our approach based on multimodal integration of task and social interaction-based features outperforms those based solely on non-verbal behaviour or contextual information (94.79 % vs. 93.75 % and 78.13 %).",2009.0,21.0,171.0,{'pages': '119-126'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Castellano2009DetectingUE,\n author = {Ginevra Castellano and André Pereira and Iolanda Leite and Ana Paiva and P.

Some researchers have shown that research participants trust smiling faces more than non-smiling faces.

In our experiment, images of 54 American and 69 Japanese male faces were initially rated for intensity of expression in the eyes and mouth, and for symmetry of the smile, by Japanese participants. The images were then presented to 142 American and 80 Japanese participants, who were asked to rate each face’s trustworthiness. The results showed that Japanese participants rated as more trustworthy faces with greater upper-half intensity and greater smile symmetry, but rated as less trustworthy faces with greater lower-half intensity.

Effects of Error, Task Type and Personality on Human-Robot Cooperation and Trust","How do mistakes made by a robot affect its trustworthiness and acceptance in human-robot collaboration? We investigate how the perception of erroneous robot behavior may influence human interaction choices and the willingness to cooperate with the robot by following a number of itsunusual requests. For this purpose, we conducted an experiment in which participants interacted with a home companion robot in one of two experimental conditions: (1) the correct modeor (2) the faulty mode. Our findings reveal that, while significantly affecting subjective perceptions of the robot and assessments of its reliability and trustworthiness, the robot’s performance does not seem to substantially influence participants’ decisions to (not) comply with its requests. However, our results further suggest that the nature of the task requested by the robot, e.g. whether its effects are revocable as opposed to irrevocable, has a significant impact on participants’ willingness to follow its instructions.",2015.0,23.0,459.0,"{'pages': '1-8', 'name': '2015 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Salem2015WouldYT,\n author = {Maha Salem and G.

There were three different types of audience behavior: an emotionally neutral audience that remained static throughout the talk, a positive audience that exhibited friendly and appreciative behavior towards the speaker, and a negative audience that exhibited hostile and bored expressions throughout the talk. A second factor was immersion: half of the forty subjects experienced the virtual seminar room through a head-tracked, head-mounted display and the remainder on a desktop system. Responses were measured using the standard Personal Report of Confidence as a Public Speaker (PRCS), which was elicited prior to the experiment and after each talk. Several other standard psychological measures such as SCL-90-R (for screening for psychological disorder), the SAD, and the FNE were also measured prior to the experiment. Other response variables included subjectively assessed somaticization and a subject self-rating scale on performance during the talk. The subjects gave the talk twice each to a different audience, but in the analysis only the results of the first talk are presented, thus making this a between-groups design. The results show that post-talk PRCS is significantly and positively correlated to PRCS measured prior to the experiment in the case only of the positive and static audiences. For the negative audience, prior PRCS was not a predictor of post-PRCS, which was higher than for the other two audiences and constant. The negative audience clearly provoked an anxiety response irrespective of the normal level of public speaking confidence of the subject. The somatic response also showed a higher level of anxiety for the negative audience than for the other two, but self-rating was generally higher only for the static audience, each of these results taking into account prior PRCS.",2002.0,34.0,512.0,"{'volume': '11', 'pages': '68-78', 'name': 'Presence: Teleoperators & Virtual Environments'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Pertaub2002AnEO,\n author = {David-Paul Pertaub and M.

Several simulation pedestrian crowd models have been proposed such as cellular automata models, agent-based models, regression models, etc. It is very important to note that agent based models are able, over others approaches to provide a natural description of the system and then to capture emergent phenomena and complex human behaviors. Usually, these models include psychological theories in order to obtain a more realistic simulation of pedestrian's behavior. However, a great number of them do not cover all the psychological factors necessary for a pedestrian located in a crowd. This causes a lack of realism. Thus, we propose a multi-agent simulation model which is based on psychological theories. It takes into account the major normal conditions of a simple pedestrian situated in a crowd such as his preferences, a realistic perception of the environment in which he is situated, etc. Our objective is to simulate realistically the pedestrian crowd phenomenon towards a simulation of a believable pedestrian behavior. The conducted experiments show that our model is able to produce realistic pedestrian behaviors.",2011.0,43.0,26.0,"{'pages': '150-156', 'name': '2011 4th International Conference on Logistics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Beltaief2011MultiagentSM,\n author = {Olfa Beltaief and Sameh El Hadouaj and K.

We assume all nodes in the network are in the susceptible state initially except the information source which is in the infected state. Susceptible nodes may then be infected by infected nodes, and infected nodes may recover and will not be infected again after recovery. Given a snapshot of the network, from which we know all infected nodes but cannot distinguish susceptible nodes and recovered nodes, the problem is to find the information source based on the snapshot and the network topology. We develop a sample path based approach where the estimator of the information source is chosen to be the root node associated with the sample path that most likely leads to the observed snapshot. We prove for infinite-trees, the estimator is a node that minimizes the maximum distance to the infected nodes. A reverse-infection algorithm is proposed to find such an estimator in general graphs. We prove that for g-regular trees such that gq > 1, where g is the node degree and q is the infection probability, the estimator is within a constant distance from the actual source with high probability, independent of the number of infected nodes and the time the snapshot is taken. Our simulation results show that for tree networks, the estimator produced by the reverse-infection algorithm is closer to the actual source than the one identified by the closeness centrality heuristic.",2012.0,24.0,291.0,"{'pages': '1-9', 'name': '2013 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zhu2012InformationSD,\n author = {Kai Zhu and Lei Ying},\n journal = {2013 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)},\n pages = {1-9},\n title = {Information source detection in the SIR model: A sample path based approach},\n year = {2012}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '48442503', 'name': 'Kai Zhu'}, {'authorId': '145404653', 'name': 'Lei Ying'}]"

In the first model, the meaning of an emotion word is represented by IT2 FSs on valence, activation, and dominance scales. In the second model, the meaning of an emotion word is represented by answers to an open-ended set of questions from the game of Emotion Twenty Questions (EMO20Q). The notion of meaning in the two proposed models is made explicit using the Frege an framework of extensional and intensional components of meaning. Inter- and intra-subject uncertainty is captured by using IT2 FSs learned from interval approach surveys. Similarity and subsethood operators are used for comparing the meaning of pairs of words. For the first model, we apply similarity and subsethood operators for the task of translating one emotional vocabulary, represented as a computing with words (CWW) codebook, to another. This act of translation is shown to be an example of CWW that is extended to use the three scales of valence, activation, and dominance to represent a single variable. We experimentally evaluate the use of the first model for translations and mappings between vocabularies. Accuracy is high when using a small emotion vocabulary as an output, but performance decreases when the output vocabulary is larger. The second model was devised to deal with larger emotion vocabularies, but presents interesting technical challenges in that the set of scales underlying two different emotion words may not be the same. We evaluate the second model by comparing it with results from a single-slider survey. We discuss the theoretical insights that the two models allow and the advantages and disadvantages of each.",2013.0,53.0,38.0,"{'volume': '8', 'pages': '34-49', 'name': 'IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kazemzadeh2013FuzzyLM,\n author = {Ebrahim (Abe) Kazemzadeh and Sungbok Lee and Shrikanth S.

The media equation posits that human-agent interaction mirrors the social cues prevalent in human-to-human relationship. As such, personality adaptation-convergence (similarity-attraction) and divergence (complementary-attraction) in human-agent interaction have been explored, particularly in the context of e-commerce, robot and scenario-based simulation. The present work extends prior studies by investigating personality adaptation in learner-agent interaction with respect to a virtual learning system. Pursuant to this goal, an introverted and an extroverted pedagogical agent were developed, as operationalized through vocal and animation parameters, and were then assessed by forty introverted and forty extraverted learners in a 2 (agent personality type) X 2 (learner personality type) experiment. The results of this study provided clear evidences in support of the complementary-attraction principle; emotional and motivational aspects of learning were significantly enhanced when the pedagogical agent exhibited personality (extraversion type) that complemented the learner's own.

This article addresses these questions by examining the interaction between representation and intelligence in user interfaces. The rubric representation covers at least three topics in this context: (1) how a computational system is represented in its user interface, (2) how the interface conveys its representations of information and the world to human users, and (3) how the system's internal representation affects the human user's interaction with the system. I argue that each of these kinds of representation (of the system, information and the world, the interaction) is key to how users make the kind of attributions of intelligence that facilitate their interactions with intelligent systems. In this vein, it makes sense to represent a systmem as a human in those cases where social collaborative behavior is key and for the system to represent its knowledge to humans in multiple ways on multiple modalities. I demonstrate these claims by discussing issues of representation and intelligence in an embodied conversational agent -- an interface in which the system is represented as a person, information is conveyed to human users by multiple modalities such as voice and hand gestures, and the internal representation is modality independent and both propositional and nonpropositional.",2001.0,34.0,293.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '67-84', 'name': 'AI Mag.'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cassell2001EmbodiedCA,\n author = {Justine Cassell},\n journal = {AI Mag.},\n pages = {67-84},\n title = {Embodied Conversational Agents: Representation and Intelligence in User Interfaces},\n volume = {22},\n year = {2001}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '145431806', 'name': 'Justine Cassell'}]"

Contrary to other crowd simulation systems, which often focus on the movement of the entire crowd, our method distinguishes between active agents that try to manoeuvre through the crowd, and passive agents that have no incentive to move. We introduce the concept of a focus point to influence crowd agent orientation.

The concept itself requires a wider view of normativity than the narrow positivist one of law as command. It is certainly protean, ranging over many fundamental questions about the changing nature of the public sphere of politics and the state, and its interactions with the ‘private’ sphere of economic activity and social relations, as well as the mediation of these interactions, especially through law. This survey aims to outline and evaluate some of the main contours of the field as it has developed in this recent period, focusing on the regulation of economic activity. Regulation is seen as having emerged with the withdrawal by governments from direct provision of many economic and social services, to be replaced by corporatist bureaucracies and quasi-public agencies managing the complex public–private interactions of financialized capitalism. The arguments for ‘smart’ regulation have, in an era fixated on neo-liberalism, generally legitimized delegation of responsibility to big business. Its advocates, having been drawn into policy fields, have perhaps too often lost their critical edge, and allowed it to become instrumentalized, reflecting the technicist character of its practice.",2017.0,0.0,560.0,"{'volume': '26', 'pages': '676 - 699', 'name': 'Social & Legal Studies'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Picciotto2017Regulation,\n author = {S.

The work is motivated by the aim to provide technology with competences in perceiving and producing the emotional and nonverbal behaviors required to sustain a conversational dialogue. We present the Sensitive Artificial Listener (SAL) scenario as a setting which seems particularly suited for the study of emotional and nonverbal behavior since it requires only very limited verbal understanding on the part of the machine. This scenario allows us to concentrate on nonverbal capabilities without having to address at the same time the challenges of spoken language understanding, task modeling, etc. We first report on three prototype versions of the SAL scenario in which the behavior of the Sensitive Artificial Listener characters was determined by a human operator. These prototypes served the purpose of verifying the effectiveness of the SAL scenario and allowed us to collect data required for building system components for analyzing and synthesizing the respective behaviors. We then describe the fully autonomous integrated real-time system we created, which combines incremental analysis of user behavior, dialogue management, and synthesis of speaker and listener behavior of a SAL character displayed as a virtual agent. We discuss principles that should underlie the evaluation of SAL-type systems.

However, although the Big Five factors are held to be orthogonal, they are not orthogonal in previous marker sets developed for them. The author describes methods for creating relatively orthogonal marker sets for orthogonal factors and demonstrates that the Big Five can be operationalized in relatively orthogonal marker scales. The three marker sets presented are a 40-item short form of Goldberg's 100 unipolar markers (Ortho-Markers), a new set of Modular Markers built with item parcels, and a 40-item short form of these (Mini-Modular Markers [the 3M40]). The new Big Five marker sets are shown to have markedly lower interscale correlations, with no loss of validity, relative to previous marker sets with comparable numbers of items. This indicates that the nonorthogonality of previous Big Five marker scales is less a property of the Big Five model than an unintended outcome of commonly used scale construction procedures.",2002.0,35.0,175.0,"{'volume': '36', 'pages': '1-31', 'name': 'Journal of Research in Personality'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Saucier2002OrthogonalMF,\n author = {G.

Background: Research has revealed that the reliability of imperfect automation is frequently misperceived. We examined the manner in which the easiness and type of imperfect automation errors affect trust and dependence. Method: Participants performed a target detection task utilizing an automated aid. In Study 1, the aid missed targets either on easy trials (easy miss group) or on difficult trials (difficult miss group). In Study 2, we manipulated both easiness and type of error (miss vs. false alarm). The aid erred on either difficult trials alone (difficult errors group) or on difficult and easy trials (easy miss group; easy false alarm group). Results: In both experiments, easy errors led to participants mistrusting and disagreeing more with the aid on difficult trials, as compared with those using aids that generated only difficult errors. This resulted in a downward shift in decision criterion for the former, leading to poorer overall performance. Misses and false alarms led to similar effects.

Purpose
This study aims to examine if a pedagogical agent’s expressed anger, when framed as a feedback cue, can enhance mental effort and learning performance in a multimedia learning environment than expressed happiness.


Design/methodology/approach
A between-subjects experiment was conducted in which learners engaged with a multimedia learning material that taught programming algorithms, featuring a pedagogical agent who expressed anger or happiness as a feedback cue in response to the learners’ prior performance. Learners completed a self-reported scale and post-test for measuring mental effort and learning performance, respectively.


Findings
Female learners reported higher mental effort and had better learning performance when the pedagogical agent expressed anger than happiness. Male learners reported marginally lower mental effort when the pedagogical agent expressed anger than happiness.


Originality/value
This study focuses on a pedagogical agent’s expressed emotion as social information to learners. Extending from research advocating a pedagogical agent’s positive emotional expression, this study highlights the potential benefits of a pedagogical agent’s negative emotional expression, such as anger, as a cue for learners to enhance learning effort and performance in a multimedia learning environment.

Many researchers have focused on providing natural interactions for humanoid avatars or even for robots with the use of camera tracking, gloves, giving them the ability to speak, brain interfaces and other devices. This paper provides a new multimodal interaction control for avatars by combining brain signals, facial muscle tension recognition and glove tracking to change the facial expression of humanoid avatars according to the user's emotional condition. The signals from brain activity and muscle movements are used as the emotional stimulator, while the glove acts as emotion intensity control for the avatar. This multimodal interface can determine when the humanoid avatar needs to change their facial expression or their walking power. The results show that humanoid avatar have different timelines of walking and facial expressions when the user stimulates them with different emotions.

This research focuses on the potential ability of animated avatars (a digital representation of the user) and virtual agents (a digital representation of a coach, buddy, or teacher) to deliver computer-based interventions for adolescents' chronic weight management. An exploration of the acceptance and desire of teens to interact with avatars and virtual agents for self-management and behavioral modification was undertaken.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The utilized approach was inspired by community-based participatory research. Data was collected from 2 phases: Phase 1) focus groups with teens, provider interviews, parent interviews; and Phase 2) mid-range prototype assessment by teens and providers.


RESULTS
Data from all stakeholder groups expressed great interest in avatars and virtual agents assisting self-management efforts. Adolescents felt the avatars and virtual agents could: 1) reinforce guidance and support, 2) fit within their lifestyle, and 3) help set future goals, particularly after witnessing the effect of their current behavior(s) on the projected physical appearance (external and internal organs) of avatars. Teens wanted 2 virtual characters: a virtual agent to act as a coach or teacher and an avatar (extension of themselves) to serve as a ""buddy"" for empathic support and guidance and as a surrogate for rewards. Preferred modalities for use include both mobile devices to accommodate access and desktop to accommodate preferences for maximum screen real estate to support virtualization of functions that are more contemplative and complex (e.g., goal setting). Adolescents expressed a desire for limited co-user access, which they could regulate. Data revealed certain barriers and facilitators that could affect adoption and use.


DISCUSSION
The current study extends the support of teens, parents, and providers for adding avatars or virtual agents to traditional computer-based interactions. Data supports the desire for a personal relationship with a virtual character in support of previous studies. The study provides a foundation for further work in the area of avatar-driven motivational interviewing.


CONCLUSIONS
This study provides evidence supporting the use of avatars and virtual agents, designed using participatory approaches, to be included in the continuum of care. Increased probability of engagement and long-term retention of overweight, obese adolescent users and suggests expanding current chronic care models toward more comprehensive, socio-technical representations.",2016.0,40.0,51.0,"{'volume': '23 1', 'pages': '\n          19-28\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{LeRouge2016EngagingAI,\n author = {C.

More recently, work on both human and non–human primates has suggested that social groups are often hierarchically structured. We combine data on human grouping patterns in a comprehensive and systematic study. Using fractal analysis, we identify, with high statistical confidence, a discrete hierarchy of group sizes with a preferred scaling ratio close to three: rather than a single or a continuous spectrum of group sizes, humans spontaneously form groups of preferred sizes organized in a geometrical series approximating 3–5, 9–15, 30–45, etc. Such discrete scale invariance could be related to that identified in signatures of herding behaviour in financial markets and might reflect a hierarchical processing of social nearness by human brains.",2004.0,54.0,490.0,"{'volume': '272', 'pages': '439 - 444', 'name': 'Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zhou2004DiscreteHO,\n author = {Wei‐Xing Zhou and D.

This has led to four institutionalized mechanisms for regulating the experience and expression of emotion in the workplace: (1) neutralizing, (2) buffering, (3) prescribing, and (4) normalizing emotion. In contrast to this perspective, we argue that emotionality and rationality are interpenetrated, emotions are an integral and inseparable part of organizational life, and emotions are often functional for the organization.

Our algorithm applies the Bayesian Theory of Mind approach to make inferences about the avatar's hidden intentions based on the observed proxemics and gaze-based cues. Our approach accounts for the potential irrationality in human behavior, as well as the dynamic nature of an individual's intentions. The inferred intent is used to guide the response of the virtual agent and generate locomotion and gaze-based behaviors. Our overall approach allows the user to actively interact with tens of virtual agents from a first-person perspective in an immersive setting. We systematically evaluate our inference algorithm in controlled multi-agent simulation environments and highlight its ability to reliably and efficiently infer the hidden intent of a user's avatar even under noisy conditions. We quantitatively demonstrate the performance benefits of our approach in terms of reducing false inferences, as compared to a prior method. The results of our user evaluation show that 68.18% of participants reported feeling more comfortable in sharing the virtual environment with agents simulated with our algorithm as compared to a prior inference method, likely as a direct result of significantly fewer false inferences and more plausible responses from the virtual agents.",2019.0,49.0,13.0,"{'volume': '25', 'pages': '2113-2122', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Narang2019InferringUI,\n author = {S.

774,395761daa9391ab50d90964aa603fce5c296b4b0,Preliminary Exploration of Agent-Human Emotional Contagion via Static Expressions,"In social psychology, emotional contagion describes the widely observed phenomenon of one person’s emotions mimicking surrounding people’s emotions [13]. While it has been observed in humanhuman interactions, no known studies have examined its existence in agent-human interactions. As virtual characters make their way into high-risk, high-impact applications such as psychotherapy and military training with increasing frequency, the emotional impact of the agents’ expressions must be accurately understood to avoid undesirable repercussions. In this paper, we perform a battery of experiments to explore the existence of agent-human emotional contagion. The first study is a between-subjects design, wherein subjects were shown an image of a character’s face with either a neutral or happy expression. Findings indicate that even a still image induces a very strong increase in self-reported happiness between Neutral and Happy conditions with all characters tested and, to our knowledge, is the first ever study explicitly showing emotional contagion from a virtual agent to a human. We also examine the effects of participant gender, participant ethnicity, character attractiveness, and perceived character happiness and find that only perceived character happiness has a substantial impact on emotional contagion. In a second study, we examine the effect of a virtual character’s presence in a strategic situation by presenting subjects with a modernized Stag Hunt game. Our experiments show that the contagion effect is substantially dampened and does not cause a consistent impact on behavior. A third study explores the impact of the strategic decision within the Stag Hunt and conducts the same experiment using a description of the same strategic situation with the decision already made. We find that the emotional impact returns again, particularly for women, implying that the contagion effect is substantially lessened in the presence of a strategic decision.",2012.0,30.0,0.0,"{'name': '', 'volume': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Tsai2012PreliminaryEO,\n author = {J.

It is crucial that the parameters of these models are calibrated carefully and ultimately it will be of interest to compare competing models to decide which model is best suited for a particular purpose. In this contribution, I demonstrate how Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), which is already a popular tool in other areas of science, can be used for model fitting and model selection in a pedestrian dynamics context. I fit two different models for pedestrian dynamics to data on a crowd passing in one direction through a bottleneck. One model describes movement in continuous-space, the other model is a cellular automaton and thus describes movement in discrete-space. In addition, I compare models to data using two metrics. The first is based on egress times and the second on the velocity of pedestrians in front of the bottleneck. My results show that while model fitting is successful, a substantial degree of uncertainty about the value of some model parameters remains after model fitting. Importantly, the choice of metric in model fitting can influence parameter estimates. Model selection is inconclusive for the egress time metric but supports the continuous-space model for the velocity-based metric. These findings show that ABC is a flexible approach and highlights the difficulties associated with model fitting and model selection for pedestrian dynamics. ABC requires many simulation runs and choosing appropriate metrics for comparing data to simulations requires careful attention. Despite this, I suggest ABC is a promising tool, because it is versatile and easily implemented for the growing number of openly available crowd simulators and data sets.",2020.0,21.0,7.0,"{'volume': 'abs/2001.10330', 'name': 'ArXiv'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bode2020ParameterCI,\n author = {N.

Going through very dense groups or around huge ones would not seem natural and could break any sense of presence in a virtual environment. This paper aims to enable crowd simulators to handle such situations correctly. To this end, we need to understand how real humans decide to go through or around groups. As a first hypothesis, we apply the Principle of Minimum Energy (PME) on different group sizes and density. According to this principle, a walker should go around small and dense groups whereas he should go through large and sparse groups. Such principle has already been used for crowd simulation; the novelty here is to apply it to decide on a global avoidance strategy instead of local adaptations only. Our study quantifies decision thresholds. However, PME leaves some inconclusive situations for which the two solutions paths have similar energetic costs. In a second part, we propose an experiment to corroborate PME decisions thresholds with real observations. As controlling the factors of an experiment with many people is extremely hard, we propose to use Virtual Reality as a new method to observe human behavior. This work represents the first crowd simulation algorithm component directly designed from a VR-based study. We also consider the role of secondary factors in inconclusive situations. We show the influence of the group appearance and direction of relative motion in the decision process. Finally, we draw some guidelines to integrate our conclusions to existing crowd simulators and show an example of such integration.

In this paper, we present an approach to developing conversational narratives that addresses such limitations. Toward this end, we present the Chimeria platform, which uses a cognitive science-grounded model of social category membership to customize how conversational narratives unfold. We also present a playable interactive conversational scenario called “Chimeria:Gatekeeper” authored using the Chimeria Platform. This scenario demonstrates how the system considers multiple aspects of a character’s identity and degree of membership with, and between, social group categories in generating conversational dialog between a player character (PC) and an NPC.

On the basis of findings, it appeared that women more often conform to feminine display rules, which require the suppression of negative emotions and the simulation of positive emotions. In contrast, men more often adopted masculine display rules, which require the suppression of positive emotions and the simulation of negative ones. For both men and women, emotional dissonance generated by a feminine display-rule pattern was positively correlated with feelings of personal inauthenticity at work. Gender modified the relationship between emotional dissonance and gender only in that women who adopted the masculine display-rule pattern reported feeling the least personally inauthentic of all.",2004.0,42.0,176.0,"{'volume': '89 4', 'pages': '\n          715-21\n        ', 'name': 'The Journal of applied psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Simpson2004GenderDE,\n author = {P.

787,3a1c1bf83e46bcaf37989e0e45af5aeaf581f8f0,Automatic mimicry reactions as related to differences in emotional empathy.,"The hypotheses of this investigation were derived by conceiving of automatic mimicking as a component of emotional empathy. Differences between subjects high and low in emotional empathy were investigated. The parameters compared were facial mimicry reactions, as represented by electromyographic (EMG) activity when subjects were exposed to pictures of angry or happy faces, and the degree of correspondence between subjects' facial EMG reactions and their self-reported feelings. The comparisons were made at different stimulus exposure times in order to elicit reactions at different levels of information processing. The high-empathy subjects were found to have a higher degree of mimicking behavior than the low-empathy subjects, a difference that emerged at short exposure times (17-40 ms) that represented automatic reactions. The low-empathy subjects tended already at short exposure times (17-40 ms) to show inverse zygomaticus muscle reactions, namely ""smiling"" when exposed to an angry face. The high-empathy group was characterized by a significantly higher correspondence between facial expressions and self-reported feelings. No differences were found between the high- and low-empathy subjects in their verbally reported feelings when presented a happy or an angry face. Thus, the differences between the groups in emotional empathy appeared to be related to differences in automatic somatic reactions to facial stimuli rather than to differences in their conscious interpretation of the emotional situation.",2002.0,78.0,367.0,"{'volume': '43 5', 'pages': '\n          433-43\n        ', 'name': 'Scandinavian journal of psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sonnby-Borgström2002AutomaticMR,\n author = {M.

However, as the positions of crowd usually change dynamically, computing the contagion process becomes a challenge. There exists a solution for a similar problem, the N-body problem, but it's too time consuming to be adapted in crowd simulation as it needs to calculate the reactions between every two objects. In order to solve this problem, we provided a fast adjacent test and contagion computing algorithm with GPU acceleration. Firstly individuals' affection fields were set and projected onto two dimensional ground and represented by squares of the same size; secondly the whole ground was divided into squares as the same size as those for the affection projection; thirdly, adjacent squares were tested to generate the nearer neighbors and the contagion results were calculated.

The sample consisted of 31 adults suffering from snake phobia. The study featured a randomized within-between design with two conditions and three counterbalanced immersions: (a) a baseline control immersion (BASELINE), (b) an immersion in a threatening and anxiety-inducing environment (ANX), and (c) an immersion in a nonthreatening environment that should not induce anxiety (NOANX). In the NOANX environment, participants were immersed for 5 min in a virtual Egyptian desert. They were told that the environment was safe and contained no snakes. The ANX immersion was identical, except that participants were led to believe that a multitude of hidden and dangerous snakes were lurking in the environment. A period of distraction (reading a text on relaxation) separated the ANX and NOANX immersions. Experimenters recorded presence and anxiety in the middle of and after each VR immersion. These brief measures of presence supported our hypothesis and were significantly higher in the anxious immersion than in the baseline or the nonanxious immersion. This finding was not corroborated by the presence questionnaire, where scores varied significantly in the opposite direction. The results from the brief one-item measures of presence support the significant contribution of emotions felt during the immersion on the subjective feeling of presence.

The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle system, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the ""animator.""

However, they have been attacked as a category, incorrectly assuming there is a generic version that applies to all. We identify and respond to 5 main lines of argument made by such critics. We agree that some of these arguments have force against some of the theories in the literature but believe them to be overstated. We argue that the dual-processing distinction is supported by much recent evidence in cognitive science. Our preferred theoretical approach is one in which rapid autonomous processes (Type 1) are assumed to yield default responses unless intervened on by distinctive higher order reasoning processes (Type 2).

Our formulation is an extension of the Velocity Obstacle concept [3], which was introduced for navigation among (passively) moving obstacles. Our approach takes into account the reactive behavior of the other agents by implicitly assuming that the other agents make a similar collision-avoidance reasoning. We show that this method guarantees safe and oscillation- free motions for each of the agents. We apply our concept to navigation of hundreds of agents in densely populated environments containing both static and moving obstacles, and we show that real-time and scalable performance is achieved in such challenging scenarios.",2008.0,25.0,1374.0,"{'pages': '1928-1935', 'name': '2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Berg2008ReciprocalVO,\n author = {J.

805,3b66cb22cdafa969e8720d9003acc7e92b0bf86e,How can we measure awareness? An overview of current methods,"It would be pushing at an open door to state that the study of consciousness is challenging because it attempts to develop an epistemically objective approach to a phenomenon that is ontologically subjective (Searle 1997). How can I objectively have access to what another person thinks or experiences? Can a person him-/herself objectively assess or report what he/she thinks? Does introspection afford privileged access, or is it merely glorified heterophenomenology? And even if introspection were truly reliable, do introspective reports reflect one’s actual phenomenological experience, or merely an interpretation thereof in light of task demands? These challenges, which present themselves in a particularly harsh light when it comes to establishing unconscious information processing, reflect the fact that the study of consciousness requires a solution to the following fundamental—and as yet unsolved—problem: How can we measure consciousness? While there has been substantial progress in measuring the level of awareness (Casali et al. 2013; Sitt et al. 2014), and we have made steady progress delineating the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) (Boly et al. 2013), we do not know of any instrument or method that makes it possible to measure the contents of awareness directly (Seth et al. 2008). Having such an instrument (i.e. a consciousness-meter) would make it possible to establish clear relationships between an external state of affairs, people’s subjective experience of this state of affairs, and their overt behavior. However, neither does such an instrument exists nor can we conceive of any way of building it (though some are trying; Haynes and Rees 2005; Kamitani and Tong 2005; Formisano et al. 2008; Haynes 2009). Thus, today, the best we can do to find out what someone currently experiences is to ask them to produce a report about it. Verbal report is the most direct method we can use to find out if a person is aware of some knowledge. But this, as appealing as it is, is fraught with complexity: people may refrain from or simply be unable to report on vague experiences; reports are typically not obtained at the time the experience occurs; people may be biased in different ways that often interact with each other (see Newell and Shanks, 2014, for a potent list of caveats). Even introspection—first-person data per excellence—has demonstrable limits (Nisbett and Wilson 1977; Johansson et al. 2006; Carruthers 2009). For these reasons, many authors have rejected subjective methods altogether and have",2015.0,104.0,129.0,"{'volume': '', 'pages': '21-46', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Timmermans2015HowCW,\n author = {Bert Timmermans and Axel Cleeremans and M.

807,3bc9e95f81e014099e7d2e0ad2c06a740410a518,Evolutionarily conserved role of oxytocin in social fear contagion in zebrafish,"Emotional contagion is the most ancestral form of empathy. We tested to what extent the proximate mechanisms of emotional contagion are evolutionarily conserved by assessing the role of oxytocin, known to regulate empathic behaviors in mammals, in social fear contagion in zebrafish. Using oxytocin and oxytocin receptor mutants, we show that oxytocin is both necessary and sufficient for observer zebrafish to imitate the distressed behavior of conspecific demonstrators. The brain regions associated with emotional contagion in zebrafish are homologous to those involved in the same process in rodents (e.g., striatum, lateral septum), receiving direct projections from oxytocinergic neurons located in the pre-optic area. Together, our results support an evolutionary conserved role for oxytocin as a key regulator of basic empathic behaviors across vertebrates. Description Fundamentals of empathy Emotional contagion, in which individuals display fear or distress behaviors in response to observations of the same in another, is considered a basal form of empathy and is known to occur in fishes. Akinrinade et al. have shown that the neuropeptide oxytocin is responsible for these behaviors in zebrafish, as it is in mammals (see the Perspective by DeAngelis and Hofmann). They also found that the same regions of the brain are involved in zebrafish and in mammals. Such homologies in emotional response mechanisms across fishes and mammals suggest that this most basal form of empathy could have evolved many, many millions of years ago. —SNV Oxytocin plays an evolutionarily conserved role for as a regulator of basic empathic behaviors across vertebrates.",2023.0,45.0,10.0,"{'volume': '379', 'pages': '1232 - 1237', 'name': 'Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Akinrinade2023EvolutionarilyCR,\n author = {I.

Mind perception also modulates the attitudes we have toward others, and determines the degree of empathy, prosociality, and morality invested in social interactions. Seeing mind in others is not exclusive to human agents, but mind can also be ascribed to non-human agents like robots, as long as their appearance and/or behavior allows them to be perceived as intentional beings. Previous studies have shown that human appearance and reliable behavior induce mind perception to robot agents, and positively affect attitudes and performance in human–robot interaction. What has not been investigated so far is whether different triggers of mind perception have an independent or interactive effect on attitudes and performance in human–robot interaction. We examine this question by manipulating agent appearance (human vs. robot) and behavior (reliable vs. random) within the same paradigm and examine how congruent (human/reliable vs. robot/random) versus incongruent (human/random vs. robot/reliable) combinations of these triggers affect performance (i.e., gaze following) and attitudes (i.e., agent ratings) in human–robot interaction. The results show that both appearance and behavior affect human–robot interaction but that the two triggers seem to operate in isolation, with appearance more strongly impacting attitudes, and behavior more strongly affecting performance. The implications of these findings for human–robot interaction are discussed.",2017.0,100.0,74.0,"{'volume': '8', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Abubshait2017YouLH,\n author = {A.

A closer look at the empirical evidence, however, reveals that although these two phenomena often co-occur, the changes in emotional expressions may not necessarily be causally linked to the changes in subjective emotional experience. Here, we directly investigate this link, by testing a model in which facial activity served as a mediator between the observed emotional displays and subsequently felt emotions (i.e. emotional contagion). Participants watched videos of different senders displaying happiness, anger, or sadness, while their facial activity was recorded. After each video, participants rated their own emotions and assessed the senders’ likeability and competence. Participants both mimicked and reported feeling the emotions displayed by the senders. Moreover, their facial activity partially explained the association between the senders’ emotional displays and self-reported emotions, thereby supporting the notion that facial mimicry may be involved in emotional contagion.",2020.0,33.0,50.0,"{'volume': '34', 'pages': '367 - 376', 'name': 'Cognition and Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Olszanowski2020MimickingAS,\n author = {M.

 Although there has been significant research on emotions, from a computational perspective, one area scarcely explored is the process of Emotional Contagion (EC). Emotional Contagion is the process through which a person's emotional state is influenced by other people's emotions. This process is especially important in group situations where the emotional states of individuals influence the behavior of others.
 Our goal was to develop a computational model, based on the Emotional Contagion Scale (ECS), that would enrich group dynamics on virtual environments. This model supports agents with different susceptibilities to contagion, and also the influence of their extroversion personality trait and interpersonal relationships (intimacy and power difference) on the contagion process. It has been also included the process of emotional mood decay, as observed in humans. With these elements characterizing the agents at an individual level, this model can simulate a wide variety of social phenomena.
 To evaluate the model, we developed a game prototype where the player (the main character) goes on a journey with two other characters (one with and another without our model).
 The results suggest that players perceived differences in the emotional contagion susceptibility between those characters and considered the model-based agent significantly more enjoyable and friendlier.",2011.0,20.0,12.0,{'pages': '2'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Dimas2011ImHI,\n author = {Joana Dimas and G.

Yet, what intrinsic motivation may mean computationally, and how it may differ from extrinsic motivation, remains a murky and controversial subject. In this paper, we adopt an evolutionary perspective and define a new optimal reward framework that captures the pressure to design good primary reward functions that lead to evolutionary success across environments. The results of two computational experiments show that optimal primary reward signals may yield both emergent intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. The evolutionary perspective and the associated optimal reward framework thus lead to the conclusion that there are no hard and fast features distinguishing intrinsic and extrinsic reward computationally.

Neural mechanisms mediating positive consequences of observing someone being imitated,"Social psychological and developmental research revealed that imitation serves a fundamental social function. It has been shown that human beings have the tendency to automatically mirror the behavior of others—the so-called chameleon effect. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that being imitated leads to positive feelings toward the imitator. But why do we feel more positive about someone who imitates us? In the current fMRI study we aimed at exploring the neural correlates of the positive consequences of being imitated by means of an observation paradigm. Our results indicate that being imitated compared to not being imitated activates brain areas that have been associated with emotion and reward processing, namely medial orbitofrontal cortex/ventromedial prefrontal cortex (mOFC/vmPFC, GLM whole-brain contrast). Moreover mOFC/vmPFC shows higher effective connectivity with striatum and mid-posterior insula during being imitated compared to not being imitated.",2010.0,58.0,73.0,"{'volume': '5', 'pages': '384 - 392', 'name': 'Social Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kühn2010WhyDI,\n author = {S.

Nonetheless, even the transparent bipolar scales proved less robust as factor markers than did parallel sets of adjectives administered in unipolar format.

In this paper we show that the spectral density of hierarchical networks follows a very different pattern, which can be used as a fingerprint of modularity.

831,3e4a843d8090d91be1b16c32e7cfa59adc3b183e,Diffusive epidemic process: theory and simulation,"We study the continuous absorbing-state phase transition in the one-dimensional diffusive epidemic process via mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulation. In this model, particles of two species (A and B) hop on a lattice and undergo reactions and ; the total particle number is conserved. We formulate the model as a continuous-time Markov process described by a master equation. A phase transition between the (absorbing) B-free state and an active state is observed as the parameters (reaction and diffusion rates, and total particle density) are varied. Mean-field theory reveals a surprising, nonmonotonic dependence of the critical recovery rate on the diffusion rate of B particles. A computational realization of the process that is faithful to the transition rates defining the model is devised, allowing for direct comparison with theory. Using the quasi-stationary simulation method we determine the order parameter and the survival time in systems of up to 4000 sites. Due to strong finite-size effects, the results converge only for large system sizes. We find no evidence for a discontinuous transition. Our results are consistent with the existence of three distinct universality classes, depending on whether A particles diffusive more rapidly, less rapidly or at the same rate as B particles. We also perform quasi-stationary simulations of the triplet creation model, which yield results consistent with a discontinuous transition at high diffusion rates.",2006.0,27.0,30.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '065143', 'name': 'Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Maia2006DiffusiveEP,\n author = {D.

The authors administered the Child Eyes Test to assess emotion recognition in a community sample of preadolescent children between the ages of 10 and 12 (N = 417; 53.6% boys). The task required children to identify a broad array of emotions from photographic stimuli depicting the eye region of the face. Stimuli were then divided into complex or basic emotions.

Automated agents should be able to persuade people in the same way people persuade each other - via dialogs. Today, automated persuasion modeling and research use unnatural assumptions regarding persuasive interaction, which creates doubt regarding their applicability for real-world deployment with people. In this work we present a novel methodology for persuading people through argumentative dialogs. Our methodology combines theoretical argumentation modeling, machine learning and Markovian optimization techniques that together result in an innovative agent named SPA. Two extensive ﬁeld experiments, with more than 100 human subjects, show that SPA is able to persuade people signiﬁcantly more often than a baseline agent and no worse than people are able to per-suade each other.",2016.0,54.0,75.0,{'pages': '320-328'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Rosenfeld2016StrategicalAA,\n author = {Ariel Rosenfeld and Sarit Kraus},\n pages = {320-328},\n title = {Strategical Argumentative Agent for Human Persuasion},\n year = {2016}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '39890672', 'name': 'Ariel Rosenfeld'}, {'authorId': '1691597', 'name': 'Sarit Kraus'}]"

837,3e8d0938a989c1a1cd08cda16317a4d985e9c6fd,Emotive characters can make learning more productive and enjoyable: It takes two to learn to Tango,"In this paper we explore a new direction for pedagogical computer agents, also called computer characters, which we believe will maximize students’ learning gains and enjoyment. To the traditional scenario where students interact primarily with a single coach or tutor character on-screen, we introduce the addition of both a social, animate colearner, and the student’s own avatar character. Variations of the colearner’s attributes, informed by research literature on human partners, are explored through an online testbed application of English language idioms. Results from an experimental study with 76 Japanese college students reveal that cooperative colearners have a positive impact on students’ performance and experience, as well as increasing perceptions of the character’s intelligence and credibility. Findings provide grounding for a fruitful new direction for pedagogical characters, where students learn alongside emotional companions. Computer Characters and Pedagogical Applications: A Perfect Match Drawing inspiration from traditional cartoon animation and comic layout processes, computer characters resemble actors in their emotional range and improvisational responses. Appearing on screen as embodied entities – whether humans, or anthropomorphized objects and animals – these agents facilitate our interactions with software applications and are rapidly gaining prevalence in our everyday online activities. Embodied conversational characters bring with them a host of social expectations and behavior patterns. In situations where time and efficiency are of the essence, the added layer of a social exchange may add to the cognitive load of the human interacting with them. Yet for cases when the social aspects of the interaction are the center, or central to, the human interactor’s objective, characters rule the day -and with good reason! Computer characters have been shown to be effective proxy sellers, customer service representatives, and teachers, by engaging us – consciously or unconsciously – through life-like language, presence and behaviors. Of particular importance for the educational domain, computer characters generate additional interest and motivation in the content presented, as well as influence proactive changes in everyday behavior. In fact, computer characters are perhaps the best interface modality for teaching and learning because they allow for mimicry and mirroring, fundamental aspects of learning. Beyond the explicit lesson plan, educational exchanges are fraught with implicit social content and tacit knowledge that instructors model for students. Through learning and teaching, we implement information gathering and problem solving skills that best exemplify our cultural practices and beliefs, whether the subject matter are skateboard moves on staircases learned from peers, algebra or Shakespeare in the classroom, or customization of characters in online gaming environments. Every day, societal values and norms for acceptable behaviors, affective and motivational exchanges, role models and speech patterns, are taught alongside lessons in classrooms around the globe. The richness of the social and emotional exchanges that make computer characters challenging to integrate in productivity suite applications make them ideal for communicating these additional channels of expressiveness in educational content, through their gestures, word choice, affective reactions, and facial expressions, among others (Maldonado and Hayes-Roth, 2004). Characters can reliably showcase the same pattern of behavior, with slight improvisations, for many users. This makes computer agents particularly interesting from the researchers’ perspective, leading to detailed analysis of different learning effects and behaviors based on each student’s characteristics and preferred learning situations. Pedagogical characters, have appeared in language learning applications, middle school curricula, oral storytelling, corporate training, health behavior change interventions, and even military instruction. Yet research and industry applications including embodied conversational computer characters in pedagogical domains have structured the interaction as a one-to-one tutoring or coaching intervention. The learner primarily interacts with one character on the screen at a time; when more than one character is present simultaneously in the application, their roles tend to be supplementary or supportive ones, providing background tips for the interaction as an articulate “Help” menu, or acting as movie extras in the background. A new paradigm: Learning together online We believe that giving the student a virtual presence in the environment, and enriching the learner’s world with a colearner, will lead to greater gains in learning and enjoyment of the educational application. To evaluate these claims, we have designed and built online application testbeds, with which we vary characteristics of the colearne,r according to research-based predictions of factors that maximize achievement and enjoyment. We’ll report in this article on the eSchool application, focused on teaching Japanese college students American idioms. This system has shown great promise for breaking free of the traditional paradigm of a single interactive character on the screen (for detailed discussion on these experiments, please refer to Maldonado el al, 2005). Today, computer characters exhibiting realistic behaviors in the pedagogical arena tend to follow three primary models, mirroring Taylor’s 1980 taxonomy of computer usage in schools: tutor, tool and tutee. Characters may be cast as expert teachers or coaches, presented as role-play partners in simulations of real-world situations, or act as learners whom the human student teaches. Most often, computer characters inhabit the role of expert or knowledgeable teacher, experienced coach, or erudite tutor. The second category, where characters are presented as partners in role-play simulations is prevalent for on-the-job training and eLearning situations, is prevalent in cases where the learner may be older and more experienced. Computer characters act as colleagues and coworkers, with whom the student practices concepts, strategies, and behaviors. The third mode of interaction with computer characters prevalent today presents the computer character as a learner, progressing alongside the human student, or being taught by him or her. Peer characters are perceived as possessing as no more content knowledge on the subject as the human learner, and often less. When students teach the peer character, the cyclical act of preparing content for teaching, and successfully communicating it becomes the learning experience in itself. In the last twenty years since Taylor published his taxonomy, we have developed the technologies to implement and render believable, animate characters, yet we have made comparatively little progress in developing applications for these characters that maximize the social and emotional relationship with human interactors. For starters, the human student tends to be implicitly present alongside the character, rather than visually embodied on screen, and the interaction is limited to exchanges between the human learner and a single computer character. Few graphical representations of the human interactors appear on-screen in pedagogical applications, despite how common these “avatars” are in commercial sociable applications and games. We propose a radical reframing of the learning context in which students interact with animated pedagogical computer characters, which we believe will maximize the students’ learning gains and enjoyment. Introducing eSchool: Our Experimental Testbed In the eSchool application we have developed, students interact with two computer characters at the same time, a teacher and a peer fellow student, within one screen. Students are themselves represented through an avatar, who they can direct in emotional and subject matter responses. The avatar’s conversational behaviors and gestures are autonomously derived from the directions of the human learner and this learner’s answers to the questions. This mode of interaction is perceived as more natural than avatars whose behaviors are minutely controlled by the users. The colearner, or classmate, learning alongside the human student, has no additional knowledge on the subject nor explanations to provide, and is called to answer questions as often as the student, on average; it also exchanges friendly banter with the student’s avatar. We have introduced this presence in the learning environment to determine the effects that learning alongside a social animate character has upon the student’s performance and attitudes, rather than using the colearner to elicit nuanced explanations from the student, or model understanding, as is the case with some intelligent tutoring systems. Figure 1: eSchool 2003 for Handhelds featuring cartoon characters Figure 2: eSchool 2005 for the PC featuring photorealistic characters Figure 1 shows the first eSchool interface for handheld computers using cartoon characters, and Figure 2, the current interface on a PC using photographic images at the same moment in the interaction. In both cases the teacher character is located on the upper right hand side of the screen, above the chalkboard, which displays the multiple choice interpretations the student must decide between, mimicking the learning space of a classroom. In Figure 1, the students’ avatar is Neko the cat, and the colearner is Taro the Tiger, while in Figure 2 the students’ avatar is Susy and the colearner is Ryota. Each of the three interactors has their own emotions and embodiment. The content of our learning application is an intermediate English language lesson, with accompanying video and evaluation instruments, primarily aimed at Japanese college students.

It was premised on the basis of proxemics theory that the closer the approach of the virtual characters to the participant, the greater the level of physiological arousal. Physiological arousal was measured by the number of skin conductance responses within a short time period after the approach, and the maximum change in skin conductance level 5 s after the approach. The virtual characters were each either female or a cylinder of human size, and one or four characters approached each subject a total of 12 times. Twelve male subjects were recruited for the experiment. The results suggest that the number of skin conductance responses after the approach and the change in skin conductance level increased the closer the virtual characters approached toward the participants. Moreover, these response variables were inversely correlated with the number of visits, showing a typical adaptation effect. There was some evidence to suggest that the number of characters who simultaneously approached (one or four) was positively associated with the responses. Surprisingly there was no evidence of a difference in response between the humanoid characters and cylinders on the basis of this physiological data. It is suggested that the similarity in this quantitative arousal response to virtual characters and virtual objects might mask a profound difference in qualitative response, an interpretation supported by questionnaire and interview results. Overall the experiment supported the premise that people exhibit heightened physiological arousal the closer they are approached by virtual characters.",2010.0,32.0,127.0,"{'volume': '8', 'pages': '3:1-3:12', 'name': 'ACM Trans.

Spatial models are being used with increasing frequency to help characterize these large-scale patterns and to evaluate the impact of interventions. Here, I review several recent studies on four diseases that show the benefits of different methodologies: measles (patch models), foot-and-mouth disease (distance-transmission models), pandemic influenza (multigroup models), and smallpox (network models). This review highlights the importance of the household in spatial studies of human diseases, such as smallpox and influenza. It also demonstrates the need to develop a simple model of household demographics, so that these large-scale models can be extended to the investigation of long–time scale human pathogens, such as tuberculosis and HIV.",2007.0,39.0,557.0,"{'volume': '316', 'pages': '1298 - 1301', 'name': 'Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Riley2007LargeScaleSM,\n author = {S.

We report three studies where the agent shows levels of emotional contagion behavior during (1) the listening act in comparison with baseline backchanneling behavior (2) additional verbal response matching simple emotional storyline (3) the verbal response to the human actor performing complex emotional behaviors. Results revealed that both mimicry and affective matching behaviors were perceived as more empathic than the baseline listening behavior, where the difference between these behaviors was only significant when the agent verbally responded to complex emotional behaviors.

Subjectively, this often leads to a sense of disembodiment in the virtual world. We explore the effect of being able to see one's own body in such systems on an objective measure of the accuracy of one form of space perception. Using an action-based response measure, we found that participants who explored near space while seeing a fully-articulated and tracked visual representation of themselves subsequently made more accurate judgments of absolute egocentric distance to locations ranging from 4 m to 6 m away from where they were standing than did participants who saw no avatar. A nonanimated avatar also improved distance judgments, but by a lesser amount. Participants who viewed either animated or static avatars positioned 3 m in front of their own position made subsequent distance judgments with similar accuracy to the participants who viewed the equivalent animated or static avatar positioned at their own location.

One proposal to overcome this problem is to increase efficiency of provision through the adoption of briefer ‘minimal interventions' within stepped care models. Aims To examine the theoretical underpinnings of stepped care, together with the practicalities of the adoption of this system of care. Method Narrative literature review. Results The potential clinical and economic benefits of stepped care are dependent upon underlying assumptions of equivalence in terms of clinical outcomes, efficiency in terms of resource use and costs, and acceptability of ‘minimal interventions' to patients and therapists. Illustrative studies of these issues are considered. Conclusions Although psychological services might benefit from the adoption of the stepped care model, a substantial research agenda needs to be fulfilled before a judgement can be made as to whether stepped care might be an efficient method of delivering psychological services.",2005.0,61.0,880.0,"{'volume': '186', 'pages': '11 - 17', 'name': 'British Journal of Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bower2005SteppedCI,\n author = {P.

However, the effect of VR on blood pressure (BP) and autonomic function in healthy populations have not been explored. This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen. Following serial sevens, VE maintained the increased low frequency (LF) power of HRV $( 66 \pm 4$ normalized units (n.u.)) compared to seated rest $( 55 \pm 5\mathrm {n}$.u., $\mathrm {p}=0.0060)$; VE maintained the decreased high frequency (HF) power of HRV $( 34 \pm 4\mathrm {n}$.u.) compared to seated rest $( 44 \pm 5\mathrm {n}$.u., $\mathrm {p}=0.014)$; and VE maintained the increased LF/HF ratio $( 2.4 \pm 0.5)$ compared to seated rest $( 1.6 \pm 0.3$, $\mathrm {p}=0.012)$. Hence, after mental stress, VE sustains the increased sympathetic drive and reduced parasympathetic drive. VE may act as a stimulatory driver for autonomic activity and BP.

However, there are still many open issues regarding the social capabilities that those robots should have in order to make daily interactions with humans more natural. For example, the role of affective interactions is still unclear. This paper presents an ethnographic study conducted in an elementary school where 40 children interacted with a social robot capable of recognising and responding empathically to some of the children's affective states. The findings suggest that the robot's empathic behaviour affected positively how children perceived the robot. However, the empathic behaviours should be selected carefully, under the risk of having the opposite effect. The target application scenario and the particular preferences of children seem to influence the “degree of empathy” that social robots should be endowed with.",2012.0,30.0,115.0,"{'pages': '367-374', 'name': '2012 7th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Leite2012ModellingEB,\n author = {Iolanda Leite and Ginevra Castellano and André Pereira and C.

In this paper, we propose a framework of crowd formation via hierarchical planning, which includes cooperative-task, coordinated-behaviour and action-control planning. In cooperative-task planning, we improve the grid potential field to achieve global path planning for a team. In coordinated-behaviour planning, we propose a time-space table to arrange behaviour scheduling for a movement. In action-control planning, we combine the gaze-movement angle model and fuzzy logic control to achieve agent action. Our method has several advantages: (1) The hierarchical architecture is guaranteed to match the human decision process from high to low intelligence. (2) The agent plans his behaviour only with the local information of his neighbour; the global intelligence of the group emerges from these local interactions. (3) The time-space table fully utilizes the three-dimensional information. Our method is verified using crowds of various densities, from sparse to dense crowds, using quantitative performance measures.

As a multimodal phenomenon, previous research argued that a mismatch in the expressive channels provides evidence of joint audio-video emotional processing. However, while previous work studied this from the point of view of emotion recognition and processing, not much is known about what effect a multimodal agent would have on a human-agent interaction task. Also, agent appearance could influence this interaction too. Here we manipulated the agent’s multimodal emotional expression (”smiling face” and ”smiling voice”, or both) and agent type (photorealistic or cartoon-like virtual human) and assessed people’s trust toward this agent. We measured trust using a mixed-methods approach, combining behavioural data from a survival task, questionnaire ratings and qualitative comments. These methods gave different results: while people commented on the importance of emotional expressivity in the agent’s voice, this factor had limited influence on trusting behaviours; while people rated the cartoon-like agent on several traits higher than the photorealistic one, the agent’s style also was not the most influential feature on people’s trusting behaviour. These results highlight the contribution of a mixed-methods approach in human-machine interaction, as both explicit and implicit perception and behaviour will contribute to the success of the interaction.",2019.0,37.0,21.0,"{'name': 'Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGGRAPH Conference on Motion, Interaction and Games'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Torre2019TheEO,\n author = {Ilaria Torre and E.

Experiment 1 found that objective measures of similarity (including fragment frequency and repetition structure) predicted ratings of familiarity, that familiarity ratings predicted grammaticality judgments, and that the extremity of familiarity ratings predicted confidence. Familiarity was further shown to predict judgments in the absence of confidence, hence contributing to above-chance guessing. Experiment 2 found that confidence developed as participants refined their knowledge of the distribution of familiarity and that differences in familiarity could be exploited prior to confidence developing. Experiment 3 found that familiarity was consciously exploited to make grammaticality judgments including those made without confidence and that familiarity could in some instances influence participants' grammaticality judgments apparently without their awareness. All 3 experiments found that knowledge distinct from familiarity was derived only under deliberate learning conditions. The results provide decisive evidence that familiarity is the essential source of knowledge in artificial grammar learning while also supporting a dual-process model of implicit and explicit learning.",2008.0,80.0,128.0,"{'volume': '34 5', 'pages': '\n          1264-88\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of experimental psychology.

Crowd simulation has been an active and important area for several decades. However, only recently has there been an increased focus on evaluating the fidelity of the results with respect to real-world situations. The focus to date has been on analyzing the properties of low-level features such as pedestrian trajectories, or global features such as crowd densities. We propose the first approach based on finding semantic information represented by latent Path Patterns  in both real and simulated data in order to analyze and compare them. Unsupervised clustering by non-parametric Bayesian inference is used to learn the patterns, which themselves provide a rich visualization of the crowd behavior. To this end, we present a new Stochastic Variational Dual Hierarchical Dirichlet Process ( SV-DHDP) model.

However, coding patient language is a resource-intensive exercise and difficult to perform at scale. Our aim was to develop a deep learning model to automatically identify patient utterances during text-based internet-enabled Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and to determine the association between utterances and clinical outcomes. Method: Using 340 manually annotated transcripts we trained a deep learning model to categorize patient utterances into one or more of five categories. The model was used to automatically code patient utterances from our entire data set of transcripts (∼34,000 patients), and logistic regression analyses used to determine the association between both reliable improvement and engagement, and patient responses. Results: Our model reached human-level agreement on three of the five patient categories. Regression analyses revealed that increased counter change-talk (movement away from change) was associated with lower odds of both reliable improvement and engagement, while increased change-talk (movement towards change or self-exploration) was associated with increased odds of improvement and engagement. Conclusions: Deep learning provides an effective means of automatically coding patient utterances at scale. This approach enables the development of a data-driven understanding of the relationship between therapist and patient during therapy.",2020.0,36.0,19.0,"{'volume': '31', 'pages': '300 - 312', 'name': 'Psychotherapy Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ewbank2020UnderstandingTR,\n author = {M.

Description of and instruction in the art of motivational interviewing (MI) has made a significant contribution to the optimism of practitioners treating addiction disorders. This is the field in which MI arose 30 years ago. Its use has generalized into other health behaviour change interventions, and beyond into general decision making. For the addiction field, the essence of the contribution has been to give practitioners a set of skills to deal with that most challenging characteristic of people with addiction disorders, namely resistance to change.

This third edition of Motivational Interviewing elaborates on the method described in the two previous editions (Miller and Rollnick, 1991, 2002), but without the assistance of contributing authors and with the change of the sub-title to ‘Helping People Change’. The previous sub-titles were: Volume 1 ‘Helping People Change Addictive Behaviour’ and Volume 2: ‘Preparing People for Change’. These subtle differences are important; the practice of MI appears to stop where the behaviour change plan begins. Hence, arguably the second volume's sub-title is the most apt.

Most Officers, however, develop their interpersonal skills on the job. Further, what formal training they receive consists primarily of live role-play sessions, which can fail to provide consistent practice, effective feedback, or accurate skill assessment and improvement. To address these issues, we have created a virtual-human-based roleplaying environment. The Virtual Officer Leadership Trainer (VOLT) is a controlled practice environment that allows instructor management and facilitates throughput. Trainees learn interpersonal skills, see demonstrations of the skills being used correctly, and then practice the skills interacting with a virtual human via branching, scripted dialogue that allows the trainee to apply specific skills. The trainees in the classroom observe this interaction in real time. At each decision point in the interaction, trainees use personal response systems (“clickers”) to indicate what they believe to be the correct course of action. These data are available to an instructor who monitors the class’s performance and conducts an after-action review. VOLT thus allows an entire class to participate in a single roleplay exercise, stimulating discussion, and facilitating peer and instructor evaluation in real time. VOLT’s instructional design is based on cognitive task analyses with expert leaders, which identified a set of learning objectives. This paper discusses VOLT’s educational goals, instructional design, technological approach, and program evaluation plan.",2011.0,28.0,26.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Campbell2011InterpersonalAL,\n author = {Julia Campbell and M.

We examined the covariation of mind perception with three subclinical syndromes—autism-spectrum disorder, schizotypy, and psychopathy—and found that each presents a unique mind-perception profile. Autism-spectrum disorder involves reduced perception of agency in adult humans. Schizotypy involves increased perception of both agency and experience in entities generally thought to lack minds. Psychopathy involves reduced perception of experience in adult humans, children, and animals. Disorders are differentially linked with the over- or underperception of agency and experience in a way that helps explain their real-world consequences.",2010.0,27.0,146.0,"{'volume': '108', 'pages': '477 - 479', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gray2010DistortionsOM,\n author = {Kurt Gray and Adrianna C.

However, designing believable characters remains a challenging task. Artists rely on stylization to increase appeal or expressivity, exaggerating or softening specific features. In this paper we analyze two of the most influential factors that define how a character looks: shape and material. With the help of artists, we design a set of carefully crafted stimuli consisting of different stylization levels for both parameters, and analyze how different combinations affect the perceived realism, appeal, eeriness, and familiarity of the characters. Moreover, we additionally investigate how this affects the perceived intensity of different facial expressions (sadness, anger, happiness, and surprise). Our experiments reveal that shape is the dominant factor when rating realism and expression intensity, while material is the key component for appeal. Furthermore our results show that realism alone is a bad predictor for appeal, eeriness, or attractiveness.",2015.0,44.0,93.0,"{'volume': '34', 'pages': '1 - 12', 'name': 'ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zell2015ToSO,\n author = {E.

The behaviour of a crowd or pedestrian somehow is determined by the inner emotion of each agent. Occasionally, the inner emotion has been influenced by surrounding atmospheres. Emotion along with Seek-flee are factors that important on simulating the crowd under the panic situation, whereas, the agent tries to seek a way out or other agents and some agents maybe try to flee because of scared or desperate. This paper proposes a unique solution for demonstrating the behaviour of emotional contagion model for parent-child agents inside the crowds. The finite state machine(FSM) consists of two main states for a regular and panic situation. The two scenarios have been introduced to demonstrate the wandering and seek-flees states. Wandering states will trigger an agent to walk toward a certain direction randomly or idle only. Whilst, the seek-flee behaviour demonstrate two parents looking for their child and once they meet each other, it will drive the crowding agent to stick together and flee. The parent-child’s bond inside the crowd is a promising feature to be investigated further especially with a huge number of agents and multi-hazard situation.",2019.0,17.0,5.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Aljahdali2019EmotionalCD,\n author = {H.

With virtual reality (VR), computer-generated interactive environments, individuals can repeatedly experience their problematic situations and be taught, via evidence-based psychological treatments, how to overcome difficulties. VR is moving out of specialist laboratories. Our central aim was to describe the potential of VR in mental health, including a consideration of the first 20 years of applications. A systematic review of empirical studies was conducted. In all, 285 studies were identified, with 86 concerning assessment, 45 theory development, and 154 treatment. The main disorders researched were anxiety (n = 192), schizophrenia (n = 44), substance-related disorders (n = 22) and eating disorders (n = 18). There are pioneering early studies, but the methodological quality of studies was generally low. The gaps in meaningful applications to mental health are extensive. The most established finding is that VR exposure-based treatments can reduce anxiety disorders, but there are numerous research and treatment avenues of promise. VR was found to be a much-misused term, often applied to non-interactive and non-immersive technologies. We conclude that VR has the potential to transform the assessment, understanding and treatment of mental health problems. The treatment possibilities will only be realized if – with the user experience at the heart of design – the best immersive VR technology is combined with targeted translational interventions. The capability of VR to simulate reality could greatly increase access to psychological therapies, while treatment outcomes could be enhanced by the technology's ability to create new realities. VR may merit the level of attention given to neuroimaging.",2017.0,67.0,623.0,"{'volume': '47', 'pages': '2393 - 2400', 'name': 'Psychological Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Freeman2017VirtualRI,\n author = {Daniel Freeman and S.

This visual aspect of speech aids understanding and helps communicating additional information, such as the speaker's mood. We analyze quantitatively head and facial movements that accompany speech and investigate how they relate to the text's prosodic structure. We recorded several hours of speech and measured the locations of the speakers' main facial features as well as their head poses. The text was evaluated with a prosody prediction tool, identifying phrase boundaries and pitch accents. Characteristic for most speakers are simple motion patterns that are repeatedly applied in synchrony with the main prosodic events. Direction and strength of head movements vary widely from one speaker to another, yet their timing is typically well synchronized with the spoken text. Understanding quantitatively the correlations between head movements and spoken text is important for synthesizing photo-realistic talking heads. Talking heads appear much more engaging when they exhibit realistic motion patterns.",2002.0,11.0,205.0,"{'pages': '396-401', 'name': 'Proceedings of Fifth IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face Gesture Recognition'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Graf2002VisualPF,\n author = {H.

We present a novel technique called Hindsight Experience Replay which allows sample-efficient learning from rewards which are sparse and binary and therefore avoid the need for complicated reward engineering. It can be combined with an arbitrary off-policy RL algorithm and may be seen as a form of implicit curriculum. 
We demonstrate our approach on the task of manipulating objects with a robotic arm. In particular, we run experiments on three different tasks: pushing, sliding, and pick-and-place, in each case using only binary rewards indicating whether or not the task is completed. Our ablation studies show that Hindsight Experience Replay is a crucial ingredient which makes training possible in these challenging environments. We show that our policies trained on a physics simulation can be deployed on a physical robot and successfully complete the task.",2017.0,47.0,1768.0,"{'volume': 'abs/1707.01495', 'name': 'ArXiv'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Andrychowicz2017HindsightER,\n author = {Marcin Andrychowicz and Dwight Crow and Alex Ray and Jonas Schneider and Rachel Fong and P.

However, we lack an integrative framework for understanding how different emotion-related functions are organized across the entire expanse of the PFC, as prior reviews have generally focused on specific emotional processes (e.g., decision making) or specific anatomical regions (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex). Additionally, psychological theories and neuroscientific investigations have proceeded largely independently because of the lack of a common framework. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of functional neuroimaging, electrophysiological, lesion, and structural connectivity studies on the emotion-related functions of 8 subregions spanning the entire PFC. We introduce the appraisal-by-content model, which provides a new framework for integrating the diverse range of empirical findings. Within this framework, appraisal serves as a unifying principle for understanding the PFC’s role in emotion, while relative content-specialization serves as a differentiating principle for understanding the role of each subregion. A synthesis of data from affective, social, and cognitive neuroscience studies suggests that different PFC subregions are preferentially involved in assigning value to specific types of inputs: exteroceptive sensations, episodic memories and imagined future events, viscero-sensory signals, viscero-motor signals, actions, others’ mental states (e.g., intentions), self-related information, and ongoing emotions. We discuss the implications of this integrative framework for understanding emotion regulation, value-based decision making, emotional salience, and refining theoretical models of emotion. This framework provides a unified understanding of how emotional processes are organized across PFC subregions and generates new hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying adaptive and maladaptive emotional functioning.",2017.0,499.0,381.0,"{'volume': '143', 'pages': '1033–1081', 'name': 'Psychological Bulletin'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Dixon2017EmotionAT,\n author = {Matthew L.

The virtual environment models a collaborative problem space of scheduling a two-day trip for students in a tourist office. Usability issues are analyzed within the framework of James Reason's where errors observed are interpreted as rule-based mistakes, i.e. the false application of rules from the physical world in the virtual reality. The issues observed qualitatively on video recordings reveal that these rule-based errors of usability in the 3D cave are related to the lack of feedback. Participants fail to seize an object because they do not “feel” that they reached it unless they have something similar to tactile feedback. Other mistakes in usability are related to typing in the 3D cave which is connected to previous findings about the immersion breaking nature of typing. Those findings implicate that the virtual reality cave as a user interface should induce applicable rules. It would be another solution to fit this interface to the rules of the real world by implementing new feedback channels replacing tactile and postural information.",2014.0,13.0,11.0,"{'pages': '243-246', 'name': '2014 5th IEEE Conference on Cognitive Infocommunications (CogInfoCom)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lógó2014UsabilityRH,\n author = {E.

Based on an empirial study on spatial descriptions of landmarks in direction-giving, we present a model that allows virtual agents to automatically generate, i.e., select the content and derive the form of coordinated language and iconic gestures. Our model simulates the interplay between these two modes of expressiveness on two levels. First, two kinds of knowledge representation (propositional and imagistic) are utilized to capture the modality-specific contents and processes of content planning. Second, specific planners are integrated to carry out the formulation of concrete verbal and gestural behavior.

The real digital communications such as the Internet are used to the logical information converted easily into a digital signal for the communication media. However, a human communication is composed of not only logical information, but also sensitivity-like non-verbal one. Non-verbal information like the human voice, gesture, and emotion rather than verbal one is more useful to understand the user's inclination exactly. However it is quite difficult to catch the meaning of non-verbal information without using a specially purposed device such as the motion capture. Although the devices can use for the experimental purposes of understanding the meaning of non-verbal information, the confidence of results is not enough because the devices give an invisible pressure to a testee wearing the equipments. In this paper, we develop a mouse-tracking system, namely Recoding tool Of Mouse trace In The Web (ROMIT), for the purpose of studying the non-verbal information on CMC. ROMIT supports on-line communication between communicators through the Internet. It can provide more exact remote users' inclination for the system manager from avoiding the invisible pressure on the users. We investigate the user’s mouse behavior on the web by using ROMIT system, and our demonstration show that the mouse behavior of each user is the effective and direct method to understand the user's inclination.

As in an earlier study [R. Pastor-Satorras and A. Vesipignani, Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 3200 (2001); Phys. Rev. E. 63, 006117 (2001)] for an infection that did not confer immunity upon recovery, the epidemic process--in contrast with many traditional epidemiological models--does not exhibit threshold behavior, and we demonstrate that this is a consequence of the extreme heterogeneity in the connectivity distribution of a scale-free network. Finally, we discuss effects that arise from finite population sizes, showing that networks of finite size do exhibit threshold effects: infections cannot spread for arbitrarily low transmission probabilities.",2001.0,11.0,740.0,"{'volume': '64 6 Pt 2', 'pages': '\n          066112\n        ', 'name': 'Physical review.

Although emotion dysregulation is not a defining feature of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), there is a growing consensus that emotional problems play a prominent role in this disorder.


METHODS
The present study examined a wide range of emotion regulation (ER) strategies in 32 individuals with ASD compared to 31 group-matched typically developing (TD) participants in three emotional domains (anger, anxiety, and amusement). Parents of individuals with ASD and TD individuals were interviewed about their child's emotional experience and the use and efficacy of 10 ER strategies. In addition, participants filled out daily diaries on experience and regulation in the same emotional domains.


RESULTS
Compared to TD individuals, parents reported that individuals with ASD experienced more anger and anxiety and less amusement, made less frequent use of a variety of adaptive ER strategies (e.g. problem solving, cognitive reappraisal), and made more frequent use of maladaptive strategies (e.g. repetitive behavior). Moreover, individuals with ASD were less effective at utilizing adaptive ER strategies. Self-reports showed differences in experience of amusement and in ER strategies for anger and anxiety, but not in experience of anger and anxiety.


CONCLUSIONS
This study provides evidence that individuals with ASD less frequently use adaptive - but more frequently use maladaptive - ER strategies. Implications for ASD treatments that focus on increasing the use of adaptive strategies are discussed.",2015.0,45.0,83.0,"{'volume': '56 8', 'pages': '\n          903-13\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Samson2015EmotionRI,\n author = {Andrea C.

Sometimes such control is executed through suppression of an unwanted response in order to avoid conflict. Conflict occurs when two simultaneously competing processes lead to different behavioral outcomes, as seen in tasks such as the anti-saccade, go/no-go, and the Stroop task. We set out to examine whether different types of stimuli in a modified emotional Stroop task would cause similar interference effects as the original Stroop-color/word, and whether the required suppression mechanism(s) would recruit similar regions of the medial PFC (mPFC). By using emotional words and emotional faces in this Stroop experiment, we examined the two well-learned automatic behaviors of word reading and recognition of face expressions. In our emotional Stroop paradigm, words were processed faster than face expressions with incongruent trials yielding longer reaction times and larger number of errors compared to the congruent trials. This novel Stroop effect activated the anterior and inferior regions of the mPFC, namely the anterior cingulate cortex, inferior frontal gyrus as well as the superior frontal gyrus. Our results suggest that prepotent behaviors such as reading and recognition of face expressions are stimulus-dependent and perhaps hierarchical, hence recruiting distinct regions of the mPFC. Moreover, the faster processing of word reading compared to reporting face expressions is indicative of the formation of stronger stimulus–response associations of an over-learned behavior compared to an instinctive one, which could alternatively be explained through the distinction between awareness and selective attention.",2011.0,85.0,59.0,"{'volume': '4', 'name': 'Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ovaysikia2011WordWO,\n author = {Shima Ovaysikia and K.

This argument suggests a broader view of how to intervene in social networks to improve health.

However, all practical applications of motion capture rely on motion editing techniques to increase the reusability and flexibility of captured motions. Because humans are proficient in detecting and interpreting subtle details in human motion, understanding the perceptual consequences of motion editing is essential. Thus in this work, we perform three experiments to gain a better understanding of how motion editing might affect the emotional content of a captured performance, particularly changes in posture and dynamics, two factors shown to be important perceptual indicators of bodily emotions. In these studies, we analyse the properties (angles and velocities) and perception (recognition rates and perceived intensities) of a varied set of full-body motion clips representing the six emotions anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. We have found that emotions are mostly conveyed through the upper body, that the perceived intensity of an emotion can be reduced by blending with a neutral motion, and that posture changes can alter the perceived emotion but subtle changes in dynamics only alter the intensity.",2013.0,32.0,34.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Applied Perception'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Normoyle2013TheEO,\n author = {Aline Normoyle and Fannie Liu and Mubbasir Kapadia and N.

Drawing on psychological research, we evaluate perception of our agents' personalities and credibility by human viewers (N = 187). Our results suggest that we succeeded in validating theoretically grounded indicators of personality in our virtual agents, and that it is feasible to place our characters on Eysenck's scales. A key finding is that the presence of behavioral characteristics reinforces the prescribed personality profiles that are already emerging from the still images.

We separately model the observer effect (or individual differences of observers), and the conversational-scene effect or the video-clip effect (how interlocutors are interacting), based on Bayes' theorem with the assumption of their conditional independence. The observer term describes the observer's cognitive tendency, including bias, in a probabilistic form, and does not include any clip information. In contrast, the clip term describes how a target clip is recognized by an unspecified observer. The perceived emotion is predicted to be the state that maximizes the conditional probability given the observer and target clip. An experiment with 100 observers and 97 clips demonstrated, in a leave-one-out cross-validation scenario, that 1) there is in fact no statistically and practically significant interaction between observer and clip, and 2) our Bayesian modelling achieves a 97 percent accuracy as a reference of test-retest reliability. Furthermore, when combined with existing observer and clip models that can handle unknown observers and clips, our model yielded an accuracy of around 50 percent in a more challenging leave-one-subject-and-clip-out cross-validation scenario.",2017.0,40.0,3.0,"{'pages': '42-49', 'name': '2017 Seventh International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII)'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Kumano2017ComputationalMO,\n author = {Shiro Kumano and Ryo Ishii and K.

935,461f46ced01dea2ecbe603bfa21c7279e3630fb8,Usability Evaluation Methods for Gesture-Based Games: A Systematic Review,"Background Gestural interaction systems are increasingly being used, mainly in games, expanding the idea of entertainment and providing experiences with the purpose of promoting better physical and/or mental health. Therefore, it is necessary to establish mechanisms for evaluating the usability of these interfaces, which make gestures the basis of interaction, to achieve a balance between functionality and ease of use. Objective This study aims to present the results of a systematic review focused on usability evaluation methods for gesture-based games, considering devices with motion-sensing capability. We considered the usability methods used, the common interface issues, and the strategies adopted to build good gesture-based games. Methods The research was centered on four electronic databases: IEEE, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), Springer, and Science Direct from September 4 to 21, 2015. Within 1427 studies evaluated, 10 matched the eligibility criteria. As a requirement, we considered studies about gesture-based games, Kinect and/or Wii as devices, and the use of a usability method to evaluate the user interface. Results In the 10 studies found, there was no standardization in the methods because they considered diverse analysis variables. Heterogeneously, authors used different instruments to evaluate gesture-based interfaces and no default approach was proposed. Questionnaires were the most used instruments (70%, 7/10), followed by interviews (30%, 3/10), and observation and video recording (20%, 2/10). Moreover, 60% (6/10) of the studies used gesture-based serious games to evaluate the performance of elderly participants in rehabilitation tasks. This highlights the need for creating an evaluation protocol for older adults to provide a user-friendly interface according to the user’s age and limitations.

Social robots can offer tremendous possibilities for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) interventions. To date, most studies with this population have used short, isolated encounters in controlled laboratory settings. Our study focused on a 1-month, home-based intervention for increasing social communication skills of 12 children with ASD between 6 and 12 years old using an autonomous social robot. The children engaged in a triadic interaction with a caregiver and the robot for 30 min every day to complete activities on emotional storytelling, perspective-taking, and sequencing. The robot encouraged engagement, adapted the difficulty of the activities to the child’s past performance, and modeled positive social skills. The system maintained engagement over the 1-month deployment, and children showed improvement on joint attention skills with adults when not in the presence of the robot. These results were also consistent with caregiver questionnaires.

It tests the hypothesis that gender will influence the exhibition of stress outcomes resulting from exposure to high-density living environments, with women displaying internalized responses and men responding with externalized styles. Expanding on the types of gender-appropriate disorders examined in this area of research, I selected depression, aggression, and withdrawal as gender-specific disorders based on theory and prior research. Multilevel analyses of data from a survey of Toronto residents indicate that, while the effects of household density are conditioned by gender, support for the existence of gender-equivalent outcomes is mixed. While women living in crowded homes are more likely to be depressed, men exposed to high-density living environments do not report increased aggression.

Hobfoll, Hall, Canetti-Nisim, Galea, Johnson, and Palmieri's (2007) insightful paper highlights important weaknesses in existing theory and data. Although we commend Hobfoll et al. for offering a provocative new way to conceptualise PTG in terms of action-focused growth, we also find a number of limitations in their approach. In this article, we attempt to place PTG within a broader framework of individual differences in response to potential trauma. As in most of the literature on PTG, Hobfoll et al. implicitly equate growth with resilience or view it as superior to resilient outcomes. We argue, however, that many if not most people are resilient in the face of trauma and that resilient outcomes typically provide little need or opportunity for PTG. We close by exploring the literature on resilience for possible mechanisms underlying a link between PTG and adaptation. For example, Hobfoll et al. dismiss some forms of reported growth as illusory. In contrast, we review evidence for the adaptive value of self-enhancing illusions in coping with adversity. 
 
Le developpement post-traumatique (PTG) est un concept attrayant mais insuffisamment approfondi. L’article stimulant de Hobfoll & al. met en relief des carences significatives dans les donnees et theories existantes.

On essaie, dans cet article, de replacer le PTG dans le cadre plus vaste des differences individuelles en reponse au traumatisme potentiel. Comme souvent dans la litterature sur le PTG, Hobfoll & al. assimilent le developpement a la resilience ou le considerent comme superieur aux consequences de la resilience. Nous defendons au contraire l’idee que beaucoup de gens, voire la plupart, sont resilients face au traumatisme et que les apports de la resilience peuvent se passer ou n’offrent habituellement que peu d’opportunites au PTG. On termine en examinant la litterature sur la resilience a la recherche d’eventuels processus sous-tendant un lien entre PTG et adaptation.

941,4665f10ba0006df8d4fec85e368bcc503d57ce44,The architecture of complex weighted networks.,"Networked structures arise in a wide array of different contexts such as technological and transportation infrastructures, social phenomena, and biological systems. These highly interconnected systems have recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e., either present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the network. We define appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to investigate the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network. These results provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.",2003.0,33.0,3448.0,"{'volume': '101 11', 'pages': '\n          3747-52\n        ', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Barrat2003TheAO,\n author = {A.

Further, empathy was investigated as a potential mediator underlying the modulation of facial reactions to emotional faces in a competitive, a cooperative, and a neutral setting. Results revealed less congruent reactions to happy expressions and even incongruent reactions to sad and angry expressions in the competition condition, whereas virtually no differences between the neutral and the cooperation condition occurred. Effects on congruent reactions were found to be mediated by cognitive empathy, indicating that the state of empathy plays an important role in the situational modulation of congruent reactions. Further, incongruent reactions to sad and angry faces in a competition setting were mediated by the emotional reaction of joy, supporting the assumption that incongruent facial reactions are mainly based on affective processes. Additionally, strategic processes (specifically, the goal to create and maintain a smooth, harmonious interaction) were found to influence facial reactions while being in a cooperative mindset. Now, further studies are needed to test for the generalizability of these effects.",2011.0,2.0,52.0,"{'volume': '11 3', 'pages': '\n          457-67\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Likowski2011ProcessesUC,\n author = {Katja U.

Faces that consistently look toward a target location are rated as more trustworthy than those that look away from the target. Representations of trust are important for future interactions; yet little is known about how they are consolidated in long-term memory. Sleep facilitates memory consolidation for incidentally learned information and may therefore support the retention of trust representations. We investigated the consolidation of trust inferences across periods of sleep or wakefulness. In addition, we employed a memory cueing procedure (targeted memory reactivation [TMR]) in a bid to strengthen certain trust memories over others. We observed no difference in the retention of trust inferences following delays of sleep or wakefulness, and there was no effect of TMR in either condition. Interestingly, trust inferences remained stable 1 week after learning, irrespective of the initial postlearning delay. A second experiment showed that this implicit learning occurs despite participants’ being unable to explicitly recall the gaze behavior of specific faces immediately after encoding. Together, these results suggest that gist-like, social inferences are formed at the time of learning without retaining the original episodic memory and thus do not benefit from offline consolidation through replay. We discuss our findings in the context of a novel framework whereby trust judgments reflect an efficient, powerful, and adaptable storage device for social information.",2019.0,72.0,7.0,"{'volume': '46', 'pages': '684 - 698', 'name': 'Journal of Experimental Psychology.

Drawing on emotions as social information (EASI) theory (Van Kleef, 2009), we hypothesized that people use the emotional expressions of others to inform their own attitudes, but only when they are sufficiently motivated and able to process those expressions. Five experiments support these ideas. Participants reported more positive attitudes about various topics after seeing a source's sad (rather than happy) expressions when topics were negatively framed (e.g., abandoning bobsleighing from the Olympics). Conversely, participants reported more positive attitudes after seeing happy (rather than sad) expressions when topics were positively framed (e.g., introducing kite surfing at the Olympics). This suggests that participants used the source's emotional expressions as information when forming their own attitudes. Supporting this interpretation, effects were mitigated when participants' information processing was undermined by cognitive load or was chronically low. Moreover, a source's anger expressions engendered negative attitude change when directed at the attitude object and positive change when directed at the recipient's attitude. Effects occurred regardless of whether emotional expressions were manipulated through written words, pictures of facial expressions, film clips containing both facial and vocal emotional expressions, or emoticons. The findings support EASI theory and indicate that emotional expressions are a powerful source of social influence.",2015.0,138.0,174.0,"{'volume': '100 4', 'pages': '\n          1124-42\n        ', 'name': 'The Journal of applied psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kleef2015ThePP,\n author = {Gerben A. van Kleef and Helma van den Berg and Marc W.

The challenge stems partly from the complexity and fluidity of this social process, but also from its covert nature. One powerful tool to enhance experimental control over such dynamic social interactions has been the use of avatars in virtual reality (VR); information about an individual in such an interaction can be collected through the analysis of his or her neurophysiological and behavioral responses. We have developed a unique platform, the Empathy-Enhancing Virtual Evolving Environment (EEVEE), which is built around three main components: (1) different avatars capable of expressing feelings and emotions at various levels based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS); (2) systems for measuring the physiological responses of the observer (heart and respiration rate, skin conductance, gaze and eye movements, facial expression); and (3) a multimodal interface linking the avatar's behavior to the observer's neurophysiological response. In this article, we provide a detailed description of the components of this innovative platform and validation data from the first phases of development. Our data show that healthy adults can discriminate different negative emotions, including pain, expressed by avatars at varying intensities. We also provide evidence that masking part of an avatar's face (top or bottom half) does not prevent the detection of different levels of pain.

Arguably, one of the main reasons is that some essential qualities of human beings such as emotion have not been effectively modeled and incorporated into crowd simulation algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel computational model for emotion evolution and demonstrate its applications for crowd simulation. Specifically, our approach is designed to tackle three major issues in the emotion evolution process: (i) how to perceive and evaluate emotion when individuals face emergency or external events, (ii) how to evolve the emotion during induction, and (iii) how specific actions of individuals in a crowd are impacted by emotion. Through many experiments, we demonstrate that our method can effectively simulate emergent dynamic collective patterns observed in real-world crowd footages.",2018.0,23.0,11.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics and Games'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Jiang2018AnEE,\n author = {Hao Jiang and Z.

962,47c90efc658de217c928738b2d52c0cd31f2dc48,Virtual race transformation reverses racial in-group bias,"People generally show greater preference for members of their own racial group compared to racial out-group members. This type of ‘in-group bias’ is evident in mimicry behaviors. We tend to automatically mimic the behaviors of in-group members, and this behavior is associated with interpersonal sensitivity and empathy. However, mimicry is reduced when interacting with out-group members. Although race is considered an unchangeable trait, it is possible using embodiment in immersive virtual reality to engender the illusion in people of having a body of a different race. Previous research has used this technique to show that after a short period of embodiment of White people in a Black virtual body their implicit racial bias against Black people diminishes. Here we show that this technique powerfully enhances mimicry. We carried out an experiment with 32 White (Caucasian) female participants. Half were embodied in a White virtual body and the remainder in a Black virtual body. Each interacted in two different sessions with a White and a Black virtual character, in counterbalanced order. The results show that dyads with the same virtual body skin color expressed greater mimicry than those of different color. Importantly, this effect occurred depending on the virtual body’s race, not participants’ actual racial group. When embodied in a Black virtual body, White participants treat Black as their novel in-group and Whites become their novel out-group. This reversed in-group bias effect was obtained regardless of participants’ level of implicit racial bias. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this surprising psychological phenomenon.",2017.0,66.0,120.0,"{'volume': '12', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hasler2017VirtualRT,\n author = {Béatrice S.

Different signs merge in a person's experience of a product as colors do not function separately and individually, but from multi-layered references and can influence consumers' purchase decision, how they see things, their emotions, choices and thus are integral to the realm of advertising and marketing. Furthermore the perception and application of color is strongly influenced by ones innate physiological and psychological predisposition, personal experiences, age, gender, personality, income, ethnographic and demographic factors that makes its application effective within the domain of marketing all the more cumbersome and challenging. However, as a marketing tool, color can be a sublimely persuasive force; and as a functional component of human vision, color can capture attention, relax or irritate the eyes, and affect the legibility of the text and - All things put together, the right colors empower and contribute to the success of an advertising campaign, a product, a service, or even an interior space and in contrast wrong colors can be a costly mistake.

The current review focuses on two recent themes in the mimicry literature. First, an analysis of the moderators of mimicry uncovers the various motivational, social, emotional, and personality factors that lead to more or less mimicry of an interaction partner in a given situation. Second, a significant amount of recent research has identified important downstream consequences of mimicking or being mimicked by another person. These include not only increased prosociality between interactants, but also unexpected effects on the individual, such as cognitive processing style, attitudes, consumer preferences, self-regulatory ability, and academic performance. Behavioral mimicry is also placed in its broader context: a form of interpersonal coordination.

When examined across 11 health categories, caregivers exhibited a slightly greater risk for health problems than did noncaregivers.

This chapter analyzes why experts in the field are looking for an alternative to the currently dominant cognitive approach. The basic principles of activity theory are presented and their implications for human-computer interaction are discussed. The chapter concludes with an outline of the potential impact of activity theory on studies and design of computer use in real-life settings. It is generally accepted that the lack of an adequate theory of human-computer interaction (HCI) is one of the most important reasons that progress in the field of HCI is relatively modest, compared with the rate of technological development. People coming to the field of HCI from different disciplines—psychology, computer science, graphics design, and others—have serious problems in coordinating and combining their efforts. For example, typical HCI curricula for undergraduate and graduate students present a mixture of knowledge from various disciplines rather than an integrated perspective. Traditional conceptual approaches cannot provide an appropriate basis for addressing many important aspects of HCI, including computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) and cross-cultural aspects of computer use. Consequently the impact of HCI studies on current design practice is limited, with user interface design being based mainly on intuition and expensive trial and error. The form of a suitable HCI theory has been subjected to much debate recently (Carroll, Kellogg, and Rosson 1991). A major trend in the debate has been the growing dissatisfaction with the dominant cognitive approach (Bannon 1991; Wood 1992; Monk et al. 1993). In contrast to the general agreement that current attempts to apply cognitive psychology to HCI are not very successful, there is little agreement on the most promising theoretical alternatives. Proposals vary from an enrichment of the traditional cognitive scheme (Barnard 1991) to a radical shift in paradigms, for example, from scientific experimental studies to ethnographic methodology (see Monk et al. 1993). In this period of theoretical uncertainty there has been a growing interest in activity theory, greatly stimulated by Bødker's works (1989, 1991). She was the first Western researcher who presented the basic ideas and potential benefits of activity theory to the HCI community. Recently, a number of papers discussing the activity theory approach to HCI have appeared in major international journals and The aim of the present chapter is to summarize current work in activity theory and its implications for …",,31.0,431.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Misc{None,\n author = {V.

In recent decades, there has been considerable interest in using virtual reality for clinical purposes, including pain management. This articles describes a systematic review of research on virtual reality and pain management, with the aim of examining the feasibility of using virtual reality technologies and content design approaches in real-world clinical situations. More specifically, this article focuses on consumer virtual reality technologies. An exhaustive search identified 29 relevant studies from 2009 to 2016. Overall, the studies indicate that virtual reality is an effective technology to ameliorate pain in clinical settings. However, their results are inconclusive.

Safety officers can spread positive emotions and reduce crowd panic by issuing information or appeasement, which is an effective way to ensure evacuation safety. However, how to deploy safety officers appropriately and maximize positive emotional contagion to cover the largest number of chaotic individuals is still a challenging problem. To solve this problem, we propose an IoT-based positive emotional contagion (IoT-PEC) method for crowd evacuation. First, we employ IoT technologies to capture the attributes of crowd movement, such as position and velocity. Based on these attributes, the crowd chaos can be quantified by calculating the macroscopic and microscopic entropies. Second, we propose an entropy-based anisotropic emotional contagion model (E-AECM) to achieve the nonuniform positive emotional contagion considering the influence of chaos on the propagation rate. Third, we formulate the problem of safety officer placement as an optimization problem to maximize the positive emotional contagion on the chaos individuals. Finally, we implement a simulation system for crowd evacuation to visualize the results of positive emotion contagion. The proposed method can provide guidance for emergency response management.",2020.0,55.0,31.0,"{'volume': '8', 'pages': '1057-1070', 'name': 'IEEE Internet of Things Journal'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zhang2020IoTBasedPE,\n author = {Guijuan Zhang and Dianjie Lu and Hong Liu},\n journal = {IEEE Internet of Things Journal},\n pages = {1057-1070},\n title = {IoT-Based Positive Emotional Contagion for Crowd Evacuation},\n volume = {8},\n year = {2020}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '3172102', 'name': 'Guijuan Zhang'}, {'authorId': '7382513', 'name': 'Dianjie Lu'}, {'authorId': '2118902760', 'name': 'Hong Liu'}]"

Therefore, it is essential to design machines to elicit trust, so as to make interactions with them acceptable and successful. However, while there is a substantial literature on first impressions of trustworthiness based on various characteristics, including voice, not much is known about the trust development process. Are first impressions maintained over time? Or are they influenced by the experience of an agent's behaviour? We addressed these questions in three experiments using the ""iterated investment game"", a methodology derived from game theory that allows implicit measures of trust to be collected over time. Participants played the game with various agents having different voices: in the first experiment, participants played with a computer agent that had either a Standard Southern British English accent or a Liverpool accent; in the second experiment, they played with a computer agent that had either an SSBE or a Birmingham accent; in the third experiment, they played with a robot that had either a natural or a synthetic voice. All these agents behaved either trustworthily or untrustworthily. In all three experiments, participants trusted the agent with one voice more when it was trustworthy, and the agent with the other voice more when it was untrustworthy. This suggests that participants might change their trusting behaviour based on the congruency of the agent's behaviour with the participant's first impression.

In this paper, we propose a novel crowd simulation method by modeling the generation and contagion of panic emotion under multihazard circumstances. In order to depict the effect from hazards and other agents to crowd movement, we first classify hazards into different types (transient and persistent, concurrent and nonconcurrent, and static and dynamic) based on their inherent characteristics. Second, we introduce the concept of perilous field for each hazard and further transform the critical level of the field to its invoked-panic emotion. After that, we propose an emotional contagion model to simulate the evolving process of panic emotion caused by multiple hazards. Finally, we introduce an emotional reciprocal velocity obstacles (RVOs) model to simulate the crowd behaviors by augmenting the traditional RVO model with emotional contagion, which for the first time combines the emotional impact and local avoidance together. Our experimental results demonstrate that the overall approach is robust, can better generate realistic crowds and the panic emotion dynamics in a crowd. Furthermore, it is recommended that our method can be applied to various complex multihazard environments.",2018.0,57.0,88.0,"{'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems', 'pages': '1567-1581', 'volume': '51'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Xu2018CrowdBS,\n author = {Mingliang Xu and Xiaozhen Xie and Pei Lv and Jiangwei Niu and Hua Wang and Chaochao Li and Ruijie Zhu and Z.

It is critical for their quality of life that rehabilitation techniques progress at a fast pace, in order to provide them with the chance to live as independently as possible. The degree of independence can be increased by improving the physical capacities to the greatest possible extent. An aspect that seems to have a great potential is neural plasticity: the ability of the human brain to rebuild lost neural pathways around the lost tissue. One procedure that seems to help this process is observing the movement through visual feedback. When actual feedback is not available - due to the existing disability - it is possible that an artificial or amplified feedback may `trick' the brain into believing that the motor action was performed - thus learning that the command is correct and a pathway must be created for it. In this article we survey some of the existing literature regarding the ability to `fool' the brain by providing an amplified feedback in order to stimulate the plasticity process.

In this study, we hypothesized that interfering with the AON will impair action recognition and that this impairment will be modulated by empathy levels. In Experiment 1 (n = 90), participants were asked to recognize facial expressions while their facial motion was restricted. In Experiment 2 (n = 50), we interfered with the AON by applying transcranial Direct Current Stimulation to the motor cortex. In both experiments, we found that interfering with the AON impaired the performance of participants with high empathy levels; however, for the first time, we demonstrated that the interference enhanced the performance of participants with low empathy.

Implicit skill learning, with its unconscious and statistical properties, underlies not only motor but also cognitive and social skills, and it therefore plays an important role from infancy to old age. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated probabilistic implicit sequence learning and its consolidation in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Three groups of children participated: thirteen with high-functioning ASD, 14 age-matched controls, and 13 IQ-matched controls. All were tested on the Alternating Serial Reaction Time Task (ASRT), making it possible to separate general skill learning from sequence-specific learning. The ASRT task was repeated after 16 hours. We found that control and ASD children showed similar sequence-specific and general skill learning in the learning phase. Consolidation of skill learning and sequence-specific learning were also intact in the ASD compared to the control groups. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that autistic children can use the effects/results of implicit learning not only for a short period, but also for a longer stretch of time. Using these findings, therapists can design more effective educational and rehabilitation programs.",2010.0,44.0,93.0,"{'volume': '5', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Németh2010LearningIA,\n author = {D.

During a story-listening functional MRI task, children who had experienced more conversational turns with adults—independently of SES, IQ, and adult-child utterances alone—exhibited greater left inferior frontal (Broca’s area) activation, which significantly explained the relation between children’s language exposure and verbal skill. This is the first evidence directly relating children’s language environments with neural language processing, specifying both an environmental and a neural mechanism underlying SES disparities in children’s language skills.

Implicit learning experiments use 3 different stimulus structures (visual, sequence, and function) and 3 different dependent measures or response modalities (conceptual fluency, efficiency, and prediction and control). Implicit learning may require a certain minimal amount of attention and may depend on attentional and working memory mechanisms. The result of implicit learning is implicit knowledge in the form of abstract (but possibly instantiated) representations rather than verbatim or aggregate representations. Implicit learning shows biases and dissociations in learning different stimulus structures. The dependence of implicit learning on particular brain areas is discussed, some conclusions are drawn for modeling implicit learning, and the interaction of implicit and explicit learning is considered. Implicit learning as a field of study in cognitive psychology began with A. S. Rebel's (1967, 1969) work on artificial grammar learning in the late 1960s. However, interest in implicit learning has exploded in the last decade, beginning with the work of Broadbent and colleagues in dynamic systems research in the early 1980s (Berry & Broadbent, 1984) and continuing with serial reaction time task research (Nissen & Bullemer, 1987) and contingent reaction time task research (Lewicki, Czyzewska, & Hoffman, 1987). The burst of interest in implicit learning (learning complex information without complete ver-balizable knowledge of what is learned) comes at least partly as a parallel development to the recent identification and exploration of implicit memory (predominantly, but not solely, unconscious priming effects of previously presented stimuli) in both normal and amnesic patients (Schacter, 1987). It also parallels increased interest in unconscious cognition in general Implicit learning has been proposed as an evolutionary ancestor of explicit thought (A. S. Reber, 1992) and, as such, is considered to have a foundational role in cognition and to be closely related to learning in related animal species (Mishkin, Malamut, & Bachevalier, 1984). Implicit learning may play an important role in the development of procedural knowledge of how complex real-world systems function (Senge & Sterman, 1992). Also, it may be involved in cognitive development (Gelman, 1991) and in social information processing I would like to thank the following for useful comments on and discussions concerning earlier versions of this article: Research on implicit learning has generally been concerned with establishing the existence of implicit learning and exploring how implicit and explicit learning may or may not interact.. …",2019.0,233.0,617.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Cleeremans2019ImplicitL,\n author = {A.

The need to analyze such user social graph via implicit clusters, enables the dynamism in contact management. Study seeks to implement this dynamism via a comparative study of the deep neural network and friend suggest algorithm.

Yet, the neural mechanisms implicated in approach‐avoidance tendencies to distinct emotional expressions have not been fully described. Here, we investigated the neural systems implicated in regulating the distance to different emotions, and how they vary as a function of empathy. Twenty‐three healthy participants assessed for psychopathic traits underwent fMRI scanning while they viewed approaching and withdrawing angry, fearful, happy, sad and neutral faces. Participants were also asked to set the distance to those faces on a computer screen, and to adjust the physical distance from the experimenter outside the scanner. Participants kept the greatest distances from angry faces, and shortest from happy expressions. This was accompanied by increased activation in the dorsomedial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices, inferior frontal gyrus, and temporoparietal junction for angry and happy expressions relative to the other emotions. Irrespective of emotion, longer distances were kept from approaching faces, which was associated with increased activation in the amygdala and insula, as well as parietal and prefrontal regions. Amygdala activation was positively correlated with greater preferred distances to angry, fearful and sad expressions. Moreover, participants scoring higher on coldhearted psychopathic traits (lower empathy) showed reduced amygdala activation to sad expressions. These findings elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying social approach‐avoidance, and how they are related to variations in empathy.

Method: Two hundred and sixty clinicians completed an on-line survey that was disseminated through professional brain injury organisations. Of respondents around 90% were allied health clinicians, with the remainder comprising medical, nursing and academia. Main outcomes: The four areas of social cognition that were routinely assessed across the disciplines were insight, disinhibition, anger and social adjustment. The least routinely assessed areas were theory of mind and alexithymia. The test suggested most likely to identify social cognition impairments was The Awareness of Social Inference Test, although only 8% of clinicians responded to this question. Clinicians preferred informal assessment methods over standardised assessment methods for identifying social cognition rehabilitation goals. Higher levels of education were associated with greater use of standardised assessment modalities. Whilst there was paucity of responses overall, TBI Express was most commonly used for social cognition rehabilitation. Conclusions: Considering the high prevalence of social cognition impairments in this population, formal assessment is extremely limited. The under-utilisation of assessment tools is problematic for the assessment and rehabilitation initiatives offered to people with TBI. These results have implications for the training of clinicians working in brain injury rehabilitation.",2017.0,131.0,24.0,"{'volume': '18', 'pages': '11 - 35', 'name': 'Brain Impairment'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kelly2017AssessmentAR,\n author = {M.

Acceptance of these synthetic characters depends on their ability to properly and recognizably convey basic emotion states to a user population. This study presents an analysis of the interaction between emotional audio (human voice) and video (simple animation) cues. The emotional relevance of the channels is analyzed with respect to their effect on human perception and through the study of the extracted audio-visual features that contribute most prominently to human perception. As a result of the unequal level of expressivity across the two channels, the audio was shown to bias the perception of the evaluators. However, even in the presence of a strong audio bias, the video data were shown to affect human perception. The feature sets extracted from emotionally matched audio-visual displays contained both audio and video features while feature sets resulting from emotionally mismatched audio-visual displays contained only audio information. This result indicates that observers integrate natural audio cues and synthetic video cues only when the information expressed is in congruence. It is therefore important to properly design the presentation of audio-visual cues as incorrect design may cause observers to ignore the information conveyed in one of the channels.",2009.0,46.0,62.0,"{'volume': '11', 'pages': '843-855', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Multimedia'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Provost2009HumanPO,\n author = {E.

Participants were presented with one of two virtual human conditions in a between-subjects experiment, static (non-animated) and dynamic (animated). Our objective measures included the use of psycho-physical Electro Dermal Activity (EDA) sensors, and subjective measures inspired by social psychology research included the Differential Emotions Survey (DES IV) and Positive and Negative Affect Survey (PANAS). We analyzed the quantitative and qualitative measures associated with participants' emotional state at four distinct time-steps in the simulated interpersonal experience as the virtual patient's medical condition deteriorated. Results suggest that participants in the dynamic condition with animations exhibited a higher sense of co-presence and greater emotional response as compared to participants in the static condition, corresponding to the deterioration in the medical condition of the virtual patient. Negative affect of participants in the dynamic condition increased at a higher rate than for participants in the static condition.

Nonverbal gestures such as facial expressions are important to human communication and should be considered by speech-driven face animation systems. In this paper, we present a framework that systematically addresses facial deformation modeling, automatic facial motion analysis, and real-time speech-driven face animation with expression using neural networks. Based on this framework, we learn a quantitative visual representation of the facial deformations, called the motion units (MUs). A facial deformation can be approximated by a linear combination of the MUs weighted by MU parameters (MUPs). We develop an MU-based facial motion tracking algorithm which is used to collect an audio-visual training database. Then, we construct a real-time audio-to-MUP mapping by training a set of neural networks using the collected audio-visual training database. The quantitative evaluation of the mapping shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Using the proposed method, we develop the functionality of real-time speech-driven face animation with expressions for the iFACE system. Experimental results show that the synthetic expressive talking face of the iFACE system is comparable with a real face in terms of the effectiveness of their influences on bimodal human emotion perception.",2002.0,57.0,106.0,"{'volume': '13 4', 'pages': '\n          916-27\n        ', 'name': 'IEEE transactions on neural networks'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hong2002RealtimeSF,\n author = {P.

How Can Technologies Help?,"This article proposes 7 core affordances of technology for collaborative learning based on theories of collaborative learning and CSCL (Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning) practices. Technology affords learner opportunities to (1) engage in a joint task, (2) communicate, (3) share resources, (4) engage in productive collaborative learning processes, (5) engage in co-construction, (6) monitor and regulate collaborative learning, and (7) find and build groups and communities. We elaborate our framework using in-depth explorations of how technologies are actually used to support collaborative learning in CSCL research and identify representative design strategies and technology examples. While technology can play an important role in addressing the demands of collaborative learning, it needs to be considered in conjunction with pedagogical strategies and other social and cultural supports for collaborative learning. The supports also need to remain at an appropriate level so as not to interfere with long-term learning goals.",2016.0,158.0,263.0,"{'volume': '51', 'pages': '247 - 265', 'name': 'Educational Psychologist'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Jeong2016SevenAO,\n author = {Heisawn Jeong and C.

A Meta-Analytic Review,"Research on the use of software programs and tools such as pedagogical agents has peaked over the last decade. Pedagogical agents are on-screen characters that facilitate instruction. This meta-analysis examined the effect of using pedagogical agents on learning by reviewing 43 studies involving 3,088 participants. Analysis of the results indicated that pedagogical agents produced a small but significant effect on learning. The overall mean effect size was moderated by the contextual and methodological features of the studies. The findings revealed that the use of pedagogical agents were more beneficial for K-12 students than post-secondary students. Pedagogical agents that communicated with students using on-screen text facilitated learning more effectively than agents that communicated using narration. The findings of this study have implications for advancing theory and practice, as well as highlighting productive future directions for research.",2013.0,80.0,187.0,"{'volume': '49', 'pages': '1 - 39', 'name': 'Journal of Educational Computing Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Schroeder2013HowEA,\n author = {Noah L.

In addition to providing problem-solving advice in response to students’ activities in the learning environment, these agents may also be able to play a powerful motivational role. To design the most effective agent-based learning environment software, it is essential to understand how students perceive an animated pedagogical agent with regard to affective dimensions such as encouragement, utility, credibility, and clarity. This paper describes a study of the affective impact of animated pedagogical agents on students’ learning experiences. One hundred middle school students interacted with animated pedagogical agents to assess their perception of agents’ affective characteristics. The study revealed the persona eflecr, which is that the presence of a lifelike character in an interactive learning environment~ven one that is not expressive— can have a strong positive effect on student’s perception of their learning experience. The study also demonstrates the interesting effect of multiple types of explanatory behaviors on both affective perception and learning performance.",1997.0,23.0,941.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human factors in computing systems'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Lester1997ThePE,\n author = {James C.

Our existing crowd simulation system (MACES) performs high level wayfinding to explore unknown environments and obtain a cognitive map for navigation purposes, in addition to dealing with low level motion within each room based on social forces. Communication and roles are added to achieve individualistic behaviors and a realistic way to spread information about the environment. To expand the range of realistic human behaviors, we use a system (PMFserv) that implements human behavior models from a range of ability, stress, emotion, decision theoretic and motivation sources. An architecture is proposed that combines and integrates MACES and PMFserv to add validated agent behaviors to crowd simulations.",2005.0,35.0,237.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': ""@Inproceedings{Pelechano2005CrowdSI,\n author = {N.

A comparative study of crowd solidarity among emergency survivors.,"Crowd behaviour in emergencies has previously been explained in terms of either 'mass panic' or strength of pre-existing social bonds. The present paper reports results from a study comparing high- versus low-identification emergency mass emergency survivors to test the interlinked claims (1) that shared identity in an emergency crowd enhances expressions of solidarity and reduces 'panic' behaviour and (2) that such a shared identity can arise from the shared experience of the emergency itself. Qualitative and descriptive quantitative analyses were carried out on interviews with 21 survivors of 11 emergencies. The analysis broadly supports these two claims. The study therefore points to the usefulness of a new approach to mass emergency behaviour, based on self-categorization theory (SCT).",2009.0,68.0,284.0,"{'volume': '48 Pt 3', 'pages': '\n          487-506\n        ', 'name': 'The British journal of social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Drury2009EveryoneFT,\n author = {J.

Due to its importance, several optical flow technique have been used in order to estimate the velocity and the direction of the pedestrians in the crowded scenes. This paper presents an overview of the optical flow methods that used mainly for pedestrian and crowd motion detection. The work focuses on the conventional optical flow method such as Lucas & Kanade and Horn & Schunck methods as well as the most recent methods such as Classic+NL that combines the classic formulation with a new non-local term. The improvement in computational efficiency and increasing interest in robust and accurate motion estimation algorithms lead to increase in the use of optical flow in crowd analytic applications. The implementation of optical flow algorithms is investigated and an evaluation of those techniques is provided qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The qualitative analysis illustrates the optical flow performance in terms of large motion, occlusion, motion discontinuities, illumination and different light condition.

The benefits of this proposed approach are illustrated on a case study using clustering analysis and a proof-of-concept simulation.

We distinguish between emotion and mood expression, and focus on mood expression. Bodily expression of an emotion is explicit behavior that typically interrupts ongoing functional behavior. Instead, bodily mood expression is integrated with functional behaviors without interrupting them. We propose a parameterized behavior model with specific behavior parameters for bodily mood expression. Robot mood controls pose and motion parameters, while those parameters modulate behavior appearance. We applied the model to two concrete behaviors - waving and pointing - of the NAO robot, and conducted a user study in which participants (N=24) were asked to design the expression of positive, neutral, and negative moods by modulating the parameters of the two behaviors. Results show that participants created different parameter settings corresponding with different moods, and the settings were generally consistent across participants. Various parameter settings were also found to be behavior-invariant. These findings suggest that our model and parameter set are promising for expressing moods in a variety of behaviors.",2013.0,22.0,52.0,"{'pages': '533-540', 'name': '2013 IEEE RO-MAN'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Xu2013MoodET,\n author = {Junchao Xu and J.

(b) Is the relationship between facial mimicry and liking symmetrical for the mimicker and the mimickee? (c) Does conscious mimicry have consequences for emotion recognition? A paradigm is introduced in which participants interact over a computer setup with a confederate whose prerecorded facial displays of emotion are synchronized with participants’ behavior to create the illusion of social interaction. In Experiment 1, the confederate did or did not mimic participants’ facial displays of various subsets of basic emotions. Mimicry promoted greater liking for the confederate regardless of which emotions were mimicked. Experiment 2 reversed these roles: participants were instructed to mimic or not to mimic the confederate’s facial displays. Mimicry did not affect liking for the confederate but it did impair emotion recognition.",2015.0,72.0,32.0,"{'volume': '155', 'pages': '590 - 604', 'name': 'The Journal of Social Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kulesza2015TheFO,\n author = {Wojciech Kulesza and A.

Also, those nurses who show a high ability to curtail their negative emotional states and prolong positive emotional states show higher levels of overall health than those individuals who have trouble regulating their emotions.

The architecture is a form of Memory Network [23] but unlike the model in that work, it is trained end-to-end, and hence requires significantly less supervision during training, making it more generally applicable in realistic settings. It can also be seen as an extension of RNNsearch [2] to the case where multiple computational steps (hops) are performed per output symbol. The flexibility of the model allows us to apply it to tasks as diverse as (synthetic) question answering [22] and to language modeling. For the former our approach is competitive with Memory Networks, but with less supervision. For the latter, on the Penn TreeBank and Text8 datasets our approach demonstrates comparable performance to RNNs and LSTMs. In both cases we show that the key concept of multiple computational hops yields improved results.",2015.0,26.0,2334.0,{'pages': '2440-2448'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Sukhbaatar2015EndToEndMN,\n author = {Sainbayar Sukhbaatar and Arthur Szlam and J.

1077,4f118d8cfd9e4eb3df249e97844af338fc171b4f,A Virtual Reprise of the Stanley Milgram Obedience Experiments,"Background Stanley Milgram's 1960s experimental findings that people would administer apparently lethal electric shocks to a stranger at the behest of an authority figure remain critical for understanding obedience. Yet, due to the ethical controversy that his experiments ignited, it is nowadays impossible to carry out direct experimental studies in this area. In the study reported in this paper, we have used a similar paradigm to the one used by Milgram within an immersive virtual environment. Our objective has not been the study of obedience in itself, but of the extent to which participants would respond to such an extreme social situation as if it were real in spite of their knowledge that no real events were taking place. Methodology Following the style of the original experiments, the participants were invited to administer a series of word association memory tests to the (female) virtual human representing the stranger. When she gave an incorrect answer, the participants were instructed to administer an ‘electric shock’ to her, increasing the voltage each time. She responded with increasing discomfort and protests, eventually demanding termination of the experiment. Of the 34 participants, 23 saw and heard the virtual human, and 11 communicated with her only through a text interface. Conclusions Our results show that in spite of the fact that all participants knew for sure that neither the stranger nor the shocks were real, the participants who saw and heard her tended to respond to the situation at the subjective, behavioural and physiological levels as if it were real. This result reopens the door to direct empirical studies of obedience and related extreme social situations, an area of research that is otherwise not open to experimental study for ethical reasons, through the employment of virtual environments.",2006.0,34.0,558.0,"{'volume': '1', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Slater2006AVR,\n author = {M.

1081,4f744f09a575471059a7dafb142b44e5305e5e3f,Using Emotion Simulation to Influence User Attitudes and Behaviour,"Humans have a natural tendency to unconsciously treat computers as though they are social actors. Many of the human-human social rules that have been well researched and defined in social psychology also seem to apply in human-computer interaction (HCI). This presents an opportunity for computers to use many of the principles and rules from human-human interaction and utilise them for enhancing HCI. One such set of principles that have been extensively investigated and examined in social psychology are influence strategies. A number of different approaches and techniques can be used to influence another’s attitudes and behaviour. These persuasive techniques could potentially be used by computers to influence or change user attitudes and behaviour for beneficial purposes (e.g. smoking cessation or improving exercise behaviour). In this project I will investigate how we respond to interface agents which make use of influence strategies when attempting to change our attitudes and behaviour toward eating. The manipulation of emotions is an essential aspect of attitude and behaviour change and it is proposed that the role of emotion in HCI will also be investigated. Interface designers often incorporate emotional expressions and statements into interface agents, through the use of textual content, synthetic or recorded speech, embodied characters, or multimedia video, without an understanding of the psychological impact on users. Moreover, it is largely unknown how strong user responses are to the synthetic emotional expressions made by computers. I will attempt to address these issues through three different investigations. Firstly, an examination of how users respond to the emotional expressions of different types of interface agents will be undertaken. Secondly, an investigation will be conducted to help understand whether agents that make use of influence strategies are able to influence or change user attitudes and behaviour more effectively than agents which do not. Finally, I will test whether emotional interface agents (which employ influence tactics) are able to influence or change user attitudes and behaviour more effectively than unemotional agents.",2005.0,60.0,10.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Creed2005UsingES,\n author = {C.

The level of engagement with and adoption of new digital applications depends on various personal, contextual, and emotional factors. In our study, we assessed the personal factors, such as gender differences, of perceiving and adopting technologies such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and conventional video. Furthermore, we assessed what kind of emotions are involved in and invoked by the context of new technologies. This is a quantitative study in which students were asked to perform experiments on VR, AR, and conventional videos. After the experiments, participants were asked to fill out a predefined survey about their emotional reactions to the experiments. The results show, unlike the prior research, that female participants were more enthusiastic about the usage of new technologies than males. The user experience of VR, AR and conventional videos triggered more positive emotions among females than males. For practitioners, the results  suggest that the audio-visual technologies could engage more females than males.

Subjects were asked to converse about six topics, five of which were selected as having moderate intimacy value. Conversations were tape recorded and several measures of self-disclosure were obtained from the tapes, from judges' ratings of the conversations, and from subjects' self reports. For the behavioral, judged, and self-reported measures of intimacy and self-disclosure, males tended to increase their intimacy rather dramatically as the interaction distance increased while females evidenced slightly decreasing intimacy as the interaction distance increased.

CT was designed to enable investigation of properties of decision-making strategies in multi-agent situations of varying complexity. The paper presents the results of an initial series of experiments of CT games in which agentsý choices affected not only their own outcomes but also the outcomes of other agents. It compares the behavior of people with that of computer agents deploying a variety of decision-making strategies. The results align with behavioral economics studies in showing that people cooperate when they play and that factors of social dependency influence their levels of cooperation. Preliminary results indicate that people design agents to play strategies closer to game-theory predictions, yielding lower utility. Additional experiments show that such agents perform worse than agents designed to make choices that resemble human cooperative behavior.

The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure.

To this end, we examined performance of men and women while classifying strings of average and attractive faces for grammaticality in the experimental task of artificial grammar learning (AGL), which reflects both conscious and unconscious processes. Subjective measures were used to assess participants’ conscious and unconscious knowledge. It was found that female attractiveness impaired performance in male participants. In particular, male participants demonstrated the lowest accuracy while classifying beautiful faces of women. Conversely, female attractiveness facilitated performance in female participants. The pattern was similar for conscious and unconscious knowledge. Presumably, objects with high incentive salience, as are beautiful faces, captured resources, which were used in task relevant versus task irrelevant ways by women versus men.

Methods This was a pragmatic, multicentre, three arm, parallel randomised controlled trial with simple randomisation. Treatment allocation was not blinded. Participants were adults with symptoms of depression (score ≥10 on nine item patient health questionnaire, PHQ-9) who were randomised to receive a commercially produced cCBT programme (“Beating the Blues”) or a free to use cCBT programme (MoodGYM) in addition to usual GP care. Participants were supported and encouraged to complete the programme via weekly telephone calls. Control participants were offered usual GP care, with no constraints on the range of treatments that could be accessed. The primary outcome was severity of depression assessed with the PHQ-9 at four months. Secondary outcomes included health related quality of life (measured by SF-36) and psychological wellbeing (measured by CORE-OM) at four, 12, and 24 months and depression at 12 and 24 months. Study answer and limitations Participants offered commercial or free to use cCBT experienced no additional improvement in depression compared with usual GP care at four months (odds ratio 1.19 (95% confidence interval 0.75 to 1.88) for Beating the Blues v usual GP care; 0.98 (0.62 to 1.56) for MoodGYM v usual GP care). There was no evidence of an overall difference between either programme compared with usual GP care (0.99 (0.57 to 1.70) and 0.68 (0.42 to 1.10), respectively) at any time point. Commercially provided cCBT conferred no additional benefit over free to use cCBT or usual GP care at any follow-up point. Uptake and use of cCBT was low, despite regular telephone support. Nearly a quarter of participants (24%) had dropped out by four months. The study did not have enough power to detect small differences so these cannot be ruled out. Findings cannot be generalised to cCBT offered with a much higher level of guidance and support. What this study adds Supported cCBT does not substantially improve depression outcomes compared with usual GP care alone. In this study, neither a commercially available nor free to use computerised CBT intervention was superior to usual GP care.

This study examined whether familiarizing toddlers with a character would improve toddlers' performance on a subsequent seriation task. Toddlers were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) a familiarized character condition where toddlers viewed character-based videos and engaged in character-based play over a 3-month period before viewing the seriation video demonstration; (2) an unfamiliarized character condition where the toddler only saw the seriation video demonstration; and (3) a no-exposure control group where the toddler did not see the seriation video demonstration or have any involvement with the character. All toddlers were tested on the same seriation task at age 21 months, with the familiarized character group beginning the study at age 18 months and the other groups participating only at age 21 months. Toddlers in the familiarized character condition, but not the unfamiliarized character condition, completed the seriation task significantly better than the no-exposure control group. Within the familiarized character condition, toddlers who nurtured the character during play subsequently had higher seriation scores.

The relation of shame and guilt to anger and self-reported aggression.,"The relation of shame and guilt to anger and aggression has been the focus of considerable theoretical discussion, but empirical findings have been inconsistent. Two recently developed measures of affective style were used to examine whether shame-proneness and guilt-proneness are differentially related to anger, hostility, and aggression. In 2 studies, 243 and 252 undergraduates completed the Self-Conscious Affect and Attribution Inventory, the Symptom Checklist 90, and the Spielberger Trait Anger Scale. Study 2 also included the Test of Self-Conscious Affect and the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory. Shame-proneness was consistently correlated with anger arousal, suspiciousness, resentment, irritability, a tendency to blame others for negative events, and indirect (but not direct) expressions of hostility. Proneness to ""shame-free"" guilt was inversely related to externalization of blame and some indices of anger, hostility, and resentment.",1992.0,33.0,801.0,"{'volume': '62 4', 'pages': '\n          669-75\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tangney1992ShamedIA,\n author = {June P Tangney and Patricia E.

1118,53052e7b5d0ffb9f5626d769e07295dfd838a4b9,Emotions and facial expressions: A perspective from Differential Emotions Theory.,"In my first major effort at elaborating Differential Emotions Theory (DET), I proposed that personality was a supersystem consisting of five separate though highly interacting subsystems (Izard, 1971). The emotions were conceived as one of the subsystems of personality, and, following Tomkins (1962), the emotions were viewed as the primary motivational system for human behavior. Furthermore, each discrete emotion was interpreted as a system with distinct though interacting components. Although DET has changed to accommodate new thought and data, the essence of the systems approach has remained integral (cf. Izard et al., 1995). The systems concept is important in presenting a perspective on facial expressions, because the perspective I present hinges on the concepts of systems and separate, dissociable components. Facial expression (as well as vocal, postural, gestural expression) is conceived as an evolved, genetically influenced but highly modifiable and dissociable component of emotion. However, as stated on previous occasions (e.g., Izard, 1977), observable expression is not viewed as a necessary component of emotion . One goal of this chapter is to summarize the argument for this position and to place it in perspective by addressing two kinds of counterarguments, argument against the evolutionary-genetic origin of facial expressions and argument against their links to emotion (feeling/motivational) states. Another goal is to reaffirm the theoretical significance of the concept of patterns. In DET, the term pattern refers to one of two phenomena: A set of movements that index a discrete emotion or a set or cluster of discrete emotions that interact to produce complex affective phenomena such as anxiety and depression (Izard & Youngstrom, 1996).",1997.0,0.0,138.0,"{'volume': '', 'pages': '57-77', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Izard1997EmotionsAF,\n author = {C.

Although its psychometric properties are relatively well understood, the impact that differences in users’ personality traits have on their perceived usability of products, services, and systems has not been deeply explored—even though people’s scores on personality traits have been shown to be reliable and predict a staggering array of societally important outcomes in work, school, and life domains. In this study, 268 users assessed the usability of 20 different products retrospectively with the SUS. Five broad personality traits were then measured using the Mini-IPIP scale. Results indicated that measured personality traits do correlate with the rated usability of products, where measures of Openness to Experience and Agreeableness have the strongest positive correlations with subjective usability assessment. Implications for practitioners, designers, and researchers are discussed.",2018.0,79.0,36.0,"{'volume': '34', 'pages': '177 - 186', 'name': 'International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kortum2018TheIO,\n author = {P.

In face-to-face interactions, aversive or appetitive actions typically co-occur with emotional expressions, allowing an observer to anticipate action intentions. In the present study, we investigated the influence of facial emotions on the processing of action intentions. Thirty-two participants were presented with video clips showing virtual agents displaying a facial emotion (angry vs. happy) while performing an action (punch vs. fist-bump) directed towards the observer. During each trial, video clips stopped at varying durations of the unfolding action, and participants had to recognize the presented action. Naturally, participants’ recognition accuracy improved with increasing duration of the unfolding actions. Interestingly, while facial emotions did not influence accuracy, there was a significant influence on participants’ action judgements. Participants were more likely to judge a presented action as a punch when agents showed an angry compared to a happy facial emotion. This effect was more pronounced in short video clips, showing only the beginning of an unfolding action, than in long video clips, showing near-complete actions. These results suggest that facial emotions influence anticipatory processing of action intentions allowing for fast and adaptive responses in social interactions.",2021.0,47.0,5.0,"{'volume': '16', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kroczek2021AngryFE,\n author = {Leon O.

Simple regression/correlation is often applied to non-independent observations or aggregated data; this may produce biased, specious results due to violation of independence and/or differing patterns between-participants versus within-participants. Unlike simple regression/correlation, rmcorr does not violate the assumption of independence of observations. Also, rmcorr tends to have much greater statistical power because neither averaging nor aggregation is necessary for an intra-individual research question. Rmcorr estimates the common regression slope, the association shared among individuals. To make rmcorr accessible, we provide background information for its assumptions and equations, visualization, power, and tradeoffs with rmcorr compared to multilevel modeling. We introduce the R package (rmcorr) and demonstrate its use for inferential statistics and visualization with two example datasets. The examples are used to illustrate research questions at different levels of analysis, intra-individual, and inter-individual. Rmcorr is well-suited for research questions regarding the common linear association in paired repeated measures data.

We propose a new robot-assisted pedestrian regulation and study passive human–robot interaction (HRI). A learning-based motion control approach is presented for a robot to efficiently interact with pedestrians for desirable collective motion. We first formulate the problem into an optimal control framework using the pedestrian dynamics description based on existing social force models with embedded HRI forces. To solve the defined optimal control problem, we propose an adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) approach to provide adjustable motion parameters of the robot to efficiently interact with pedestrians so that the regulated pedestrian flow tracks a desired velocity. The ADP control process only uses observed flow information rather than the models of pedestrians, and the ADP method provides feedback control with online learning and control capability. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can regulate pedestrian flows to desirable speeds by online learning.",2019.0,54.0,33.0,"{'volume': '49', 'pages': '797-813', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Jiang2019LearningHI,\n author = {Chao Jiang and Zhen Ni and Yi Guo and Haibo He},\n journal = {IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems},\n pages = {797-813},\n title = {Learning Human–Robot Interaction for Robot-Assisted Pedestrian Flow Optimization},\n volume = {49},\n year = {2019}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2115484380', 'name': 'Chao Jiang'}, {'authorId': '2142260323', 'name': 'Zhen Ni'}, {'authorId': '144979422', 'name': 'Yi Guo'}, {'authorId': '2198278', 'name': 'Haibo He'}]"

We developed a prototype version of an abstract emotion visualization agent to express five basic emotions and a neutral state. In contrast to well-known symbolic characters (e.g., smileys) these displays follow general biological and ethological rules. We conducted a multiple questionnaire study on the assessment of the displays with Hungarian and Japanese subjects. In most cases participants were successful in recognizing the displayed emotions. Fear and sadness were most easily confused with each other while both the Hungarian and Japanese participants recognized the anger display most correctly. We suggest that the implemented biological approach can be a viable complement to the emotion expressions of some artificial agents, for example mobile devices.",2018.0,92.0,10.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Korcsok2018BiologicallyIE,\n author = {Beáta Korcsok and Veronika Konok and G.

1135,5421a25239b38f459d5bd86e1c46d9ae8a04cc7c,An agent-based approach for modeling dynamics of contagious disease spread,"Background: The propagation of communicable diseases through a population is an inherent spatial and temporal process of great importance for modern society. For this reason a spatially explicit epidemiologic model of infectious disease is proposed for a greater understanding of the disease's spatial diffusion through a network of human contacts. Objective: The objective of this study is to develop an agent-based modelling approach the integrates geographic information systems (GIS) to simulate the spread of a communicable disease in an urban environment, as a result of individuals' interactions in a geospatial context. Methods: The methodology for simulating spatiotemporal dynamics of communicable disease propagation is presented and the model is implemented using measles outbreak in an urban environment as a case study. Individuals in a closed population are explicitly represented by agents associated to places where they interact with other agents. They are endowed with mobility, through a transportation network allowing them to move between places within the urban environment, in order to represent the spatial heterogeneity and the complexity involved in infectious diseases diffusion. The model is implemented on georeferenced land use dataset from Metro Vancouver and makes use of census data sets from Statistics Canada for the municipality of Burnaby, BC, Canada study site. Results: The results provide insights into the application of the model to calculate ratios of susceptible/infected in specific time frames and urban environments, due to its ability to depict the disease progression based on individuals' interactions. It is demonstrated that the dynamic spatial interactions within the population lead to high numbers of exposed individuals who perform stationary activities in areas after they have finished commuting. As a result, the sick individuals are concentrated in geographical locations like schools and universities. Conclusion: The GIS-agent based model designed for this study can be easily customized to study the disease spread dynamics of any other communicable disease by simply adjusting the modeled disease timeline and/or the infection model and modifying the transmission process. This type of simulations can help to improve comprehension of disease spread dynamics and to take better steps towards the prevention and control of an epidemic outbreak.

The present study is the first to examine the impact of the attribution of mind to others on gaze-guided attentional orienting and its ERP correlates. Using a paradigm in which attention was guided to a location by the gaze of a centrally presented face, we manipulated participants' beliefs about the gazer: gaze behavior was believed to result either from operations of a mind or from a machine. In Experiment 1, beliefs were manipulated by cue identity (human or robot), while in Experiment 2, cue identity (robot) remained identical across conditions and beliefs were manipulated solely via instruction, which was irrelevant to the task. ERP results and behavior showed that participants' attention was guided by gaze only when gaze was believed to be controlled by a human. Specifically, the P1 was more enhanced for validly, relative to invalidly, cued targets only when participants believed the gaze behavior was the result of a mind, rather than of a machine. This shows that sensory gain control can be influenced by higher-order (task-irrelevant) beliefs about the observed scene. We propose a new interdisciplinary model of social attention, which integrates ideas from cognitive and social neuroscience, as well as philosophy in order to provide a framework for understanding a crucial aspect of how humans' beliefs about the observed scene influence sensory processing.",2014.0,53.0,127.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wykowska2014BeliefsAT,\n author = {A.

In addition, the individual personality also plays an important role in crowd emotional contagion. However, few existing works have investigated the two factors jointly. To solve this problem, we propose a personalized virtual and physical cyberspace-based emotional contagion model (PVP-ECM) to simulate the process of crowd emotional contagion. First, we construct an individual emotion model and propose the personalized emotional contagion rules to consider the influences of the individual personality on crowd emotional contagion coupling the virtual and physical cyberspaces. Second, we use mean field theory to derive an evolution process and obtain mean field equations for the PVP-ECM. Then, we solve the PVP-ECM numerically using the finite difference method. Third, we construct a personalized BA scale-free network for the PVP-ECM simulation to further verify the stability of the model. Finally, we perform the PVP-ECM simulation and implement a simulation system to visualize the results of our theoretical analysis. The experimental results show that our approach can simulate the process of crowd emotional contagion more realistically.

Assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance underlie this test. More often than not, when these conditions are not met, Student’s t -test can be severely biased and lead to invalid statistical inferences. Moreover, we argue that the assumption of equal variances will seldom hold in psychological research, and choosing between Student’s t -test and Welch’s t -test based on the outcomes of a test of the equality of variances often fails to provide an appropriate answer. We show that the Welch’s t -test provides a better control of Type 1 error rates when the assumption of homogeneity of variance is not met, and it loses little robustness compared to Student’s t -test when the assumptions are met.

In the first study (n = 131), psychology students received false feedback that their group was more or less intelligent than a comparable outgroup (business students) in order to manipulate relative ingroup status. Subjects were divided into high and low identifiers on the basis of their scores on an ingroup identification measures. As well as rating both groups on a series of comparative dimensions, subjects rated the similarities within their group. Although there was no difference in similarity ratings between high and low identifiers when ingroup status was high, low status subjects who identified weakly with their group rated within-group similarity as significantly less than high identifiers. In the second study (n = 101) both status and group identification were manipulated experimentally. Subjects were categorized as belonging to one of two groups, ostensibly on the basis of their problem solving style, and they received false feedback on a subsequent task indicating that their group had performed better or worse than the other group on a series of personnel decision problems. Group identification was manipulated by means of false feedback reinforced by a ""bogus pipeline"" procedure. Ratings of ingroup (and outgroup) variability as measured by the perceived range of group scores on various positive dimensions, replicated the interaction obtained the first study. In the high status condition, ingroup identification did not affect the perceived range of group scores whereas under low group status, subjects in the low identification condition perceived greater intragroup variation than did subjects in the high identification condition. The differential perception and use of variability judgments by high and low group identifiers in the face of a threatened group image is discussed in terms of social identity principles.",1995.0,0.0,1026.0,"{'volume': '31', 'pages': '410-436', 'name': 'Journal of Experimental Social Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Doosje1995PERCEIVEDIV,\n author = {B.

In a set of three perceptual studies, we investigated how humans perceive characteristics of virtual crowds in static scenes reconstructed from annotated still images, where the orientations and positions of the individuals have been modified. We found that by applying rules based on the contextual information of the scene, we improved the perceived realism of the crowd formations when compared to random formations. We also examined the effect of camera viewpoint on the plausibility of virtual pedestrian scenes, and we found that an eye-level viewpoint is more effective for disguising random behaviors, while a canonical viewpoint results in these behaviors being perceived as less realistic than an isometric or top-down viewpoint. Results from these studies can help in the creation of virtual crowds, such as computer graphics pedestrian models or architectural scenes, and identify situations when users' perception is less accurate.",2011.0,28.0,43.0,"{'volume': '8', 'pages': '10:1-10:22', 'name': 'ACM Trans.

The main goal is to individuate a minimal representation of emotional displays based on nonverbal gesture features. The GEMEP (Geneva multimodal emotion portrayals) corpus was used to validate this framework. Twelve emotions expressed by 10 actors form the selected data set of emotion portrayals. Visual tracking of trajectories of head and hands were performed from a frontal and a lateral view. Postural/shape and dynamic expressive gesture features were identified and analyzed. A feature reduction procedure was carried out, resulting in a 4D model of emotion expression that effectively classified/grouped emotions according to their valence (positive, negative) and arousal (high, low). These results show that emotionally relevant information can be detected/measured/obtained from the dynamic qualities of gesture. The framework was implemented as software modules (plug-ins) extending the EyesWeb XMI Expressive Gesture Processing Library and is going to be used in user centric, networked media applications, including future mobiles, characterized by low computational resources, and limited sensor systems.",2011.0,82.0,212.0,"{'volume': '2', 'pages': '106-118', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Glowinski2011TowardAM,\n author = {D.

Tracking is a more complex problem than speech-to-text alignment, since presenters rarely follow their exact presentation notes, and it must be performed in realtime. In this paper, we propose a novel system that can track the current degree of coverage of each slide’s contents. To do this, the presentation notes for each slide are segmented into sentences, and the words are filtered into keyword candidates. These candidates are then scored based on word specificity and semantic similarity measures to find the most useful keywords for the tracking task. Real-time automatic speech recognition results are matched against the keywords and their synonyms. Sentences are scored based on detected keywords, and the ones with scores higher than a threshold are tagged as covered. We manually and automatically annotated 150 slide presentation recordings to evaluate the system. A simple tracking method, matching speech recognition results against the notes, was used as the baseline.

Distant services in turn can acquire local information from people in an area of interest. Socially expressive agent behaviour has been suggested as a way to build reciprocal relationships and to increase user response to such requests. This between-subject, Wizard-of-Oz experiment aimed to investigate the potential of such behaviours. 44 participants performed a search task in an urgent context while being interrupted by a mobile agent that both provided and requested information. The socially expressive behaviour shown in this study did not increase compliance to requests; it instead reduced trust in provided information and compliance to warnings. It also negatively impacted the affective experience of users scoring lower on empathy as a personality trait. Inappropriate social expressiveness can have serious consequences; we here elaborate on the reasons for our negative results.",2010.0,15.0,10.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems'},"{'bibtex': ""@Article{Cramer2010TryingTH,\n author = {H.

Automatic Processing as a Function of Age and Reading Ability. CmLD DEVELOPMENT, 1978, 49, 707-716. Early and late first-grade children, third-grade poor and good readers, and adults named pictures under several interference conditions: with embedded intracategory or extracategory words, pronounceable or nonpronounceable letter strings, and visual noise. Interference attributable to word category was found for all groups except the early first grade. Interference from letters was found for all groups except a subgroup of 5 early first-grade children who also made errors on a picture-word matching task. Only adults and third-grade good readers were reliably affected by whether the nonword letter strings were pronounceable. It was concluded that even children who are poor readers and normal children with only 9 months of formal reading instruction extract meaning from familiar printed words automatically. The results are also discussed in terms of the relation between controlled and automatic processing of letters and words and the role of automatic decoding in the reading comprehension deficit of poor readers.",1978.0,12.0,120.0,"{'volume': '49', 'pages': '707-716', 'name': 'Child Development'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Guttentag1978AutomaticPA,\n author = {R.

In order to deal with these challenges, a fusion formulation which integrates low- and high-dimensional tracking approaches into one framework is proposed. The low-dimensional approach successfully overcomes the high-dimensional problem of tracking the motions with available training data by learning motion models, but it only works with specific motion types. On the other hand, although the high-dimensional approach may recover the motions without learned models by sampling directly in the pose space, it lacks robustness and efficiency. Within the framework, the two parallel approaches, low- and high-dimensional, are fused via a probabilistic approach at each time step. This probabilistic fusion approach ensures that the overall performance of the system is improved by concentrating on the respective advantages of the two approaches and resolving their weak points. The experimental results, after qualitative and quantitative comparisons, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in tracking generic human motion.",2013.0,28.0,187.0,"{'volume': '43', 'pages': '996-1002', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Xu2013TrackingGH,\n author = {Yuandong Xu and J.

Participants were asked to listen to and memorize a number of strings of 10 syllables instantiating an inversion (i.e. a global pattern); after the training phase, they were required to judge whether new strings were well formed. In Experiment 1, Western people implicitly acquired the inversion rule defined over the Chinese tones in a similar way as Chinese participants when alternative structures (specifically, chunking and repetition structures) were controlled. In Experiments 2 and 3, we directly pitted knowledge of the inversion (global) against chunk (local) knowledge, and found that Chinese participants had a striking global advantage in implicit learning, which was greater than that of Western participants.

In this article, we propose a new data-driven crowd modeling approach that can generate universal behavior rules with better interpretability. Higher interpretability helps people better understand and analyze the rules. Furthermore, the proposed approach considers both static and dynamic features during modeling to generate a realistic crowd, based on the assumption that humans tend to consider different features with respect to their states. In the proposed method, the automatic behavior rule generation problem is formulated as a symbolic regression problem. Then, the problem is solved by multi-objective genetic programming. On one hand, to improve the interpretability of the behavior rules found, a new mechanism is proposed to guide the algorithm to find concise and dimensionally consistent solutions. On the other hand, decisions made by considering static and dynamic features respectively are combined to improve the generated crowd realism. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, three real-world datasets are utilized for training and testing. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to find universal behavior rules that are competitive to previous work in accuracy while having better interpretability.",2020.0,45.0,8.0,"{'volume': '30', 'pages': '1 - 24', 'name': 'ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation (TOMACS)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Li2020DimensionallyAM,\n author = {D.

However, as another famous multiobjective optimization framework, decomposition-based multiobjective optimization has not received sufficient attention from constrained evolutionary optimization. In this paper, we make use of decomposition-based multiobjective optimization to solve constrained optimization problems (COPs). In our method, first of all, a COP is transformed into a biobjective optimization problem (BOP). Afterward, the transformed BOP is decomposed into a number of scalar optimization subproblems. After generating an offspring for each subproblem by differential evolution, the weighted sum method is utilized for selection. In addition, to make decomposition-based multiobjective optimization suit the characteristics of constrained evolutionary optimization, weight vectors are elaborately adjusted. Moreover, for some extremely complicated COPs, a restart strategy is introduced to help the population jump out of a local optimum in the infeasible region. Extensive experiments on three sets of benchmark test functions, namely, 24 test functions from IEEE CEC2006, 36 test functions from IEEE CEC2010, and 56 test functions from IEEE CEC2017, have demonstrated that the proposed method shows better or at least competitive performance against other state-of-the-art methods.",2018.0,63.0,69.0,"{'volume': '51', 'pages': '574-587', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wang2018DecompositionBasedMO,\n author = {Bing-chuan Wang and Han-Xiong Li and Qingfu Zhang and Yong Wang},\n journal = {IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems},\n pages = {574-587},\n title = {Decomposition-Based Multiobjective Optimization for Constrained Evolutionary Optimization},\n volume = {51},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '7425642', 'name': 'Bing-chuan Wang'}, {'authorId': '2145572068', 'name': 'Han-Xiong Li'}, {'authorId': '8326747', 'name': 'Qingfu Zhang'}, {'authorId': '49418176', 'name': 'Yong Wang'}]"

1185,587b7fb571d8088df449bcac8446a6304a2926a5,The Influences of Emotion on Learning and Memory,"Emotion has a substantial influence on the cognitive processes in humans, including perception, attention, learning, memory, reasoning, and problem solving. Emotion has a particularly strong influence on attention, especially modulating the selectivity of attention as well as motivating action and behavior. This attentional and executive control is intimately linked to learning processes, as intrinsically limited attentional capacities are better focused on relevant information. Emotion also facilitates encoding and helps retrieval of information efficiently. However, the effects of emotion on learning and memory are not always univalent, as studies have reported that emotion either enhances or impairs learning and long-term memory (LTM) retention, depending on a range of factors. Recent neuroimaging findings have indicated that the amygdala and prefrontal cortex cooperate with the medial temporal lobe in an integrated manner that affords (i) the amygdala modulating memory consolidation; (ii) the prefrontal cortex mediating memory encoding and formation; and (iii) the hippocampus for successful learning and LTM retention. We also review the nested hierarchies of circular emotional control and cognitive regulation (bottom-up and top-down influences) within the brain to achieve optimal integration of emotional and cognitive processing. This review highlights a basic evolutionary approach to emotion to understand the effects of emotion on learning and memory and the functional roles played by various brain regions and their mutual interactions in relation to emotional processing. We also summarize the current state of knowledge on the impact of emotion on memory and map implications for educational settings. In addition to elucidating the memory-enhancing effects of emotion, neuroimaging findings extend our understanding of emotional influences on learning and memory processes; this knowledge may be useful for the design of effective educational curricula to provide a conducive learning environment for both traditional “live” learning in classrooms and “virtual” learning through online-based educational technologies.",2017.0,185.0,657.0,"{'volume': '8', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tyng2017TheIO,\n author = {C.

This study compared the mycobacterial yields and the times to detection (in days) of mycobacteria in pediatric clinical specimens by using Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tubes (MGITs) and solid Löwenstein-Jensen (LJ) slants with and without a nutrient broth supplement. A total of 801 specimens from 493 patients were processed: 82.8% were gastric aspirate specimens, 15.6% were sputum specimens, and 1.6% were fine-needle-aspiration biopsy specimens. The mycobacterial yield obtained with MGITs (with and without nutrient broth) was 11.0%, and that obtained with LJ slants was 1.6% (P < 0.001). Of the 88 positive cultures, 62 were detected in MGITs and 73 were detected in MGITs supplemented with nutrient broth (P = 0.11). The mean time to detection in MGITs (without nutrient broth) was 18.5 days, whereas it was 12.4 days in MGITs with nutrient broth (P < 0.001). Supplementation of standard MGITs improved the mycobacterial yield and significantly reduced the time to detection of mycobacteria in pediatric samples.",2009.0,29.0,21.0,"{'volume': '47', 'pages': '1287 - 1289', 'name': 'Journal of Clinical Microbiology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Brittle2009ImprovementIM,\n author = {W.

This is consistent with the maximum of inverse TMR observed at Ϫ0.4 V for Co/STO/LSMO junctions (Fig. 3A). For a positive bias, the TMR is expected to change sign and become normal above 1 V when the Fermi level of LSMO goes down into the energy range of the majority spin d-band of Co. This is also observed in Fig. 3A. For ALO and ALO/STO barriers, a predominant tunneling of s-character electrons (see arrow in Fig. 2B) is the usual explanation of the positive polarization (6–8). The rapid drop with bias (Fig. 3B) is similar to what has been observed in most junctions with ALO barriers, and completely different from what is obtained when the tunneling is predominantly by d-character electrons (Fig. 3A). The origin of this rapid decrease of the TMR at relatively small bias has never been clearly explained. This is roughly consistent with the energy dependence of the DOS induced by sp-d bonding effects on the first atomic layer of ALO in the calculation of Nguyen-Mahn et al. (8) for the Co-ALO interface. But Zhang et al. (13) have also shown that a large part of the TMR drop can be attributed to the excitation of spin waves. The experiments reported here and in several recent publications (3, 4) demonstrate the important role of the electronic structure of the metal-oxide interface in determining the spin polarization of the tunneling electrons. The negative polarization for the Co-STO interface has been ascribed to d-d bonding effects between Al and Ti (4). This interpretation is similar to that proposed to explain, in terms of sp-d bonding , the positive polarization at the Co-ALO interface (8). However, there is no general theory predicting the trend of the experimental results for Co—that is, a negative polarization with oxides of d elements (STO, CLO, Ta 2 O 5) and a positive one when there are only s and p states (ALO). It is likely that the spin polarization should also depend on the position of the Fermi level with respect to the electronic levels of each character above and below the gap of the insulator. In addition, as an evanescent wave in an insulator is a Bloch wave with an imaginary wave vector, one …",,16.0,777.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Misc{None,\n author = {Jannene S. McBride and N. Evans and D.

1193,5963177df4e6c4c1f8590ced813f8f6489945750,Social cognition and the brain: A meta‐analysis,"This meta‐analysis explores the location and function of brain areas involved in social cognition, or the capacity to understand people's behavioral intentions, social beliefs, and personality traits. On the basis of over 200 fMRI studies, it tests alternative theoretical proposals that attempt to explain how several brain areas process information relevant for social cognition. The results suggest that inferring temporary states such as goals, intentions, and desires of other people—even when they are false and unjust from our own perspective—strongly engages the temporo‐parietal junction (TPJ). Inferring more enduring dispositions of others and the self, or interpersonal norms and scripts, engages the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), although temporal states can also activate the mPFC. Other candidate tasks reflecting general‐purpose brain processes that may potentially subserve social cognition are briefly reviewed, such as sequence learning, causality detection, emotion processing, and executive functioning (action monitoring, attention, dual task monitoring, episodic memory retrieval), but none of them overlaps uniquely with the regions activated during social cognition. Hence, it appears that social cognition particularly engages the TPJ and mPFC regions. The available evidence is consistent with the role of a TPJ‐related mirror system for inferring temporary goals and intentions at a relatively perceptual level of representation, and the mPFC as a module that integrates social information across time and allows reflection and representation of traits and norms, and presumably also of intentionality, at a more abstract cognitive level.

We precompute a data-driven mapping between gaits and their perceived emotions. EVA uses this gait emotion association at runtime to generate appropriate walking styles in terms of gaits and gaze. Using the EVA algorithm, we can simulate gaits and gazing behaviors of hundreds of virtual agents in real-time with known emotional characteristics.

The variability of SCR shapes hereby complicates the proper decomposition of SC data. A method is proposed for full decomposition of SC data into tonic and phasic components. A two-compartment diffusion model was found to adequately describe a standard SCR shape based on the process of sweat diffusion. Nonnegative deconvolution is used to decompose SC data into discrete compact responses and at the same time assess deviations from the standard SCR shape, which could be ascribed to the additional process of pore opening. Based on the result of single non-overlapped SCRs, response parameters can be estimated precisely as shown in a paradigm with varying inter-stimulus intervals.",2010.0,43.0,497.0,"{'volume': '47', 'pages': '647 - 658', 'name': 'Psychophysiology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Benedek2010DecompositionOS,\n author = {M.

General state anxiety and task involvement did not substantially relate to performance. The results are discussed in terms of the nature of this particular task and the predictions of various stress/performance theories.

One of challenging issues in behavior modeling is how virtual agents make decisions given some time-critical and uncertain situations. In this paper, we present HumDPM, a decision process model for virtual agents, which incorporates two important factors of human decision making in time-critical situations: experience and emotion. In HumDPM, rather than relying on deliberate rational analysis, an agent makes its decisions by matching past experience cases to the current situation. We propose the detailed representation of experience case and investigate the mechanisms of situation assessment, experience matching and experience execution. To incorporate emotion into HumDPM, we introduce an emotion appraisal process in situation assessment for emotion elicitation. In HumDPM, the decision making process of an agent may be affected by its emotional states when: 1) deciding whether it is necessary to do a re-match of experience cases, 2) determining the situational context, and 3) selecting experience cases. We illustrate the effectiveness of HumDPM in crowd simulation. A case study for emergency evacuation in a subway station scenario is conducted, which shows how a varied crowd composition leads to different evacuation behaviors, due to the retrieval of different experiences and the variation of agents' emotional states.",2010.0,14.0,17.0,"{'pages': '360-367', 'name': '2010 International Conference on Cyberworlds'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Luo2010ModelingHD,\n author = {Linbo Luo and Suiping Zhou and Wentong Cai and M.

1211,5ad65c6474c135a6c15e7127d8bb91de8c8a55a1,Designing Empathetic Animated Agents for a B-Learning Training Environment within the Electrical Domain,"Introduction Performing electrical tests involves dangerous activities. Therefore, efficient training is needed in order to minimize training time, costs, and equipment damage, and most importantly, to prevent accidents that could injure electricians. However, training on electrical tests faces some problematic situations, such as limited opportunity to practice in an actual substation, since substations are operating on a regular basis. We have developed a Virtual Reality System (VRS) to support traditional training. Trainees still attend classroom courses but they complement their learning and practice aided by the VRS. The system is used at the Mexican electricity utility by a number of electricians. However, the VRS is not adaptive to trainees' knowledge and emotional states. Training still depends on a courses schedule, which most of the times, means waiting for a training course for a long time. Based on this VRS that supports traditional training, we composed a blended learning model. Blended learning is a new strand in education, although the concept itself has already existed for a long time. It can take many forms and there are several definitions that include the same elements roughly. In a formal education context, blended learning is a formal educational program in which a student learns, at least in part through online delivery of content and instruction with some elements of student control over time, place, path, or pace, and at least in part at a supervised brick-and-mortar location away from home (Staker & Horn, 2012). A more general and perhaps more accepted definition states that blended learning is learning that is facilitated by the effective combination of different delivery modes, teaching models and learning styles, and founded on transparent communication amongst all parties involved in a course (Heinze & Procter, 2004). In addition to blended learning, the characteristics of electrical tests demand faster and more efficient training, where instruction is adaptive and responds to needs of the trainees. For that reason, we have defined a roadmap to achieve efficient and tailored training. The roadmap starts with traditional training and ends with intelligent and adaptive training. In order to have more adaptive training, we have built a trainee model. This model represents the affective and knowledge states of trainees and allows the training system to adapt the instruction to a particular trainee. Our proposal for the affective state is based on facial expressions and contextual information. We propose to present the instruction by an animated agent representing the instructor. We are designing an empathetic agent to try to engage the trainee, promote a positive emotional state and improve learning. A key highlight of the agent's design is that it is presented as an electrician so that trainees can feel identified with him. With all these elements, we are developing a model and a platform for blended training, which adapts itself to needs of the trainee in an intelligent way based on the roadmap for training. In this paper we present the outcomes of a study that we conducted on animated agents in order to refine our empathetic agent before full integration to the VRS. Experts in electrical tests who know the VRS participated in the study. We gathered useful information to improve the design of the agent, which includes ingredients such as appearance, behavior, and facial expressions. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the next section presents some related work. Then, we present the roadmap for training, describing the virtual reality system and the elements of the blended training model, particularly, the affective student model and the empathetic agent. After that, we present the evaluation of the empathetic agent. Then, results are analysed. Finally, we present some conclusions, as well as a description of future work. …",2016.0,46.0,15.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '116-131', 'name': 'J. Educ. Technol.

Or is it forever beyond human reach? In science we never know the ultimate outcome of the journey. We can only take whatever steps our current knowledge affords. This paper explores today's evidence from the viewpoint of Global Workspace (GW) theory. 1 First, we ask what kind of evidence has the most direct bearing on the question. The answer given here is 'contrastive analysis' — a set of paired comparisons between similar conscious and unconscious processes. This body of evidence is already quite large, and constrains any possible theory (Baars, 1983; 1988; 1997). Because it involves both conscious and unconscious events, it deals directly with our own subjective experience, as anyone can tell by trying the demonstrations in this article. One dramatic contrast is between the vast number of unconscious neural processes happen- ing in any given moment, compared to the very narrow bottleneck of conscious capacity. The narrow limits of consciousness have a compensating advantage: consciousness seems to act as a gateway, creating access to essentially any part of the nervous system. Even single neurons can be controlled by way of conscious feedback. Conscious experience creates access to the mental lexicon, to autobiographical memory, and to voluntary control over automatic action routines. Daniel C. Dennett has suggested that consciousness may itself be viewed as that to which 'we' have access. (Dennett, 1978) All these facts may be summed up by saying that consciousness creates global access.",1997.0,25.0,360.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Baars1997INTT,\n author = {B.

We investigate children's (age 1 - 5) transitions to and from screen-based activities to understand the boundaries families have set and their experiences living within them. We report on interviews with 27 parents and a diary study with a separate 28 families examining these transitions. These families turn on screens primarily to facilitate parents' independent activities. Parents feel this is appropriate but self-audit and express hesitation, as they feel they are benefiting from an activity that can be detrimental to their child's well-being. We found that families turn off screens when parents are ready to give their child their full attention and technology presents a natural stopping point. Transitioning away from screens is often painful, and predictive factors determine the pain of a transition. Technology-mediated transitions are significantly more successful than parent-mediated transitions, suggesting that the design community has the power to make this experience better for parents and children by creating technologies that facilitate boundary-setting and respect families' self-defined limits.",2016.0,57.0,99.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Hiniker2016ScreenTT,\n author = {Alexis Hiniker and Hye-Ji Suh and Sabina Cao and J.

Traditional approaches to emotion extraction have mainly focused on mining the polarities of opinions or using annotated data to extract emotion types. Emotion theories, which identify the underlying cognitive structure and emotional dimensions that are key to generate emotions, have almost been totally ignored in previous work. To facilitate the automatic extraction of emotions from textual data, in this paper, we propose an emotion model based approach to emotion extraction from online reviews. Informed by the widely used OCC emotion model, we employ a statistical method to extract emotion words with their dimension values from texts, and implement OCC model to obtain emotions based on the emotion-dimension dictionary.

Further, the models are rarely investigated in natural settings, limiting their ecological validity. The current study used experience sampling via text message to examine college students’ daily coviewing behaviors. Momentary assessments were taken 3 times a day for 1 week. Respondents reported their happiness during viewing and the enjoyableness of their experiences. Consistent with emotional contagion theory, data suggest that increases in emotional intensity mediated the effect of emotional contagion on program enjoyment, but only among respondents who reported coviewing with someone else. These results provide preliminary evidence that social context is partially responsible for contagious transfer of affect during entertainment experiences.",2016.0,54.0,16.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '149 - 172', 'name': 'Mass Communication and Society'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cohen2016RUW,\n author = {Elizabeth L.

One type of communication is the argumentative dialogue where both agents aim to convert each others’ point of view. Argumentative reinforcement learning (RL) agents can learn from experience via trial and error. For an agent learning to argue with other agents, it would be useful to discover some useful argument patterns i.e. state and action pairs, which will enable a RL agent to transfer what has been learned from one domain to another. A dialogue model is needed to manage the evolving dialogue between agents. In this paper we adopt the DE dialogue game and construct an RL agent that can win a debate with the minimum number of moves. The result is promising so far and this enables us to move forward to transfer learning in order to generalise our approach. It is anticipated that our research will contribute to the design and implementation of argumentative learning agents.",2019.0,19.0,3.0,{'pages': '29-37'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Alahmari2019ReinforcementLF,\n author = {Sultan Alahmari and Tommy Yuan and D.

In the present study, we investigated the relationship between mimicry and cognitive and emotional empathy. To assess mimicry, facial electromyography was recorded for 70 participants while they completed the Multifaceted Empathy Test, which presents complex context-embedded emotional expressions. As predicted, inter-individual differences in emotional and cognitive empathy were associated with the level of facial mimicry. For positive emotions, the intensity of the mimicry response scaled with the level of state emotional empathy. Mimicry was stronger for the emotional empathy task compared to the cognitive empathy task. The specific empathy condition could be successfully detected from facial muscle activity at the level of single individuals using machine learning techniques. These results support the view that mimicry occurs depending on the social context as a tool to affiliate and it is involved in cognitive as well as emotional empathy.",2019.0,65.0,53.0,"{'volume': '33', 'pages': '1672 - 1686', 'name': 'Cognition and Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Drimalla2019FromFT,\n author = {Hanna Drimalla and Niels Landwehr and U.

If robotic companions could acquire their human counterparts' sense of humor in an unobtrusive manner, they could improve their skills of engagement. In order to explore this assumption, we have developed a dynamic user modeling approach based on Reinforcement Learning, which allows a robot to analyze a person's reaction while it tells jokes and continuously adapts its sense of humor. We evaluated our approach in a test scenario with a Reeti robot acting as an entertainer and telling different types of jokes. The exemplary adaptation process is accomplished only by using the audience's vocal laughs and visual smiles, but no other form of explicit feedback. We report on results of a user study with 24 participants, comparing our approach to a baseline condition (with a non-learning version of the robot) and conclude by providing limitations and implications of our approach in detail.",2018.0,28.0,61.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 20th ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Weber2018HowTS,\n author = {Klaus Weber and Hannes Ritschel and Ilhan Aslan and Florian Lingenfelser and E.

1235,5d41ca9cca1adddd8cb414e57caa2b0725489272,Behavioral Corporate Finance,"Managers and corporate directors need to recognize two key behavioral impediments that obstruct the process of value maximization, one internal to the firm and the other external. I call the first obstruction behavioral costs. Behavioral costs, like agency costs, tend to prevent value creation. Behavioral costs are the costs associated with errors that people make because of cognitive imperfections and emotional influences. The second obstruction stems from behavioral errors on the part of analysts and investors. These errors can create gaps between fundamental values and market prices. When they do, managers may find themselves conflicted, unsure of how to factor the errors of analysts and investors into their own decisions. Proponents of value based management emphasize that with properly designed incentives, managers will maximize the value of the firms for which they work. As such, either they treat behavioral costs as simply another form of agency costs, or they deny the relevance of cognitive errors. In contrast, proponents of behavioral finance argue that behavioral costs are typically large, and cannot be addressed though incentives alone. This is not to say that incentives are immaterial. On the contrary, incentives are of critical importance. The point, however, is that there are limits to incentives. If employees have a distorted view of what is in their own self-interest, or if they have a mistaken view of what actions they need to take in order to maximize their self-interest, then incentive compatibility, although necessary for value maximization, will not be sufficient.",2017.0,13.0,189.0,{'name': 'Corporate Finance: Valuation'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Shefrin2017BehavioralCF,\n author = {H.

We investigated whether corresponding facial reactions can be elicited when people are unconsciously exposed to happy and angry facial expressions. Through use of the backward-masking technique, the subjects were prevented from consciously perceiving 30-ms exposures of happy, neutral, and angry target faces, which immediately were followed and masked by neutral faces. Despite the fact that exposure to happy and angry faces was unconscious, the subjects reacted with distinct facial muscle reactions that corresponded to the happy and angry stimulus faces.

The efficacy of the mean field theory approach is demonstrated on parameter estimation for one-dimensional mixture data and two-dimensional unsupervised stochastic model-based image segmentation. Experimental results indicate that in the 1-D case, the mean field theory approach provides results comparable to those obtained by Baum's (1987) algorithm, which is known to be optimal.

However, current findings are lacking as to whether the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and cortical regions are involved in the learning effect when subjects retrieve associative memory, and whether their activations differentially change over time due to learning experience. To address these issues, we designed an fMRI experiment in which face-scene pairs were learned once (L1) or six times (L6). Subjects learned the pairs at four retention intervals, 30-min, 1-day, 1-week and 1-month, after which they finished an associative recognition task in the scanner. The results showed that compared to learning once, learning six times led to stronger activation in the hippocampus, but weaker activation in the perirhinal cortex (PRC) as well as anterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vLPFC).

The main idea is to to construct a single function approximator V (s; θ) that estimates the long-term reward from any state s, using parameters θ. In this paper we introduce universal value function approximators (UVFAs) V (s, g; θ) that generalise not just over states s but also over goals g. We develop an efficient technique for supervised learning of UVFAs, by factoring observed values into separate embedding vectors for state and goal, and then learning a mapping from s and g to these factored embedding vectors. We show how this technique may be incorporated into a reinforcement learning algorithm that updates the UVFA solely from observed rewards. Finally, we demonstrate that a UVFA can successfully generalise to previously unseen goals.",2015.0,26.0,880.0,{'pages': '1312-1320'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Schaul2015UniversalVF,\n author = {T.

1250,5e4bca08443acdd9343e5edf448fd0d9e959588c,Human agency beliefs influence behaviour during virtual social interactions,"In recent years, with the emergence of relatively inexpensive and accessible virtual reality technologies, it is now possible to deliver compelling and realistic simulations of human-to-human interaction. Neuroimaging studies have shown that, when participants believe they are interacting via a virtual interface with another human agent, they show different patterns of brain activity compared to when they know that their virtual partner is computer-controlled. The suggestion is that users adopt an “intentional stance” by attributing mental states to their virtual partner. However, it remains unclear how beliefs in the agency of a virtual partner influence participants’ behaviour and subjective experience of the interaction. We investigated this issue in the context of a cooperative “joint attention” game in which participants interacted via an eye tracker with a virtual onscreen partner, directing each other’s eye gaze to different screen locations. Half of the participants were correctly informed that their partner was controlled by a computer algorithm (“Computer” condition). The other half were misled into believing that the virtual character was controlled by a second participant in another room (“Human” condition). Those in the “Human” condition were slower to make eye contact with their partner and more likely to try and guide their partner before they had established mutual eye contact than participants in the “Computer” condition. They also responded more rapidly when their partner was guiding them, although the same effect was also found for a control condition in which they responded to an arrow cue. Results confirm the influence of human agency beliefs on behaviour in this virtual social interaction context. They further suggest that researchers and developers attempting to simulate social interactions should consider the impact of agency beliefs on user experience in other social contexts, and their effect on the achievement of the application’s goals.",2017.0,24.0,24.0,"{'volume': '5', 'name': 'PeerJ'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Caruana2017HumanAB,\n author = {N.

But what happens when one of the interlocutors is a machine? The facilitation of human-machine communication and cooperation is of growing importance as smartphones, autonomous cars, or social robots increasingly pervade human social spaces. Previous research has shown that emotionally expressive virtual characters generally elicit higher cooperation and trust than 'neutral' ones. Since emotional expressions are multi-modal, and given that virtual characters can be designed to our liking in all their components, would a mismatch in the emotion expressed in the face and voice influence people's cooperation with a virtual character? We developed a game where people had to cooperate with a virtual character in order to survive on the moon. The character's face and voice were designed to either smile or not, resulting in 4 conditions: smiling voice and face, neutral voice and face, smiling voice only (neutral face), smiling face only (neutral voice). The experiment was set up in a museum over the course of several weeks; we report preliminary results from over 500 visitors, showing that people tend to trust the virtual character in the mismatched condition with the smiling face and neutral voice more.

In novel environments, zebrafish swim to tank bottoms and dark backgrounds, behaviors attributed to anxiety associated with threat of predation. To examine possible genetic effects of inbreeding and segregation on this behavior, we compared Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC) AB and WIK lines to zebrafish and GloFish® from a pet store (PETCO) in two qualitatively different novel environments: the dive tank and aquatic light/dark plus maze. Behavior was observed in the dive tank for 5 min, immediately followed by 5 min in the light/dark plus maze. Among strains, WIK spent more time in the dive tank top than AB (76 ± 30 vs. 17 ± 11 sec), and AB froze in the plus maze center for longer than PETCO or GloFish® (162 ± 61 vs. 72 ± 29 or 27 ± 27 sec). Further, behavior of zebrafish exposed for 3 min to 25 mg/L nicotine, desipramine, chlordiazepoxide, yohimbine, 100 mg/L citalopram, 0.05% DMSO, or 0.5% ethanol was compared to controls. Approximately 0.1% of drug is available in brain after such exposures. Desipramine or citalopram-exposed fish spent more time in the dive tank top, and both reuptake inhibitors bound to serotonin transporters in zebrafish brain with high affinity (K(i) = 7 ± 5 and 9 ± 5 nM). In the plus maze, chlordiazepoxide, ethanol and DMSO-exposed fish crossed more lines and spent more time in white arms. Neither 25 mg/L nicotine nor yohimbine altered zebrafish behavior in novel environments, but nicotine was anxiolytic at higher doses. Overall, the light/dark plus maze and dive tank are distinct behavioral measures that are sensitive to treatment with anxiolytic compounds, but zebrafish line selection and solvents can influence baseline behavior in these tests.",2010.0,30.0,235.0,"{'volume': '23 1', 'pages': '\n          43-61\n        ', 'name': 'International journal of comparative psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sackerman2010ZebrafishBI,\n author = {James Sackerman and J.

Design Qualitative semistructured interviews with 36 participants. Participants Depressed patients with a Patient Health Questionnaire 9 of 10 or above recruited into the REEACT randomised controlled trial. Setting Primary care settings in England. Results Participant experience was on a continuum, with some patients unable or unwilling to accept psychological therapy without interpersonal contact while others appreciated the enhanced anonymity and flexibility of cCBT. The majority of patients were ambivalent, recognising the potential benefits offered by cCBT but struggling with challenges posed by the severity of their illness, lack of support and limited personalisation of programme content. Low completion rates were commonly reported, although more positive patients reported greater engagement. Both positive and ambivalent patients perceived a need for monitoring or follow-up to support completion, while negative patients reported deliberate non-adherence due to dissatisfaction with the programme. Patients also reported that severity of depression impacted on engagement, and viewed cCBT as unsuitable for patients undergoing more severe depressive episodes. Conclusions The study demonstrates both the unique demands and benefits of computerised therapy. cCBT was preferred by some patients and rejected by others, but the majority of patients were ambivalent about the therapy. cCBT could be offered within a menu of options in stepped care if matched appropriately to individual patients or could be offered with enhanced support to appeal to a greater number of patients.

This study explores how parents perceive the role of new media in their families, how and why they regulate children’s media use, and how they feel about this process. The study conducts ethnographic interviews with 20 South Korean parents of two- to six-year-olds and observes 10 children in their media use and interaction with parents. We find that parents presumed that touchscreen media wielded a more negative than positive influence on their children. As a result, parents engaged in restrictive and technical mediation, though they often failed to effectively manage their children’s media use due to practical challenges. The failure of parental mediation made the parents feel guilty. We suggest a greater need to attend to the contexts and emotions in which parental mediation of children’s media use occurs.",2017.0,62.0,17.0,"{'volume': '11', 'pages': '20', 'name': 'International Journal of Communication'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Seo2017EmotionMW,\n author = {Hogeun Seo and C.

1266,5fbdbe6d870b7927a10c5bde74baf868b5cfacbf,Affective Haptics: Current Research and Future Directions,"Touch plays a prominent role in communicating emotions and intensifying interpersonal communication. Affective haptics is an emerging field, which focuses on the analysis, design, and evaluation of systems that can capture, process, or display emotions through the sense of touch. The objective of this paper is to present an overview of the recent achievements in affective haptics and to discuss how the sense of touch can elicit or influence human emotions. We first introduce a definition to the term affective haptics and describe its multidisciplinary nature-as a field that integrates ideas from affective computing, haptic technology, and user experience. Second, we provide a thorough discussion about the effectiveness of using the haptic channel to communicate affective information through direct and mediated means. Third, we present a variety of applications in the area ranging from interhuman social interaction systems to human robot interaction applications. Finally, we discuss some of the key findings discerned from the various surveyed papers, and present some of the challenges and trends in this field. We extract the following conclusions pertaining to affective haptics: 1) haptic stimulation can be successfully used to achieve a higher level of emotional immersion during media consumption or emotional telepresence; 2) existing research has demonstrated that haptics is effective in communicating valence and arousal, and the emotions of happiness, sadness, anger and fear, and less focus have been given to the communication of disgust and surprise; 3) the haptic-based affect detection remains an understudied topic, whereas the haptic-based affect display is a well-established subject; and 4) the interpretation of the haptic stimulation by human beings is highly contextual.",2016.0,103.0,101.0,"{'volume': '4', 'pages': '26-40', 'name': 'IEEE Access'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Eid2016AffectiveHC,\n author = {M.

1268,5fd3ce235f5fcebd3d2807f710b060add527183b,Deep Curiosity Search: Intra-Life Exploration Improves Performance on Challenging Deep Reinforcement Learning Problems,"Traditional exploration methods in RL require agents to perform random actions to find rewards. But these approaches struggle on sparse-reward domains like Montezuma's Revenge where the probability that any random action sequence leads to reward is extremely low. Recent algorithms have performed well on such tasks by encouraging agents to visit new states or perform new actions in relation to all prior training episodes (which we call across-training novelty). But such algorithms do not consider whether an agent exhibits intra-life novelty: doing something new within the current episode, regardless of whether those behaviors have been performed in previous episodes. We hypothesize that across-training novelty might discourage agents from revisiting initially non-rewarding states that could become important stepping stones later in training. We introduce Deep Curiosity Search (DeepCS), which encourages intra-life exploration by rewarding agents for visiting as many different states as possible within each episode, and show that DeepCS matches the performance of current state-of-the-art methods on Montezuma's Revenge. We further show that DeepCS improves exploration on Amidar, Freeway, Gravitar, and Tutankham (many of which are hard exploration games). Surprisingly, DeepCS doubles A2C performance on Seaquest, a game we would not have expected to benefit from intra-life exploration because the arena is small and already easily navigated by naive exploration techniques. In one run, DeepCS achieves a maximum training score of 80,000 points on Seaquest, higher than any methods other than Ape-X. The strong performance of DeepCS on these sparse- and dense-reward tasks suggests that encouraging intra-life novelty is an interesting, new approach for improving performance in Deep RL and motivates further research into hybridizing across-training and intra-life exploration methods.",2018.0,38.0,38.0,"{'volume': 'abs/1806.00553', 'name': 'ArXiv'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Stanton2018DeepCS,\n author = {C.

Overall, the cohesiveness-performance effect was highly significant and of small magnitude. Several theoretically informative determinants of the cohesiveness-performance effect were examined. This effect was significantly stronger when cohesiveness was operationalized in terms of measurements of group members' perceptions of cohesiveness than when cohesiveness was operationalized in terms of experimental inductions of cohesiveness. The results of this analysis suggest that the more direct effect may be from performance to cohesiveness rather than from cohesiveness to performance.

The aim of the present study is to empirically examine the core assumptions about the fear of being laughed at in a sample comprising a total of 863 clinical and non-clinical participants. Discriminant function analysis yielded that gelotophobes can be separated from other shame-based neurotics, non-shame-based neurotics, and controls. Separation was best for statements specifically describing the gelotophobic symptomatology and less potent for more general questions describing socially avoidant behaviors. Factor analysis demonstrates that while Gelotophobia is composed of a set of correlated elements in homogenous samples, overall the concept is best conceptualized as unidimensional. Predicted and actual group membership converged well in a cross-classification (approximately 69% of correctly classified cases). Overall, it can be concluded that the fear of being laughed at varies tremendously among adults and might hold a key to understanding certain forms of humorlessness.",2008.0,15.0,166.0,"{'volume': '21', 'pages': '47 - 67'}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Ruch2008TheFO,\n author = {W.

Negotiation is a multifaceted process in which affect plays a critical role, a role confirmed in recent empirical studies. In this position paper we first argue that affect is an important issue to consider when developing a negotiation support system. We do so by giving a strategic overview of some of the most important findings in the affect-cognition and affect-negotiation literature. Second, we show in a structured manner during which phases in the negotiation process what emotion-related concepts play a major role, as well as discuss more concrete affect-related support functions an affective negotiation support system could offer. Third, we analyze the feasibility of these functions by reviewing currently available affective computing technologies, such as affect measurement, emotion modeling, emotion expression, emotional reasoning, and emotional agents.",2010.0,160.0,47.0,"{'volume': '2', 'pages': '121-144', 'name': 'J.

The original formulation's main proposition is limited to interference with an expected attainment of a desired goal on hostile (emotional) aggression. Although some studies have yielded negative results, others support the core proposition. Frustrations can create aggressive inclinations even when they are not arbitrary or aimed at the subject personally. Interpretations and attributions can be understood partly in terms of the original analysis but they can also influence the unpleasantness of the thwarting. A proposed revision of the 1939 model holds that frustrations generate aggressive inclinations to the degree that they arouse negative affect.

Scientists have long sought to model the collective motion of large groups of individuals and study the mathematical basis of what seems to be apparently random behavior. A large number of macroscopic models have been proposed that describe crowd motion as a whole, much like the partial differential equations of fluid mechanics. This paper proposes a Lagrangian approach to the modeling of crowd dynamics by taking into consideration the various forces that act between the members of a crowd while they are in motion in a 2-D field. We attempt a realistic modeling of the attractive and repulsive forces between the members and seek to give a definite mathematical backbone to the terms “panic” and “evacuation.” That the dynamics is stable is demonstrated by constructing an appropriate Lyapunov energy function. We then linearize the dynamics to obtain mathematical expressions for the small perturbations about an equilibrium point. Through machine simulations and by tracking the motion of actual crowd systems, we show the validity of the mathematics of group formation and evacuation that we have proposed.",2015.0,53.0,25.0,"{'volume': '45', 'pages': '865-876', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mukherjee2015ALA,\n author = {Sudipto Mukherjee and Debdipta Goswami and Sarthak Chatterjee},\n journal = {IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems},\n pages = {865-876},\n title = {A Lagrangian Approach to Modeling and Analysis of a Crowd Dynamics},\n volume = {45},\n year = {2015}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '1500559043', 'name': 'Sudipto Mukherjee'}, {'authorId': '2755504', 'name': 'Debdipta Goswami'}, {'authorId': '153609700', 'name': 'Sarthak Chatterjee'}]"

In Experiment 1, 65 participants rated faces for threat, arousal and valence (pleasantness). The faces varied in eyebrow shape (V-shaped, flat), mouth type (closed, open), eye type (wide, normal) and mouth curvature (down-turned, up-turned). In replication of previous research (Lundqvist, Esteves, & Öhman, 1999, 2004), the V-shaped eyebrow was the most important determinant of facial threat. Faces with a V-shaped eyebrow were rated as more aroused and threatening, and less pleasant than faces with a flat eyebrow. Similar, albeit weaker, effects were recorded for mouth and eye type, leading to a new hierarchical ordering of facial features for determining facial threat (eyebrow type > mouth type > eye type > mouth curvature). In Experiment 2 (n=37) the effects and ordering recorded in Experiment 1 were replicated for ratings of face of a woman and, moreover , individual features (except an up-turned mouth) increased ratings of threat compared to an expressionless control condition.",2007.0,33.0,20.0,"{'volume': '21', 'pages': '535 - 557', 'name': 'Cognition and Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tipples2007WideEA,\n author = {J.

Results revealed a coherent manifestation in the experiential, expressive, and physiological components of the emotional response system, which supports the emotivist position. Happy music generated more zygomatic facial muscle activity, greater skin conductance, lower finger temperature, more happiness and less sadness than sad music.

Traditionally, interactions between humans and machines like computers do not exhibit any emotional exchanges. If we could build any system that is intelligent enough to interact with humans that involves emotions, that is, it can detect user emotions and change its behaviour accordingly, then using machines could be more effective and friendly. Many approaches have been taken to detect user emotions. Affective computing is the field that detects user emotion in a particular moment. Our approach in this paper is to detect user emotions by analysing the keyboard typing patterns of the user and the type of texts (words, sentences) typed by them. This combined analysis gives us a promising result showing a substantial number of emotional states detected from user input. Several machine learning algorithms were used to analyse keystroke timing attributes and text pattern. We have chosen keystroke because it is the cheapest and most available medium to interact with computers. We have considered seven emotional classes for classifying the emotional states. For text pattern analysis, we have used vector space model with Jaccard similarity method to classify free-text input.

An important issue regards whether, when participants are unaware of the CS-US contingency, the affective valence can generalize to new stimuli that share similarities with the CS. Previous studies have shown that generalization of EC effects appears only when participants are aware of the contingencies, but we suggest that this is because (a) the contingencies typically used in these studies are salient and easy to detect consciously, and (b) the performance-based measures of awareness (so-called ""objective measures""), typically used in these studies, tend to overestimate the amount of available conscious knowledge. We report a preregistered study in which participants (N = 217) were exposed to letter strings generated from two complex artificial grammars that are difficult to decipher consciously. Stimuli from one grammar were paired with positive USs, whereas those from the other grammar were paired with negative USs. Subsequently, participants evaluated new, previously unseen, stimuli from the positively conditioned grammar more positively than new stimuli from the negatively conditioned grammar. Importantly, this effect appeared even when trial-by-trial subjective measures indicated lack of relevant conscious knowledge. We provide evidence for the generalization of EC effects even without subjective awareness of the structures that enable those generalizations.

The second topic of this work describes how the CA can be integrated into an iterative learning cycle where the individual pedestrian can adapt travel plans based on experiences from previous iterations. Depending on the setup, the overall travel behavior moves either toward a Nash equilibrium or the system optimum. The functional interaction of the CA with the iterative learning approach is demonstrated on a set of transport paradoxes. Furthermore, time series of speed and density observed in a small‐scale experiment show a general agreement between the CA simulation and laboratory experiments.

We hypothesized that angry and happy responses to a group member's deviating opinion are interpreted as signals of imminent rejection versus acceptance. In 5 studies, the majority's expressions of anger led the deviant individual to feel rejected, whereas expressions of happiness made the deviant feel accepted. Because conformity can be seen as strategic behavior aimed at gaining (re)acceptance, the effects of emotional expressions on conformity should be moderated by social-contextual factors that determine the motivation to be accepted by the group and by the extent to which conformity is a means to this end. Accordingly, in Study 2, the availability of alternative groups determined whether a deviant conformed to the current group or abandoned the group after an angry reaction. In Study 3, anger and happiness were only associated with conformity pressure in situations that were perceived as cooperative (rather than competitive). Employing an interactive group task in Study 4, we showed that individuals who received an angry reaction contributed less in a cooperative group task than did those who received a neutral or happy reaction. Finally, in Study 5, peripheral group members conformed more after an angry reaction than after a happy reaction, but prototypical group members did not. Moreover, conformity was still manifest 3 weeks after the experiment, and this effect was mediated by feelings of rejection. We discuss implications of these findings for theorizing about social functions of emotions and the role of emotions in groups.",2013.0,133.0,88.0,"{'volume': '105 2', 'pages': '\n          262-84\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Heerdink2013OnTS,\n author = {Marc W.

Thus, it could easily be extended to other languages, though the first version of HTS was implemented for Japanese. The resulting run-time engine of HTS has the advantage of being small: less than 1 Mbyte, excluding text analysis part.

Is it possible to design social robots to support the early development of children’s interpersonal conflict resolution skills? To investigate this question, 64 (32 pairs of) children ages 3-6 years engaged in a 50-minute play session consisting of 5 activities facilitated by the robot Keepon. Children were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 conditions. In the mediation condition, Keepon directed the play session flow by indicating when and which activity to switch to, and whenever possible, signaled the onset of object possession conflicts that occurred between the pair and offered prompts for constructive conflict resolution. In the control condition, Keepon only facilitated and directed the play session and did not intervene during children’s conflicts. Results show that children were more likely to resolve conflicts constructively in the mediation condition than in the control condition, and that a key function for a robot mediator within the conflict process is to successfully flag the conflict onset. Drawing from these findings, we discuss design recommendation for a robot mediator.",2018.0,35.0,69.0,"{'pages': '69-77', 'name': '2018 13th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Shen2018StopIS,\n author = {Solace Shen and P.

We asked participants to train an erroneous virtual agent on a cognitive task and to reward or punish it. The agent showed human-like emotional facial reactions for the experimental but not for the control group. We expected participants from the experimental group to give less harmful reinforcement and show more hesitation before punishing. Additionally, we hypothesised that participants with higher empathy show more compassion towards the agent and therefore would give more positive reinforcement and feel worse when punishing. The results indicate that the agent’s expression of emotionality is not the relevant factor for showing compassion towards it.

In this study we sought to examine how the ability to perceive own emotions assessed with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale related to both the ability to perceive emotions depicted in point-light displays and the confidence in these perceptions. Participants observed video scenes of human interactions, rated the depicted valence, and judged their confidence in this rating. Results showed that people with higher alexithymia scores were significantly less confident about their decisions, but did not differ from people with lower alexithymia scores in the valence of their ratings. Furthermore, no modulating effect of social context on the effect of higher alexithymia scores was found. It is concluded that the used stimuli are fit to investigate the kinematic aspect of emotion perception and possibly separate people with high and low alexithymia scores via confidence differences.

The present study used resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to parcellate the human insular lobe based on clustering of functional connectivity patterns. Connectivity maps were computed for each voxel in the insula based on resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data and segregated using cluster analysis. We identified 3 insular subregions with distinct patterns of connectivity: a posterior region, functionally connected with primary and secondary somatomotor cortices; a dorsal anterior to middle region, connected with dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, along with other regions of a previously described control network; and a ventral anterior region, primarily connected with pregenual anterior cingulate cortex. Applying these regions to a separate task data set, we found that dorsal and ventral anterior insula responded selectively to disgusting images, while posterior insula did not. These results demonstrate that clustering of connectivity patterns can be used to subdivide cerebral cortex into anatomically and functionally meaningful subregions; the insular regions identified here should be useful in future investigations on the function of the insula.",2010.0,84.0,602.0,"{'volume': '21', 'pages': '1498 - 1506', 'name': 'Cerebral Cortex (New York, NY)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Deen2010ThreeSO,\n author = {Ben Deen and Naomi B.

These types of hardware aim to facilitate new and novel experiences for users above and beyond what is possible with traditional audiovisual displays. However, a very limited number of studies exist in the literature to determine the influence of these technologies on user Quality of Experience (QoE). In order to evaluate QoE as users consume VR content, this paper proposes the use of affordable consumer electronics to capture objective physiological metrics: Heart Rate (HR) and ElectroDermal Activity (EDA). Our findings indicate different HR and EDA dependent on VR and non-VR environments. Additionally, we examine the relationship between these objective metrics and user QoE captured via a post-test questionnaire. To the best of the authors knowledge, this is the first work which demonstrates a tangible relationship between the EDA/HR combination and user QoE of immersive VR environments.",2016.0,26.0,136.0,"{'pages': '1-6', 'name': '2016 Eighth International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Egan2016AnEO,\n author = {Darragh Egan and Sean Brennan and John Barrett and Yuansong Qiao and C.

In terms of NHS spending, at least £1 in every £8 spent on long-term conditions is linked to poor mental health and well-being – between £8 billion and £13 billion in England each year. Long-term conditions and mental health: The cost of co-morbidities, published jointly by The King’s Fund and the Centre for Mental Health, suggests that care for a large number of people with long-term conditions could be improved by: integrating mental health support with primary care and chronic disease management programmes improving the provision of liaison psychiatry services in acute hospitals providing health professionals of all kinds with basic mental health knowledge and skills removing policy barriers to integration, for example, through redesign of payment mechanisms. This paper suggests that developing more integrated support for people with mental and physical health problems could improve outcomes and play an important part in helping the NHS meet the quality, innovation, productivity and prevention challenge. The authors conclude that the prevailing approach to supporting people with long-term conditions is at risk of failing unless we recognise the role of emotional and mental health problems in reducing people’s ability and motivation to manage their physical health.",2012.0,98.0,395.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Naylor2012LongtermCA,\n author = {C.

In this paper, we objectively evaluate the influence of various academic emotions on learning effects and studied the relationship between positive and negative academic emotions and learning effects by using five electronic databases, including WOS, EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar. According to established standards, a total of 14 articles from 506 articles were included in the analysis. We divided the 14 studies into nine intervention studies and five observational studies; five of the nine intervention studies found that students who used active learning materials performed better and had higher mental loads than those who used neutral learning materials. Positive academic emotions promoted the learning effect. Four of the five observational studies with high school, college, and postgraduate participants reported that regulating academic emotions can improve learning effects. In conclusion, this paper holds that positive academic emotions are better than negative academic emotions at improving academic performance.

Unlike formless conversational agents, like smart speakers or chatbots, VH bring together the capabilities of both a conversational agent and an interactive avatar (computer-represented digital characters). Although their use in patient-facing systems has garnered substantial interest, it is unknown to what extent VH are effective in health applications. Objective The purpose of this review was to examine the effectiveness of VH in patient-facing systems. The design and implementation characteristics of these systems were also examined. Methods Electronic bibliographic databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles with relevant key terms. Studies were included in the systematic review if they designed or evaluated VH in patient-facing systems. Of the included studies, studies that used a randomized controlled trial to evaluate VH were included in the meta-analysis; they were then summarized using the PICOTS framework (population, intervention, comparison group, outcomes, time frame, setting). Summary effect sizes, using random-effects models, were calculated, and the risk of bias was assessed. Results Among the 8,125 unique records identified, 53 articles describing 33 unique systems, were qualitatively, systematically reviewed. Two distinct design categories emerged — simple VH and VH augmented with health sensors and trackers. Of the 53 articles, 16 (26 studies) with 44 primary and 22 secondary outcomes were included in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of the 44 primary outcome measures revealed a significant difference between intervention and control conditions, favoring the VH intervention (SMD = .166, 95% CI .039-.292, P=.012), but with evidence of some heterogeneity, I2=49.3%. There were more cross-sectional (k=15) than longitudinal studies (k=11). The intervention was delivered using a personal computer in most studies (k=18), followed by a tablet (k=4), mobile kiosk (k=2), head-mounted display (k=1), and a desktop computer in a community center (k=1). Conclusions We offer evidence for the efficacy of VH in patient-facing systems. Considering that studies included different population and outcome types, more focused analysis is needed in the future. Future studies also need to identify what features of virtual human interventions contribute toward their effectiveness.",2020.0,129.0,24.0,"{'volume': '22', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chattopadhyay2020ComputerControlledVH,\n author = {Debaleena Chattopadhyay and Tengteng Ma and H.

And if so, what kinds of expression are most likely to spread? To address these questions, we developed a nonexperimental, noninvasive method to detect and quantify contagion of semantic expression in massive online social networks, which we review and discuss here. Using only observational data, the method avoids performing emotional experiments on users of online social networks, a research practice that recently became an object of criticism and concern. Our model combines geographic aggregation and instrumental variables regression to measure the effect of an exogenous variable on an individual's expression and the influence of this change on the expression of others to whom that individual is socially connected. In a previous work, we applied our method to the emotional content of posts generated by a large sample of users over a period of three years. Those results suggest that each post expressing a positive or negative emotion can cause friends to generate one to two additional posts expressing the same emotion, and it also inhibits their use of the opposite emotion. Here, we generalize our method so it can be applied to contexts different than emotional expression and to different forms of content generated by the users of online platforms. The method allows us to determine the usage of words in the same semantic category spread, and to estimate a signed relationship between different semantic categories, showing that an increase in the usage of one category alters the usage of another category in one's social contacts. Finally, it also allows us to estimate the total cumulative effect that a person has on all of her social contacts.",2014.0,65.0,16.0,"{'volume': '102', 'pages': '1911-1921', 'name': 'Proceedings of the IEEE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Coviello2014WordsOT,\n author = {Lorenzo Coviello and J.

Prior research suggests a number of variables that might detrimentally affect the performance of highly anxious speakers when they present speeches. But does speech anxiety affect only presentation behavior, or does it also affect the ways in which people prepare their speeches? Measures of public speaking anxiety, and most texts focusing on presentational speaking, assume that the anxiety's effect is limited to performance. In the current study we examine this notion. Using a number of variables drawn from a conceptual model of the speech preparation process, we first find that the way people go about preparing their speeches is meaningfully associated with the quality of their presentation.

However, these interventions are often characterised by poor adherence. One way to address this problem is to mimic therapy support by a conversational agent. The objectives of this study were to assess the e ﬀ ectiveness and adherence of a smartphone app, delivering strategies used in positive psychology and CBT interventions via an automated chatbot (Shim) for a non-clinical population — as well as to explore participants' views and experiences of interacting with this chatbot. A total of 28 participants were randomized to either receive the chatbot intervention ( n = 14) or to a wait-list control group ( n = 14). Findings revealed that participants who adhered to the intervention ( n = 13) showed signi ﬁ cant interaction e ﬀ ects of group and time on psychological well-being (FS) and perceived stress (PSS-10) compared to the wait-list control group, with small to large between e ﬀ ect sizes (Cohen's d range 0.14 – 1.06). Also, the participants showed high engagement during the 2-week long intervention, with an average open app ratio of 17.71 times for the whole period. This is higher compared to other studies on fully automated interventions claiming to be highly engaging, such as Woebot and the Panoply app. The qualitative data revealed sub-themes which, to our knowledge, have not been found previously, such as the moderating format of the chatbot. The results of this study, in particular the good adherence rate, validated the usefulness of replicating this study in the future with a larger sample size and an active control group. This is important, as the search for fully automated, yet highly engaging and e ﬀ ective digital self-help interventions for promoting mental health is crucial for the public health.",,53.0,215.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Misc{None,\n title = {Internet Interventions}\n}\n'}",[]

 BACKGROUND
 Individuals living with long-term physical health conditions frequently experience co-occurring mental health problems. This comorbidity has a significant impact on an individual’s levels of emotional distress, health outcomes, and associated health care utilization. As health care services struggle to meet demand and care increasingly moves to the community, digital tools are being promoted to support patients to self-manage their health. One such technology is the autonomous virtual agent (chatbot, conversational agent), which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to process the user’s written or spoken natural language and then to select or construct the corresponding appropriate responses.
 
 
 OBJECTIVE
 This study aimed to co-design the content, functionality, and interface modalities of an autonomous virtual agent to support self-management for patients with an exemplar long-term condition (LTC; chronic pulmonary obstructive disease [COPD]) and then to assess the acceptability and system content.
 
 
 METHODS
 We conducted 2 co-design workshops and a proof-of-concept implementation of an autonomous virtual agent with natural language processing capabilities. This implementation formed the basis for video-based scenario testing of acceptability with adults with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals involved in their care.
 
 
 RESULTS
 Adults (n=6) with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals (n=5) specified 4 priority self-management scenarios for which they would like to receive support: at the time of diagnosis (information provision), during acute exacerbations (crisis support), during periods of low mood (emotional support), and for general self-management (motivation). From the scenario testing, 12 additional adults with COPD felt the system to be both acceptable and engaging, particularly with regard to internet-of-things capabilities. They felt the system would be particularly useful for individuals living alone.
 
 
 CONCLUSIONS
 Patients did not explicitly separate mental and physical health needs, although the content they developed for the virtual agent had a clear psychological approach. Supported self-management delivered via an autonomous virtual agent was acceptable to the participants. A co-design process has allowed the research team to identify key design principles, content, and functionality to underpin an autonomous agent for delivering self-management support to older adults living with COPD and potentially other LTCs.

However, the learning results of traditional methods cannot adapt to the dynamic changes of the simple scene, and thus have the disadvantage of poor generalization. To solve this problem, we propose a data-driven crowd evacuation framework based on hierarchical deep reinforcement learning. The framework consists of: a macro-control layer with path programming function and a micro control layer with collision avoidance function. In this paper, a path programming method combining data-driven and deep reinforcement learning is proposed in the macro-control layer. The method combines the pedestrian motion attributes in the video with the DDPG algorithm to learn the pedestrian track in the video from a macro perspective. In the micro-control layer, the track sequence learned in the macro-control layer is used as the motion target to learn the collision-free motion velocity of individuals using the multiple agent deep reinforcement learning method. When the scene changes, the micro-control layer adaptively adjusts the motion speed without the need for the macro-control layer to repeat the path programming learning. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hierarchical crowd evacuation framework can not only simulate the real crowd movement behavior and improve the simulation fidelity, but also flexibly adapt to the dynamic changes of the simple scene and enhance the generalization.",2021.0,20.0,9.0,"{'pages': '563-568', 'name': '2021 IEEE 24th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design (CSCWD)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zhang2021CrowdES,\n author = {Zheng Zhang and Dianjie Lu and Jialiuyuan Li and Pingshan Liu and Guijuan Zhang},\n journal = {2021 IEEE 24th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design (CSCWD)},\n pages = {563-568},\n title = {Crowd Evacuation Simulation Using Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning},\n year = {2021}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2148907574', 'name': 'Zheng Zhang'}, {'authorId': '7382513', 'name': 'Dianjie Lu'}, {'authorId': '1492112268', 'name': 'Jialiuyuan Li'}, {'authorId': '2640580', 'name': 'Pingshan Liu'}, {'authorId': '3172102', 'name': 'Guijuan Zhang'}]"

Therefore, this meta-analysis investigated the efficacy of VRET for PTSD as compared to waitlist and active comparators. A literature search yielded nine controlled studies encompassing 296 participants (124 VRET, 172 controls). The differences between conditions regarding the primary outcome of PTSD symptom severity and the secondary outcome of depressive and anxiety symptoms post-treatment were calculated using Hedges’ g. Compared to waitlist controls, VRET showed a significantly better outcome for PTSD symptoms (g = 0.62, p = .017) and depressive symptoms (g = 0.50, p = .008). There was no significant difference between VRET and active comparators regarding PTSD symptoms (g = 0.25, p = .356) and depressive symptoms (g = 0.24, p = .340) post-treatment. No significant effects emerged for anxiety symptoms. These findings suggest that VRET may be as effective as active comparators for PTSD patients. However, the results must be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of trials and the substantial number of – predominantly male – military service members studied. Additional controlled trials, considering a wider range of trauma types and balanced gender, are required to strengthen the evidence.

Understanding the nature of these interactions could critically inform the design of educational technologies to facilitate children’s learning, research methods for use in future studies involving adult-child dyad technology use, and policy decisions regarding the use of educational technology with young children. In this study, we explored the natural interactions among parent, child, and a child-friendly virtual rabbit character named Floppy. Floppy is a virtual agent in a Smart Speaker app that models adult dialogic reading and conversational strategies for use with young children (ages 4-6 years). Over a span of four to six weeks, 18 parent-child dyads read The Rainbow Fish, a classic children’s book by Marcus Pfister, during 24 at-home, remote sessions with Floppy. Of the 189 conversations generated during this time, 125 were initiated by a prompt spoken by Floppy. Though there were some variations among the dyads, across all conversations, parent-driven interactions made up 63% of the conversations, followed by child-driven conversations at 15.3%, Floppy-driven at 14.3%, and Floppy-and-parent-driven at 7.4%. A select few parents were more comfortable having their children interact directly with Floppy, whereas the majority of the parents would direct children’s attention back to themselves or help children understand the questions by repeating or reformulating Floppy’s prompts. More than half of the parents reported that their children formed emotional connections with the virtual character. These findings point to a need to clearly define the role of virtual agents, even ones with limited AI, in this type of triadic interaction.",2022.0,47.0,3.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 21st Annual ACM Interaction Design and Children Conference'},"{'bibtex': '@Book{Lin2022WhatCA,\n author = {Grace C.

In social psychological studies, helping behavior has been examined in the context of short-term encounters with strangers. This focus has tended to exclude from the research literature those helping behaviors prescribed by the female gender role, because they are displayed primarily in long-term, close relationships. In contrast, the helping behaviors prescribed by the male gender role have been generously represented in research findings because they are displayed in relationships with strangers as well as in close relationships.

All 41 participants were soldiers who had previously received basic stress management training and first aid training in combat. On the first day, they received a 15-minute refresher briefing and were randomly assigned to either: (a) no additional stress management training (SMT) for three days, or (b) 30-minute sessions (one per day for three days) of biofeedback-assisted SMT while immersed in a horror/first-person shooter game. The training was performed in a dark and enclosed environment using a 50-inch television with active stereoscopic display and loudspeakers. On the last day, all participants underwent a live simulated ambush with an improvised explosive device, where they had to provide first aid to a wounded soldier. Stress levels were measured with salivary cortisol collected when waking-up, before and after the live simulation. Stress was also measured with heart rate at baseline, during an apprehension phase, and during the live simulation. Repeated-measure ANOVAs and ANCOVAs confirmed that practicing SMT was effective in reducing stress.

This has led to a truly interdisciplinary, mutually beneficial partnership between emotion research in psychology and in computational science, of which this volume is an exemplar. To understand this partnership and its potential for transforming existing practices in emotion research across disciplines and for disclosing important novel areas of research, we explore in this chapter the history of work in computational models of emotion including the various uses to which they have been put, the theoretical traditions that have shaped their development, and how these uses and traditions are reflected in their underlying architectures. For an outsider to the field, the last 15 years have seen the development of a seemingly bewildering array of competing and complementary computational models. Figure 1.2.1 lists a ‘family tree’ of a few of the significant models and the theoretical traditions from which they stem. Although there has been a proliferation of work, the field is far from mature: the goals that a model is designed to achieve are not always clearly articulated; research is rarely incremental, more often returning to motivating theories rather than extending prior computational approaches; and rarely are models contrasted with each other in terms of their ability to achieve their set goals. Contributing to potential confusion is the reality that computational models are complex systems embodying a number of, sometimes unarticulated, design decisions and assumptions inherited from the psychological and computational traditions from which they emerged, a circumstance made worse by the lack of a commonly accepted lexicon even for designating these distinctions. In this chapter, we lay out the work on computational models of emotion in an attempt to reveal the common uses to which they may be put and the underlying techniques and assumptions from which the models are built. Our aim is to present conceptual distinctions and common terminology that can aid in discussion and comparison of competing models. Our hope is that this will not only facilitate an understanding of the field for outside researchers but work towards a lexicon that can help foster the maturity of the field towards more incremental research. In characterizing different computational models of emotion, we begin by describing interdisciplinary uses to which computational models may be put, including their uses in improving human–computer interaction, in enhancing general models of intelligence, and as methodological tools for furthering our understanding of human behaviour. We next discuss how models have been built, including the underlying theoretical traditions that have shaped their development. These differing theoretical perspectives often conceptualize emotion in quite different ways, emphasizing different scenarios and proposed functions, different component processes, and different linkages between these components. It should then come as no surprise that such",2010.0,113.0,382.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Marsella2010ComputationalMO,\n author = {S. Marsella and J. Gratch and P.

Prof. Dr. Uğur Güdükbay July, 2010 Crowd simulation has a wide range of application areas such as biological and social modeling, military simulations, computer games and movies. Simulating the behavior of animated virtual crowds has been a challenging task for the computer graphics community. As well as the physical and the geometrical aspects, the semantics underlying the motion of real crowds inspire the design and implementation of virtual crowds. Psychology helps us understand the motivations of the individuals constituting a crowd. There has been extensive research on incorporating psychological models into the simulation of autonomous agents. However, in our study, instead of the psychological state of an individual agent as such, we are interested in the overall behavior of the crowd that consists of virtual humans with various psychological states. For this purpose, we incorporate the three basic constituents of affect: personality, emotion and mood. Each of these elements contribute variably to the emergence of different aspects of behavior. We thus examine, by changing the parameters, how groups of people with different characteristics interact with each other, and accordingly, how the global crowd behavior is influenced. In the social psychology literature, crowds are classified as mobs and audiences. Audiences are passive crowds whereas mobs are active crowds with emotional, irrational and seemingly homogeneous behavior. In this thesis, we examine how audiences turn into mobs and simulate the common properties of mobs to create collective misbehavior. So far, crowd simulation research has focused on panicking crowds among all types of mobs. We extend the state of the art to simulate different types of mobs based on the taxonomy. We demonstrate various scenarios that realize the behavior of distinct mob types.

This study designed a GIVRLE by integrating knowledge of quadratic functions into gameplay. Forty seventh graders who had never acquired that knowledge played the game and took pre- and posttests. An additional 60 seventh graders took the same math tests as controls. The results showed significant improvements in math achievement and learning motivation between the pre- and posttests among students who played the game. No enhancement of math achievement was found in the control students. The playability survey and user experience questionnaire verified the suitability of the game. The findings indicate that a GIVRLE is a suitable tool for addressing teaching difficulties in K–12. The notion of intrinsic integration between learning content and gameplay based on simulated daily activity tasks is further discussed.",2019.0,56.0,40.0,"{'volume': '30', 'pages': '721 - 734', 'name': 'Interactive Learning Environments'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Shi2019TheEO,\n author = {Aili Shi and Yamin Wang and N.

J. Turner tambien se embarca a traves de las paginas de la presente obra en esta investigacion concretando la pregunta en un aspecto de nuestra naturaleza, a saber, el social, transformando asi el enigma inicial en como hemos llegado a ser seres sociales. Para responder a ello el presente libro aporta pistas sumamente valiosas en la reconstruccion del puzzle, reparando en una pieza olvidada y al mismo tiempo clave para entender la identidad de los humanos: las emociones, llegando asi a defender la sorprendente y poco frecuente tesis de que las emociones son el fundamento de los lazos sociales en los humanos. On the origins of human emotions trata, pues, de descifrar mediante una historia logica y factible como opero la seleccion para hacer de los humanos los animales mas emocionales que existen sobre la tierra.1 Para ello J. Turner, profesor de sociologia de las emociones en la Universidad de California (Riverside), realiza un recorrido interdisciplinar, sin por ello abandonar su enfoque sociologico, con el fin de anclar su tesis en distintos puertos intelectuales, mostrando asi, como el mismo senala, que la trasgresion de estas fronteras en el conocimiento se perfila cada vez mas necesaria en cualquier estudio del ser humano. Asi, con el fin de entender mejor la dinamica de las emociones en las relaciones humanas desde una perspectiva sociologica y evolucionista, J. Turner elabora un argumento original y riguroso, transportandonos al comienzodenuestra historia como especie. Para el autor se hace evidente, siendo este el punto central de toda su argumentacion, que la capacidad emocional fue la manera mas eficaz que tuvo la evolucion para garantizar nuestra supervivencia; y esto",2000.0,0.0,249.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Turner2000OnTO,\n author = {J.

In two experiments, a total of 100 high school students rated their impression of two sets of schematic faces in terms of semantic differential scales (Activity, Negative Evaluation, and Potency). It was found that the different facial features could be ordered hierarchically, with eyebrows as the most important feature, followed by mouth and eyes.

The authors suggest that the mechanism involved is the perception-behavior link, the recently documented finding (e.g., J. A. Bargh, M. Chen, & L. Burrows, 1996) that the mere perception of another's behavior automatically increases the likelihood of engaging in that behavior oneself. Experiment 1 showed that the motor behavior of participants unintentionally matched that of strangers with whom they worked on a task. Experiment 2 had confederates mimic the posture and movements of participants and showed that mimicry facilitates the smoothness of interactions and increases liking between interaction partners.

We found that while younger children track which informant provides which examples, they do not have clear preferences for the informant who provides stronger examples. Older children, on the other hand, are in the middle of a developmental transition.

Although several studies designed to examine the correlation between extraversion and nonverbal behavior have been conducted, most attempts to summarize these studies reflect the inconsistent nature of the research findings. Indeed, correlations range from −.36 to .73. The extant literature summaries are limited to narrative reviews, however, which tend to be highly selective. The purpose of this study was to meta‐analyze the relevant studies. Results indicated that the mean correlation coefficient weighted for sample size was .13 for the entire sample of studies. Although 63% of the variance was attributable to sampling error, the distribution of correlations was heterogeneous. The remaining variance was due to two methodological artifacts: sample size and the number of nonverbal behaviors coded. For example, hierarchical breakdowns by moderator indicated that the mean correlation was .50 for highly focused studies—those in which researchers concentrated on a few behaviors and limited coding to 40 or fewer subjects. A cognitive‐overload model for these findings is offered and corroborated by findings from other research domains. Implications for communication research and theory are discussed. In addition to clarifying the empirical relationship between extraversion and nonverbal behavior, the contributions of this study reside, in part, in its implications for large samples and large numbers of nonverbal behaviors coded in research and for meta‐analyses of such research literatures.",2004.0,59.0,43.0,"{'volume': '71', 'pages': '28 - 48', 'name': 'Communication Monographs'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{France2004IsTE,\n author = {Betty H.

This integrated perspective entails a flexible approach to emotional behavior: Expressive behavior, action tendencies, and cultural influence on emotion meaning all have their place in understanding emotional development. The chapter goes on to examine early emotional development, highlighting the importance of emotion communication as evidenced in infants through their emotional signaling to caregivers, their social referencing to significant others, and their growing skills at affective sharing with others. The final half of the chapter examines the development of eight specific skills of emotional competence, emphasizing their social effectiveness and individual adaptiveness. We conclude with a discussion of future research directions, including what may be the relational limits of emotion, individual differences in emotional responsiveness to contextual cues, attention processes, and emotion-related goals, some of which may become interiorized with development.

More concretely, discriminators each specialize in a different principle of communication, such as Grice’s maxims, and are collectively combined with the base RNN generator through a composite decoding objective. Human evaluation demonstrates that text generated by our model is preferred over that of baselines by a large margin, significantly enhancing the overall coherence, style, and information of the generations.",2018.0,57.0,191.0,"{'volume': 'abs/1805.06087', 'name': 'ArXiv'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Holtzman2018LearningTW,\n author = {Ari Holtzman and Jan Buys and Maxwell Forbes and Antoine Bosselut and David Golub and Yejin Choi},\n journal = {ArXiv},\n title = {Learning to Write with Cooperative Discriminators},\n volume = {abs/1805.06087},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '14487640', 'name': 'Ari Holtzman'}, {'authorId': '144685020', 'name': 'Jan Buys'}, {'authorId': '39191185', 'name': 'Maxwell Forbes'}, {'authorId': '2691021', 'name': 'Antoine Bosselut'}, {'authorId': '145798491', 'name': 'David Golub'}, {'authorId': '1699545', 'name': 'Yejin Choi'}]"

These two modalities influence each other in perception. Under normal circumstances the speech information in both channels is coherent and complementary and integrated to a percept. But if the information is conflicting and nevertheless integrated then the percept in one of the modalities might be changed by the other modality.

1431,6e084ecb7e88d267ed1f0db7fca90a1c126bd361,Exploring Coherent Motion Patterns via Structured Trajectory Learning for Crowd Mood Modeling,"Crowd behavior analysis has recently attracted extensive attention in research. However, the existing research mainly focuses on investigating motion patterns in crowds, while the emotional aspects of crowd behaviors are left unexplored. Analyzing the emotion of crowd behaviors is indeed extremely important, as it uncovers the social moods that are beneficial for video surveillance. In this paper, we propose a novel crowd representation termed crowd mood. Crowd mood is established based upon the discovery that the social emotional hypothesis of crowd behaviors can be revealed by investigating the spacing interactions and the structural levels of motion patterns in crowds. To this end, we first learn the structured trajectories of crowds by particle advection using low-rank approximation with group sparsity constraint, which implicitly characterizes the coherent motion patterns. Second, rich emotional motion features are explicitly extracted and fused by support vector regression to reflect social characteristics. In particular, we construct weighted features in a boosted manner by considering the features’ significance. Finally, crowd mood is intuitively presented as affective curves to track the emotion states of the crowd dynamics, which is robust to noise, sensitive to semantic shift, and compact for pattern expressions. Extensive evaluations on crowd video data sets demonstrate that our approach effectively models crowd mood and achieves significantly better results with comparisons to several alternative and state-of-the-art approaches for various tasks, i.e., crowd mood classification, global abnormal mood detection, and crowd emotion matching.",2017.0,54.0,28.0,"{'volume': '27', 'pages': '635-648', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zhang2017ExploringCM,\n author = {Yanhao Zhang and Lei Qin and R.

Ten fully saturated chromatic colors were chosen from the Munsell color system: red, yellow, green, blue, purple, yellow-red, green-yellow, blue-green, purple-blue, and redpurple. Apart from these ten hue groups, three achromatic colors (white, black and gray) were also used. The sample consisted of 98 volunteered college students at a public institution in the southeast region of the US. Results revealed that the principle hues comprised the highest number of positive emotional responses, followed by the intermediate hues and the achromatic colors. Color symbolism seems to be apparent in how individuals associate colors with things, objects or physical space. Red-purple, for instance, was associated with the color of red wine, plum, bridesmaid dress, or the color of a bedroom.

Developmental Changes in Mental Performance. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 1973, 38 (3, Serial No. 150). A distinction was made between the general level of a person's IQ (i.e., the average of his scores across age) and his profile contour (i.e., the developmental pattern of inflections in performance). Most research has focused on the general level of IQ and its correlates; this project systematically investigated patterns of IQ change with data from the Fels Longitudinal Study. Normal middle-class children changed an average of 28.5 IQ points between 21/2 and 17 years of age, and one in seven displayed shifts of more than 40 points. While siblings were more similar in their general level of IQ than unrelated children matched or unmatched for social class, the pattern of developmental changes in childhood IQs or infant DQs was not more similar among siblings than among unrelated children. Twins and triplets scored lower in general level and were less variable in IQ over age than singletons, thus potentially qualifying attempts to generalize IQ change results based upon multiple-birth samples to singletons. Parent-child IQ correlations were higher when the parent was assessed as an adult than if both parent and child were tested at the same chronological ages. A sample of 80 subjects who had relatively complete IQ data (maximum of 17 tests) between 2/2 and 17 years were clustered into five groups which represented different patterns of IQ change over age. These profiles were relatively simple linear or quadratic trends and not random fluctuations about a constant value. Major inflection points occurred at 6 and 10 years of age. It was not obvious that these patterns were simple products of repeated testing or the changing nature of the IQ test. The children in the five IQ profile clusters had parents who were different in the extent to which they attempted to accelerate their child's development and the severity of punishments they administered. These parental correlates appeared to hold up even when parental education and IQ as well as the general level of the child's IQ were statistically controlled. Given the assumptions prompted by these data, the changing nature of environmental circumstances across the childhood years for a given individual may be as potent in changing IQ as the differences between family environments.

THE LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES IN IQ Several reviews of the literature on the development of mental performance are available (Bayley 1970; Bloom 1964; Pinneau 1961). However, most of the research surveyed involves correlations between mental test performance at several different ages and correlations between personality and social variables with IQ at one age versus another. Such research strategies are valuable and have yielded important results, but they are ""developmental"" only in the sense that data are available at several ages on the same subjects and correlational relationships are derived within and across age periods. Because the correlation coefficient is independent of the means of the distributions, it is possible to obtain high correlational stability of IQ across age but marked fluctuations in the group mean. In short, cross-age correlations reveal little about the nature of absolute changes in level of performance, and they provide only partial information about individual differences in developmental pattern. This project focuses on developmental patterns of change in the level of mental performance as assessed by traditional intelligence tests.",2016.0,97.0,6668.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Mccall2016MONOGRAPHSOT,\n author = {R.

However, to realize its potential, the exchange between the two disciplines, as well as the intradisciplinary coordination, should be further improved. We make three proposals for how this could be achieved. The proposals refer to: 1) systematizing and classifying the assumptions of psychological emotion theories; 2) formalizing emotion theories in implementation-independent formal languages (set theory, agent logics); and 3) modeling emotions using general cognitive architectures (such as Soar and ACT-R), general agent architectures (such as the BDI architecture) or general-purpose affective agent architectures. These proposals share two overarching themes. The first is a proposal for modularization: deconstruct emotion theories into basic assumptions; modularize architectures. The second is a proposal for unification and standardization: Translate different emotion theories into a common informal conceptual system or a formal language, or implement them in a common architecture.",2013.0,236.0,135.0,"{'volume': '4', 'pages': '246-266', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Reisenzein2013ComputationalMO,\n author = {R.

In this paper, head motion sequences in expressive facial animations are analyzed in terms of their naturalness and emotional salience in perception. Statistical measures are derived from an audiovisual database, comprising synchronized facial gestures and speech, which revealed characteristic patterns in emotional head motion sequences. Head motion patterns with neutral speech significantly differ from head motion patterns with emotional speech in motion activation, range, and velocity. The results show that head motion provides discriminating information about emotional categories. An approach to synthesize emotional head motion sequences driven by prosodic features is presented, expanding upon our previous framework on head motion synthesis. This method naturally models the specific temporal dynamics of emotional head motion sequences by building hidden Markov models for each emotional category (sadness, happiness, anger, and neutral state). Human raters were asked to assess the naturalness and the emotional content of the facial animations. On average, the synthesized head motion sequences were perceived even more natural than the original head motion sequences. The results also show that head motion modifies the emotional perception of the facial animation especially in the valence and activation domain. These results suggest that appropriate head motion not only significantly improves the naturalness of the animation but can also be used to enhance the emotional content of the animation to effectively engage the users",2007.0,44.0,182.0,"{'volume': '15', 'pages': '1075-1086', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Busso2007RigidHM,\n author = {C.

The model is then deformed for each key viewpoint, yielding a set of models that closely match the corresponding sketches. We introduce a view-dependent facial expression space defined by the key viewpoints and the basic emotions to generate various facial expressions viewed from arbitrary angles. The output facial animation conforms to the input sketches and maintains frame-to-frame correspondence. We demonstrate the potential of our approach through an easy-to-use system, where the animating of cartoon faces is automated once the user accomplishes sketching and configuration.

In this work, two experiments were conducted with that aim, one asking participants to compare two different versions of an application side-by-side when conveying a specific emotion, and another asking the participants to recognize the emotion being expressed in each version. We found that, for some emotions, the approach rated higher in terms of emotion expression during the side-by-side comparison would not translate to the approach with a higher emotion recognition in the second experiment. Although this discrepancy is generally consistent with what happens with emotion recognition in humans, it is noteworthy that some higher-rated choices ended up not being as effective in the expression of emotion. We discuss how these discrepancies might have originated from forced-choice and feature dominance, and why context should be taken into account when designing experiments.",2022.0,53.0,1.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 22nd ACM International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Rodrigues2022ACT,\n author = {R.

Although past research has studied how agents apologize or seek help appropriately, there lacks a comprehensive study of how to design an emotionally intelligent (EI) virtual agent. In this paper, we propose to improve a VA's perceived EI by equipping it with personality-driven responsive expression of emotions. We conduct a within-subject experiment to verify this approach using a medical assistant VA. We ask participants to observe how the agent (displaying a dominant or submissive trait, or having no personality) handles user challenges when issuing reminders and rate its EI. Results show that simply being emotionally expressive is insufficient for suggesting VAs as fully emotionally intelligent. Equipping such VAs with a consistent, distinctive personality trait (especially submissive) can convey a significantly stronger sense of EI in terms of the ability to perceive, use, understand, and manage emotions, and can better mitigate user challenges.",2019.0,103.0,23.0,{'name': 'The World Wide Web Conference'},"{'bibtex': '@Book{Ma2019ExploringPE,\n author = {Xiaojuan Ma and Emily P.

While the perception of emotions has been studied extensively in human psychology, little is known about what factors influence the human perception of emotions in robots and virtual characters. In this paper, we build on the Brunswik lens model to investigate the influence of (a) the agent's embodiment using a 2D virtual character, a 3D blended embodiment, a recording of the 3D platform and a recording of a human, as well as (b) the level of human-likeness on people's ability to interpret emotional facial expressions in an agent. In addition, we measure social traits of the human observers and analyze how they correlate to the success in recognizing emotional expressions. We find that interpersonal differences play a minor role in the perception of emotional states.

1457,70b8273602fde618364af25722a3a11a0249270e,Keeping speed and distance for aligned motion.,"The cohesive collective motion (flocking, swarming) of autonomous agents is ubiquitously observed and exploited in both natural and man-made settings, thus, minimal models for its description are essential. In a model with continuous space and time we find that if two particles arrive symmetrically in a plane at a large angle, then (i) radial repulsion and (ii) linear self-propelling toward a fixed preferred speed are sufficient for them to depart at a smaller angle. For this local gain of momentum explicit velocity alignment is not necessary, nor are adhesion or attraction, inelasticity or anisotropy of the particles, or nonlinear drag. With many particles obeying these microscopic rules of motion we find that their spatial confinement to a square with periodic boundaries (which is an indirect form of attraction) leads to stable macroscopic ordering. As a function of the strength of added noise we see--at finite system sizes--a critical slowing down close to the order-disorder boundary and a discontinuous transition. After varying the density of particles at constant system size and varying the size of the system with constant particle density we predict that in the infinite system size (or density) limit the hysteresis loop disappears and the transition becomes continuous. We note that animals, humans, drones, etc., tend to move asynchronously and are often more responsive to motion than positions. Thus, for them velocity-based continuous models can provide higher precision than coordinate-based models. An additional characteristic and realistic feature of the model is that convergence to the ordered state is fastest at a finite density, which is in contrast to models applying (discontinuous) explicit velocity alignments and discretized time. To summarize, we find that the investigated model can provide a minimal description of flocking.",2014.0,17.0,4.0,"{'volume': '91 1', 'pages': '\n          012807\n        ', 'name': 'Physical review.

Here, we investigated the hypothesis that the vmPFC represents the subjective value or desirability of future outcomes during social decision-making. Both vmPFC-damaged patients and control participants acted as the responder in a single-round ultimatum game. To test outcome valuation, we contrasted concrete, immediately available gains with abstract, future ones. To test social valuation, we contrasted interactions with a human partner and those involving a computer. We found that, compared to controls, vmPFC patients substantially reduced their acceptance rate of unfair offers from a human partner, but only when financial gains were presented as abstract amounts to be received later. When the gains were visible and readily available, the vmPFC patients' acceptance of unfair offers was normal. Furthermore, unlike controls, vmPFC patients did not distinguish between unfair offers from a human agent and those from a computerized opponent.

One interesting finding is that even if there is no percolation in the individual networks, percolation (i.e., information epidemics) can take place in the conjoint social-physical network. We also show, both analytically and experimentally, that the fraction of individuals who receive an item of information (started from an arbitrary node) is significantly larger in the conjoint social-physical network case, as compared to the case where the networks are disjoint.

Prey fish under threat of predation can signal risk to conspecific fish, which then exhibit defensive responses. Fish also assess predation risk by visual cues and change their behavior accordingly. Here, we explored whether these behavioral changes act as visual alarm signals to conspecific fish that are not initially under risk. We show that shoals of zebrafish (Danio rerio) visually exposed to a predator display antipredator behaviors. In addition, these defensive maneuvers trigger antipredator reactions in conspecifics and, concomitantly, stimulate the hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal axis, leading to cortisol increase.

Naturally, the facial features of a subject taken from different instances of the same emotion have wide variations. In the presence of two or more facial features, the variation of the attributes together makes the emotion recognition problem more complicated. This variation is the main source of uncertainty in the emotion recognition problem, which has been addressed here in two steps using type-2 fuzzy sets. First a type-2 fuzzy face space is constructed with the background knowledge of facial features of different subjects for different emotions. Second, the emotion of an unknown facial expression is determined based on the consensus of the measured facial features with the fuzzy face space. Both interval and general type-2 fuzzy sets (GT2FS) have been used separately to model the fuzzy face space. The interval type-2 fuzzy set (IT2FS) involves primary membership functions for m facial features obtained from n-subjects, each having l-instances of facial expressions for a given emotion. The GT2FS in addition to employing the primary membership functions mentioned above also involves the secondary memberships for individual primary membership curve, which has been obtained here by formulating and solving an optimization problem. The optimization problem here attempts to minimize the difference between two decoded signals: the first one being the type-1 defuzzification of the average primary membership functions obtained from the n-subjects, while the second one refers to the type-2 defuzzified signal for a given primary membership function with secondary memberships as unknown. The uncertainty management policy adopted using GT2FS has resulted in a classification accuracy of 98.333% in comparison to 91.667% obtained by its interval type-2 counterpart. A small improvement (approximately 2.5%) in classification accuracy by IT2FS has been attained by pre-processing measurements using the well-known interval approach.",2013.0,81.0,114.0,"{'volume': '43', 'pages': '587-605', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Halder2013GeneralAI,\n author = {Anisha Halder and A.

To this date, investigations of emotional cognition have predominantly concentrated on processes associated with viewing facial expressions. However, expressive body movements may be just as important for understanding the neurobiology of emotional behavior. Here, we used functional MRI to clarify how the brain recognizes happiness or fear expressed by a whole body. Our results indicate that observing fearful body expressions produces increased activity in brain areas narrowly associated with emotional processes and that this emotion-related activity occurs together with activation of areas linked with representation of action and movement. The mechanism of fear contagion hereby suggested may automatically prepare the brain for action.",2004.0,69.0,445.0,"{'volume': '101 47', 'pages': '\n          16701-6\n        ', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gelder2004FearFF,\n author = {B. de Gelder and Josh Snyder and Doug Greve and George Gerard and N.

To support that claim, research has been carried out in various modern cultures and in cultures relatively isolated from Western influence. A review of the methods used in that research raises questions of its ecological, convergent, and internal validity. Forced-choice response format, within-subject design, preselected photographs of posed facial expressions, and other features of method are each problematic. When they are altered, less supportive or nonsupportive results occur. When they are combined, these method factors may help to shape the results.

In Experiment 1, subjects negotiated and then learned that their opponent felt happy/disappointed/neutral. Negotiators felt less successful when their opponent was happy than when the opponent was disappointed. This effect occurred independent of negotiators′ actual performance on the task. The feeling of success was ""bittersweet"", however, in that individuals who felt successful also regarded themselves as less honest, less sincere, less generous, and less fair - in short, less honourable in the negotiations. Experiment 2 tested the prediction that intergroup relationships govern the inverse affect and bittersweet effects. Individuals who negotiated with a disappointed opponent felt successful when the opponent was an out-group member, but not when the opponent was an in-group member. Negotiators allocated substantially more resources to in-group members who expressed disappointment with a previous outcome than to out-group members who expressed disappointment.",1995.0,0.0,105.0,"{'volume': '31', 'pages': '467-492', 'name': 'Journal of Experimental Social Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Thompson1995TheBF,\n author = {Leigh Thompson and Kathleen L.

Because specific emotions inflate expectancies for events possessing matching emotional overtones (D. DeSteno, R. E. Petty, D. T. Wegener, & D. D. Rucker, 2000), the authors predicted that attempts at persuasion would be more successful when messages were framed with emotional overtones matching the emotional state of the receiver and that these changes would be mediated by emotion-induced biases involving expectancies attached to arguments contained in the messages. Two studies manipulating discrete negative emotional states and message frames (i.e., sadness and anger) confirmed these predictions. The functioning of this emotion-matching bias in parallel with emotion-induced processing differences and the limitations of a valence-based approach to the study of attitude change are also considered.",2004.0,88.0,336.0,"{'volume': '86 1', 'pages': '\n          43-56\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{DeSteno2004DiscreteEA,\n author = {David DeSteno and R.

Many skills we learn, such as language, are learned through observation or imitation in social contexts. Likewise, many skills are learned implicitly, that is, without an explicit intent to learn and without full awareness of the acquired knowledge. Here, we asked whether performance in a motor learning task is modulated by social vs. object cues of varying validity. To address this question, we asked participants to carry out a serial reaction time (SRT) task in which, on each trial, people have to respond as fast and as accurately as possible to the appearance of a stimulus at one of four possible locations. Unbeknownst to participants, the sequence of successive locations was sequentially structured, so that knowledge of the sequence facilitates anticipation of the next stimulus and hence faster motor responses. Crucially, each trial also contained a cue pointing to the next stimulus location. Participants could thus learn based on the cue, or on learning about the sequence of successive locations, or on a combination of both. Results show an interaction between cue type and cue validity for the motor responses: social cues (vs. object cues) led to faster responses in the low validity (LV) condition only. Concerning the extent to which learning was implicit, results show that in the cued blocks only, the highly valid social cue led to implicit learning. In the uncued blocks, participants showed no implicit learning in the highly valid social cue condition, but did in all other combinations of stimulus type and cueing validity. In conclusion, our results suggest that implicit learning is context-dependent and can be influenced by the cue type, e.g., social and object cues.",2018.0,65.0,16.0,"{'volume': '12', 'name': 'Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Geiger2018SocialCA,\n author = {Alexander Geiger and Axel Cleeremans and G.

Two experiments exploring a choice reaction time task are reported. Unknown to Ss, successive stimuli followed a sequence derived from a ""noisy"" finite-state grammar. After considerable practice (60,000 exposures) with Experiment 1, Ss acquired a complex body of procedural knowledge about the sequential structure of the material. Experiment 2 was an attempt to identify limits on Ss ability to encode the temporal context by using more distant contingencies that spanned irrelevant material. Taken together, the results indicate that Ss become increasingly sensitive to the temporal context set by previous elements of the sequence, up to 3 elements. Responses are also affected by priming effects from recent trials. A connectionist model that incorporates sensitivity to the sequential structure and to priming effects is shown to capture key aspects of both acquisition and processing and to account for the interaction between attention and sequence structure reported by Cohen, Ivry, and Keele (1990).",1991.0,49.0,664.0,"{'volume': '120 3', 'pages': '\n          235-53\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of experimental psychology.

Beneficial effects associated with these practices have been found on physical health, mental health and cognitive performance. However, studies and theories that clarify the underlying mechanisms are lacking or scarce. This theoretical review aims to address and compensate this scarcity. We will show that various contemplative activities have in common that breathing is regulated or attentively guided. This respiratory discipline in turn could parsimoniously explain the physical and mental benefits of contemplative activities through changes in autonomic balance. We propose a neurophysiological model that explains how these specific respiration styles could operate, by phasically and tonically stimulating the vagal nerve: respiratory vagal nerve stimulation (rVNS). The vagal nerve, as a proponent of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), is the prime candidate in explaining the effects of contemplative practices on health, mental health and cognition.

Virtual human faces are useful for conducting controlled experiments. However, little is known regarding the possible differences between physiological responses elicited by virtual versus real human facial expressions. The aim of the current study was to determine if virtual and real emotional faces elicit the same rapid facial reactions for the perception of facial expressions of joy, anger, and sadness. Facial electromyography (corrugator supercilii, zygomaticus major, and depressor anguli) was recorded in 30 participants during the presentation of dynamic or static and virtual or real faces. For the perception of dynamic facial expressions of joy and anger, analyses of electromyography data revealed that rapid facial reactions were stronger when participants were presented with real faces compared with virtual faces.

In this paper, we describe an algorithm for controlling the movements of creatures that travel as a group and evaluate the performance of the algorithm with three simulated systems: legged robots, humanlike bicycle riders, and point-mass systems. Both the legged robots and the bicyclists are dynamic simulations that must control balance, facing direction, and forward speed as well as position within the group.

Positive and negative affect was manipulated in a controlled setting, and the effectiveness of the mood induction was assessed using standard mood adjective rating scales.

The variety of conceptualizations makes it difficult for researchers to interpret, compare, and evaluate the presence ratings obtained from individual studies. Presence has been measured by employing questionnaires, physiological indices, behavioral feedbacks, and interviews. A systematic literature review was conducted to provide insight into the definitions and measurements of presence in studies from 2002 to 2019, with a focus on questionnaires and physiological measures. The review showed that scholars had introduced various definitions of presence that often originate from different theoretical standpoints and that this has produced a multitude of different questionnaires that aim to measure presence. At the same time, physiological studies that investigate the physiological correlates of the sense of presence have often shown ambiguous results or have not been replicated. Most of the scholars have preferred the use of questionnaires, with Witmer and Singer's Presence Questionnaire being the most prevalent. Among the physiological measures, electroencephalography was the most frequently used.

In the study, a virtual agent acted as an assistant to review the imaginary monthly schedule of the participant. After uttering each schedule, the agent showed different emotional nonverbal behaviors to express empathy. The stimulus materials were presented to 60 participants (30 elderly people and 30 younger adults) in 25 videos. All participants had to rate the agent's friendliness, intelligence, empathy, trustworthiness, and helpfulness immediately after watching each video. The results indicated that in the presence of the emotional nonverbal behaviors the elderly rated the agent as more empathic and trustworthy compared to the younger adults. The data also revealed that there were differences with respect to rating specific emotional nonverbal behaviors as more empathic than others. Elderly people perceived Dropping the Arms plus Sad Face, Head down, Sad Face, Head Nod plus Smile, and Smile as more empathic, and the nonverbal behaviors perceived as most empathic for the younger adults were Dropping the Arms plus Sad Face, and Head down.",2018.0,18.0,26.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Human-Agent Interaction'},"{'bibtex': '@Book{Hosseinpanah2018EmpathyFE,\n author = {Adineh Hosseinpanah and N.

Do some emotion regulation strategies have more to recommend them than others? According to Gross's (1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271-299) process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners. This review concludes with a consideration of five important directions for future research on emotion regulation processes.",2002.0,83.0,3660.0,"{'volume': '39 3', 'pages': '\n          281-91\n        ', 'name': 'Psychophysiology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gross2002EmotionRA,\n author = {J.

To investigate this question, we developed four APAs with two distinct personality types and two sets of gestures expressing distinct emotional feedback. Effects of APAs' personality types and emotional feedback strategies on learning experiences and performance were assessed experimentally using a virtual Tai Chi training system. Fifty six participants completed the experiment. Results showed that positive emotional feedback strategy led to better learning experiences and performance than negative feedback strategy. Moreover, personality type had significant effect on learning. Choleric APAs led to better performance than Phlegmatic APAs. Personality types moderated the effect of emotional feedback on learning satisfaction. Our study demonstrates that APAs with distinct personality types and emotional feedback are important design parameters for virtual learning environments.",2016.0,57.0,23.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems'},"{'bibtex': ""@Book{Bian2016EffectsOP,\n author = {Yulong Bian and Chenglei Yang and Dong-Dong Guan and Sa Xiao and Fengqiang Gao and Chia Shen and Xiangxu Meng},\n booktitle = {International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems},\n journal = {Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems},\n title = {Effects of Pedagogical Agent's Personality and Emotional Feedback Strategy on Chinese Students' Learning Experiences and Performance: A Study Based on Virtual Tai Chi Training Studio},\n year = {2016}\n}\n""}","[{'authorId': '1867496', 'name': 'Yulong Bian'}, {'authorId': '8100457', 'name': 'Chenglei Yang'}, {'authorId': '2955207', 'name': 'Dong-Dong Guan'}, {'authorId': '2112869075', 'name': 'Sa Xiao'}, {'authorId': '2243198', 'name': 'Fengqiang Gao'}, {'authorId': '5286031', 'name': 'Chia Shen'}, {'authorId': '1759133', 'name': 'Xiangxu Meng'}]"

The idea is put forward, based on the experience of a large number of experimental studies, that there are two orthogonal components that contribute to this realistic response. The first is ‘being there’, often called ‘presence’, the qualia of having a sensation of being in a real place. We call this place illusion (PI). Second, plausibility illusion (Psi) refers to the illusion that the scenario being depicted is actually occurring. In the case of both PI and Psi the participant knows for sure that they are not ‘there’ and that the events are not occurring. PI is constrained by the sensorimotor contingencies afforded by the virtual reality system. Psi is determined by the extent to which the system can produce events that directly relate to the participant, the overall credibility of the scenario being depicted in comparison with expectations. We argue that when both PI and Psi occur, participants will respond realistically to the virtual reality.",2009.0,49.0,1495.0,"{'volume': '364', 'pages': '3549 - 3557', 'name': 'Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Slater2009PlaceIA,\n author = {M.

However, and contrary to the widely available literature on personality traits, no best practices for the development of personality state measures exist, and personality state measures have been developed in many different ways. To address this, we first define what a personality state is and discuss important components. On the basis of this, we define what a personality state measure is and suggest a general guideline for the development of such measures. Following the ABC of test construction can then guide the strategy for obtaining validity and reliability evidence: (A) What is the construct being measured? (B) What is the intended purpose of the measure? And (C) What is the targeted population of persons and situations? We then conclude with an example by developing an initial item pool for the assessment of conscientiousness personality states. © 2020 The Authors.

In this study, we hypothesized that emotion expression alters behavior in morally charged negotiation. We investigated the impact of facial displays of discrete emotions, specifically anger and sadness, in a morally charged multi-issue negotiation task. Our results indicate that if a negotiator associated moral significance to the object of the negotiation, displays of anger resulted in reduced concession making whereas displays of sadness increased concession making. Moral significance of the issues fostered an emotional matching mechanism of sorrow, where a sorrow expression from one party elicited a sorrow expression from the other.

In such situations, a psychologist might recommend a program of exposure therapy in order to help break the pattern of avoidance and fear.

Results revealed that firefighters were not different from controls on world assumptions and that world assumptions were unrelated to years of service. These results suggest that the psychological reactions of workers exposed to high levels of job-related traumatic stress may not be consistent with that described in previous literature regarding primary victims.

A mechanism according to which action representation modulates emotional activity may provide an essential functional architecture for empathy. The superior temporal and inferior frontal cortices are critical areas for action representation and are connected to the limbic system via the insula.

Imitation and observation of emotions activated a largely similar network of brain areas. Within this network, there was greater activity during imitation, compared with observation of emotions, in premotor areas including the inferior frontal cortex, as well as in the superior temporal cortex, insula, and amygdala.

In this paper, we are investigating if there are differences in how characters are perceived in immersive virtual reality as opposed to more common, screen-based environments. We were particularly interested if the spatial and immersive components play an important part in perception of interactive, game-like settings, where characters can either be controlled (avatars) or observed (agents). We focus on the subjective reports on perceived realism, affinity, co-presence and agency. Since appearance of the character is an important component of affinity, we introduced the changes in render style, ranging in three realism levels, to test if appearance would even further influence the perception in relation to control condition and platform. Furthermore, we adapted a behavioural method (proximity task) as a novel approach to establishing if behavioural changes could be recorded based on the introduced conditions and compared those values with the subjective reports of the participants.

In order to more effectively complete the DRL-based collaborative path planning in crowd evacuation, it is necessary to consider the space expansion problem brought by the increase of the number of agents. In addition, it is often faced with complicated circumstances, such as exit selection and congestion in crowd evacuation. However, few existing works have integrated these two aspects jointly. To solve this problem, we propose a planning approach for crowd evacuation based on the improved DRL algorithm, which will improve evacuation efficiency for large-scale crowd path planning. First, we propose a framework of congestion detection-based multi-agent reinforcement learning, the framework divides the crowd into leaders and followers and simulates leaders with a multi-agent system, it considers the congestion detection area is set up to evaluate the degree of congestion at each exit. Next, under the specification of this framework, we propose the improved Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (IMADDPG) algorithm, which adds the mean field network to maximize the returns of other agents, enables all agents to maximize the performance of a collaborative planning task in our training period. Then, we implement the hierarchical path planning method, which upper layer is based on the IMADDPG algorithm to solve the global path, and lower layer uses the reciprocal velocity obstacles method to avoid collisions in crowds. Finally, we simulate the proposed method with the crowd simulation system.

Gaze cues in particular are integral in mechanisms for communication and management of attention in social interactions, which can trigger important social and cognitive processes, such as establishment of affiliation between people or learning new information. The fundamental building blocks of gaze behaviors are gaze shifts: coordinated movements of the eyes, head, and body toward objects and information in the environment. In this article, we present a novel computational model for gaze shift synthesis for ECAs that supports parametric control over coordinated eye, head, and upper body movements. We employed the model in three studies with human participants. In the first study, we validated the model by showing that participants are able to interpret the agent’s gaze direction accurately. In the second and third studies, we showed that by adjusting the participation of the head and upper body in gaze shifts, we can control the strength of the attention signals conveyed, thereby strengthening or weakening their social and cognitive effects. The second study shows that manipulation of eye--head coordination in gaze enables an agent to convey more information or establish stronger affiliation with participants in a teaching task, while the third study demonstrates how manipulation of upper body coordination enables the agent to communicate increased interest in objects in the environment.",2015.0,86.0,49.0,"{'volume': '5', 'pages': '1 - 34', 'name': 'ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Pejsa2015GazeAA,\n author = {T.

Implicit learning through motor sequencing tasks is sensitive to basal ganglia dysfunction. Consequently, it is ideally suited for testing elements of the frontostriatal model of major depression and performance can be related to key clinical, neuropsychological, vascular and biochemical data. Method. Twenty-one subjects with moderate to severe unipolar depression and 21 age-, sex- and education-matched controls were recruited. Clinical, vascular and biochemical data were recorded. Subjects were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests that assessed speed of processing, working memory, learning, memory, language, perceptual organization and executive functioning. Additionally, subjects were administered a motor sequencing implicit learning task. Implicit learning is assumed when reaction times improve during the sequenced condition as compared to the pseudo-random baseline condition. Results. The rate of implicit learning in persons with depression was only half that of control subjects (3·6% v. 7·3%). Lower rates of implicit learning in patients were associated with poorer performance on neuropsychological tests of visuomotor speed and mental flexibility, longer duration of depressive episode and severity of acute stress. In a small number of subjects, poorer performance was also related to past suicide attempt. Conclusions. Impaired implicit learning in persons with depression is consistent with frontostriatal dysfunction. Performance is related to some clinical characteristics and to neuropsychological functioning on tests of visuomotor speed and mental flexibility.",2005.0,63.0,67.0,"{'volume': '36', 'pages': '313 - 323', 'name': 'Psychological Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Naismith2005ImpairedIS,\n author = {S.

Thus higher cognitive levels of perception and behaviour improve simulation quality. Furthermore, giving an agent the possibility to choose the nature of its interactions with the others can not only improve simulation realism but also bring heterogeneity in the simulated population because each agent individually perceives the situation according to its own characteristics. In this paper, we aim at providing the pedestrian agent the ability to obtain an individual representation of the environment that allows him to adapt its behaviour according to the situation. We base our work on the analysis and interpretation of the environment, which makes the agent decide the behaviour it is going to adopt. We focus on two kinds of behaviours, following and group avoidance behaviours, and on their integration in classical avoidance simulations. We integrate recent works about following behaviour and propose to model interactions directly with groups of people instead of individuals. We aim at providing perception rules totally independent from the collision avoidance model used in the simulation. Because of the improved perception process, we observe emerging speed waves, group behaviours and lane formation in our simulations. Our results demonstrate the interest of modelling such behaviours to obtain more realistic simulations and show that specific patterns and collective behaviours emerge when using several types of behaviours in simulations.

However, the state variables of practical system do not necessarily have a cascaded integral relationship. Therefore, this paper proposes an algebraic substitution method and its structure, which can convert a noncascaded integral system of PID control into a cascaded integral form. The adjusting parameters of the ADRC controller are also demonstrated. Meanwhile, a numerical example and the oscillation control of a flexible arm are demonstrated to show the conversion, controller design, and control effect. The converted system is proved to be more suitable for a direct ADRC control. In addition, for the numerical example, its control effect for the converted system is compared with a PID controller under different disturbances. The result shows that the converted system can achieve a better control effect under the ADRC than that of a PID. The theory is a guide before practice. This converting method not only solves the ADRC control problem of some noncascaded integral systems in theory and simulation but also expands the application scope of the ADRC method.",2018.0,32.0,92.0,{'name': 'Mathematical Problems in Engineering'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Huang2018AnAM,\n author = {Zhijian Huang and Yudong Li and Yihua Liu and Wenbo Sui and Gui-chen Zhang},\n journal = {Mathematical Problems in Engineering},\n title = {An ADRC Method for Noncascaded Integral Systems Based on Algebraic Substitution Method and Its Structure},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '144829273', 'name': 'Zhijian Huang'}, {'authorId': '2111162773', 'name': 'Yudong Li'}, {'authorId': '2015975461', 'name': 'Yihua Liu'}, {'authorId': '153799202', 'name': 'Wenbo Sui'}, {'authorId': '3214953', 'name': 'Gui-chen Zhang'}]"

These emotions and behaviors that disturb the organization of a crowd are of concern in our study, and we attempt to predict these suspicious circumstances and provide help in making the right decisions at the right time. Furthermore, most of the models that address crowd disasters belong to the physical or the cognitive approaches. They study pedestrian flow and collision avoidance, etc., and they use walking speed and angle of vision. However, in this work, based on a behavioral rules approach, we aim to model emergent emotion, behavior and influence in a crowd, taking into account particularly the personality of members of the crowd. For this purpose, we have combined the OCEAN (Openness, Consciousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) personality model with the OCC (Ortony, Clore, and Collins) emotional model to indicate the susceptibility of each of the five personality factors to feeling every emotion. Then we proposed an approach that uses first fuzzy logic for the emotional modeling of critical emotions of members of the crowd at the announcement or the presence of unusual events, in order to quantify emotions. Then, we model the behavior and the tendency towards actions using probability theory. Finally, the influence among the members of the crowd is modeled using the neighborhood principle and cellular automata.",2016.0,26.0,16.0,"{'volume': '24', 'pages': '428 - 445', 'name': 'Adaptive Behavior'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Saifi2016AnAF,\n author = {Lynda Saifi and Abdelhak Boubetra and Farid Nouioua},\n journal = {Adaptive Behavior},\n pages = {428 - 445},\n title = {An approach for emotions and behavior modeling in a crowd in the presence of rare events},\n volume = {24},\n year = {2016}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '7619490', 'name': 'Lynda Saifi'}, {'authorId': '1967138', 'name': 'Abdelhak Boubetra'}, {'authorId': '1783796', 'name': 'Farid Nouioua'}]"

In this paper, we review a large literature on emotion–cognition interactions in psychology, neuroscience, and computational modeling. Then, we introduce eMODUL, which consolidates this literature into a conceptual model. In particular, this model stresses the importance of emotional modulations and the roles they play with respect to the system autonomy depending on the targeted computational/cognitive processes (e.g., allocation of resources, organization of behavior). To illustrate these aspects and support our theoretical model, we review two robotic experiments where eMODUL is instantiated. The results demonstrate the interest of our approach for the development of interaction/communication and autonomy/adaptation capabilities in cognitive robots. In terms of natural cognition understanding they give additional insights into the emergence of emotion, the construction of multilevel appraisal, and the link between emotion and cognition in task-related emotions.",2019.0,57.0,12.0,"{'volume': '49', 'pages': '206-215', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Belkaid2019AutonomousCR,\n author = {Marwen Belkaid and N.

This study of 684 Chinese resident respondents elicited how COVID-19 risk messages affected post-pandemic travel intentions. The results showed that people exposed to messages in the risk-amplifying frame had lower basic travel and destination travel intentions than those who were exposed to messages in the risk- attenuating frame. Empathy had a beneficial effect on basic travel intentions and had an inducing effect on destination travel intentions only in high-risk situations. High PWT tourists had more positive destination travel intentions in the risk-attenuating frame. The findings provide a theoretical basis for future research as well as practical implications for destination risk communications and market restoration during a public health crisis.,2021.0,87.0,40.0,"{'volume': '24', 'pages': '3387 - 3406', 'name': 'Current Issues in Tourism'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Xie2021TheEO,\n author = {Chaowu Xie and Jiangchi Zhang and A.

1591,7c15b80211d1382ee59adaceb26c16723e2b9017,TOWARD A BIFURCATED THEORY OF EMOTIONAL DETERRENCE,"Since Hobbes (1957 [1651] and Beccaria (1963 [1764]), scholars have theorized that the emotion of fear is critical for deterrence. Nevertheless, contemporary deterrence researchers have mostly overlooked the distinction between perceived sanction risk and fear of apprehension. Whereas perceived risk is a cognitive judgment, fear involves visceral feelings of anxiety or dread. Equally important, a theory explicating the influence of deterrence on both criminal propensity and situational offending has remained elusive. We develop a theoretical model in which perceived risk and fear are distinguished at both the general and situational levels. We test this theoretical model with data from a set of survey-based experiments conducted in 2016 with a nationwide sample of adults (N = 965). We find that perceived risk and fear are empirically distinct and that perceived risk is positively related to fear at both the general and situational levels. Certain background and situational factors have indirect effects through perceived risk on fear.

A robust emotion recognition system should be able to compensate for these differences across speakers. A natural approach is to normalize the features before training the classifiers. However, the normalization scheme should not affect the acoustic differences between emotional classes. This study presents the iterative feature normalization (IFN) framework, which is an unsupervised front-end, especially designed for emotion detection. The IFN approach aims to reduce the acoustic differences, between the neutral speech across speakers, while preserving the inter-emotional variability in expressive speech. This goal is achieved by iteratively detecting neutral speech for each speaker, and using this subset to estimate the feature normalization parameters. Then, an affine transformation is applied to both neutral and emotional speech. This process is repeated till the results from the emotion detection system are consistent between consecutive iterations. The IFN approach is exhaustively evaluated using the IEMOCAP database and a data set obtained under free uncontrolled recording conditions with different evaluation configurations. The results show that the systems trained with the IFN approach achieve better performance than systems trained either without normalization or with global normalization.",2013.0,48.0,59.0,"{'volume': '4', 'pages': '386-397', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Busso2013IterativeFN,\n author = {C.

We analyse four cases of parent–child digital co-play on Let’s Play gaming videos with Roblox on YouTube. Our research method adopts a netnography research approach and multimodal discourse analysis to examine the data. We identify three ways of digital co-play, which include the parent-directed, parent–child negotiated, and child-directed parent–child interaction styles from the analysis of the videos. Following the analysis, we discuss how each of the ways of parent–child digital co-play can be productive in helping the child learn through shared gameplay with parents. We suggest how children can learn through communicating with parents during gameplay, creating something by themselves in the game, modelling parents’ in-game behaviour, teaching their parents by sharing their knowledge, and leading the co-play. Our study aims to serve as a conversational starter to contribute to the global discourse on the phenomenon of parent and child shared interactions with digital technology as well as the ways in which learning can be facilitated through such experiences.",2021.0,57.0,9.0,"{'volume': '31', 'pages': '4072 - 4082', 'name': 'Interactive Learning Environments'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Toh2021LetsPT,\n author = {Weimin Toh and Fei Victor Lim},\n journal = {Interactive Learning Environments},\n pages = {4072 - 4082},\n title = {Let’s play together: ways of parent–child digital co-play for learning},\n volume = {31},\n year = {2021}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '3443969', 'name': 'Weimin Toh'}, {'authorId': '37679213', 'name': 'Fei Victor Lim'}]"

The model is based on a simple weight-driven dynamics and a weights' reinforcement mechanism coupled to the local network growth. That coupling can be generalized in order to include the effect of additional randomness and nonlinearities which can be present in real-world networks. The model generates weighted graphs exhibiting the statistical properties observed in several real-world systems. In particular, the model yields a nontrivial time evolution of vertices' properties and scale-free behavior with exponents depending on the microscopic parameters characterizing the coupling rules. Very interestingly, the generated graphs spontaneously achieve a complex hierarchical architecture characterized by clustering and connectivity correlations varying as a function of the vertices' degree.",2004.0,44.0,286.0,"{'volume': '70 6 Pt 2', 'pages': '\n          066149\n        ', 'name': 'Physical review.

Emotional labor is characterized as involving a discrepancy monitoring and reduction process, whereby perceptions of emotional displays and emotional display rules are continuously compared. If a discrepancy between emotional displays and display rules is detected, individuals are proposed to use emotion regulation strategies to reduce the discrepancy. The goal hierarchy aspect of control theory is used to describe emotional labor in the broader context of job performance and explain how positive and negative outcomes can result from the emotional labor process.

Although the mechanisms underlying mimicry are not fully understood, there is growing awareness that it is more than a one-to-one motor matching of others’ expressions and may be the result of neural simulation. If true, it is possible that mimicry could extend to other parts of the body, even in the absence of visual information from that body part. Indeed, we found that passively viewing anger and fear expressions, without accompanying information from the body, voice or other channels, produced both facial mimicry and corresponding responses in arm muscles that make a fist or a defensive posture. This suggests that observers simulated observed expressions and that activity may have spilled over to other areas to create a body response.",2018.0,52.0,18.0,"{'volume': '9', 'pages': '844 - 852', 'name': 'Social Psychological and Personality Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Moody2018EmotionalMB,\n author = {E.

This meta-analysis systematically evaluated two IGRAs (ELISA and ELISPOT) and the tuberculin skin test (TST). We searched databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Ovid) between January 2000 and January 2011 using search terms of latent tuberculosis infection or tuberculosis and interferon gamma release assay, or T-SPOT.TB test, or QuantiFERON-TB Gold, or ESAT-6, or CFP-10, and child, or childhood, or pediatrics. We also collected data by performing a manual search of references from relevant articles and communicating with selected authors. The meta-analysis was conducted with random effects models to account for heterogeneity between selected studies. The sensitivities of all three tests in active tuberculosis were similar. The pooled sensitivity was 70% for ELISA studies, 62% for ELISPOT studies and 71% for TST. Calculated sensitivities for IGRAs and the TST differ in culture-confirmed tuberculosis [ELISA (85%) vs. ELISPOT (76%) vs. TST (85%)] and clinical diagnosed cases [ELISA (64%) vs. ELISPOT (58%) vs. TST (66%)]. The pooled specificity was 100% for ELISA and 90% for ELISPOT, but was much lower for TST [56% in all included studies and 49% in children with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination]. The agreement between the TST and IGRAs in non-BCG-vaccinated children is higher than that in BCG-vaccinated children. In the diagnosis of active tuberculosis in children, the TST and IGRAs have similar sensitivity. By contrast, the specificity of IGRAs is far greater than the TST, particularly in children with previous BCG vaccination.",2011.0,27.0,72.0,"{'volume': '63 2', 'pages': '\n          165-73\n        ', 'name': 'FEMS immunology and medical microbiology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sun2011InterferonGR,\n author = {Lin Sun and Jing Xiao and Q.

Under the “computers as social actors” paradigm, people treat robots in similar ways as they treat other humans. We argue that robots’ differences from humans lead them to be regarded as members of a potentially competing outgroup. Based on this conceptual parallel, our studies examine four related areas: people’s reactions to multiple (as opposed to single) robots; characteristics of robot groups (such as synchrony) that may influence people’s responses; tests of interventions that have been demonstrated to reduce prejudice in humans; and tests of other theoretical predictions drawn from work on human intergroup behavior. Several of these studies examined cultural differences between the U.S. and Japan. We offer brief descriptions and citations of 10 previously published studies (total N = 1635), as well as 12 unpublished studies (total N = 1692) that produced null or inconsistent results – to make them part of the scientific record and potentially inspire related investigations by others.

The task of empathetic dialogue generation is proposed to address this problem. However, lacking external knowledge makes it difficult to perceive implicit emotions from limited dialogue history. To address the above challenges, we propose to leverage multi-type knowledge, i.e, the commonsense knowledge and emotional lexicon, to explicitly understand and express emotions in empathetic dialogue generation. We first enrich the dialogue history by jointly interacting with two-type knowledge and construct an emotional context graph. Then we introduce a multi-type knowledge-aware context encoder to learn emotional context representations and distill emotional signals, which are the prerequisites to predicate emotions expressed in responses. Finally, we propose an emotional cross-attention mechanism to exploit the emotional dependencies between the emotional context graph and the target empathetic response. Conducted on a benchmark dataset, extensive experimental results show that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of automatic metrics and human evaluations.",2020.0,55.0,15.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': 'arXiv: Computation and Language'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Li2020TowardsED,\n author = {Qintong Li and Piji Li and Zhumin Chen and Z.

By applying a combination of psychological and geometrical rules with a social and physical forces model, HiDAC exhibits a wide variety of emergent behaviors from agent line formation to pushing behavior and its consequences; relative to the current situation, personalities of the individuals and perceived social density.",2007.0,35.0,583.0,{'pages': '99-108'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Metaxas2007ControllingIA,\n author = {Dimitris N.

In either real or virtual social interactions, interactants try to maintain their personal space (PS), an ubiquitous, situative, flexible safety zone. Building upon larger PS preferences to humans and VAs with angry facial expressions, we extend the investigations to whole-body emotional expressions. In two immersive settings-HMD and CAVE-66 males were approached by an either happy, angry, or neutral male VA. Subjects preferred a larger PS to the angry VA when being able to stop him at their convenience (Sample task), replicating previous findings, and when being able to actively avoid him (Pass By task).

A sample of 100 adults was videotaped while entering and walking through a room, sitting down, looking into the camera, and reading a standard text. The targets then provided self-descriptions on 5 personality factors. A sample of 24 strangers who had never seen the targets before was given 1 of 4 types of information on the targets: (a) sound-film, (b) silent film, (c) still, or (d) audiotape. Strangers rated various physical attributes and 20 traits of each target. Level of information influenced the validity but not the reliability of the stranger ratings, which were most valid for extraversion and conscientiousness. Extraversion covaried most strongly with physical attributes, and implicit theories on the covariation of traits with physical attributes were more accurate for extraversion and conscientiousness than for agreeableness, emotional stability, and culture. If judges indicate their impressions of other people, their judgments usually correlate with the self-reports of the ratees. Moreover, the correlations between self-ratings and ratings by judges tend to be higher the more the judges know about the targets (Cloyd, 1977; Funder & Colvin, 1988; Norman & Goldberg, 1966; Paunonen, 1989). The highest correlations are usually found between self-reports and ratings by spouses. McCrae and Costa (1989) report correlations between self-ratings and spouse ratings from .53 to .60, whereas they report somewhat lower correlations, ranging from .32 to .54, between self-reports and ratings by a single peer. These findings indicate that (a) personality ratings reflect actual attributes of the target persons rather than illusions that exist only in the eye of the beholder, and (b) self-ratings and ratings by others agree more the more that both reflect shared information concerning the targets' personality. Consensus at Zero Acquaintance This raises the question of how much information is required in order that ratings by others possess some validity. We use the term valid to indicate that ratings by strangers or acquaintances correlate substantially with the targets' self-reports. At first glance, this is a curious usage of the idea of validity because self-reports are usually more suspect than observer ratings and are therefore frequently validated against observer ratings. But we have a special case here: Because the observers are strangers, the self-ratings are the more dependable measure of the actual personality of the ratees.",1992.0,38.0,566.0,"{'volume': '62', 'pages': '645-657', 'name': 'Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Borkenau1992TraitIS,\n author = {P.

A theory called the 'Uncanny Valley' has been used to describe the phenomenon that the appearance of a virtual character can contribute to negative/positive audience reactions to that character [Mori 1970]. Since the style used to render a character strongly changes the appearance, we investigate whether a difference in render style can indirectly influence audience reaction, which we measure based on perception of personality. Based on psychology research, we first scripted original character dialogues in order to convey a range of ten typical personality types. Then, a professional actor was recruited to act out these dialogues, while his face and body motion and audio were recorded. The performances were mapped onto a virtual character rendered in two styles that differ in appearance: an appealing cartoon style and unappealing ill style (Figure 1). In our experiment, participants were asked questions about the character's personality in order for us to test if the difference in render style causes differences in personality perception. Our results found an indirect effect of render style where the cartoon style was rated as having a more agreeable personality than the ill style. This result has implications for developers interested in creating appealing virtual humans, avoiding the 'Uncanny Valley' phenomenon.",2014.0,26.0,38.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Applied Perception'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Zibrek2014DoesRS,\n author = {Katja Zibrek and R.

Then, we propose virtual reality (VR) as the appropriate medium to encompass all the requirements mentioned above. VR is arguably one of the most suitable technologies for neurorehabilitation able to integrate evidence-based neurorehabilitation techniques and neuroscience principles into motivating training approaches that promote self-management by empowering patients to own their recovery process. We discuss the advantages and challenges of such an approach on several exemplary applications and outline directions for future developments.

Most theories assume, at least implicitly, that the new attitude replaces the former one. The authors argue that a new attitude can override, but not replace, the old one, resulting in dual attitudes. Dual attitudes are defined as different evaluations of the same attitude object: an automatic, implicit attitude and an explicit attitude. The attitude that people endorse depends on whether they have the cognitive capacity to retrieve the explicit attitude and whether this overrides their implicit attitude. A number of literatures consistent with these hypotheses are reviewed, and the implications of the dual-attitude model for attitude theory and measurement are discussed. For example, by including only explicit measures, previous studies may have exaggerated the ease with which people change their attitudes. Even if an explicit attitude changes, an implicit attitude can remain the same.",2000.0,228.0,2045.0,"{'volume': '107 1', 'pages': '\n          101-26\n        ', 'name': 'Psychological review'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wilson2000AMO,\n author = {T.

In the virtual environment provided by the platform, the adult-self of the user learns to create and strengthen an affectional and supportive bond with the inner-child.

Affect labeling (labeling emotional experience) attenuates emotional responding. The current project examined whether affect labeling enhances exposure effectiveness in participants with public speaking anxiety. Participants were randomized to exposure with or without affect labeling. Physiological arousal and self-reported fear were assessed before and after exposure and compared between groups.

No effect was found for self-report measures. eScholarship provides open access, scholarly publishing services to the University of California and delivers a dynamic research platform to scholars worldwide. Also, greater emotion regulation deficits at baseline predicted more benefit in physiological arousal from exposure combined with affect labeling than exposure alone. The current research provides evidence that behavioral strategies that target prefrontal-amygdala circuitry can improve treatment effectiveness for anxiety and these effects are particularly pronounced for patients with the greatest deficits in emotion regulation. a b s t r a c t Exposure is an effective treatment for anxiety but many patients do not respond fully.

Hence, communities around the world will need to rely on factors that can promote Social Sustainability. Our work envisages three essential concepts to leverage social development: Empathy, Emotions, and Social Sustainability. It emerges from the hypothesis that the behavior of the Emotional Contagion phenomenon can be modeled similarly to disease proliferation, considering Empathy as its main factor. We propose a social simulation model for emotional contagion, considering that the probability of one adopting others’ emotions can derive from the empathy level of the individual, which is obtained through the Empathy Quotient score. The population sample of virtual agents is randomly generated following a normal distribution, which can be formed either by individuals without empathy limitations, or by Asperger Syndrome or High-Functioning Autism patients. The results from our experiments showed that the analogy between Emotional Contagion and disease proliferation fits in our empirical predictions suggesting that Empathy can be correlated to metrics such as the disease spread contact rate.

Public-speaking anxiety (PSA) is an anxiety-provoking social situation that is characterized by fear of negative evaluation from an audience. This pilot study aimed to determine whether self-guided VRET (1) increases exposure to PSA-specific virtual social threats, and (2) reduces anxiety, arousal, heartrate and PSA over repeated exposure. Methods: Thirty-two University students (27 completers) with high self-reported public-speaking anxiety attended 2 weekly self-guided VRET sessions. Each session involved the participant delivering a 20-min speech in a virtual classroom. Participants were able to increase their exposure to virtual social threat through the audience size, audience reaction, number of speech prompts, and their own salience in the virtual classroom at 4-min intervals. Participants' heartrates and self-reported anxiety and arousal were monitored during these intervals. Participants completed psychometric assessments after each session and 1 month later. Results: Participants increased their exposure to virtual social threat during each VRET session, which coincided with a reduction in heartrate and self-reported anxiety and arousal. Improvement in PSA occurred post-treatment and 1 month later. The in-session improvement in anxiety correlated with reductions in fear of negative evaluation post-treatment and 1 month later. Conclusions: Increased self-exposure to virtual social threat from self-guided VRET relieves anxiety and shows immediate reductions in subjective and physiological arousal during application, but also yields sustained improvement in PSA.",2021.0,93.0,12.0,"{'volume': '12', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Premkumar2021TheEO,\n author = {P.

Are these signals reliant on culturally learned cues or are they intelligible across individuals lacking exposure to a common culture? To find out, we traveled to a remote Kreung village in Ratanakiri, Cambodia. First, we recorded Kreung portrayals of 5 emotions through bodily movement. These videos were later shown to American participants, who matched the videos with appropriate emotional labels with above chance accuracy (Study 1). The Kreung also viewed Western point-light displays of emotions. After each display, they were asked to either freely describe what was being expressed (Study 2) or choose from 5 predetermined response options (Study 3). Across these studies, Kreung participants recognized Western point-light displays of anger, fear, happiness, sadness, and pride with above chance accuracy. Kreung raters were not above chance in deciphering an American point-light display depicting love, suggesting that recognizing love may rely, at least in part, on culturally specific cues or modalities other than bodily movement. In addition, multidimensional scaling of the patterns of nonverbal behavior associated with each emotion in each culture suggested that similar patterns of nonverbal behavior are used to convey the same emotions across cultures. The considerable cross-cultural intelligibility observed across these studies suggests that the communication of emotion through movement is largely shaped by aspects of physiology and the environment shared by all humans, irrespective of differences in cultural context.",2017.0,65.0,26.0,"{'volume': '17', 'pages': '459–477', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Parkinson2017EmotionsAU,\n author = {Carolyn Parkinson and Trent Walker and Sarah Memmi and T.

1630,7f6aee02aecbce0fdd34fb88b6271061a1e02584,Simulation of pedestrian crowds in normal and evacuation situations,"Starting with a short review of the available literature in the field of pedestrian and evacuation research, an overview is given over the observed collective phenomena in pedestrian crowds. This includes lane formation in corridors and oscillations at bottlenecks in normal situations, while different kinds of blocked states are produced in panic situations. By means of molecular-dynamic-like microsimulations based on a generalized force model of interactive pedestrian dynamics, the spatio-temporal patterns in pedestrian crowds are successfully reproduced and interpreted as self-organized phenomena. In contrast to previous socio-psychological approaches, this allows a physical understanding of the observations. Despite the significantly different phenomena occuring in normal and panic situations, the main effects can be described by a unified model containing only well interpretable and plausible terms. The transition between the “rational” normal behavior and the apparently “irrational” panic behavior is controlled by a single parameter, the “nervousness”, which influences fluctuation strengths, desired speeds, and the tendency of herding.

We present the results of four case studies conducted to develop m-learning applications in which the proposed mLUX framework was applied. The main goal of the proposed mLUX framework is to ensure that the stakeholders, especially students, recognize that m-learning applications are learning media that fulfill their essential educational requirements. We begin by reviewing the literature on the contributions to mobile learning usability made in various conferences and journals from 2002 to 2010. This review helped identify and recognize the methodology used to develop mobile learning applications during this period. Based on the literature review, as the empirical case studies, four m-learning applications are examined to demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework for the development of m-learning applications. We apply three distinct measurement criteria to assess the performances of the mLUX framework. This paper also argues that emotional factors, such as the user’s enjoyment, adjustability, and reliability, are significant design issues in m-learning.",2015.0,54.0,37.0,"{'volume': '9', 'pages': '37-51', 'name': 'Int.

However, the opposite finding has also been documented. The present study investigated the ASE in the visual periphery with a visual crowding task. In the study, the target face either appeared alone (uncrowded condition) or was crowded by four neutral or emotional faces (crowded condition). Participants were instructed to determine whether the target face was happy or angry. Experiment 1 showed an ASE when crowded by neutral faces. Intriguingly, this superiority vanished when the target face was crowded by emotional faces that had a different expression from the target as well as when the target face was presented alone. Experiment 2 replicated this result in an independent sample of East Asians (vs. Caucasians in Experiment 1) and thus demonstrated the robustness and cross-cultural consistency of our findings. Together, these results suggest that the ASE in the visual periphery is contingent on task demands induced by visual crowding.",2020.0,62.0,8.0,"{'volume': '35', 'pages': '214 - 224', 'name': 'Cognition and Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gong2020TheAS,\n author = {Mingliang Gong and L.

1634,7f8baa24bdbefb0c5b1a0a98a52fa34defad8258,A Theory of Social Comparison Processes,"Hypothesis I: There exists, in the human organism, a drive to evaluate his opinions and his abilities. While opinions and abilities may, at first glance, seem to be quite different things, there is a close functional tie between them. They act together in the manner in which they affect behavior. A person’s cognition (his opinions and beliefs) about the situation in which he exists and his appraisals of what he is capable of doing (his evaluation of his abilities) will together have bearing on his behavior. The holding of incorrect opinions and/or inaccurate appraisals of one’s abilities can be punishing or even fatal in many situations. It is necessary, before we proceed, to clarify the distinction between opinions and evaluations of abilities since at first glance it may seem that one’s evaluation of one’s own ability is an opinion about it. Abilities are of course manifested only through performance which is assumed to depend upon the particular ability. The clarity of the manifestation or performance can vary from instances where there is no clear ordering criterion of the ability to instances where the performance which reflects the ability can be clearly ordered. In the former case, the evaluation of the ability does function like other opinions which are not directly testable in “objective reality’. For example, a person’s evaluation of his ability to write poetry will depend to a large extent on the opinions which others have of his ability to write poetry. In cases where the criterion is unambiguous and can be clearly ordered, this furnishes an objective reality for the evaluation of one’s ability so that it depends less on the opinions of other persons and depends more on actual comparison of one’s performance with the performance of others. Thus, if a person evaluates his running ability, he will do so by comparing his time to run some distance with the times that other persons have taken. In the following pages, when we talk about evaluating an ability, we shall mean specifically the evaluation of that ability in situations where the performance is unambiguous and is known. Most situations in real life will, of course, present situations which are a mixture of opinion and ability evaluation. In a previous article (7) the author posited the existence of a drive to determine whether or not one’s opinions were “correct”. We are here stating that this same drive also produces behavior in people oriented toward obtaining an accurate appraisal of their abilities. The behavioral implication of the existence of such a drive is that we would expect to observe behaviour on the part of persons which enables them to ascertain whether or not their opinions are correct and also behavior which enables them accurately to evaluate their abilities. It is consequently",1954.0,30.0,17221.0,"{'volume': '7', 'pages': '117 - 140', 'name': 'Human Relations'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Festinger1954ATO,\n author = {L.

1637,801257f13663c493851d55366b431fad0cc801a9,A contribution to the mathematical theory of epidemics,"(1) One of the most striking features in the study of epidemics is the difficulty of finding a causal factor which appears to be adequate to account for the magnitude of the frequent epidemics of disease which visit almost every population. It was with a view to obtaining more insight regarding the effects of the various factors which govern the spread of contagious epidemics that the present investigation was undertaken. Reference may here be made to the work of Ross and Hudson (1915-17) in which the same problem is attacked. The problem is here carried to a further stage, and it is considered from a point of view which is in one sense more general. The problem may be summarised as follows: One (or more) infected person is introduced into a community of individuals, more or less susceptible to the disease in question. The disease spreads from the affected to the unaffected by contact infection. Each infected person runs through the course of his sickness, and finally is removed from the number of those who are sick, by recovery or by death. The chances of recovery or death vary from day to day during the course of his illness. The chances that the affected may convey infection to the unaffected are likewise dependent upon the stage of the sickness. As the epidemic spreads, the number of unaffected members of the community becomes reduced. Since the course of an epidemic is short compared with the life of an individual, the population may be considered as remaining constant, except in as far as it is modified by deaths due to the epidemic disease itself. In the course of time the epidemic may come to an end. One of the most important probems in epidemiology is to ascertain whether this termination occurs only when no susceptible individuals are left, or whether the interplay of the various factors of infectivity, recovery and mortality, may result in termination, whilst many susceptible individuals are still present in the unaffected population. It is difficult to treat this problem in its most general aspect. In the present communication discussion will be limited to the case in which all members of the community are initially equally susceptible to the disease, and it will be further assumed that complete immunity is conferred by a single infection.",1927.0,2.0,9875.0,"{'volume': '115', 'pages': '700-721', 'name': 'Proceedings of The Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kermack1927ACT,\n author = {W.

1643,805e06976b42bc202a733896616fab182a73b225,Vestibulo-ocular reflex.,"The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) ensures best vision during head motion by moving the eyes contrary to the head to stabilize the line of sight in space. The VOR has three main components: the peripheral sensory apparatus (a set of motion sensors: the semicircular canals, SCCs, and the otolith organs), a central processing mechanism, and the motor output (the eye muscles). The SCCs sense angular acceleration to detect head rotation; the otolith organs sense linear acceleration to detect both head translation and the position of the head relative to gravity. The SCCs are arranged in a push-pull configuration with two coplanar canals on each side (like the left and right horizontal canals) working together. During angular head movements, if one part is excited the other is inhibited and vice versa. While the head is at rest, the primary vestibular afferents have a tonic discharge which is exactly balanced between corresponding canals. During rotation, the head velocity corresponds to the difference in the firing rate between SCC pairs. Knowledge of the geometrical arrangement of the SCCs within the head and of the functional properties of the otolith organs allows to localize and interpret certain patterns of nystagmus and ocular misalignment. This is based on the experimental observation that stimulation of a single SCC leads v ia the VOR to slowphase eye movements that rotate the globe in a plane parallel to that of the stimulated canal. Furthermore, knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie compensation for vestibular disorders is essential for correctly diagnosing and effectively managing patients with vestibular disturbances.",2007.0,39.0,110.0,"{'volume': '40', 'pages': '\n          35-51\n        ', 'name': 'Developments in ophthalmology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fetter2007VestibuloocularR,\n author = {M.

However, commonly used experimental manipulations tend to have collateral effects on emotions other than the targeted emotion, making it difficult to ascribe outcomes to any single emotion. In this letter, we propose to address this problem using causal mediation analysis. We illustrate this approach using an experiment examining the effect of emotion on dyadic trust, as measured by the trust game. Our findings suggest that negative emotions can decrease trust, but only if those negative emotions make people feel less certain about their current situation. Our results suggest that only anxiety, a low-certainty emotion, has a negative impact on trust, whereas anger and guilt, two emotions that differ in their control appraisals but induce the same high level of certainty, appear to have no effect on trusting behavior. Importantly, we find that failing to use causal mediation analysis would ascribe a positive effect of anxiety on trust, demonstrating the value of this approach.",2016.0,74.0,66.0,"{'volume': '24', 'pages': '492 - 500', 'name': 'Political Analysis'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Myers2016TheIO,\n author = {C.

Yet, their systematic experimental study remains a challenging open problem due to ethical and methodological constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate the viability of shared three-dimensional virtual environments as an experimental platform for conducting crowd experiments with real people. In particular, we show that crowds of real human subjects moving and interacting in an immersive three-dimensional virtual environment exhibit typical patterns of real crowds as observed in real-life crowded situations. These include the manifestation of social conventions and the emergence of self-organized patterns during egress scenarios. High-stress evacuation experiments conducted in this virtual environment reveal movements characterized by mass herding and dangerous overcrowding as they occur in crowd disasters. We describe the behavioural mechanisms at play under such extreme conditions and identify critical zones where overcrowding may occur. Furthermore, we show that herding spontaneously emerges from a density effect without the need to assume an increase of the individual tendency to imitate peers.

Consistent with emotional contagion, participants felt sadder when viewing a sad-faced victim, and their own sadness mediated the effect of emotion expression on sympathy.

This article reports the results from a study conducted in nine countries in Europe, the United States, and Asia on vocal emotion portrayals of anger, sadness, fear, joy, and neutral voice as produced by professional German actors. Data show an overall accuracy of 66% across all emotions and countries. Although accuracy was substantially better than chance, there were sizable differences ranging from 74% in Germany to 52% in Indonesia.

However, little attention has been paid to the user interactions with conversational agents in the multi-device collaboration context (MDCC), where a multiple number of devices are connected to accomplish a common mission. The objective of this study is to identify the roles of conversational agents in the MDCC. Toward this goal, we conducted semi-structured interviews with nine participants who are heavy users of smart speakers connected with home IoT devices. We collected 107 rules (usage instances) and asked benefits and limitations of using those rules. Our thematic analysis has found that, while the smart speakers perform the role of voice controller in the single device context, their role extended to automation hub, reporter, and companion in the MDCC.

The 17-item Emotional Expressivity Scale (EES) was designed as a self-report measure of the extent to which people outwardly display their emotions. Reliability studies showed the EES to be an internally consistent and stable individual-difference measure. Validational studies established initial convergent and discriminant validities, a moderate relationship between self-rated and other-rated expression, and correspondence between self-report and laboratory-measured expressiveness using both college student and community populations. The potential for the EES to promote and integrate findings across diverse areas of research is discussed.",1994.0,91.0,496.0,"{'volume': '66 5', 'pages': '\n          934-49\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kring1994IndividualDI,\n author = {A.

One approach is the use of other reports wherein knowledgeable informants indicate how well the scale items describe the assessed person’s behavior. In other reports, the same EI scales are typically used as in self-reports. However, it is not known whether the measurement structure underlying EI ratings is equivalent across self and other ratings. In this study, the measurement equivalence of an extant EI measure (Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale [WLEIS]) across self and other ratings was tested. Using multiple group confirmatory factor analysis, the authors conducted a sequence of increasingly more restrictive tests of equivalence across self and other ratings. The WLEIS was found to be configurally and metrically invariant across self and other ratings. However, there was no evidence for structural invariance between rater groups.

Following this insight, the paper describes an approach to learn how to use color to influence the perception of emotions in virtual humans. First, a model of lighting and filters inspired on the visual arts is integrated with a virtual human platform to manipulate color. Next, an evolutionary model, based on genetic algorithms, is created to evolve mappings between emotions and lighting and filter parameters. A first study is, then, conducted where subjects evolve mappings for joy and sadness without being aware of the evolutionary model. In a second study, the features which characterize the mappings are analyzed. Results show that virtual human images of joy tend to be brighter, more saturated and have more colors than images of sadness.

On this basis, we propose a network to capture states of personal distress and (weak and strong forms of) empathic concern, which are particularly relevant for psychotherapists conducting attachment-based interventions. This model is then extended for the case of self-attachment therapy, in which conceptualized components of the self serve as both the source of and target for empathic resonance. In particular, we consider how states of empathic concern involving an other that is perceived as being closely related to the self might enhance the motivation for self-directed bonding (which in turn is proposed to lead the individual toward more compassionate states) in terms of medial prefrontal cortex–mediated activation of these caregiving pathways.

Our results indicate that Facebook use predicts negative shifts on both of these variables over time. The more people used Facebook at one time point, the worse they felt the next time we text-messaged them; the more they used Facebook over two-weeks, the more their life satisfaction levels declined over time.

Methods: The literature search was conducted in the Medline, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases. Main criteria for selection were that the participants were adult persons with TBI, social cognition as well as social behaviour or social outcome post-TBI was assessed and correlations between social cognition and social behaviour or outcome were reported. Average correlations were calculated based on weighted summation of the correlations from the individual studies. Results: Of the 511 publications identified in the search, 13 were selected. Ten of these assessed emotion recognition, six assessed understanding of intentions and two assessed empathy. Average correlations between social cognition performance and post-injury social behaviour or outcome were significant for each of the three social cognition functions; poorer performance was associated with poorer outcome. Effect sizes varied from small to moderate (understanding intentions) to moderate (emotion recognition) to large (empathy).

The epidemic threshold is a fundamental metric for the epidemic process to determine the condition when an epidemic can either survive or die out in a network. The previous works have been focused on finding the epidemic threshold when both infection rates and recovery rates are homogeneous or studying the transient behavior of an epidemic when the infection rates are heterogeneous. In this work, we explore the effect of the heterogeneity in both infection rates and recovery rates on the epidemic threshold through both analysis and simulations. We discover that heterogeneous infection rates and heterogeneous recovery rates have the opposite impact on the epidemic threshold. Specifically, the heterogeneity in infection rates leads to a larger epidemic threshold than in the homogeneous case. Moreover, as the degree of the heterogeneity of infection rates gets higher, the epidemic threshold increases.

Emotion and emotion-related concepts are interspersed throughout theories of charismatic and transformational leadership. Existing research in this area articulates expected relationships of global emotion constructs such as emotional intelligence, positive affect, and negative affect to leadership. However, there has been little attention to the potential roles of more specific emotions. This chapter describes some of the existing theoretical and empirical research on leadership and emotion, and proposes a framework to examine more systematically how specific emotions may influence transformational and charismatic leadership. The emotion framework is applied to two theories to demonstrate its utility in gaining a more in-depth understanding of how emotions influence leader communication, motivation, interpersonal relations, and relationship management with followers.",2013.0,45.0,31.0,"{'volume': '5', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Connelly2013ACL,\n author = {S.

This study aimed to establish if detection of autism was possible at 18 months of age. We screened 41 18–month-old toddlers who were at high genetic risk for developing autism, and 50 randomly selected 18–month-olds, using a new instrument, the CHAT, administered by GPs or health visitors. More than 80% of the randomly selected 18–month-old toddlers passed on all items, and none failed on more than one of pretend play, protodeclarative pointing, joint-attention, social interest, and social play. Four children in the high-risk group failed on two or more of these five key types of behaviour. At follow-up at 30 months of age, the 87 children who had passed four or more of these key types of behaviour at 18 months of age had continued to develop normally. The four toddlers who had failed on two or more of these key types of behaviour at 18 months received a diagnosis of autism by 30 months.",1992.0,12.0,865.0,"{'volume': '161', 'pages': '839 - 843', 'name': 'British Journal of Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Baron-Cohen1992CanAB,\n author = {S.

To address this issue, we focused on one strategy, reappraisal, which involves cognitively reframing affective events in ways that modulate one's emotional response to them. With a commonly used reappraisal task, we assessed the behavioral correlates of four laboratory sessions of guided practice in down-regulating responses to aversive photos. Two groups received practice in one of two types of reappraisal tactics: psychological distancing and reinterpretation. A third no-regulation control group viewed images in each session without instructions to regulate. Three key findings were observed. First, both distancing and reinterpretation training resulted in reductions over time in self-reported negative affect. Second, distancing participants also showed a reduction over time in negative affect on baseline trials in which they responded naturally. Only distancing group participants showed such a reduction over and above the reduction observed in the no-regulation control group, indicating that it was not attributable to habituation. Third, only participants who distanced reported less perceived stress in their daily lives. The present results provide the first evidence for the longitudinal trainability of reappraisal in healthy adults using short courses of reappraisal practice, particularly using psychological distancing.",2014.0,50.0,186.0,"{'volume': '14 2', 'pages': '\n          425-33\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Denny2014BehavioralEO,\n author = {Bryan T.

Some kinds of sociograms are more suitable than others for achieving a high academic performance of students. However, for now, at the beginning of an educative period, it is not possible to know for sure how the sociogram of a group of students will be or evolve during a semester or an academic year. In this context, the current approach presents an Agent-Based Simulator (ABS) that predicts the sociogram of a group of students taking into consideration their psychological profiles, by evolving an initial sociogram through time. This simulator is referred to as ABS-SOCI (ABS for SOCIograms). For instance, this can be useful for organizing class groups for some subjects of engineering grades, anticipating additional learning assistance or testing some teaching strategies. As experimentation, ABS-SOCI has been executed 100 times for each one of four real scenarios. The results show that ABS-SOCI produces sociograms similar to the real ones considering certain sociometrics. This similarity has been corroborated by statistical binomial tests that check whether there are significant differences between the simulations and the real cases. This experimentation also includes cross-validation and an analysis of sensitivity. ABS-SOCI is free and open-source to (1) ensure the reproducibility of the experiments; (2) to allow practitioners to run simulations; and (3) to allow developers to adapt the simulator for different environments.",2017.0,31.0,4.0,"{'volume': '7', 'pages': '1126', 'name': 'Applied Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{García-Magariño2017ABSSOCIAA,\n author = {I.

This small freshwater species offers many advantages to the study of organ and tissue development that are not provided by other model systems. Against this background, modern molecular genetic approaches are being applied to expand the physical and genetic mapping of the zebrafish genome. These approaches complement the large-scale mutagenic screens that have led to the isolation of mutant phenotypes. Some of the phenotypes have been found to resemble human disease states, while mapping and sequencing data have revealed zebrafish genes with significant homology to human disease-causing genes. It is the realization that the zebrafish offers an amenable system for understanding disease, as opposed to development, that underpins this review. The adventitious identification of disease phenotypes amongst zebrafish mutants and the important area of deliberate disease modelling using transgenesis and gene targeting should lead to a better application of the zebrafish as a vertebrate model of human diseases.",2000.0,89.0,148.0,"{'volume': '9 16', 'pages': '\n          2443-9\n        ', 'name': 'Human molecular genetics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Dodd2000ZebrafishBT,\n author = {A.

Contrary to rule- or template-based domain-specific dialog systems, open-domain conversation usually requires data-driven approaches, which can be roughly divided into two categories: retrieval-based and generation-based systems. Retrieval systems search a user-issued utterance (called a query) in a large database, and return a reply that best matches the query. Generative approaches, typically based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), can synthesize new replies, but they suffer from the problem of generating short, meaningless utterances. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based dialog systems in the open domain. In our approach, the retrieved candidate, in addition to the original query, is fed to an RNN-based reply generator, so that the neural model is aware of more information. The generated reply is then fed back as a new candidate for post-reranking.

Destrebecqz and A. Cleeremans's (2001, 2003) claim that, under certain circumstances, the expression of such sequence knowledge cannot be brought under intentional control. In Experiment 1 participants were trained on either a deterministic or a probabilistic sequence and then performed a free-generation test under either inclusion or exclusion instructions. Participants were found to be capable of both expressing (inclusion) and avoiding expressing (exclusion) sequence knowledge. These results were confirmed in Experiment 2 with a more exact replication of Destrebecqz and Cleeremans's methodology. In Experiment 3 participants performed a trial-by-trial generation test under both inclusion and exclusion conditions after a much longer period of training.

1707,85653ddfa6ae70bf53f6398b9ea537b91764da5b,Public and private self-consciousness: Assessment and theory.,"A scale was constructed to assess individual differences in self-consciou sness. Norms and test-retest reliability are presented. Factor analysis of the scale revealed that self-consciousness has three components: public, private, and social anxiety. The relationships among these three factors are examined. The scale was found useful in research on social behavior, and its implications for research and therapy are discussed. Self Jawareness is a central concept in several divergent approaches to behavior and life. In psychoanalysi s, increased awareness of the self is both a tool and a goal. Self-examination enables the person to recognize his unconscious thoughts, motives, and defenses; one result of the therapy is increased insight, i.e., greater self-awareness. Rogerian therapy, existential analysis, and a variety of other insight therapies have also emphasized the importance of attending to and understanding one's inner thoughts and feelings. Relatively newer traditions, such as transactional analysis, encounter groups, and sensitivity training, have stressed the value of ""getting in touch with oneself"" and recognizing how one's behavior affects others. The quest for self-insight may also be seen in the widespread interest in the practice of meditation. Previous interest in self-awarenes s has derived from either a therapeutic orientation or a philosophical approach to life. Recently, self-awareness has been approached from an entirely different perspective—that of social psychology. Argyle (1969) has speculated about the impact of self ^awareness on social interaction, and Duval and Wicklund (1972) have elaborated an entire theory of selfawareness. Laboratory research generated by Duval and Wicklund's theory has examined both the effects of stimuli that direct attention toward the self (mirrors and cameras) Allan Fenigstein is now at Kenyon College, Gambier, Ohio, and Michael F.

Specifically, a crosswalk scenario was created in which a virtual crowd was scripted to cross the road once the traffic light turned green. Participants were also instructed to walk across the road to the opposite sidewalk. During that time, the assessment of participant movement behavior was captured by the use of objective measurements (time, speed, and deviation). Five density conditions (no density, low density, medium density, high density, and extreme density) were developed to investigate which had the greatest effect on the movement behavior of the participants. The results obtained indicated that the extreme density condition of the virtual crowd did indeed alter the movement behavior of participants to a significant degree. Given that density had the greatest effect on the movement behavior of participants, a follow-up study was also conducted that utilized the density findings and explored whether density can affect the speed and direction of participants. This was achieved through examining five speed conditions and six directional conditions. The follow-up study provided some evidence that during an extreme density condition the speed of the crowd also affects the movement behavior of participants. However, no alteration in human movement behavior was observed when examining the direction of the virtual crowd. Implications for future research are discussed.",2019.0,54.0,11.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Virtual-Reality Continuum and its Applications in Industry'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Nelson2019WithinAV,\n author = {Michael G.

– The two aims of this paper are to explore the development of trust for relationships between staff and customers in the banking sector and to investigate possible links between financial performance of relationship manager and their levels of emotional intelligence (EI) and trust. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
– An internet survey was undertaken, where respondents were asked to complete an EI test and questions relating to trusting behaviour. These data were integrated with financial performance data supplied by the bank. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and correlation analysis was used to identify links. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
– Trust was found to be made up of three components: dependability; knowledge; and expectations. Further, there were significant correlations between both trust and EI, when compared to the financial performance of a relationship manager. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
– The methods used by the bank to collect performance data have limited the analysis that could be conducted. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
– Increased awareness by the relationship managers of their own emotions, and how they perceive and act upon the emotions of others, should favourably impact financial performance. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
– This paper is an important initial step in highlighting the significance of EI and trust in the relationship marketing/selling arena.",2008.0,72.0,168.0,"{'volume': '26', 'pages': '183-199', 'name': 'International Journal of Bank Marketing'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Heffernan2008RelationshipMT,\n author = {Troy Heffernan and G.

This scenario is representative of an epidemic process spreading on a network of persistent real contacts, and a cyclic information awareness process diffusing in the network of virtual social contacts between the same individuals. The topology corresponds to a multiplex network where two diffusive processes are interacting affecting each other. The analysis using a microscopic Markov chain approach reveals the phase diagram of the incidence of the epidemics and allows us to capture the evolution of the epidemic threshold depending on the topological structure of the multiplex and the interrelation with the awareness process. Interestingly, the critical point for the onset of the epidemics has a critical value (metacritical point) defined by the awareness dynamics and the topology of the virtual network, from which the onset increases and the epidemics incidence decreases.",2013.0,17.0,670.0,"{'volume': '111 12', 'pages': '\n          128701\n        ', 'name': 'Physical review letters'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Granell2013OnTD,\n author = {C.

While its application in Virtual Reality (VR) has been very successful for phobic disorders, the effects of exposure to virtual social stimuli in Social Anxiety Disorder are heterogeneous. This difference has been linked to demands on realism and presence, particularly social presence, as a pre-requisite in evoking emotional experiences in virtual social interactions. So far, however, the influence of social presence on emotional experience in social interactions with virtual agents remains unknown. Objective: We investigated the relationship between realism and social presence and the moderating effect of social presence on the relationship between agent behavior and experienced emotions in virtual social interaction. Methods: Healthy participants (N = 51) faced virtual agents showing supportive and dismissive behaviors in two virtual environments (short interactions and oral presentations). At first, participants performed five blocks of short one-on-one interactions with virtual agents (two male and two female agents per block). Secondly, participants gave five presentations in front of an audience of 16 agents. In each scenario, agent behavior was a within subjects factor, resulting in one block of neutral, two blocks of negative, and two blocks of positive agent behavior. Ratings of agent behavior (valence and realism), experience (valence and arousal), and presence (physical and social) were collected after every block. Moderator effects were investigated using mixed linear models with random intercepts. Correlations were analyzed via repeated measures correlations. Results: Ratings of valence of agent behaviors showed reliable relationships with experienced valence and less reliable relationships with experienced arousal. These relationships were moderated by social presence in the presentation scenario. Results for the interaction scenario were weaker but potentially promising for experimental studies. Variations in social presence and realism over time were correlated but social presence proved a more reliable moderator. Conclusion: Our findings emphasize the role of social presence for emotional experience in response to specific agent behaviors in virtual social interactions. While these findings should be replicated with experimental designs and in clinical samples, variability in social presence might account for heterogeneity in efficacy of virtual exposure to treat social anxiety disorder.",2021.0,39.0,3.0,{'volume': '2'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Pfaller2021SocialPA,\n author = {Michael Pfaller and Leon O.

Data arefrom questionnaire responses provided by subjects in a computerized experiment who offered different group-pay allocations. Perceived procedural justice, which is affected by the conflict between initial pay divisions, enhances positivefeelings about the negotiation and attenuates depression over outcomes. One's own final pay level influences positivelyfairness of the outcome to self and negativelyfairness to others. Fairness to self decreases negativefeelings aboutfinal pay and increases pay satisfaction, but also guilt. Fairness to others, in contrast, only negatively affects guilt. The discussion emphasizes the importance of differentiating types ofjustice and of emotions to understand reactions to negotiations. Within the distributive justice literature, Homans's (1974) argument about emotional responses to injustice has been the cornerstone for research on the topic. He argues simply that those treated fairly will experience positive emotions, whereas those underrewarded are likely to feel anger and those overrewarded are likely to feel guilty.

Some areas of the prefrontal cortex also showed activation. In contrast, patients with autism or AS activated the fronto‐temporal regions but not the amygdala when making mentalistic inferences from the eyes.

In this fMRI study we used simplified stimuli to investigate brain regions involved in the detection of mechanical and intentional contingencies. Using a factorial design we manipulated the 'animacy' and 'contingency' of stimulus movement, and the subject's attention to the contingencies. The detection of mechanical contingency between shapes whose movement was inanimate engaged the middle temporal gyrus and right intraparietal sulcus. The detection of intentional contingency between shapes whose movement was animate activated superior parietal networks bilaterally. These activations were unaffected by attention to contingency. Additional regions, the right middle frontal gyrus and left superior temporal sulcus, became activated by the animate-contingent stimuli when subjects specifically attended to the contingent nature of the stimuli. Our results help to clarify neural networks previously associated with 'theory of mind' and agency detection. In particular, the results suggest that low-level perception of agency in terms of objects reacting to other objects at a distance is processed by parietal networks. In contrast, the activation of brain regions traditionally associated with theory of mind tasks appears to require attention to be directed towards agency and contingency.",2003.0,34.0,238.0,"{'volume': '13 8', 'pages': '\n          837-44\n        ', 'name': 'Cerebral cortex'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Blakemore2003TheDO,\n author = {Sarah-Jayne Blakemore and Pascal Boyer and M.

In the first experiment, emotional contagion occurred among ""receivers"" who ""caught"" a happy emotion from ""senders"" whom the receivers liked. The relationship between the emotion experienced by senders and receivers was found to be mediated by receivers mimicking smiling on the part of senders. Exposing receivers to happy senders they liked also resulted in receivers having a positive attitudinal bias toward a product. The happiness experienced by receivers via contagion was found to mediate the effects of sender emotion and receiver liking of the sender on receiver product attitudes. The second experiment replicated the first while demonstrating that observation of the facial expressions of senders by receivers, thus allowing mimicking of smiling, was a necessary condition for emotional contagion to occur. The relevance of emotional contagion for understanding consumer behavior across various substantive domains is discussed.

Naturalistic observations were conducted on humans interacting in groups that differed in terms of age composition (and presumably social status). Three affiliative behaviours were recorded by focal sampling: spontaneous smiles, deliberate smiles and laughter. Interestingly, young men showed significantly higher proportions of deliberate smiles in comparison to laughter when interacting with people of a different age class than when interacting in same-age groups. The pattern of affiliative behaviours in women remained unaffected by the age composition of groups.

Use of virtual reality could facilitate new learning. Aims To test the hypothesis that enabling patients to test the threat predictions of persecutory delusions in virtual reality social environments with the dropping of safety-seeking behaviours (virtual reality cognitive therapy) would lead to greater delusion reduction than exposure alone (virtual reality exposure). Method Conviction in delusions and distress in a real-world situation were assessed in 30 patients with persecutory delusions. Patients were then randomised to virtual reality cognitive therapy or virtual reality exposure, both with 30 min in graded virtual reality social environments. Delusion conviction and real-world distress were then reassessed. Results In comparison with exposure, virtual reality cognitive therapy led to large reductions in delusional conviction (reduction 22.0%, P = 0.024, Cohen's d = 1.3) and real-world distress (reduction 19.6%, P = 0.020, Cohen's d = 0.8).

Compared with human evacuation experiments and drills, which may have personal safety risks and require a large number of volunteers, a simple and convenient computer simulation has become the mainstream research method. The computer simulation first needs to characterize small groups in the crowd to model the motion state of crowds for more accurate crowd modeling. In this paper, a top–bottom hierarchical clustering algorithm based on off-line crowd trajectories is proposed to provide small group information for crowd motion simulation. First, an unmanned aerial vehicle and a tracking technology are used to capture the pedestrian flow and extract the pedestrian trajectory. Second, a top–bottom hierarchical clustering strategy is proposed to divide the crowd into groups, which solves the problem of the difficulty of ascertaining small groups. This method solves the problem of automatically determining cluster centers by using the improved density peak clustering algorithm combined with a greedy algorithm. One factor of distinguishing small groups is improved by replacing the angle of the direction of motion with the distance difference, thus reducing the computational complexity. Specifically, the mean distance between trajectories based on the Euclidean distance is used for the top-level coarse-grained clustering; then, the improved Hausdorff mean distance is determined in the bottom-level fine-grained clustering. Third, the proposed algorithm is validated by classifying the groups of pedestrians in real videos. The experiments show that the proposed method is applicable and effective.",2019.0,57.0,12.0,"{'volume': '7', 'pages': '29679-29698', 'name': 'IEEE Access'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Li2019ATC,\n author = {Yan Li and Hong Liu and Xiangwei Zheng and Yanbin Han and Liang Li},\n journal = {IEEE Access},\n pages = {29679-29698},\n title = {A Top–Bottom Clustering Algorithm Based on Crowd Trajectories for Small Group Classification},\n volume = {7},\n year = {2019}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '152998599', 'name': 'Yan Li'}, {'authorId': '2118903809', 'name': 'Hong Liu'}, {'authorId': '4243457', 'name': 'Xiangwei Zheng'}, {'authorId': '2658163', 'name': 'Yanbin Han'}, {'authorId': '2154884052', 'name': 'Liang Li'}]"

Their perceptual judgments are based on simple movement features, such as overall speed, but also on more intricate posture and dynamic cues. The systematic analysis of such features is complicated due to the difficulty of considering the large number of potentially relevant kinematic and dynamic parameters. To identify emotion-specific features we motion-captured the neutral and emotionally expressive (anger, happiness, sadness, fear) gaits of 25 individuals. Body posture was characterized by average flexion angles, and a low-dimensional parameterization of the spatio-temporal structure of joint trajectories was obtained by approximation with a nonlinear mixture model. Applying sparse regression, we extracted critical emotion-specific posture and movement features, which typically depended only on a small number of joints. The features we extracted from the motor behavior closely resembled features that were critical for the perception of emotion from gait, determined by a statistical analysis of classification and rating judgments of 21 observers presented with avatars animated with the recorded movements. The perceptual relevance of these features was further supported by another experiment showing that artificial walkers containing only the critical features induced high-level after-effects matching those induced by adaptation with natural emotional walkers.",2009.0,122.0,337.0,"{'volume': '9 6', 'pages': '\n          15.1-32\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of vision'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Roether2009CriticalFF,\n author = {Claire L.

Over time, the landscape of these worlds evolves and changes as players create and personalise their own virtual property.

Antagonistic emotions, which is the typical psychological state of agents in different roles (i.e., cops, activists, and civilians) in crowd violence scenes, and the way they spread through contagion in a crowd are important causes of crowd antagonistic behaviors. Moreover, games, which refers to the interaction between opposing groups adopting different strategies to obtain higher benefits and less casualties, determine the level of crowd violence. We present an antagonistic crowd simulation model (ACSEE), which is integrated with antagonistic emotional contagion and evolutionary game theories. Our approach models the antagonistic emotions between agents in different roles using two components: mental emotion and external emotion. We combine enhanced susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) and game approaches to evaluate the role of antagonistic emotional contagion in crowd violence. Our evolutionary game theoretic approach incorporates antagonistic emotional contagion through deterrent force, which is modelled by a mixture of emotional forces and physical forces defeating the opponents. Antagonistic emotional contagion and evolutionary game theories influence each other to determine antagonistic crowd behaviors. We evaluate our approach on real-world scenarios consisting of different kinds of agents. We also compare the simulated crowd behaviors with real-world crowd videos and use our approach to predict the trends of crowd movements in violence incidents. We investigate the impact of various factors (number of agents, emotion, strategy, etc.) on the outcome of crowd violence. We present results from user studies suggesting that our model can simulate antagonistic crowd behaviors similar to those seen in real-world scenarios.",2019.0,99.0,27.0,"{'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing', 'pages': '729-745', 'volume': '13'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Li2019ACSEEAC,\n author = {Chaochao Li and Pei Lv and Dinesh Manocha and Hua Wang and Yafei Li and Bing Zhou and Mingliang Xu},\n booktitle = {IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing},\n journal = {IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing},\n pages = {729-745},\n title = {ACSEE: Antagonistic Crowd Simulation Model With Emotional Contagion and Evolutionary Game Theory},\n volume = {13},\n year = {2019}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '7431398', 'name': 'Chaochao Li'}, {'authorId': '144470801', 'name': 'Pei Lv'}, {'authorId': '1699159', 'name': 'Dinesh Manocha'}, {'authorId': '2113254290', 'name': 'Hua Wang'}, {'authorId': '2110450498', 'name': 'Yafei Li'}, {'authorId': '2118869098', 'name': 'Bing Zhou'}, {'authorId': '2285442', 'name': 'Mingliang Xu'}]"

In this work we study the effect of warmth expressed in the behavior of a virtual agent on a human-agent negotiation. We design and conduct an experiment where participants negotiate with two versions of the same agent displaying varying levels of warmth. The results show that humans are more satisfied with the warm agent, are more willing to renegotiate with it, would recommend the agent more to their friends and had a better interaction experience, even though there is no difference in negotiation outcome (utility, agreement or rounds needed).

In a within-subjects design, the participants played the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game with VCs with different dynamic facial expressions (predefined or dependent on the participant's electrodermal and facial EMG activity). In general, VC facial expressions elicited congruent facial muscle activity. However, both frontal EEG asymmetry and facial EMG activity elicited by an angry VC facial expression varied as a function of preceding interactional events (human collaboration/defection). Pre-decision inner emotional-motivational processes and emotional facial expressions were dissociated, suggesting that human goals influence pre-decision frontal asymmetry, whereas display rules may affect (pre-decision) emotional expressions in human-VC interaction. An angry VC facial expression, high pre-decision corrugator EMG activity, and relatively greater left frontal activation predicted the participant's decision to defect. Both post-decision frontal asymmetry and facial EMG activity were related to reciprocal cooperation. The results suggest that the justifiability of VC emotional expressions and the perceived fairness of VC actions influence human emotional responses.",2018.0,81.0,19.0,"{'volume': '9', 'pages': '285-298', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ravaja2018VirtualCF,\n author = {N.

Emphasis in this pursuit has varied, of course: empiricists have concentrated on the mind's interplay with an external world of nature, hoping to find the key in the association of sensations and ideas, while rationalists have looked inward to the powers of mind itself for the principles of right reason. The objective, in either case, has been to discover how we achieve ""reality,"" that is to say, how we get a reliable fix on the world, a world that is, as it were, assumed to be immutable and, as it were, ""there to be observed."" This quest has, of course, had a profound effect on the development of psychology, and the empiricist and rationalist traditions have dominated our conceptions of how the mind grows and how it gets its grasp on the ""real world."" Indeed, at midcentury Gestalt theory represented the rationalist wing of this enterprise and American learning theory the empiricist. Both gave accounts of mental development as proceeding in some more or less linear and uniform fashion from an initial incompetence in grasping reality to a final competence, in one case attributing it to the working out of internal processes or mental organization, and in the other to some unspecified principle of reflection by which—whether through reinforcement, association, or conditioning—we came to respond to the world ""as it is.""

However, CBT is not always available to patients because of a shortage of therapists and long waiting times. Computerized CBT (CCBT) is one of several alternatives currently available to treat patients with depression. Evidence of its clinical effectiveness has led to programs being used increasingly within the UK and elsewhere. However, little information is available regarding the acceptability of CCBT to patients. Method A systematic review of sources of information on acceptability to patients of CCBT for depression. Results Sources of information on acceptability included: recruitment rates, patient drop-outs and patient-completed questionnaires. We identified 16 studies of CCBT for the treatment of depression that provided at least some information on these sources. Limited information was provided on patient take-up rates and recruitment methods. Drop-out rates were comparable to other forms of treatment. Take-up rates, when reported, were much lower. Six of the 16 studies included specific questions on patient acceptability or satisfaction although information was only provided for those who had completed treatment. Several studies have reported positive expectancies and high satisfaction in routine care CCBT services for those completing treatment. Conclusions Trials of CCBT should include more detailed information on patient recruitment methods, drop-out rates and reasons for dropping out. It is important that well-designed surveys and qualitative studies are included alongside trials to determine levels and determinants of patient acceptability.",2008.0,39.0,239.0,"{'volume': '38', 'pages': '1521 - 1530', 'name': 'Psychological Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kaltenthaler2008TheAT,\n author = {E.

In this study, we examine the use of four different types of text structures to structure the character’s narrative in an instructional video: expository, refutation text, deep reasoning questions, and refutation text and deep reasoning questions; and their effects on learning, perceptions, attitudes, and emotions about genetically modified foods.

However, we believe that recent studies have overemphasized ways that the power-law connectivity distribution features of social networks affect epidemic dynamics and critical thresholds. As a result, two important factors have been overlooked: resource limitations and transmission costs associated with social interactions and daily contact. Here we present our results from the simultaneous application of mean-field theory and an agent-based network simulation approach for analyzing the effects of resources and costs on epidemic dynamics and critical thresholds. Our main findings are: (a) a significant critical threshold does exist when resources and costs are taken into consideration, and it has a lower bound whenever contagion events occur in scale-free networks; (b) when transmission costs increase or individual resources decrease, critical contagion thresholds in scale-free networks grow linearly and steady density curves shrink linearly; (c) regardless of whether the resources of individuals obey delta, uniform, or normal distributions, they have the same critical thresholds and epidemic dynamics as long as the average value of usable resources remains the same across different scale-free networks; and (d) the spread of epidemics in scale-free networks remains controllable as long as resources are properly restricted and intervention strategy investments are significantly increased.",2009.0,31.0,11.0,"{'volume': '85', 'pages': '205 - 219', 'name': 'SIMULATION'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Huang2009InfluencesOR,\n author = {Chung-Yuan Huang and Yu-Shiuan Tsai and Chuen-Tsai Sun and J.

We aim to create guidelines that allow humans to trust robots to be able to look after their well-being by adopting human-like behaviours. We want to study a Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) to assess whether a certain degree of transparency in the robots actions, the use of social behaviours and natural communications can affect humans' sense of trust and companionship towards the robots. However, trust can change over time due to different factors, e.g. due to perceiving erroneous robot behaviors. We believe that the magnitude and the timing of the error during an interaction may have different impacts resulting in different scales of loss of trust and of restoring lost trust.",2017.0,15.0,38.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the Companion of the 2017 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Rossi2017InvestigatingHP,\n author = {Alessandra Rossi and K.

A process-based client-server approach is presented that permits concurrent sensor-based map and localization-correction updates as well as concurrent path computation and execution. A potential function is created by solving Laplace's equation (i.e. a harmonic function) using an iteration kernal convolved with an occupancy-grid representation of the current free space. The path produced (i.e. by steepest gradient descent on the harmonic function) is optimal in the sense of globally minimizing the distance to the goal as well as locally minimizing a hitting probability. This helps alleviate the influence of uncertainty on path planning. On a regular grid, the computation of the harmonic function is linear in the total number of grid elements, thus constraining this planner to be local. A global planner-provided that an a priori CAD map of the fixed objects exists-provides information to the local planner about the effects of a global goal. An algorithm for the three typical local scenarios found in indoor office-like environments is presented showing how a global goal is projected into the local context for each case. Since objects are sensed on-the-fly it is possible to discover that passage through a hallway or room may be blocked. A zero gradient vector in the local potential function is used to signal a blocked passage and subsequently initiate global replanning. The technique has been used to control a Nomadics 200 robot.",2000.0,16.0,13.0,"{'volume': '30', 'pages': '865-870', 'name': 'IEEE Trans. Syst. Man Cybern.

These actors displayed a series of emotions, which included sadness, anger, joy, disgust, fear, and romantic love. In experiment 1, subjects viewed brief clips of these point-light displays presented the right way up and upside down. In experiment 2, the importance of the interaction between the two figures in the recognition of emotion was examined. Subjects were shown upright versions of (i) the original pairs (dyads), (ii) a single actor (monad), and (iii) a dyad comprising a single actor and his/her mirror image (reflected dyad). In each experiment, the subjects rated the emotional content of the displays by moving a slider along a horizontal scale. All of the emotions received a rating for every clip. In experiment 1, when the displays were upright, the correct emotions were identified in each case except disgust; but, when the displays were inverted, performance was significantly diminished for some emotions. In experiment 2, the recognition of love and joy was impaired by the absence of the acting partner, and the recognition of sadness, joy, and fear was impaired in the non-veridical (mirror image) displays. These findings both support and extend previous research by showing that biological motion is sufficient for the perception of emotion, although inversion affects performance. Moreover, emotion perception from biological motion can be affected by the veridical or non-veridical social context within the displays.",2005.0,30.0,235.0,"{'volume': '34', 'pages': '1171 - 1180', 'name': 'Perception'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Clarke2005ThePO,\n author = {T.

At each iteration of the experiment, four conditions (Self-Avatar LookAt, No Self-Avatar LookAt, Self-Avatar No LookAt, and No Self-Avatar No LookAt) were applied to examine users' movement behavior based on kinematic measures. During the experiment, 52 participants were asked to walk from a starting position to a target position. A virtual character was placed at the midpoint. Participants were asked to wear a head-mounted display throughout the task, and their locomotion was captured using a motion capture suit. We analyzed the captured trajectories of the participants' routes on four kinematic measures to explore whether the four experimental conditions influenced the paths they took. The results indicated that the Self-Avatar LookAt condition affected the path the participants chose more significantly than the other three conditions in terms of length, duration, and deviation, but not in terms of speed. Overall, the length and duration of the task, as well as the deviation of the trajectory from the straight line, were greater when a self-avatar represented participants. An additional effect on kinematic measures was found in the LookAt (Gaze) conditions.

In this article, we explore affective engagement with a virtual agent through Neurofeedback (NF). We report an experiment where subjects engage with a virtual agent by expressing positive attitudes towards her under a NF paradigm. We use for affective input the asymmetric activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DL-PFC), which has been previously found to be related to the high-level affective-motivational dimension of approach/avoidance. The magnitude of left-asymmetric DL-PFC activity, measured using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and treated as a proxy for approach, is mapped onto a control mechanism for the virtual agent’s facial expressions, in which action units (AUs) are activated through a neural network. We carried out an experiment with 18 subjects, which demonstrated that subjects are able to successfully engage with the virtual agent by controlling their mental disposition through NF, and that they perceived the agent’s responses as realistic and consistent with their projected mental disposition. This interaction paradigm is particularly relevant in the case of affective BCI as it facilitates the volitional activation of specific areas normally not under conscious control.

1790,8cc8bda43875b6a74993a4264d4a7233ff9554f0,The Walking Behaviour of Pedestrian Social Groups and Its Impact on Crowd Dynamics,"Human crowd motion is mainly driven by self-organized processes based on local interactions among pedestrians. While most studies of crowd behaviour consider only interactions among isolated individuals, it turns out that up to 70% of people in a crowd are actually moving in groups, such as friends, couples, or families walking together. These groups constitute medium-scale aggregated structures and their impact on crowd dynamics is still largely unknown. In this work, we analyze the motion of approximately 1500 pedestrian groups under natural condition, and show that social interactions among group members generate typical group walking patterns that influence crowd dynamics. At low density, group members tend to walk side by side, forming a line perpendicular to the walking direction. As the density increases, however, the linear walking formation is bent forward, turning it into a V-like pattern. These spatial patterns can be well described by a model based on social communication between group members. We show that the V-like walking pattern facilitates social interactions within the group, but reduces the flow because of its “non-aerodynamic” shape. Therefore, when crowd density increases, the group organization results from a trade-off between walking faster and facilitating social exchange. These insights demonstrate that crowd dynamics is not only determined by physical constraints induced by other pedestrians and the environment, but also significantly by communicative, social interactions among individuals.",2010.0,32.0,936.0,"{'volume': '5', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Moussaïd2010TheWB,\n author = {M.

In this study, math anxiety from the GED (General Educational Development) population is addressed through emotional and motivational support provided by pedagogical agents. There are two reasons to this approach. One major reason is the inherent social nature of learning and research on learners’ emotion and motivation are gaining more and more interest. The other major reason is that the embodiment nature of pedagogical agents have been recognized by researchers and the pedagogical agents become one of the ideal candidates to improve learning and influence learners’ emotion and motivation in a computer-based learning environment. 
In this study, emotional support and cognitive motivational messages were embedded in pedagogical agents to promote learning, alleviate math anxiety, and improve leaner motivation. 109 GED students affiliated with local community college participated in this study. This study used a 2 x 2 factorial design. The two independent variables were emotional support and cognitive motivational messages and each dependent variable contained two levels: presence versus absence. The dependent measure of study includes learning, math anxiety, and leaner motivation. 
MANOVA analysis revealed a main effect of emotional support. Further univariate analysis showed that students who worked with emotional support agents performed better in learning and had less math anxiety than those students who worked with none-emotional support agents. No significant results were found on the main effect of cognitive motivational messages. This study shows quantitative evidence of the effectiveness of pedagogical agents as a means to deliver emotional support in a computer based learning environment. 
Further research is suggested to examine the adaptive nature of emotional support and cognitive motivational messages. The effect of emotional support and cognitive motivational messages in non-GED population needs to be tested.",2009.0,114.0,15.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Keller2009TheEO,\n author = {J.

Some researchers propose that people apply the same social norms to computers as they do to humans, suggesting that social psychological knowledge can be applied to our interactions with computers. In contrast, theories of human–automation interaction postulate that humans respond to machines in unique and specific ways. We believe that anthropomorphism—the degree to which an agent exhibits human characteristics—is the critical variable that may resolve this apparent contradiction across the formation, violation, and repair stages of trust. Three experiments were designed to examine these opposing viewpoints by varying the appearance and behavior of automated agents. Participants received advice that deteriorated gradually in reliability from a computer, avatar, or human agent. Our results showed (a) that anthropomorphic agents were associated with greater trust resilience, a higher resistance to breakdowns in trust; (b) that these effects were magnified by greater uncertainty; and c) that incorporating human-like trust repair behavior largely erased differences between the agents. Automation anthropomorphism is therefore a critical variable that should be carefully incorporated into any general theory of human–agent trust as well as novel automation design.",2016.0,132.0,322.0,"{'volume': '22 3', 'pages': '\n          331-49\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of experimental psychology.

For a long time, it has represented a sort of “oral encyclopedia” which, through narrative, has passed down from generation to generation traditions, customs and knowledge (Halverson, 1992). The role that storytelling played, even before the discovery of writing, in the diffusion of knowledge, in the construction of interpersonal relationships and in the birth of new societies, is well known. Without doubt writing is the earliest “technology” invented by man, through which culture and knowledge have been passed down over time, after having been transmitted orally for a long time. According to Barthes and Duisit (1975), in fact, storytelling begins with the same story of the human race, almost as if to represent an ontogenetically distinctive trait of the species, which unites homo sapiens with the homo digitalis of today’s society (Montag & Diefenbach, 2018). Other authors (Kenyon et al., 1996) argue that men and women not only have stories to tell, but that they are the stories they tell.

In many realistic situations the flow of physical quantities in the network, as characterized by the loads on nodes, is important. We show that for such networks where loads can redistribute among the nodes, intentional attacks can lead to a cascade of overload failures, which can in turn cause the entire or a substantial part of the network to collapse. This is relevant for real-world networks that possess a highly heterogeneous distribution of loads, such as the Internet and power grids. We demonstrate that the heterogeneity of these networks makes them particularly vulnerable to attacks in that a large-scale cascade may be triggered by disabling a single key node.

In a large-scale evacuation action, there are complicated interactions between people and the disaster environment, and it is very difficult to present such interactions in quantitative functions or specific values. In this paper, a qualitatively simulated approach to model and study the panic spread is proposed. First, the internal structure of the evacuation system is described and various internal and external phenomena related to the change of evacuees’ behaviors in the evacuation process are qualitatively interpreted. Based on the qualitative knowledge, a qualitative simulation model of a large-scale evacuation system is established. The calculation results of inverse group matrix verify the rationality and stability of our model. According to the implementation of a series of scenarios with different input, some uncertainty factors that can affect the panic spread in the evacuation process are analyzed, in which the spread of disaster, the rescue guidance, and the normal emotional evacuees are mainly considered. This model reproduces a well-known phenomenon in crowd evacuation, namely “fast is slow”, and confirms that the severity of disaster exponentially positively correlates with the panic spread, and the effectiveness of rescue guidance is influenced by the leading emotion in the crowds as a whole.",2012.0,32.0,38.0,"{'volume': '88', 'pages': '1465 - 1474', 'name': 'SIMULATION'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wang2012QualitativeSO,\n author = {Jinghong Wang and S.

The purpose of this paper is to critically examine the current knowledge in developmental and affective neuroscience with an emphasis on the perception of pain in others. It will be argued that human empathy involves several components: affective arousal, emotion understanding and emotion regulation, each with different developmental trajectories. These components are implemented by a complex network of distributed, often recursively connected, interacting neural regions including the superior temporal sulcus, insula, medial and orbitofrontal cortices, amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex, as well as autonomic and neuroendocrine processes implicated in social behaviors and emotional states.

Instead, individuals often turn to others for help in shaping their affective lives. How and under what circumstances does such interpersonal regulation modulate emotional experience? Although scientists have examined allied phenomena such as social sharing, empathy, social support, and prosocial behavior for decades, there have been surprisingly few attempts to integrate these data into a single conceptual framework of interpersonal regulation. Here we propose such a framework. We first map a ""space"" differentiating classes of interpersonal regulation according to whether an individual uses an interpersonal regulatory episode to alter their own or another person's emotion. We then identify 2 types of processes--response-dependent and response-independent--that could support interpersonal regulation. This framework classifies an array of processes through which interpersonal contact fulfills regulatory goals. More broadly, it organizes diffuse, heretofore independent data on ""pieces"" of interpersonal regulation, and identifies growth points for this young and exciting research domain.",2013.0,105.0,660.0,"{'volume': '13 5', 'pages': '\n          803-10\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zaki2013InterpersonalER,\n author = {Jamil Zaki and W.

In terms of symbolic forms, of course, the spontaneous and unwitting gestures we make while talking differ sharply from spoken language itself. Whereas spoken language is linear, segmented, standardized, and arbitrary, gestures are global, synthetic, idiosyncratic, and imagistic. In Hand and Mind, David McNeill presents a bold theory of the essential unity of speech and the gestures that accompany it. This long-awaited, provocative study argues that the unity of gestures and language far exceeds the surface level of speech noted by previous researchers and in fact also includes the semantic and pragmatic levels of language. In effect, the whole concept of language must be altered to take into account the nonsegmented, instantaneous, and holistic images conveyed by gestures. McNeill and his colleagues carefully devised a standard methodology for examining the speech and gesture behavior of individuals engaged in narrative discourse. A research subject is shown a cartoon like the 1950 Canary Row--a classic Sylvester and Tweedy Bird caper that features Sylvester climbing up a downspout, swallowing a bowling ball and slamming into a brick wall. After watching the cartoon, the subject is videotaped recounting the story from memory to a listener who has not seen the cartoon. Painstaking analysis of the videotapes revealed that although the research subjects--children as well as adults, some neurologically impaired--represented a wide variety of linguistic groupings, the gestures of people speaking English and a half dozen other languages manifest the same principles. Relying on data from more than ten years of research, McNeill shows thatgestures do not simply form a part of what is said and meant but have an impact on thought itself.

We tested spatial perception in the workspace using a combination of haptic matching and line drawing tasks. There were 132 participants with varying degrees of visual ability ranging from congenitally blind to normally sighted. Each participant was blindfolded and asked to match a haptic target position felt under a table with their nondominant hand using a pen in their dominant hand. Once the pen was in position on the tabletop, they had to draw a line of equal length to a previously felt reference object by moving the pen laterally. We used targets at three different locations to evaluate whether different starting positions relative to the body give rise to different matching errors, drawn line lengths, or drawn line angles. We found no influence of visual ability on matching error, drawn line length, or line angle, but we found that early-blind participants are slightly less consistent in their matching errors across space. We conclude that the elementary haptic abilities tested in these tasks do not depend on visual experience.",2018.0,43.0,23.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'i-Perception'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Nelson2018SpatialRO,\n author = {J.

We argue that emotional signals are intrinsically meaningful within a social relationship, which is crucial for understanding the functionality and boundary conditions of emotional mimicry. On the basis of a review of the literature on facial mimicry of emotion displays, we conclude that the classic matched motor hypothesis does not hold for emotional mimicry. We alternatively propose a contextual view of emotional mimicry, which states that emotional mimicry depends on the social context: we only mimic emotional signals that are interpreted to promote affiliation goals and not necessarily what we see. As a further consequence, we are less likely to mimic strangers and we do not mimic people we do not like nor emotions that signal antagonism.",2014.0,72.0,231.0,"{'volume': '8', 'pages': '45-57', 'name': 'Social and Personality Psychology Compass'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hess2014EmotionalMW,\n author = {U.

In Internet-based eHealth interventions, ECAs may be used for the delivery of automated human support factors. Objective We aim to provide an overview of the technological and clinical possibilities, as well as the evidence base for ECA applications in clinical psychology, to inform health professionals about the activity in this field of research. Methods Given the large variety of applied methodologies, types of applications, and scientific disciplines involved in ECA research, we conducted a systematic scoping review. Scoping reviews aim to map key concepts and types of evidence underlying an area of research, and answer less-specific questions than traditional systematic reviews. Systematic searches for ECA applications in the treatment of mood, anxiety, psychotic, autism spectrum, and substance use disorders were conducted in databases in the fields of psychology and computer science, as well as in interdisciplinary databases. Studies were included if they conveyed primary research findings on an ECA application that targeted one of the disorders. We mapped each study’s background information, how the different disorders were addressed, how ECAs and users could interact with one another, methodological aspects, and the study’s aims and outcomes. Results This study included N=54 publications (N=49 studies). More than half of the studies (n=26) focused on autism treatment, and ECAs were used most often for social skills training (n=23). Applications ranged from simple reinforcement of social behaviors through emotional expressions to sophisticated multimodal conversational systems. Most applications (n=43) were still in the development and piloting phase, that is, not yet ready for routine practice evaluation or application. Few studies conducted controlled research into clinical effects of ECAs, such as a reduction in symptom severity. Conclusions ECAs for mental disorders are emerging. State-of-the-art techniques, involving, for example, communication through natural language or nonverbal behavior, are increasingly being considered and adopted for psychotherapeutic interventions in ECA research with promising results. However, evidence on their clinical application remains scarce. At present, their value to clinical practice lies mostly in the experimental determination of critical human support factors. In the context of using ECAs as an adjunct to existing interventions with the aim of supporting users, important questions remain with regard to the personalization of ECAs’ interaction with users, and the optimal timing and manner of providing support. To increase the evidence base with regard to Internet interventions, we propose an additional focus on low-tech ECA solutions that can be rapidly developed, tested, and applied in routine practice.",2017.0,85.0,245.0,"{'volume': '19', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Provoost2017EmbodiedCA,\n author = {Simon Provoost and Ho Ming Lau and Jeroen Ruwaard and H.

In order to determine whether body or facial motion is a better indicator for emotional expression for game characters, we conduct a perceptual experiment using synchronized full-body and facial motion-capture data.

Many of these hypotheses present computational challenges to scientific research, in that they require the analysis of numerous mental and bodily changes simultaneously over time. In this thesis, I applied statistical models of machine learning to address these challenges, and to investigate hypotheses concerning interaction effects, curvilinear associations, feedback among emotion components, synchronization of components, and the felt experience of synchronized changes (e.g., feeling angry). Results of the four studies generally supported the algorithmic complexity that underlies emotion unfolding, and that modelling these complexities is necessary to differentiate patterns of emotional responding quantitatively and qualitatively. Using a novel measure for emotional synchronization, I showed experimentally that changes in motivation, physiology, and expression responses synchronized following a manipulation of the appraised importance of a situation.",2015.0,0.0,7.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Meuleman2015ComputationalMO,\n author = {B.

In crowds, in spite of the complexity of the environment made of numerous obstacles, humans demonstrate remarkable capacities in avoiding collisions. Cognitive science work on human locomotion states that relatively succinct information is extracted from the optic flow to achieve safe locomotion. In this paper, we explore a novel vision-based approach of collision avoidance between walkers that fits the requirements of interactive crowd simulation. By simulating humans based on cognitive science results, we detect future collisions as well as the level of danger from visual stimuli. The motor-response is twofold: a reorientation strategy prevents future collision, whereas a deceleration strategy prevents imminent collisions. Several examples of our simulation results show that the emergence of self-organized patterns of walkers is reinforced using our approach. The emergent phenomena are visually appealing. More importantly, they improve the overall efficiency of the walkers' traffic and avoid improbable locking situations.",2010.0,39.0,344.0,{'name': 'ACM SIGGRAPH 2010 papers'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Ondřej2010ASB,\n author = {Jan Ondřej and J.

In addition, the way in which music works so as to touch the listener is of ongoing interest to music psychologists and is increasingly being considered in the context of live listening situations. This paper considers the phenomenon of emotional contagion, or the transference of emotion between audience members, and how this contributes to the audience experience. Audience members (N = 105) were surveyed at three concerts by a ‘pro-am’ orchestra – an orchestra made up of both professionals and amateurs – about their response to the concerts and factors that influenced that response. It was found that emotional contagion can enhance the emotional response of audience members at concerts, and that this is mediated by the sense of social bonding participants have with other people present. Social bonding is also associated with attendance at enhancement events such as pre-concert talks.",2018.0,46.0,9.0,"{'volume': '24', 'pages': '155 - 167', 'name': 'Musicae Scientiae'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Garrido2018AudienceEW,\n author = {Sandra Garrido and Jennifer Macritchie},\n journal = {Musicae Scientiae},\n pages = {155 - 167},\n title = {Audience engagement with community music performances: Emotional contagion in audiences of a ‘pro-am’ orchestra in suburban Sydney},\n volume = {24},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '145468605', 'name': 'Sandra Garrido'}, {'authorId': '2760473', 'name': 'Jennifer Macritchie'}]"

Each subject examined the material from one of the four possible treatment levels and rated the woman for personality, social, and physical attractiveness. The subjects also rated themselves for physical attractiveness. Two 2 × 2 multivariate analyses of variance were performed to evaluate subjects' ratings of personality and social attractiveness and a 2 × 2 analysis of variance was used to evaluate ratings of physical attractiveness. Personality ratings were significantly increased by the friendliness and physical attractiveness of the stimulus while the social attractiveness of the woman was significantly increased only by her physical attractiveness.

Despite the consequent progress in this field, researchers still face some fundamental problems in the use of such programs. For example, the best‐performing programs are often uneasy to use, and user‐friendly programs require source videos recorded under strict conditions (e.g. homogenous environments, constant lighting and high resolution), which may be difficult to meet in both laboratory and field studies. We present here AnimalTA, a new program that tracks and analyses animal movement in diverse environments. This program aims to be accessible to everyone, including those without knowledge of coding and image analysis. AnimalTA allows to process rapidly a high number of videos and manage multi‐arena tracking. It is adapted to follow the movement of targets in variable conditions, including heterogenous and complex environments, or in low‐quality videos. AnimalTA provides tools for editing videos and correcting problems caused by camera tremors, light changes or perspective deformation. AnimalTA also allows the user to easily correct tracking errors and repeat the tracking in a subsample of the video. The target's identity can be personalized to facilitate video analysis. The tracking results can be analysed in AnimalTA to obtain many different variables related to the trajectory of each target, such as average speed, total distance travelled, latency to reach defined areas, distance to a defined point, distance to other individuals, number of contacts with others, explored surface, among others. Users can set and control different parameters for these analyses and directly view the results.",2023.0,23.0,3.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '1699 - 1707', 'name': 'Methods in Ecology and Evolution'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chiara2023AnimalTAAH,\n author = {Violette Chiara and Sin‐Yeon Kim},\n journal = {Methods in Ecology and Evolution},\n pages = {1699 - 1707},\n title = {AnimalTA: A highly flexible and easy‐to‐use program for tracking and analysing animal movement in different environments},\n volume = {14},\n year = {2023}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '8214286', 'name': 'Violette Chiara'}, {'authorId': '8363752', 'name': 'Sin‐Yeon Kim'}]"

In social interaction between humans laughter occurs in a variety of contexts featuring diverse meanings and connotations. Thus, we started to investigate the usefulness of this auditory and behavioral signal applied to social robotics. We first report on results of two surveys conducted to assess the subjectively evaluated naturalness of different types of laughter applied to two humanoid robots. Then we describe the effects of laughter when combined with an android‘s motion and presented to uninformed participants, during playful interaction with another human. In essence, we learned that the social effect of laughter heavily depends on at least the following three factors: First, the situational context, which is not only determined by the task at hand, but also by linguistic content as well as non-verbal expressions; second, the type and quality of laughter synthesis in combination with an artificial laugher‘s outer appearance; and third, the interaction dynamics, which is partly depending on a perceiver‘s gender, personality, and cultural as well as educational background.",2009.0,39.0,25.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Becker-Asano2009LaughterIS,\n author = {C.

There are emotional, cognitive, and conditioning views, applying in varying degrees across species. An adequate description of the ultimate and proximate mechanism can integrate these views. Proximately, the perception of an object's state activates the subject's corresponding representations, which in turn activate somatic and autonomic responses. This mechanism supports basic behaviors (e.g., alarm, social facilitation, vicariousness of emotions, mother-infant responsiveness, and the modeling of competitors and predators) that are crucial for the reproductive success of animals living in groups. The Perception-Action Model (PAM), together with an understanding of how representations change with experience, can explain the major empirical effects in the literature (similarity, familiarity, past experience, explicit teaching, and salience). It can also predict a variety of empathy disorders. The interaction between the PAM and prefrontal functioning can also explain different levels of empathy across species and age groups. This view can advance our evolutionary understanding of empathy beyond inclusive fitness and reciprocal altruism and can explain different levels of empathy across individuals, species, stages of development, and situations.",2001.0,680.0,3339.0,"{'volume': '25 1', 'pages': '\n          1-20; discussion 20-71\n        ', 'name': 'The Behavioral and brain sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Preston2001EmpathyIU,\n author = {S.

Multiple cues from facial appearance influence the judgments that viewers make. Here we investigate the contribution of a novel cue: the change in appearance due to the perspective distortion that results from viewing distance. We found that photographs of faces taken from within personal space elicit lower investments in an economic trust game, and lower ratings of social traits (such as trustworthiness, competence, and attractiveness), compared to photographs taken from a greater distance. The effect was replicated across multiple studies that controlled for facial image size, facial expression and lighting, and was not explained by face width-to-height ratio, explicit knowledge of the camera distance, or whether the faces are perceived as typical. These results demonstrate a novel facial cue influencing a range of social judgments as a function of interpersonal distance, an effect that may be processed implicitly.",2012.0,39.0,47.0,"{'volume': '7', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bryan2012PerspectiveDF,\n author = {Ronnie Bryan and P.

Including (minimal) social cues in Persuasive Technology (PT) increases the probability that people attribute human-like characteristics to that technology, which in turn can make that technology more persuasive (see, e.g., Nass, Steuer, Tauber, & Reeder, 1993). PT in the social actor role can be equipped with a variety of social cues to create opportunities for applying social influence strategies (for an overview, see Fogg, 2003). However, multiple social cues may not always be perceived as being consistent, which could decrease their perceived human-likeness and their persuasiveness. In the current article, we investigate the relation between consistency of social cues and persuasion by an artificial agent. Findings of two studies show that consistency of social cues increases people’s recognition and recall of artificial agents’ emotional expressions, and make those agents more persuasive. These findings show the importance of the combined meaning of social cues in the design of persuasive artificial agents.",2016.0,50.0,15.0,"{'volume': '32', 'pages': '734 - 744', 'name': 'International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ruijten2016AmbiguousAT,\n author = {Peter A.

1853,916940bdf5ffdfb52df372771b5ab95ca1cce2a0,Emotional contagion in nonhuman animals: A review,"Abstract Emotional contagion, the emotional state‐matching of an individual with another, seems to be crucial for many social species. In recent years evidence on emotional contagion in different animal species has accumulated. However, despite its adaptative advantages and its presumed simplicity, the study and direct demonstration of this phenomenon present more complexities than previously thought. For these reasons, a review of the literature on emotional contagion in nonhuman species is timely to integrate current findings. In this paper thus, we carry out a comprehensive review of the most relevant studies on emotional contagion in animals and discuss the main problems and challenges of the field. We conclude that more research is needed to broaden our understanding of the mechanisms and functions of emotional contagion and the extent to which this process is present in a wide variety of species. Furthermore, the comparative study of emotional contagion would benefit from the use of systematized paradigms including both behavioral and physiological measures and the simultaneous recording of the responses of the interacting individuals to reliably assess an emotional state‐matching between them and reliable controls.

However, some patients are resistant to self-compassion. Aims To investigate whether the effects of self-identification with virtual bodies within immersive virtual reality could be exploited to increase self-compassion in patients with depression. Method We developed an 8-minute scenario in which 15 patients practised delivering compassion in one virtual body and then experienced receiving it from themselves in another virtual body. Results In an open trial, three repetitions of this scenario led to significant reductions in depression severity and self-criticism, as well as to a significant increase in self-compassion, from baseline to 4-week follow-up. Four patients showed clinically significant improvement. Conclusions The results indicate that interventions using immersive virtual reality may have considerable clinical potential and that further development of these methods preparatory to a controlled trial is now warranted.

We perform comparisons between real-real interactions and real-virtual ones. We show promising results: similar effects are observed on the kinematics of interactions in both experiments.

1860,922c2f4f7e38e3cefdd052fc021f4e1cd9411e6a,Tuberculosis,"Editor's Note: This issue of In the Clinic has been updated. One third of the world population has Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (1). Despite recent progress in the United States, tuberculosis infection remains prevalent in immigrants, immunosuppressed persons, and other high-risk groups (3). Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the most prevalent form of tuberculosis in the United States (2). LTBI can progress to active tuberculosis disease, especially in individuals with a suppressed cell-mediated immunity. Active tuberculosis disease in immuno-suppressed patients can be difficult to diagnose and can progress to disseminated forms of tuberculosis disease associated with high mortality (4). New methods of diagnosing tuberculosis disease have entered practice in recent years (5), but the diagnosis of LTBI can be challenging in some high-risk populations (6, 7). The introduction of directly observed therapy with first-line antituberculous regimens (8) was an important advance in therapy, but multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and the extensively resistant form of MDR-TB remain significant threats to international and local tuberculosis control efforts (9, 10). Screening and Prevention Who should be screened for tuberculosis? Clinicians should screen all individuals at risk for tuberculosis infection, including close contacts of persons who have active pulmonary tuberculosis. Table 1 identifies asymptomatic individuals who should be screened because they are at high risk for exposure to active tuberculosis or at high risk for disease once infected. Table 1. Risk Factors for Tuberculosis Infection or Progression to Disease After Infection What tests are used to screen for tuberculosis? The tuberculin skin test (TST) with purified protein derivative (PPD) and the Mantoux method have been in use for more than 100 years to screen for tuberculosis. The TST result may not become positive for 8 to 10 weeks after exposure to active tuberculosis. The TST can give false-positive results in patient with previous bacille Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccination or other mycobacterial infections and false-negative results in anergic or immunosuppressed patients; however, previous BCG vaccination should not change the interpretation of the TST in most adults. The newer interferon- release assays (IGRAs), including the 2 U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved commercial tests (T-SPOT.TB [Oxford Immunotec, Oxford, United Kingdom], and QuantiFERON-TB Gold and its In-tube version [Cellestis, Valencia, California]) can also be used in circumstances in which the TST is currently used (11). IGRAs assess the T-cell lymphocyte response to specific M. tuberculosis antigens (for example, ESAT-6 and CFP-10) and are more specific, and possibly more sensitive, than TST (12, 13). However, information about IGRA performance is limited in immunocompromised patients and patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy (6, 14). The commercially available IGRAs also have limitations; indeterminate results can occur in immunosuppressed patients, more so with QuantiFERON TB Gold than T-SPOT.TB (6). Discordant results between TST and IGRA testing also occur in about 20% of individuals (13), which could be related, at least in part, to differences in performance characteristics of these tests (5) and to characteristics of the studied populations, such as the prevalence of persons previously vaccinated with BCG and the proportion of persons born outside the United States (15, 16). In addition to their improved specificity compared with TST, IGRAs have several practical advantages. They do not require a second visit for reading and they do not trigger amnestic responses. Longitudinal data supporting the predictive value of IGRA testing is limited, however, in contrast to the many studies of TST for predicting active tuberculosis (17). A recent study from a high-incidence area of tuberculosis in Africa found that initial test results were positive in only 56% of TST testing and 52% of IGRA testing in close household contacts who developed active tuberculosis during 2 years of follow up. Of these close household contacts who developed active tuberculosis, 71% had a positive result with either TST or IGRA during their initial evaluations (18). Another prospective study (19) from a country with a low incidence of tuberculosis suggests that IGRA testing could be more accurate than TST for diagnosing LTBI and for detecting individuals who will progress to active tuberculosis, but more longitudinal data are needed, especially in immunosuppressed individuals. What can patients do to reduce their likelihood of becoming infected with tuberculosis? Tuberculosis is mainly transmitted by the airborne route from a patient with respiratory symptoms, and its ability to infect others decreases significantly after 2 weeks of effective therapy (20, 22). Therefore, prevention of tuberculosis transmission involves promptly identifying and treating patients with active tuberculosis. For hospitalized patients, prevention includes isolating patients with tuberculosis from other patients and strictly applying other hospital infection control practices (23, 24). Patients usually can be removed from airborne infection isolation when they are no longer considered infectious. Patients are no longer infectious when they are on adequate tuberculosis drug therapy, have had a significant clinical response to therapy, and have had negative results on 3 consecutive sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Some patients can be isolated from outsiders at home after appropriate evaluation and the initiation of outpatient treatment. Isolation of patients at home assumes that household contacts already have been exposed and that further exposure will not affect their outcomes. Two studies, one in India and one in Arkansas, showed similar rates of disease or infection in exposed household contacts whether the patient was admitted to the hospital or allowed to remain at home for initial treatment (25, 26). However, if household contacts of the patients with infectious tuberculosis are at high risk (for example, infants or immuno-compromised persons), housing the patient elsewhere until he or she meets noninfectious criteria should be strongly considered. Hospitalization may be required until housing can be obtained (27). Educating health care workers to evaluate exposed persons for active tuberculosis by obtaining sputum for AFB testing when they have respiratory symptoms has been shown to improve the case detection rates in primary care settings (28). What should clinicians tell patients with active tuberculosis to protect household members and other contacts from infection? Clinicians should teach patients to cough into disposable tissues and to cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing to contain droplet nuclei before they are expelled into the air. Patients who are placed in airborne infection isolation rooms should be educated about the transmission of tuberculosis, the reasons for isolation, and the importance of staying in their rooms. Every effort should be made to help the patient follow the isolation policy (29). Hospital employees and physicians who come in contact with an infectious or suspected infectious patient should wear previously fitted particulate respirators certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health for protection against tuberculosis, which does not include surgical masks. What are the physician's public health responsibilities after making a diagnosis of active tuberculosis? All 50 U.S. states require physicians to notify public health authorities about all patients suspected of having active tuberculosis (22, 23), which can enable identification of other cases and potentially prevent further transmission of tuberculosis in the community. Genetic fingerprinting of tuberculosis isolates during an outbreak can help public health authorities detect tuberculosis infection in the community (30). Clinical Bottom Line: Screening and Prevention Clinicians should screen persons who have close contact with a person who has active pulmonary tuberculosis, and screen other persons who are at high risk for infection or for progression to disease once infected. Clinicians should screen with TST or IGRAs and should prevent infection by identifying and treating persons with active pulmonary tuberculosis. Patient airborn infection isolation is an important part of early treatment and prevention of transmission. Persons who provide care to patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis should wear particulate respirators. Clinicians should notify public health authorities about patients with suspected active tuberculosis. Diagnosis What signs and symptoms suggest active tuberculosis? Although tuberculosis can cause disease in many parts of the body, this article focuses on pulmonary tuberculosis because it is the most common form of the disease. Clinicians should consider a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis and evaluate patients for tuberculosis if the patient has constitutional or pulmonary signs and symptoms, such as cough longer than 2 to 3 weeks (may not be productive until later in course of disease), hemoptysis (more likely with cavitation and rarely a presenting symptom), chest pain, fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, easy fatigability, or anorexia. Some patients have classic signs and symptoms, but it is rare for someone to have most of the classic signs and symptoms except in advanced disease, and many patients will have few of them. Some patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis infection can be fairly asymptomatic.

Thus the lip image synthesis plays an important role to realize a natural human-like face of computer agents. Moreover the synthesized lip movement images can compensate lack of auditory information for hearing impaired people. We propose a novel lip movement synthesis method based on mapping from input speech based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM). This paper compares the HMM-based method and a conventional method using vector quantization (VQ). In the experiment, error and time differential error between synthesized lip movement images and original ones are used for evaluation. The result shows that the error of the HMM based method is 8.7% smaller than that of the VQ-based method. Moreover, the HMM-based method reduces time differential error by 32% than the VQ's. The result also shows that the errors are mostly caused by phoneme /h/ and /Q/. Since lip shapes of those phonemes are strongly dependent on succeeding phoneme, the context dependent synthesis on the HMM-based method is applied to reduce the error. The improved HMM-based method realizes reduction of the error (differential error) by 10.5% (11%) compared with the original HMM-based method.",1998.0,23.0,135.0,"{'pages': '154-159', 'name': 'Proceedings Third IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Yamamoto1998LipMS,\n author = {E.

The key concept is that of ""threshold"": the number or proportion of others who must make one decision before a given actor does so; this is the point where net benefits begin to exceed net costs for that particular actor. Beginning with a frequency distribution of thresholds, the models allow calculation of the ultimate or ""equilibrium"" number making each decision. The stability of equilibrium results against various possible changes in threshold distributions is considered. Stress is placed on the importance of exact distributions distributions for outcomes. Groups with similar average preferences may generate very different results; hence it is hazardous to infer individual dispositions from aggregate outcomes or to assume that behavior was directed by ultimately agreed-upon norms.

Experiments 2 and 3 replicated this effect by showing that students used the pronoun tee more when describing a victory than a nonvktory of their school's football team.

Conventionally, GAs are neutralized to improve culture yields of mycobacteria. However, there are limited data to support this practice. To study the utility of neutralization of GAs with sodium bicarbonate in children with intrathoracic tuberculosis, a total of 116 children of either sex, aged 6 months to 14 years (median age, 120 months; interquartile range [IQR], 7 to 192 months), underwent gastric aspiration on 2 consecutive days. Gastric aspirates were divided into two aliquots, and only one aliquot was neutralized with 1% sodium bicarbonate. Both aliquots were processed for smear and culture examinations. Out of the 232 gastric aspirates, 12 (5.17%) were acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear positive. There were no differences in smear positivity rates from samples with or without neutralization. The yield of Mycobacterium tuberculosis on a Bactec MGIT 960 culture system was significantly lower in the neutralized samples (16.3% [38/232]) than in the nonneutralized samples (21.5% [50/232]) (P = 0.023). There was no significant difference between the neutralized and the nonneutralized samples in time to detection using the MGIT 960 system (average, 24.6 days; IQR, 12 to 37 days) (P = 0.9). The contamination rates were significantly higher in the neutralized samples than in the nonneutralized samples (17.2% [40/232] versus 3.9% [9/232]) (P = 0.001). The agreement for positive mycobacterial culture between the two approaches was 66.5% (P = 0.001). Hence, we recommend that gastric aspirate samples not be neutralized with sodium bicarbonate prior to culture for M. tuberculosis.",2013.0,21.0,27.0,"{'volume': '51', 'pages': '1753 - 1756', 'name': 'Journal of Clinical Microbiology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Parashar2013DoesNO,\n author = {D.

When tested independently, both of these processes have been usually observed to be atypical in individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC). However, it is not known how these processes interact with each other in relation to autistic traits. This study addresses this question by testing the impact of JA on SFM of happy faces using a truly interactive paradigm. Sixty‐two neurotypical participants engaged in gaze‐based social interaction with an anthropomorphic, gaze‐contingent virtual agent. The agent either established JA by initiating eye contact or looked away, before looking at an object and expressing happiness or disgust. Eye tracking was used to make the agent's gaze behavior and facial actions contingent to the participants' gaze. SFM of happy expressions was measured by Electromyography (EMG) recording over the Zygomaticus Major muscle. Results showed that JA augments SFM in individuals with low compared with high autistic traits. These findings are in line with reports of reduced impact of JA on action imitation in individuals with ASC. Moreover, they suggest that investigating atypical interactions between empathic processes, instead of testing these processes individually, might be crucial to understanding the nature of social deficits in autism.

All dental undergraduates attending a UK dental school were invited to complete a questionnaire on age, gender, year of study, EI, and PS. Two hundred and thirteen students (48 percent male) participated, a response rate of 70 percent. The mean score for EI was 117.54 (S.D. 14.90) and PS was 17.73 (S.D. 6.49). Factor analysis confirmed four factors previously identified in the literature as comprising emotional intelligence: optimism/mood regulation, utilization of emotions, appraisal of emotions, and social skills. T-tests indicated that females had significantly higher EI scores than males. Mean PS scores were significantly higher for students aged over twenty-one years compared with those aged twenty-one years or less (p < 0.001), female compared to male students (p < 0.05), and those in higher years compared to those in lower years of study (p < 0.001). Correlational analysis showed an inverse relationship between EI and PS. Multiple regression analysis identified year of study, optimism/mood regulation, and gender as independent, significant predictors of PS. In conclusion, low EI scorers report more PS.

Work-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an important condition encountered by many occupational health practitioners.


AIMS
To carry out an in-depth review of the research on occupational groups that are at particular risk of developing work-related PTSD.


METHODS
A literature search was conducted in the databases OVID MEDLINE, OVID Embase, Ovid PsycINFO, ISI Web of Science and CSA Health and Safety Science Abstracts.


RESULTS
Professionals such as police officers, firefighters and ambulance personnel often experience incidents that satisfy the stressor criterion for the PTSD diagnosis. Other professional groups such as health care professionals, train drivers, divers, journalists, sailors and employees in bank, post offices or in stores may also be subjected to work-related traumatic events. Work-related PTSD usually diminishes with time.


CONCLUSIONS
Mental health problems prior to the traumatic event and weak social support increase the risk of PTSD. Prevention of work-related PTSD includes a sound organizational and psychosocial work environment, systematic training of employees, social support from colleagues and managers and a proper follow-up of employees after a critical event.",2013.0,78.0,201.0,"{'volume': '63 3', 'pages': '\n          175-82\n        ', 'name': 'Occupational medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Skogstad2013WorkrelatedPS,\n author = {M.

These parameters, however, are specific to the crowd models and may be difficult for an animator or naive user to use. We propose mapping these parameters to personality traits. In this paper, we extend the HiDAC (High-Density Autonomous Crowds) system by providing each agent with a personality model in order to examine how the emergent behavior of the crowd is affected. We use the OCEAN personality model as a basis for agent psychology. To each personality trait we associate nominal behaviors; thus, specifying personality for an agent leads to an automation of the low-level parameter tuning process.

1887,93cde013e02a3432a3b8a2a613be1ac01680ad25,The expressive pattern of laughter,"Laughter as a vocal expressive-communicative signal is one of the least understood and most frequently overlooked human behaviors. The chapter provides an overview of what we know about laughter in terms of respiration, vocalization, facial action, and body movement and attempts to illustrate the mechanisms of laughter and to define its elements. The importance of discriminating between spontaneous and contrived laughter is pointed out and it is argued that unrestrained spontaneous laughter involves inarticulate vocalization. It is argued that we need research integrating the different systems in laughter including experience. Laughter is a conspicuous but frequently overlooked human phenomenon. In ontogenetic development it emerges, later than smiling, around the fourth month; however, cases of gelastic epilepsy (from Greek; gelos = laughter) among neonates demonstrate that all structures are there and functional on date of birth. Further evidence for its innateness comes from twin studies as well as from the fact that laughter is easily observable among deaf-blind children (even among deaf-blind thalidomide children, who could not ""learn"" laughter by touching people's faces). Man is not the only animal that laughs. Like smiling, laughter has its equivalent in the repertoire of some nonhuman primates. Beginning with Darwin (1872), many writers have been struck by the notable acoustic, orofacial, and contextual similarities between chimpanzee and human laughter. Especially among juvenile chimpanzees a ""play-face"" with associated vocalization was noted to accompany actions such as play, tickling, or play-biting (Preuschoft, 1995; van Hooff, 1972). 1. Laughter as an Inarticulate Utterance Laughter is estimated to be about 7 million years old (Niemitz, 1990). There is disagreement on how human speech developed phylogenetically. It could have originated from non-verbal vocal utterances, a prelingual gestural system, or sounds initially used to supplement the facial channel. However, it is safe to assume that laughter –like other utterances such as moan, sigh, cry, groan, etc.– was there before man developed speech and served as an expressive-communicative social signal. Considering the stage in the evolution of voice when laughter emerged allows us to make several deductions about the nature of the sound, its generation and the cerebral organization of laughter. If laughter was part of the human vocal repertoire before the speech centers were developed, it is likely that the sound was generated almost exclusively by laryngeal modulations, modified to some degree by supralaryngeal activity but not by articulation. This is because articulation requires voluntary control over the vocal system. Thus the production of speech sounds needs the coordination of respiration, phonation, resonance, and articulation, an analysis of laughter will involve mainly the consideration of the first three. But is it consistent with current knowledge to hypothesize that a laugh-pulse –a vocalization segment initiated by an aspirated ""h"" type sound followed by the utterance of one of several vowel sounds that is then abruptly terminated– is an inarticulate sound? Indeed, the /h/, an voiceless fricative glottal sound, is the only consonant produced at the level of the larynx; but as laughter is not ""speech"" we should not expect phonemes of a language to be uttered. Likewise, the assumption of resting articulators would suggest that the laughter ""vowel"" (but also the sound for other prelingual utterances, such as moaning or utterances of astonishment) is the central vowel schwa, or /e/ (as in about). For the production of this ""neutral vowel"" one needs to open the mouth and lower the jaw, but keep all other articulators passive. We know from everyday experience that there is a tremendous variety in the quality of the laughing sounds, so obviously deviations from the schwa occur. This does not contradict the hypothesis of an inarticulate vocalization per se but puts forward the task of defining the deviations from the resting articulation position that are due to altered emotional states and separate them from those supralaryngeal conditions modulating the sound that are due to voluntary actions. A second factor that we need to take into account is that there are different ways to generate laughing sounds and it is possible to intentionally modulate the emotion-driven spontaneous laughter. As the cerebral organization of vocal behavior progressed phylogenetically after these early facio-vocal signals became hardwired, higher centers obtained control over the laughter ""timer"". Thus, in addition to laughing spontaneously (emotional laughter), we can laugh voluntarily or on command (contrived or faked laughter), and we can even speak or sing the laughing sounds, which typically are phonetically represented as ""ha ha ha."" These forms of utterances differ in degree of volitional control and –inversely– emotionality, and imply different neural pathways and systems involved (for reviews of neuronal control of vocalization see, for example, Jürgens, 1998; Ploog, 1986; for reviews or models of laughter: Arroyo et al., 1993; Fried et al., 1998). The distinction made between spontaneous and voluntary laughter is consistent with clinical observations; certain patients with degenerative brain disorders may be unable to move their abdomen voluntarily, but demonstrate vigorous expiratory movement of the abdomen when laughing spontaneously (Bright et al., 1986). Finally, it should be noted that there are also voluntary attempts to regulate spontaneous laughter; for sake of brevity the combination of voluntary and spontaneous in regulated laughter is only mentioned here. In spontaneous laughter we are following an impulse, an urge to laugh without restraining ourselves. There is no attempt to suppress the response or exert any control over its expression; the laughing person has been described as abandoning himself or herself to the body response (Plessner, 1941). The involuntary aspect can also be seen in the fact that during laughter our self-awareness and self-attention is diminished. Trying to direct attention during a laughter episode stops or reduces laughter. During laughter the state of consciousness is altered; as Hall and Allin (1897; p. 8-9) put it: ""[t]he objective world has vanished and is forgotten, the proprieties and even the presence of others are lost, and the soul is all eye and ear to the one laughable object. Care, trouble, and even physical pain are forgotten, and the mind, as it were, falls back through unnumbered millennia and catches a glimpse of that primeval paradise where joy was intense and supreme."" While descriptions of emotional experience are rather sparse and reports of subjects mainly refer to the awareness of the impulse to laugh, spontaneous laughter is clearly enjoyable. In voluntary laughter we may want to produce a sound pattern like that of natural laughter. A typical everyday situation demanding faked laughter is when we want to signal somebody that we enjoyed a humorous message and join the laughter of others but actually do not feel any enjoyment. While voluntary laughter may pass over into involuntary laughter, we can not voluntarily produce emotional laughter. Interestingly, research has shown that contrived and spontaneous laughter within a person are strikingly similar with respect to the respirational pattern (suggesting a ""laughter signature""); however, it is doubtful whether this is also the case for supralaryngeal systems. The many ways in which they differ still need to be described; this will be especially important when studying individual differences as laughter gets socialized during ontogenetic development. Research has made use of the fact that we can voluntarily alter key features, and thus studies of laughter at different vowels, pitch, and voice quality exist (Citardi et al., 1996; Habermann, 1955). Laughing on command is embarrassing to some, and thus the results obtained for contrived laughter are of limited value for describing spontaneous laughter as it may merge voluntary movements with unintended affective states. Speaking or singing ""ha ha"" allows modulating the sound in many ways (e.g., stretching the length of vowels, emphasizing particular syllables), just as with other spoken words. As with voluntary laughter we intend to produce a particular sound pattern and we have even more control over the outcome; the major difference being that phonation is not based on forced breathing but on well dosed air supply resulting in less tracheal resonance, breathiness, and aspiration. Spoken laugh sounds may be devoid of emotional intonation; thus there will be less variability in melody, and the utterance will be more clearly articulated and often match the phonemes of a language. Emotional laughter and speech are rather independent; in fact, laughter and speech may co-occur, thereby lengthening the duration of laugh-pulses (Nwokah et al., in press). It remains to be verified that damage of the higher speech centers has little impact on the expression of tickle-induced emotional laughter. 2. Description of Laughter Laughter is not a term used consistently, nor is it precisely defined in research articles and even encyclopedias. In everyday life a smiling face is often referred to as ""laughter"" although the vocal element is entirely missing. Research studies usually focus on one or two systems of laughter rather than the integration of all the components involved. For example, a study of the acoustics of laughter typically restricts the investigation to the phonatory system and may arrive at the conclusion that the duration of laughter is, say, below two seconds. Sound production is contingent on air flow and the deviation from resting breathing exceeds the rhythmic forced exhalations underlying laughter by far; therefore duration estimates of eight seconds are not uncommon in respiration studies (",2001.0,50.0,268.0,"{'volume': '', 'pages': '426-443', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Ruch2001TheEP,\n author = {W.

The MBMS model utilizes real human motion samples recorded in motion capture experiments as templates for simulating novel motions. Such human motion samples are stored in a motion database. When a user submits an input simulation scenario to the model, a motion search engine termed the ldquoroot motion finderrdquo in the model searches the motion database and retrieves the motion samples that closely match the given scenario. The retrieved motions, referred to as root motions, may significantly differ from one another in the underlying movement technique. Such variability within the root motion set is analyzed and graphically summarized by a model component termed the motion variability analyzer. This analysis helps users rapidly identify alternative movement techniques for the given input simulation scenario and simulate human motions based on alternative movement techniques. Since root motions do not exactly satisfy but only closely match the input simulation scenario, a motion modification (MoM) algorithm adapts them to fit the scenario by systematically deforming them in the joint angle-time domain. The MoM algorithm retains the root motions' fundamental spatial-temporal structure and minimizes deviations from the root motions during such deformations. The MBMS model overcomes limitations of existing simulation models and achieves the following: 1) simulation of categorically different motions based on a single unified model; 2) simple and efficient learning of new motion behaviors; and 3) representation and simulation of human motion variability.",2008.0,39.0,38.0,"{'volume': '38', 'pages': '513-527', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Park2008MemoryBasedHM,\n author = {W.

Such symptoms include pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and retching, anxiety and depression. There is a gap in the relevant literature on the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural and relaxation techniques in symptom clusters. The study reflects this gap in the literature and aimed to test the effectiveness of Guided Imagery (GI) and Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) on a cluster of symptoms experienced by patients undergoing chemotherapy. Methods This was a randomized control trial with 208 patients equally assigned either in the intervention or the control group. Measurements in both groups were collected at baseline and at completion of intervention (4 weeks). Patients were assessed for pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and retching, anxiety and depression. The overall management of the cluster was also assessed based on the patients’ self-reported health related quality of life-HRQoL. Chi-square tests (X2), independent T-tests and Linear Mixed Models were calculated. Results Patients in the intervention group experienced lower levels of Fatigue (p<0.0.0225), and Pain (p = 0.0003) compared to those in the control group and experienced better HRQoL (p<0.0001) [PRE-POST: Intervention: Pain 4.2(2.5) - 2.5(1.6), Fatigue 27.6(4.1) - 19.3(4.1), HRQoL 54.9(22.7) - 64.5(23), Control: Pain 3.5(1.7) - 4.8(1.5), Fatigue 28.7(4.1) - 32.5(3.8), HRQoL 51.9(22.3)– 41.2(24.1)]. Nausea, vomiting and retching occurred significantly less often in the intervention group [pre-post: 25.4(5.9)– 20.6(5.6) compared to the control group (17.8(6.5)– 22.7(5.3) (F = 58.50 p<0.0001). More patients in the control group (pre:n = 33-post:n = 47) were found to be moderately depressed compared to those in the intervention group (pre:n = 35-post:n = 15) (X2 = 5.93; p = 0.02). Conclusion This study provided evidence that the combination of GI and PMR can be effective in the management of a cluster of symptoms in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.

Echo planar imaging with simultaneous acquisition of four coronal slices separated by 44mm and simultaneous 4‐fold phase‐encoding undersampling, resulting in 16‐fold acceleration and up to 16‐fold maximal aliasing, was investigated. Task/stimulus‐induced signal changes and temporal signal behavior under basal conditions were comparable for multiband and standard single‐band excitation and longer pulse repetition times. Robust, whole‐brain functional mapping at 7 T, with 2 × 2 × 2mm3 (pulse repetition time 1.25 sec) and 1 × 1 × 2mm3 (pulse repetition time 1.5 sec) resolutions, covering fields of view of 256 × 256 × 176mm3 and 192 × 172 × 176mm3, respectively, was demonstrated with current gradient performance.

Virtual environments can be incredible training tools if used properly and used for the correct training application. Virtual environments have already been very successful in training Warfighters how to operate vehicles and weapons systems. At the Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) we have been exploring a new question: can virtual environments be used to train Warfighters in interpersonal skills such as negotiation, tactical questioning and leadership that are so critical for success in the contemporary operating environment? Using embodied conversational agents to create this type of training system has been one of the goals of the Virtual Humans project at the institute. ICT has a great deal of experience building complex, integrated and immersive training systems that address the human factor needs for training experiences. This paper will address the research, technology and value of developing virtual humans for training environments. This research includes speech recognition, natural language understanding & generation, dialogue management, cognitive agents, emotion modeling, question response managers, speech generation and non-verbal behavior. Also addressed will be the diverse set of training environments we have developed for the system, from single computer laptops to multi-computer immersive displays to real and virtual integrated environments. This paper will also discuss the problems, issues and solutions we encountered while building these systems. The paper will recount subject testing we have performed in these environments and results we have obtained from users.

Individuals in the population vary markedly on this trait, ranging from frequent and intense emotional reactions to minor challenges to little emotional reaction even in the face of significant difficulties. Although not widely appreciated, there is growing evidence that neuroticism is a psychological trait of profound public health significance. Neuroticism is a robust correlate and predictor of many different mental and physical disorders, comorbidity among them, and the frequency of mental and general health service use. Indeed, neuroticism apparently is a predictor of the quality and longevity of our lives. Achieving a full understanding of the nature and origins of neuroticism, and the mechanisms through which neuroticism is linked to mental and physical disorders, should be a top priority for research. Knowing why neuroticism predicts such a wide variety of seemingly diverse outcomes should lead to improved understanding of commonalities among those outcomes and improved strategies for preventing them.",2009.0,235.0,1442.0,"{'volume': '64 4', 'pages': '\n          241-56\n        ', 'name': 'The American psychologist'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lahey2009PublicHS,\n author = {B.

The results confirm Becker’s deterrence hypothesis. Moreover, crowding out of pro-social behavior occurs due to deterrence incentives: when deterrence incentives first exist and are removed later on, subsequent behavior is more selfish than without this deterrence history. This study offers evidence that (part of this) crowding out takes place via change of emotions. Without deterrence incentives in place, in a variant of the dictator game, players with pro-social emotions steal less. When players face expected punishment, pro-social emotions are deactivated and do not decrease stealing; in this case, self-centered emotions get activated and motivate greater stealing. This study provides support for theories on emotions in behavioral criminal law and economics and offers new insights for deterrence policy.

It was hypothesized that cross-situational consistency would be substantial, and that trait aggression would have the greatest impact on aggressive behavior in ambiguous situations. Participants were 80 female and 38 male undergraduate students. They completed the Aggression Questionnaire [Buss and Perry, J Pers Soc Psychol, 1992, pp. 452], read a set of 24 vignettes depicting conflict situations and rated their perceived likelihood of becoming angry and aggressive in those situations. An overall cross-situational consistency correlation coefficient of r=.47 was found. It was also found that trait aggression had a significantly greater effect on the likelihood of aggressive responses in the ambiguous and intentional situations than it did in the unintentional situations.

The results indicate that social context shapes action planning and that in the context of a social interaction, flexible online adjustments take place between partners. These observations provide novel insights on the social dimension of motor planning and control.",2010.0,28.0,108.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '183 - 188', 'name': 'Current Directions in Psychological Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Becchio2010TowardY,\n author = {C.

To contain its spread, China adopted unprecedented nationwide interventions on January 23 2020. These policies included large-scale quarantine, strict controls on travel and extensive monitoring of suspected cases. However, it is unknown whether these policies have had an impact on the epidemic. We sought to show how these control measures impacted the containment of the epidemic. Methods We integrated population migration data before and after January 23 and most updated COVID-19 epidemiological data into the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model to derive the epidemic curve. We also used an artificial intelligence (AI) approach, trained on the 2003 SARS data, to predict the epidemic. Results We found that the epidemic of China should peak by late February, showing gradual decline by end of April. A five-day delay in implementation would have increased epidemic size in mainland China three-fold. Lifting the Hubei quarantine would lead to a second epidemic peak in Hubei province in mid-March and extend the epidemic to late April, a result corroborated by the machine learning prediction. Conclusions Our dynamic SEIR model was effective in predicting the COVID-19 epidemic peaks and sizes. The implementation of control measures on January 23 2020 was indispensable in reducing the eventual COVID-19 epidemic size.",2020.0,17.0,1123.0,"{'volume': '12', 'pages': '165 - 174', 'name': 'Journal of Thoracic Disease'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Yang2020ModifiedSA,\n author = {Zi-feng Yang and Zhiqi Zeng and Ke Wang and Sook-san Wong and W.

It is also about generating evasion routing for the agents in virtual environment such as in crowd simulation. It consists of three processes which are construction of Field of Vision, Collision handling and collision response. Constructing field of vision is always a daunting task and always in enigma for the designer because it is subjected towards agent’s perception which is varies to each of them. There are few attempts on designing field of vision based on the agent’s dynamic focus toward its surrounding. Therefore, we present a top down approach study from crowd simulation modeling until the collision handling level in order to identify the suitable crowd modeling for our approach. Hence, at the end of this paper we will be able to discuss the possible techniques for constructing agent’s field of vision and analyze its potential in crowd simulation environment.

The use of computers in the treatment of autistic children is highly controversial and emotional among parents and professionals. Fears of reinforcing autistic withdrawal are often mixed with insecurity and dislike of new technologies. On the other hand, positive effects of CAI on learning and behaviour are reported by parents and published as single case studies. The following paper relates perception, motivation, communication and behaviour--characteristics of autistic children to features of computer-assisted learning. Preliminary findings support the benefit of the use of computer-technology for the management of behaviour and learning of autistic children. In 12 autistics, video-taped evaluations showed higher enthusiasm ratings in computer-sessions than personal instruction sessions. Single case-studies demonstrated a positive influence of CAI on autistic children's behaviour-problems (e.g. avoidance of eye contact, echolalia) as well as improved spontaneous communication and better learning of academics.",1990.0,0.0,61.0,"{'volume': '19 5', 'pages': '\n          611-6\n        ', 'name': 'Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bernard-Opitz1990ComputerAI,\n author = {V.

One of the key skills to reading and writing is the ability to represent thoughts symbolically and share them in language with an audience who may not necessarily share the same temporal and spatial context. Children learn and practice these important language skills everyday, telling stories with the peers and adults around them. In particular, storytelling in the context of peer collaboration provides a key environment for children to learn language skills important for literacy. In light of this, an embodied conversational agent, Sam, who tells stories collaboratively with children was designed. Sam looks like a peer for pre-school children, but tells stories in a developmentally advanced way, modelling narrative skills important for literacy. Results demonstrated that children who played with the virtual peer told stories that more closely resembled the virtual peer's linguistically advanced stories: using more quoted speech and temporal and spatial expressions. In addition, children listened to Sam's stories carefully, assisting her and suggesting improvements.

1939,97ede42d86fabe465528893561dec04da6947bbb,EVA 2.0: Emotional and rational multimodal argumentation between virtual agents,"Abstract Persuasive argumentation depends on multiple aspects, which include not only the content of the individual arguments, but also the way they are presented. The presentation of arguments is crucial – in particular in the context of dialogical argumentation. However, the effects of different discussion styles on the listener are hard to isolate in human dialogues. In order to demonstrate and investigate various styles of argumentation, we propose a multi-agent system in which different aspects of persuasion can be modelled and investigated separately. Our system utilizes argument structures extracted from text-based reviews for which a minimal bias of the user can be assumed. The persuasive dialogue is modelled as a dialogue game for argumentation that was motivated by the objective to enable both natural and flexible interactions between the agents. In order to support a comparison of factual against affective persuasion approaches, we implemented two fundamentally different strategies for both agents: The logical policy utilizes deep Reinforcement Learning in a multi-agent setup to optimize the strategy with respect to the game formalism and the available argument. In contrast, the emotional policy selects the next move in compliance with an agent emotion that is adapted to user feedback to persuade on an emotional level. The resulting interaction is presented to the user via virtual avatars and can be rated through an intuitive interface.",2021.0,44.0,1.0,"{'name': 'it - Information Technology', 'pages': '17 - 30', 'volume': '63'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rach2021EVA2E,\n author = {Niklas Rach and Klaus Weber and Yuchi Yang and Stefan Ultes and E.

Our results show that commercial systems mainly avoid answering, while rule-based chatbots show a variety of behaviours and often deflect. Data-driven systems, on the other hand, are often non-coherent, but also run the risk of being interpreted as flirtatious and sometimes react with counter-aggression.

To aid the understanding of how urbanisation has influenced anthropogenic CO2 and air pollutant emissions across all world regions, we make use of the latest developments of the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research. In this study, we systematically analyse over 5 decades of emissions from different types of human settlements (from urban centres to rural areas) for different sectors in all countries. Our analysis shows that by 2015, urban centres were the source of a third of global anthropogenic greenhouse gases and most of the air pollutant emissions. The high levels of both population and emissions in urban centres therefore call for focused urban mitigation efforts. Moreover, despite the overall increase in urban emissions, megacities with more than 10 million inhabitants in high-income countries have been reducing their emissions, while emissions in developing regions are still growing.

1945,98ab45160269f7c1545f7924f989d5da1895e9a5,The Uncanny Valley [From the Field],"More than 40 years ago, Masahiro Mori, a robotics professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, wrote an essay [1] on how he envisioned people's reactions to robots that looked and acted almost like a human. In particular, he hypothesized that a person's response to a humanlike robot would abruptly shift from empathy to revulsion as it approached, but failed to attain, a lifelike appearance. This descent into eeriness is known as the uncanny valley. The essay appeared in an obscure Japanese journal called Energy in 1970, and in subsequent years, it received almost no attention. However, more recently, the concept of the uncanny valley has rapidly attracted interest in robotics and other scientific circles as well as in popular culture. Some researchers have explored its implications for human-robot interaction and computer-graphics animation, whereas others have investigated its biological and social roots. Now interest in the uncanny valley should only intensify, as technology evolves and researchers build robots that look human. Although copies of Mori's essay have circulated among researchers, a complete version hasn't been widely available. The following is the first publication of an English translation that has been authorized and reviewed by Mori.

Evaluating the Relation Between Presence, Self-Reported Anxiety, and Heart Rate in a Virtual Public Speaking Task","The link between anxiety and presence in a virtual environment (VE) is still a subject of an unresolved debate, with little empirical research to support theoretical claims. Thus, the current study analyzed presence, self-reported anxiety, and a physiological parameter (heart rate [HR]) in a sample of 30 high anxious and 35 low anxious participants. Both groups delivered a 5 minute speech in a virtual lecture hall. Results indicate no mediating influences of presence on group differences in self-reported state anxiety during the speech, but point toward negative correlations between state anxiety and the iGroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ) scales ""sense of being there"" and ""realism."" Furthermore, HR was found to be unrelated to self-reported presence. Only the IPQ scale ""spatial presence"" showed a marginally significant influence on group differences in state anxiety. The present results support the assumption that presence and anxiety are logically distinct, meaning that presence does not directly influence the intensity of an emotion felt in a VE. Rather, it constitutes a precondition for an emotion to be at all elicited by a VE. Also, HR has proven to be no adequate substitute measure for presence, since it only assesses anxiety not presence. It may, however, mediate the interplay between trait anxiety and state anxiety. Possible implications of the current findings are discussed alongside the problem of using presence questionnaires that seem to be prone to subjective bias (i.e., participants confusing presence and emotion).",2014.0,23.0,48.0,"{'volume': '17 5', 'pages': '\n          310-6\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Felnhofer2014AfraidTB,\n author = {A.

This article advocates a resource management perspective on making this decision, in which the investigator seeks a strategic balance between service to scientific objectives and economy. Considerations in making design decisions include whether research questions are framed as main effects or simple effects; whether and which effects are aliased (confounded) in a particular design; the number of experimental conditions that must be implemented in a particular design and the number of experimental subjects the design requires to maintain the desired level of statistical power; and the costs associated with implementing experimental conditions and obtaining experimental subjects. In this article 4 design options are compared: complete factorial, individual experiments, single factor, and fractional factorial. Complete and fractional factorial designs and single-factor designs are generally more economical than conducting individual experiments on each factor. Although relatively unfamiliar to behavioral scientists, fractional factorial designs merit serious consideration because of their economy and versatility.",2009.0,56.0,334.0,"{'volume': '14 3', 'pages': '\n          202-24\n        ', 'name': 'Psychological methods'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Collins2009DesignOE,\n author = {L.

Despite this, interventions aimed at reducing stress have low adherence rates. The proliferation of mobile phone devices along with gaming-style applications allows for a unique opportunity to broaden the reach and appeal of stress-reduction interventions in modern society. We assessed the effectiveness of two smartphone applications games combined with biofeedback in reducing stress. Methods: We compared a control game to gaming-style smartphone applications combined with a skin conductance biofeedback device (the Pip). Fifty participants aged between 18 and 35 completed the Trier Social Stress Test. They were then randomly assigned to the intervention (biofeedback game) or control group (a non-biofeedback game) for thirty minutes. Perceived stress, heart rate and mood were measured before and after participants had played the games. Results: A mixed factorial ANOVA showed a significant interaction between time and game type in predicting perceived stress [F(1,48) = 14.19, p < 0.001]. Participants in the biofeedback intervention had significantly reduced stress compared to the control group. There was also a significant interaction between time and game in predicting heart rate [F(1,48) = 6.41, p < 0.05]. Participants in the biofeedback intervention showed significant reductions in heart rate compared to the control group.

However, many other variables influence proximity, such as appearance characteristics of the virtual character (e.g., attractiveness, etc.). Our study focuses on proximity to virtual walkers in virtual reality (VR), where gender could be inferred from motion only. We applied a set of male and female walking motions (motion capture) to a wooden mannequin, and displayed them to the participant embodied in a virtual avatar in VR. Participants used the controller to stop the approaching mannequin when they felt it was uncomfortably close to them. We hypothesized that proximity will be affected by the gender of the character, but also the gender of the participant. We additionally expected some motions to be rated more attractive than others and that attractive motions would reduce the proximity measure. Our results show support for the last two assumptions, but no difference in proximity was found according to the gender of the character’s motion.

In the recent years, the idea of using computers in the teaching learning environment has been accepted. The challenge has been in developing software that are appropriate as well as emotionally engaging for the teaching and learning environment. The idea of introducing emotions in educational software creates a sense of human to human interaction when interacting with a computer. Emotions give life to software agents, making them believable in a virtual learning environment. In this research, we use the psychoanalytic theory (“Freudian” theory) of transference of emotions in developing emotional virtual agents that can act as math tutors using Scratch programming language. The major components of the tutorial program include animations, sound and icons that will help the young children understand the tutorials. The designed tutorial program is highly interactive, user friendly, and also encourages the students as well as the teachers to participate in an amusing virtual learning environment.

This virtual coach is capable of supporting and adapting to the needs of human students, helping them in their tasks based on their intentions, motivations and feelings. By gathering objective and subjective user data, the virtual coach is able to interpret learning situations of individual users and, with the use of a synthetic character with analogous mannerisms to those of an actual human, help them by modulating their emotional state in the context of the learning process.

Previous work has focused on using audiovisual movie content to predict movie induced emotions. However, the relationship between the audience's perceptions of the affective movie content (perceived emotions) and the emotions evoked in the audience (induced emotions) remains unexplored. In this work, we address the relationship between perceived and induced emotions in movies, and identify features and modelling approaches effective for predicting movie induced emotions. First, we extend the LIRIS-ACCEDE database by annotating perceived emotions in a crowd-sourced manner, and find that perceived and induced emotions are not always consistent. Second, we show that dialogue events and aesthetic highlights are effective predictors of movie induced emotions. In addition to movie based features, we also study physiological and behavioural measurements of audiences. Our experiments show that induced emotion recognition can benefit from including temporal context and from including multimodal information. Our study bridges the gap between affective content analysis and induced emotion prediction.",2017.0,44.0,21.0,"{'pages': '28-35', 'name': '2017 Seventh International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tian2017RecognizingIE,\n author = {Leimin Tian and Michal Muszynski and Catherine Lai and Johanna D.

1962,99b0926673c7a727eff3697d579ce1a69056fc75,Relaxation with Immersive Natural Scenes Presented Using Virtual Reality.,"INTRODUCTION
Virtual reality (VR) can provide exposure to nature for those living in isolated confined environments. We evaluated VR-presented natural settings for reducing stress and improving mood.


METHODS
There were 18 participants (9 men, 9 women), ages 32 ± 12 yr, who viewed three 15-min 360° scenes (an indoor control, rural Ireland, and remote beaches). Subjects were mentally stressed with arithmetic before scenes. Electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate variability measured psycho-physiological arousal. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the 15-question Modified Reality Judgment and Presence Questionnaire (MRJPQ) measured mood and scene quality.


RESULTS
Reductions in EDA from baseline were greater at the end of the natural scenes compared to the control scene (-0.59, -0.52, and 0.32 μS, respectively). The natural scenes reduced negative affect from baseline ( 1.2 and 1.1 points), but the control scene did not ( 0.4 points). MRJPQ scores for the control scene were lower than both natural scenes (4.9, 6.7, and 6.5 points, respectively). Within the two natural scenes, the preferred scene reduced negative affect ( 2.4 points) more than the second choice scene ( 1.8 points) and scored higher on the MRJPQ (6.8 vs. 6.4 points).


DISCUSSION
Natural scene VR provided relaxation both objectively and subjectively, and scene preference had a significant effect on mood and perception of scene quality. VR may enable relaxation for people living in isolated confined environments, particularly when matched to personal preferences.Anderson AP, Mayer MD, Fellows AM, Cowan DR, Hegel MT, Buckey JC.

Three predominant procedures were defined in the framework: knowledge representation, dynamic knowledge transmission, and knowledge-guided wayfinding. First, a semantic-based layered structure is designed to represent knowledge about the unfamiliar environment. Second, to capture important influential factors for knowledge transmission, such as personal influential radius and personal abilities of expressing and assimilating knowledge, we construct a model of personalized knowledge transmission. Third, a probability-based knowledge-guided wayfinding model is presented to produce diverse actions and allow the individuals to adapt to knowledge changes in an unfamiliar environment. Finally, a crowd simulation system is implemented to visualize the analysis in a graphical manner. The proposed method is expected to provide guidance for emergency management especially when the crowd has incomplete knowledge of the environment.",2018.0,31.0,16.0,"{'volume': '6', 'pages': '72581-72593', 'name': 'IEEE Access'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zhang2018KnowledgeBasedCM,\n author = {Guijuan Zhang and Dianjie Lu and Lei Lv and Hui Yu and Hong Liu},\n journal = {IEEE Access},\n pages = {72581-72593},\n title = {Knowledge-Based Crowd Motion for the Unfamiliar Environment},\n volume = {6},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '3172102', 'name': 'Guijuan Zhang'}, {'authorId': '7382513', 'name': 'Dianjie Lu'}, {'authorId': '2054672421', 'name': 'Lei Lv'}, {'authorId': '2118681994', 'name': 'Hui Yu'}, {'authorId': '2118902760', 'name': 'Hong Liu'}]"

FACS is used to objectively measure the frequency and intensity of facial expressions without assigning any emotional meaning to those muscle movements. Instead FACS breaks down facial expressions into their smallest discriminable movements called Action Units. Each Action Unit creates a distinct change in facial appearance, such as an eyebrow lift or nose wrinkle. FACS coders can identify the Action Units which are present on the face when viewing still images or videos. Psychological research has used FACS to examine a variety of research questions including social-emotional development, neuropsychiatric disorders, and deception. In the course of this report we provide an overview of FACS and the Action Units, its reliability as a measure, and how it has been applied in some key areas of psychological research.",2015.0,11.0,1478.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Prince2015FacialAC,\n author = {E.

Such methods may be mathematically justifiable but are not necessarily valid from a perceptual point of view. The research reported here starts by user experiments aiming at understanding how people combine facial actions to express mixed emotions, and how the viewers perceive a set of facial actions in terms of underlying emotions. Using the results of these experiments and a three-dimensional emotion model, we associate facial actions to dimensions and regions in the emotion space, and create a facial expression based on the location of the mixed emotion in the three-dimensional space.

1979,9aebf48bb891c24970e6aeaf8b057311d930d9dd,"Modeling realistic high density autonomous agent crowd movement: social forces, communication, roles and psychological influences","The simulation of realistic, large, dense crowds of autonomous agents is still a challenge for the computer graphics community. Typical approaches either look like particle simulations (where agents 'vibrate' back and forth) or are conservative in the range of motion possible (agents aren't allowed to 'push' each other). Our HiDAC system (High Density Autonomous Crowds) focuses on the problem of simulating the local motion behaviors of crowds moving in a natural manner within dynamically changing virtual environments. This is achieved by applying a combination of psychological and geometrical rules layered on top of a social forces model. The results show: elimination of agent 'shaking' behavior, fast perception, and a wide variety of emergent behaviors including: bi-directional flows, overtaking, emergent queuing with different line widths, agents being 'pushed' and 'falling', and panic propagation. These behaviors emerge based on the current situation, agent personality and perceived density of the crowd. 
To accurately simulate crowds in large, complex environments, it is not enough to only model local motion; agents must also have the ability to navigate the unknown virtual environment. We therefore address the problems that arise during crowd navigation where not all individuals have complete knowledge of the building's internal structure. In addition, we simulate the effects of communication on the behavior of autonomous agents while exploring the building. We have developed a system called MACES (Multi-Agent Communication for Evacuation Simulation) which combines local motion with wayfinding using inter-agent communication and different roles. Together they automatically augment an agent's mental map of the environment to produce empirically better maze evacuation performance. 
We study the emergent behavior during building evacuation under different conditions such as agents using communication to share their knowledge of the building routes and hazards, psychological factors driving different navigation skills, and agents taking different roles such as trained personnel, leaders and followers. The experimental results show significant improvements in evacuation rates with inter-agent communication and demonstrate that only a relatively small percentage of trained leaders yield evacuation rates comparable to the case where all are trained. 
The framework presented in this dissertation combines decision making, including communication and roles (MACES), with local motion (HiDAC). The two systems interact in real-time while being driven by a set of psychological and physiological parameters that allow the user to have control over the final behavior exhibited by the crowd.",2006.0,93.0,16.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Badler2006ModelingRH,\n author = {N.

The emotions people feel shape the ways in which they respond to persuasion attempts, and the emotions people express influence other individuals who observe those expressions. This chapter is concerned with the latter type of emotional influence. Such interpersonal effects of emotional expressions are quite different from the traditionally studied intrapersonal effects of emotional experience. This calls for a new theoretical approach that is dedicated specifically to understanding the interpersonal effects of emotional expressions. I summarize emotions as social information (EASI) theory, which posits that emotional expressions shape social influence by triggering affective reactions and/or inferential processes in observers, depending on the observer’s information processing and the perceived appropriateness of the emotional expression. I review supportive evidence from various domains of social influence, including negotiation, leadership, attitude change, compliance, and conformity in groups. Differences and commonalities with traditional intrapersonal frameworks are discussed.",2017.0,132.0,9.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Kleef2017EmotionsAA,\n author = {van Kleef},\n title = {Emotions as agents of social influence: insights from Emotions as Social Information (EASI) theory},\n year = {2017}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '148298087', 'name': 'van Kleef'}]"

We presented subjects with 15 interpersonal distances ranging from 40 to 250 cm and obtained verbal and joystick-based ratings of discomfort. Whereas discomfort rose immediately when personal space was entered, the gradient was less steep for distances that exceeded the comfort region of personal space.

He referred to this dip in familiarity and corresponding surge in strangeness as the uncanny valley. The eerie sensation associated with a mismatch between human expectations and a robot’s behavior provides a useful source of feedback to improve the cognitive models implemented in the robot. Is the uncanny valley a necessary property of near-humanlike forms? This paper contributes to ongoing work in understanding the nature and causes of the uncanny valley by means of an experiment: 56 participants were asked to rate 13 robots and 1 human, shown in video clips, on a very mechanical (1) to very humanlike (9) scale, a very strange (1) to very familiar (9) scale, and a not eerie (0) to extremely eerie (10) scale. Contrary to earlier studies with morphs [MacDorman and Ishiguro, 2006], plots of average and median values for ratings on these scales do not reveal a single U-shaped valley as predicted by Mori’s uncanny valley hypothesis [1970], although his hypothesis allows for some variation owing to movement. Robots rated similarly on the mechanical versus humanlike scale can be rated quite differently on the strange versus familiar or the eeriness scales. The results indicate that the perceived human likeness of a robot is not the only factor determining the perceived familiarity, strangeness, or eeriness of the robot. This suggests that other factors could be manipulated to vary the familiarity, strangeness, or eeriness of a robot independently of its human likeness. Introduction To build robots that at least superficially approach human likeness is leading to insights in human perception and face-to-face interaction. These android robots possess the physical presence that simulated characters lack, yet can be more perfectly controlled than any human actor, to isolate the factor under study. Even in experiments in which the android’s responses are identical, we can observe how human responses vary according to their beliefs. For example, Japanese participants showed the same modesty with their eyes by averting gaze downward when interacting with an android as when interacting with a human interlocutor if they believed the android were under human control by telepresence [MacDorman et al., 2005]. In addition, androids provide an ideal testing ground for theories from the social and cognitive sciences because competing models can be implemented in an android and then tested by letting the android interact with industrial robot humanoid robot",2006.0,8.0,236.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Macdorman2006SubjectiveRO,\n author = {K.

We dismiss the traditional dichotomy between reactive and symbolic architectures. A classiication in terms of the amount of knowledge embedded in the system is made, instead, running from regulatory to planning to adaptive agents. Regulatory agents are implementable as control systems or automata, and represent the ideal case in which the agent has all the knowledge it needs. We nd that each type of agent is best suited for a particular kind of behavior. The diierent kinds of behavior form a hierarchy in terms of frequency of occurrence and response time, and do not gracefully reduce to each other. This suggests implementing agents as hierarchies of simpler agents, each specialized in the kind of behavior it implements. In this scheme, agents at one level act through agents at the next lower level. We introduce the concept of drive to address the issue of where an agent's goals come from. A discussion is made of common pitfalls and suggestions for the design of planning agents. Finally, a parallel architecture that embodies many of the ideas presented is sketched and discussed.

They may become important tools for finding a valid model to study neuropsychiatric changes and to study human neurodevelopmental processes that have been impaired by social events. While a preference for conspecifics has been shown for different species, social novelty has been used as a model for anxiety-like behavior in rodents. The goal of this research was to understand the roles of stimulus salience (numerousness) and novelty in social investigation and social novelty tests in zebrafish (Danio rerio Hamilton 1822). We used a sequential design, in which animals are exposed first to a social investigation test (with dichotomous presentation of novel conspecifics vs. empty tank) and then to a social novelty test (with dichotomous presentation of the already known conspecific and a novel conspecific). In experiment 1, animals were presented to either 1 or 3 (vs. an empty tank) conspecifics as stimuli. In experiment 2, animals were presented to 1 vs. 3 conspecifics as stimuli. In experiment 3, animals were observed in the social investigation and social novelty tests for 3 consecutive days. The results showed equivalence between 1 or 3 conspecifics in the social investigation and social novelty tests, although animals were able to discriminate between different shoal sizes. These preferences do not change with repeated test exposure, suggesting novelty to be a minor contributor to social investigation and social novelty in zebrafish.",2023.0,49.0,1.0,"{'volume': '210', 'name': 'Behavioural Processes'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Nascimento2023SocialIA,\n author = {Bianca Gomes do Nascimento and C.

2011,9d03e5fa79378bc45c219de043955ab07f123c9e,Facial emotion perception in schizophrenia: a meta-analytic review.,"OBJECTIVES
A considerable body of literature has reported on emotion perception deficits and the relevance to clinical symptoms and social functioning in schizophrenia. Studies published between 1970-2007 were examined regarding emotion perception abilities between patient and control groups and potential methodological, demographic, and clinical moderators. DATA SOURCES AND REVIEW: Eighty-six studies were identified through a computerized literature search of the MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and PubMed databases. A quality of reporting of meta-analysis standard was followed in the extraction of relevant studies and data. Data on emotion perception, methodology, demographic and clinical characteristics, and antipsychotic medication status were compiled and analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-analysis Version 2.0 (Borenstein M, Hedges L, Higgins J and Rothstein H. Comprehensive Meta-analysis. 2. Englewood, NJ: Biostat; 2005).


RESULTS
The meta-analysis revealed a large deficit in emotion perception in schizophrenia, irrespective of task type, and several factors that moderated the observed impairment. Illness-related factors included current hospitalization and--in part--clinical symptoms and antipsychotic treatment. Demographic factors included patient age and gender in controls but not race.


CONCLUSION
Emotion perception impairment in schizophrenia represents a robust finding in schizophrenia that appears to be moderated by certain clinical and demographic factors. Future directions for research on emotion perception are discussed.",2010.0,126.0,856.0,"{'volume': '36 5', 'pages': '\n          1009-19\n        ', 'name': 'Schizophrenia bulletin'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kohler2010FacialEP,\n author = {C.

The proposed internalization model of reflective emotion regulation argues that caregivers’ co-regulation of emotionally challenging events plays a constitutive role for the development of 4- to 6-year-olds’ reflective emotion regulation. The model specifies the gradual shift from co- to self-regulation by focusing on two important ways how caregivers structure emotionally challenging interactions: Through emotion talk, caregivers promote the development of preschoolers’ emotional awareness. Once established, they support children in establishing a repertoire of effective emotion regulation strategies and they guide preschoolers’ emerging skills to generate, evaluate, and select from alternative appraisals or behavioral responses.",2016.0,87.0,23.0,"{'volume': '2', 'pages': '17-32', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Silkenbeumer2016TheRO,\n author = {Judith Rebecca Silkenbeumer and Eva-Maria Schiller and Manfred Holodynski and Joscha Kärtner},\n pages = {17-32},\n title = {The role of co-regulation for the development of social-emotional competence},\n volume = {2},\n year = {2016}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '115964516', 'name': 'Judith Rebecca Silkenbeumer'}, {'authorId': '2052760391', 'name': 'Eva-Maria Schiller'}, {'authorId': '6051757', 'name': 'Manfred Holodynski'}, {'authorId': '4185170', 'name': 'Joscha Kärtner'}]"
2023,9df0d8298b9de5ab56c68cab6695d5a1dff51578,"Clinical Virtual Reality tools to advance the prevention, assessment, and treatment of PTSD","ABSTRACT Numerous reports indicate that the incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) military personnel has created a significant behavioural healthcare challenge. These findings have served to motivate research on how to better develop and disseminate evidence-based treatments for PTSD. The current article presents the use of Virtual Reality (VR) as a clinical tool to address the assessment, prevention, and treatment of PTSD, based on the VR projects that were evolved at the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies since 2004. A brief discussion of the definition and rationale for the clinical use of VR is followed by a description of a VR application designed for the delivery of prolonged exposure (PE) for treating Service Members (SMs) and Veterans with combat- and sexual assault-related PTSD. The expansion of the virtual treatment simulations of Iraq and Afghanistan for PTSD assessment and prevention is then presented. This is followed by a forward-looking discussion that details early efforts to develop virtual human agent systems that serve the role of virtual patients for training the next generation of clinical providers, as healthcare guides that can be used to support anonymous access to trauma-relevant behavioural healthcare information, and as clinical interviewers capable of automated behaviour analysis of users to infer psychological state. The paper will conclude with a discussion of VR as a tool for breaking down barriers to care in addition to its direct application in assessment and intervention.",2017.0,150.0,116.0,"{'volume': '8', 'name': 'European Journal of Psychotraumatology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rizzo2017ClinicalVR,\n author = {Albert A.

Perceivers’ reactions to others’ facial expressions often represent a match or mirroring (e.g., they smile to a smile). However, the information conveyed by an expression depends on context. Thus, when shown by an opponent, a smile conveys bad news and evokes frowning. The availability of anthropomorphic agents capable of facial actions raises the question of how people respond to such agents in social context. We explored this issue in a study where participants played a strategic game with or against a facially expressive android. Electromyography (EMG) recorded participants’ reactions over zygomaticus muscle (smiling) and corrugator muscle (frowning). We found that participants’ facial responses to android’s expressions reflect their informational value, rather than a direct match. Overall, participants smiled more, and frowned less, when winning than losing. Critically, participants’ responses to the game outcome were similar regardless of whether it was conveyed via the android’s smile or frown. Furthermore, the outcome had greater impact on people’s facial reactions when it was conveyed through android’s face than a computer screen. These findings demonstrate that facial actions of artificial agents impact human facial responding. They also suggest a sophistication in human-robot communication that highlights the signaling value of facial expressions.",2018.0,58.0,11.0,"{'volume': '12', 'name': 'Frontiers in Neurorobotics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hofree2018BehindTR,\n author = {Galit Hofree and P.

More recently, the need for new experimental approaches has been highlighted that allow studying social encounters in a truly interactive manner by establishing 'online' reciprocity in social interaction. In this article, we present a newly developed adaptation of a method which uses eyetracking data obtained from participants in real time to control visual stimulation during functional magnetic resonance imaging, thus, providing an innovative tool to generate gaze-contingent stimuli in spite of the constraints of this experimental setting. We review results of two paradigms employing this technique and demonstrate how gaze data can be used to animate a virtual character whose behavior becomes 'responsive' to being looked at allowing the participant to engage in 'online' interaction with this virtual other in real-time. Possible applications of this setup are discussed highlighting the potential of this development as a new 'tool of the trade' in social cognitive and affective neuroscience.",2010.0,45.0,149.0,"{'volume': '5 1', 'pages': '\n          98-107\n        ', 'name': 'Social cognitive and affective neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Wilms2010ItsIY,\n author = {M.

Perceived stigma prevents many from reporting their symptoms. Stigma is a particularly pervasive problem among military service members, preventing them from reporting symptoms of combat-related conditions like posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, research shows increased reporting by service members when anonymous assessments are used. For example, service members report more symptoms of PTSD when they anonymously answer the Post-Deployment Health Assessment (PDHA) symptom checklist compared to the official PDHA, which is identifiable and linked to their military records. To investigate the factors that influence reporting of psychological symptoms by service members, we used a transformative technology: automated virtual humans that interview people about their symptoms. Such virtual human interviewers allow simultaneous use of two techniques for eliciting disclosure that would otherwise be incompatible; they afford anonymity while also building rapport. We examined whether virtual human interviewers could increase disclosure of mental health symptoms among active-duty service members that just returned from a year-long deployment in Afghanistan. Service members reported more symptoms during a conversation with a virtual human interviewer than on the official PDHA. They also reported more to a virtual human interviewer than on an anonymized PDHA. A second, larger sample of active-duty and former service members found a similar effect that approached statistical significance. Because respondents in both studies shared more with virtual human interviewers than an anonymized PDHA -even though both conditions control for stigma and ramifications for service members’ military records- virtual human interviewers that build rapport may provide a superior option to encourage reporting.",2017.0,71.0,164.0,"{'volume': '4', 'pages': '51', 'name': 'Frontiers Robotics AI'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lucas2017ReportingMH,\n author = {Gale M.

However, the complex mechanism of antagonistic emotion influencing decision making, especially in the environment of sudden confrontation, has not yet been explored very clearly. In this paper, we propose an Emotional contagion-aware Deep reinforcement learning model for Antagonistic Crowd Simulation (ACSED). Firstly, we build a group emotional contagion module based on the improved Susceptible Infected Susceptible (SIS) infection disease model, and estimate the emotional state of the group at each time step during the simulation. Then, the tendency of crowd antagonistic action is estimated based on Deep Q Network (DQN), where the agent learns the action autonomously, and leverages the mean field theory to quickly calculate the influence of other surrounding individuals on the central one. Finally, the rationality of the predicted actions by DQN is further analyzed in combination with group emotion, and the final action of the agent is determined. The proposed method in this paper is verified through several experiments with different settings. The results prove that the antagonistic emotion has a vital impact on the group combat, and positive emotional states are more conducive to combat. Moreover, by comparing the simulation results with real scenes, the feasibility of our method is further confirmed, which can provide good reference to formulate battle plans and improve the win rate of righteous groups in a variety of situations.",2021.0,47.0,1.0,{'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Lv2021EmotionalCD,\n author = {Pei Lv and Qingqing Yu and Boya Xu and Chaochao Li and Bing Zhou and Mingliang Xu},\n booktitle = {IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing},\n journal = {IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing},\n title = {Emotional Contagion-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning for Antagonistic Crowd Simulation},\n year = {2021}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '144470801', 'name': 'Pei Lv'}, {'authorId': '2087411234', 'name': 'Qingqing Yu'}, {'authorId': '2109511600', 'name': 'Boya Xu'}, {'authorId': '7431398', 'name': 'Chaochao Li'}, {'authorId': '2118869098', 'name': 'Bing Zhou'}, {'authorId': '2285442', 'name': 'Mingliang Xu'}]"

2036,9ea80fd6ce6ad3e12e43338802d26443ce126f9f,"The emulation theory of representation: Motor control, imagery, and perception","The emulation theory of representation is developed and explored as a framework that can revealingly synthesize a wide variety of representational functions of the brain. The framework is based on constructs from control theory (forward models) and signal processing (Kalman filters). The idea is that in addition to simply engaging with the body and environment, the brain constructs neural circuits that act as models of the body and environment. During overt sensorimotor engagement, these models are driven by efference copies in parallel with the body and environment, in order to provide expectations of the sensory feedback, and to enhance and process sensory information. These models can also be run off-line in order to produce imagery, estimate outcomes of different actions, and evaluate and develop motor plans. The framework is initially developed within the context of motor control, where it has been shown that inner models running in parallel with the body can reduce the effects of feedback delay problems. The same mechanisms can account for motor imagery as the off-line driving of the emulator via efference copies. The framework is extended to account for visual imagery as the off-line driving of an emulator of the motor-visual loop. I also show how such systems can provide for amodal spatial imagery. Perception, including visual perception, results from such models being used to form expectations of, and to interpret, sensory input. I close by briefly outlining other cognitive functions that might also be synthesized within this framework, including reasoning, theory of mind phenomena, and language.",2004.0,337.0,1148.0,"{'volume': '27', 'pages': '377 - 396', 'name': 'Behavioral and Brain Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Grush2004TheET,\n author = {R.

The present study investigates this relationship for salespeople in a business-to-business context.

The analysis is based on a dyadic data set that involves judgments provided by salespeople and their customers collected across multiple manufacturing and services industries. Results indicate the presence of a positive relationship between salespeople’s job satisfaction and customer satisfaction.

One such type of information consists of cues to the speaker's personality traits, the most fundamental dimension of variation between humans. Recent work explores the automatic detection of other types of pragmatic variation in text and conversation, such as emotion, deception, speaker charisma, dominance, point of view, subjectivity, opinion and sentiment. Personality affects these other aspects of linguistic production, and thus personality recognition may be useful for these tasks, in addition to many other potential applications. However, to date, there is little work on the automatic recognition of personality traits. This article reports experimental results for recognition of all Big Five personality traits, in both conversation and text, utilising both self and observer ratings of personality. While other work reports classification results, we experiment with classification, regression and ranking models. For each model, we analyse the effect of different feature sets on accuracy. Results show that for some traits, any type of statistical model performs significantly better than the baseline, but ranking models perform best overall. We also present an experiment suggesting that ranking models are more accurate than multi-class classifiers for modelling personality. In addition, recognition models trained on observed personality perform better than models trained using self-reports, and the optimal feature set depends on the personality trait. A qualitative analysis of the learned models confirms previous findings linking language and personality, while revealing many new linguistic markers.",2007.0,94.0,880.0,"{'volume': '30', 'pages': '457-500', 'name': 'J.

However, such tests have a ceiling in developmental terms corresponding to a mental age of about 6 years. It is therefore impossible to say if such individuals are intact or impaired in their theory of mind skills. We report the performance of very high functioning adults with autism or Asperger Syndrome on an adult test of theory of mind ability. The task involved inferring the mental state of a person just from the information in photographs of a person's eyes. Relative to age-matched normal controls and a clinical control group (adults with Tourette Syndrome), the group with autism and Asperger Syndrome were significantly impaired on this task. The autism and Asperger Syndrome sample was also impaired on Happé's strange stories tasks. In contrast, they were unimpaired on two control tasks: recognising gender from the eye region of the face, and recognising basic emotions from the whole face. This provides evidence for subtle mindreading deficits in very high functioning individuals on the autistic continuum.",1997.0,48.0,1751.0,"{'volume': '38 7', 'pages': '\n          813-22\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Baron-Cohen1997AnotherAT,\n author = {S.

Based on our work, the findings of other investigators on individual differences in risk for PTSD, and drawing on preclinical studies fear conditioning and extinction, we propose a conceptual model for the development of PTSD symptoms emphasizing the role of vulnerability and resilience to peritraumatic panic reactions. We tested this conceptual model in a cross‐sectional sample of police officers (n= 715). Utilizing an hierarchical linear regression model we were able to explain 39.7% of the variance in PTSD symptoms. Five variables remained significant in the final model; greater peritraumatic distress (β= 0.240, P < .001), greater peritraumatic dissociation (β= 0.174, P < .001), greater problem‐solving coping (β= 0.103, P < .01), greater routine work environment stress (β= 0.182, P < .001), and lower levels of social support (β=−0.246, P < .001). These results were largely consistent with the proposed conceptual model. Next steps in this line of research will be to test this model prospectively in a sample of 400 police academy recruits assessed during training and currently being followed for the first 2 years of police service.",2006.0,48.0,365.0,"{'volume': '1071', 'name': 'Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Marmar2006PredictorsOP,\n author = {C.

With a plethora of AI solutions around, the other person being targeted may be a conversational agent. In this study, involving 3 verbal abuse types (Insult, Threat, Swearing) and 3 response styles (Avoidance, Empathy, Counterattacking), we examine whether a conversational agent's response style under varying abuse types influences those emotions found to mitigate people's aggressive behaviors. Sixty-four participants, assigned to one of the abuse type conditions, interacted with the three conversational agents in turn and reported their feelings about guiltiness, anger, and shame after each session.

With users able to interact with conversational agents through both text and voice, understanding how designing for these channels supports behavior change is important. To begin answering this question, we designed a conversational agent for the workplace that supports workers' activity journaling and self-learning through reflection. Our agent, named Robota, combines chat-based communication as a Slack Bot and voice interaction through a personal device using a custom Amazon Alexa Skill. Through a 3-week controlled deployment, we examine how voice-based and chat-based interaction affect workers' reflection and support self-learning. We demonstrate that, while many current technical limitations exist, adding dedicated mobile voice interaction separate from the already busy chat modality may further enable users to step back and reflect on their work. We conclude with discussion of the implications of our findings to design of workplace self-tracking systems specifically and to behavior-change systems in general.",2018.0,80.0,76.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 2018 Designing Interactive Systems Conference'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Kocielnik2018DesigningFW,\n author = {Rafal Kocielnik and Daniel Avrahami and Jennifer Marlow and Di Lu and Gary Hsieh},\n journal = {Proceedings of the 2018 Designing Interactive Systems Conference},\n title = {Designing for Workplace Reflection: A Chat and Voice-Based Conversational Agent},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '3299344', 'name': 'Rafal Kocielnik'}, {'authorId': '2667384', 'name': 'Daniel Avrahami'}, {'authorId': '144841404', 'name': 'Jennifer Marlow'}, {'authorId': '2087234532', 'name': 'Di Lu'}, {'authorId': '1786841', 'name': 'Gary Hsieh'}]"
2050,a03242b258194bff2e60200ec90608257f2ccc24,Believable Social and Emotional Agents.,"Abstract : One of the key steps in creating quality interactive drama is the ability to create quality interactive characters (or believable agents). Two important aspects of such characters will be that they appear emotional and that they can engage in social interactions. My basic approach to these problems has been to use a broad agent architecture and minimal amounts of modeling of other agent in the environment. This approach is based on an understanding of the artistic nature of the problem. To enable agent-builders (artists) to create emotional agents, I provide a general framework for building emotional agents, default emotion-processing rules, and discussion about how to create quality, emotional characters. My framework gets a lot of its power from being part of a broad agent architecture. The concept is simple: the agent will be emotionally richer if there are more things to have emotions about and more ways to express them. This reliance on breadth has also meant that I have been able to create simple emotion models that rely on perception and motivation instead of deep modeling of other agents and complex cognitive processing. To enable agent builders to create social behaviors for believable agents, I have designed a methodology that provides heuristics for incorporating personality into social behaviors and suggests how to model other agents in the environment. I propose an approach to modeling other agents that calls for limiting the amount of modeling of other agents to that which is sufficient to create the desired behavior. Using this technique, I have been able to build robust social behaviors that use surprisingly little representation. I have used this methodology to build a number of social behaviors, like negotiation and making friends. I have built three simulations containing seven agents to drive and test this work.",1996.0,129.0,479.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Bates1996BelievableSA,\n author = {J.

The social context theory of emotional mimicry in human-human interactions suggests that these processes are modulated by social factors, such as the group membership identities of interactants (whether the interactants belong to the same social group or not). However, the social factors that modulate the emotional contagion between humans and artificial agents are not known yet. Hence, this research attempts to understand the process of emotional contagion in human-agent interaction by conducting an interaction experiment in a competitive in-group/out-group context. Emotional contagion as well as the social attitudes of trust, empathy, liking, bonding, and pro-social orientation were found to be significantly higher in the in-group than in the out-group setting. Furthermore, these social attitudes were highly correlated with emotional contagion, which demonstrates the potential of using emotional contagion as an unobtrusive proxy measurement of people’s social attitudes.",2022.0,58.0,0.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Human-Agent Interaction'},"{'bibtex': '@Book{Joby2022EffectOG,\n author = {Nora Elizabeth Joby and H.

Although smartphones are designed to connect us with others, such smartphone use may create a source of distraction that disconnects us from the people in our immediate social environment. Focusing on one fundamental social relationship—between parents and their children—we examined whether smartphones made parents feel distracted, thereby undermining key benefits parents reap when spending time with their children. Ina field experiment at a science museum (Study 1), we randomly assigned parents to use their phones frequently or infrequently. Frequent phone use led parents to feel more distracted, which in turn impaired feelings of social connection and the meaning that parents derived when spending time with their children. In an additional weeklong diary study (Study 2), we found further evidence that smartphones can distract parents from reaping a sense of social connection when spending time with their children. These studies suggest that being constantly connected to the Internet may carry subtle costs for the fabric of social life.",2019.0,56.0,85.0,"{'volume': '36', 'pages': '1619 - 1639', 'name': 'Journal of Social and Personal Relationships'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kushlev2019SmartphonesDP,\n author = {Kostadin Kushlev and Elizabeth W.

Despite this, relatively little attention has been given to identifying the characteristics of such deficits in a systematic way. We describe the development of self and informant versions of a new questionnaire designed to measure the changes in social cognition that may occur following ABI, the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Trust (BIRT) Social Cognition Questionnaire (BSCQ). Seventy-two participants (Mean age  = 36 years, SD = 12), with different forms of ABI (76% traumatic brain injury, 8% cerebrovascular accident, 15% other) and who were on average 20 months post-injury (SD = 16), took part in the study. The measure demonstrates excellent psychometric properties, including high test-retest (.94) and split-half (.92) reliability, high internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = .92), and good concurrent validity. The questionnaire measures characteristics that are distinguishable from measures of cognitive ability. There was moderate overlap between self-report and informant versions of the questionnaire (r = .50), but the informant version had the strongest predictive value of outcome, measured with the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory III, one year later. The potential uses of the measure in relation to theory and practice are discussed. The results suggest that the BSCQ is a useful screening tool for those with ABI.",2018.0,38.0,3.0,"{'volume': '28', 'pages': '633 - 648', 'name': 'Neuropsychological Rehabilitation'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cattran2018TheDO,\n author = {Charlotte Cattran and M.

State-of-the-art analysis is primarily based on statistics of quantitative measures stemming from animal trajectories in a maze, e.g. path length or correct decisions made. Currently trajectories themselves are analyzed and evaluated one at a time and comparison of multiple trajectories is a tedious task. The resulting ﬁndings may not fully answer complex questions that behavioral researchers encounter as well, e.g., why do animals behave in a certain way or can atypical behaviour be detected? This paper describes an innovative approach on how exploratory analysis for Multiple T-Maze studies can be enhanced through interactive visual analysis. We explain our solution for analyzing a whole ensemble of data at once and support the ﬁnding of orientational characteristics and migration patterns within the ensemble. We also abstract the analysis tasks for Multiple T-Maze studies and, based on these tasks, we extend a coordinated multiple views system to support the solving of fundamental problems which behavioral researchers face. Besides views of standard charts we deploy a multi-resolution heat map and the Gate-O-Gon, which is a novel visual element. It gives clues on the animals’ general movement orientation and distribution of revisited gates, as well as enhances the discovery of patterns in movement and identifying of irregular behavior. Finally we demonstrate the usefulness of the newly proposed approach using a real life data set consisting of 400 Multiple T-Maze runs.",2018.0,30.0,3.0,{'pages': '203-213'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Bechtold2018VisualEA,\n author = {Fabrizia Bechtold and R.

MTL-cortical theta and gamma coupling is believed to mediate such coordination, but which cortical structures are critical for retrieval and how they influence oscillatory coupling is unclear. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) combined with continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to (i) clarify the roles of theta and gamma oscillations in network-wide communication during naturalistic memory retrieval, and (ii) understand the causal relationship between cortical network nodes and oscillatory communication. Retrieval was associated with MTL-posterior neocortical theta phase coupling and theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling relative to a rest period. Precuneus cTBS altered MTL-neocortical communication by modulating theta and gamma oscillatory coupling. These findings provide a mechanistic account for MTL-cortical communication and demonstrate that the precuneus is a critical cortical node of oscillatory activity, coordinating cross-regional interactions that drive remembering.",2019.0,73.0,48.0,"{'volume': '8', 'name': 'eLife'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hebscher2019ACR,\n author = {Melissa Hebscher and Jed A.

We evaluated the effects of emotional valence (positive versus negative) and source (external, i.e. loudspeakers, versus embedded, i.e. headphones) of music on the participant's interpersonal distance when interacting with others. Methodology/Principal Findings Personal space was evaluated as the comfort interpersonal distance between participant and experimenter during both active and passive approach tasks. Our results show that, during passive approach tasks, listening to positive versus negative emotion-inducing music reduces the representation of personal space, allowing others to come closer to us. With respect to a no-music condition, an embedded source of positive emotion-inducing music reduced personal space, while an external source of negative emotion-inducing music expanded personal space. Conclusions/Significance The results provide the first empirical evidence of the relation between induced emotional state, as a result of listening to positive music through headphones, and personal space when interacting with others.

Notably, we propose a novel max-mix training strategy, leading to a single “One-for-All” model that is remarkably robust to a vast range of downsampling factors. That makes our framework well adapted for the varied bandwidths in real transmission scenarios, without hampering scalability or efficiency.

Second, the process of recoding is a very important one in human psychology and deserves much more explicit attention than it has received. In particular, the kind of linguistic recoding that people do seems to me to be the very lifeblood of the thought processes. Recoding procedures are a constant concern to clinicians, social psychologists, linguists, and anthropologists and yet, probably because recoding is less accessible to experimental manipulation than nonsense syllables or T mazes, the traditional experimental psychologist has contributed little or nothing to their analysis. Nevertheless, experimental techniques can be used, methods of recoding can be specified, behavioral indicants can be found. And I anticipate that we will find a very orderly set of relations describing what now seems an uncharted wilderness of individual differences. Third, the concepts and measures provided by the theory of information provide a quantitative way of getting at some of these questions. The theory provides us with a yardstick for calibrating our stimulus materials and for measuring the performance of our subjects. In the interests of communication I have suppressed the technical details of information measurement and have tried to express the ideas in more familiar terms; I hope this paraphrase will not lead you to think they are not useful in research. Informational concepts have already proved valuable in the study of discrimination and of language; they promise a great deal in the study of learning and memory; and it has even been proposed that they can be useful in the study of concept formation. A lot of questions that seemed fruitless twenty or thirty years ago may now be worth another look. In fact, I feel that my story here must stop just as it begins to get really interesting. And finally, what about the magical number seven? What about the seven wonders of the world, the seven seas, the seven deadly sins, the seven daughters of Atlas in the Pleiades, the seven ages of man, the seven levels of hell, the seven primary colors, the seven notes of the musical scale, and the seven days of the week? What about the seven-point rating scale, the seven categories for absolute judgment, the seven objects in the span of attention, and the seven digits in the span of immediate memory? For the present I propose to withhold judgment. Perhaps there is something deep and profound behind all these sevens, something just calling out for us to discover it. But I suspect that it is only a pernicious, Pythagorean coincidence.",1956.0,27.0,22253.0,"{'volume': '63 2', 'pages': '\n          81-97\n        ', 'name': 'Psychological review'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Miller1956TheMN,\n author = {G.

The emotion model focuses on entire crowds, builds individual emotion spaces as network nodes, embodies psychological linkages with relationship arcs, and clusters emotionally homogeneous crowds into EmotionTrees. According to the maximum value of the emotion component and the psychological distance, crowds are initialized as different trees. With relational distributions of crowd changes, agents move between different subgroups. Then, we construct emotion-oriented commands with subgroup constraints according to intergroup emotion theory. For execution, motion variables are calculated from emotion commands (i.e., emotion source-oriented orientation, and velocity and emotion strength-based motion clip selection). Experiments on bystanders, football fans, violent protestors, and guided marching behaviors demonstrate that the Emotion Network can improve crowd behavior modeling with particular attention to the impacts of group constraints and emotional characteristics, which can reflect environment stimuli and changes. The model can be integrated into physical crowd simulators as a high-level emotion manager, providing intelligent emotional support in improving the realism of human-like crowds.",2018.0,53.0,5.0,"{'volume': '6', 'pages': '55893-55906', 'name': 'IEEE Access'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lyu2018TowardME,\n author = {Lei Lyu and Jinling Zhang},\n journal = {IEEE Access},\n pages = {55893-55906},\n title = {Toward Modeling Emotional Crowds},\n volume = {6},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '144522284', 'name': 'Lei Lyu'}, {'authorId': '49051568', 'name': 'Jinling Zhang'}]"

2069,a24dd1ec5ec4a99b3a0c9d367fe5fcd26b4c3266,Factors Affecting Enjoyment of Virtual Reality Games: A Comparison Involving Consumer-Grade Virtual Reality Technology.,"OBJECTIVE
This study investigated psychological responses to playing videogames using a virtual reality (VR) head-mounted display (HMD). We also investigated how cybersickness impacts the sense of presence one feels in the virtual environment, as well as how cybersickness affects enjoyment.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants played randomly assigned VR games that varied in the level of sensory conflict they provided: ""Lucky's Tale,"" ""Elite: Dangerous,"" and ""Minecraft."" Results were compared based on two headset conditions-the Oculus DK2 and the recently released Oculus Rift Consumer Version (CV1).


RESULTS
Cybersickness was not reduced by playing games with a VR HMD of higher technological quality-the Oculus Rift CV1. Furthermore, cybersickness responses were significantly different based on the level of sensory conflict in the games. Games with less sensory conflict, such as third-person platformer games, or space and flight simulator games, produce less cybersickness in players than first-person games. Enjoyment of VR games was shown to be directly influenced by a sense of spatial presence, which was affected by interactivity and realism. Findings suggest that the variables that are important to the enjoyment of console, mobile, or motion-based games are consistently important to enjoyment of VR games.


CONCLUSION
Better technology does not affect the frequency or severity of cybersickness for players; but sensory conflict has a significant impact on how sick users become. Additionally, we present a model that indicates how enjoyment is produced in VR gaming experiences. These findings bear further investigation as new methods of interacting with VR games are developed.",2019.0,14.0,56.0,"{'volume': '8 1', 'pages': '\n          15-23\n        ', 'name': 'Games for health journal'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Shafer2019FactorsAE,\n author = {D.

In an increasing number of military personnel, the adverse effects of service and particularly of stressful combat exposure are significant long lasting and possibly fatal. Most stress research is focused on treatment, but because stress effects are liable to appear years after exposure, it is imperative that methodologies be developed to mitigate the adverse effects of military-related stress and prevent its post-exposure effects. It has long been accepted that warfighters adapt to combat stress after the first few experiences and that training can help duplicate this process, with recent studies showing that experienced military personnel are able to control and even utilize stress productively. A key part of what experienced personnel learn is self-awareness of their stress state and self-regulation of stress effects. These skills can be greatly enhanced by combining cognitive learning methodologies grounded in learning theory and biofeedback techniques based on Heart Rate Variability (HRV) with innovative simulation game-based training tools. The training system described here will be implemented on a mobile device such as an iPod/Touch, providing adaptive, tailored training that can be widely distributed to the Warfighter for initial stress resilience training, on-the-spot refreshment and practice.",2010.0,20.0,13.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Cohn2010StressIT,\n author = {Joseph Cohn and G.

Control participants watched the same films with no appraisal instructions. Participants who practiced appraisal, compared with controls, exhibited reduced levels of self-reported negative emotional (Studies 1-3) and electrodermal (Study 1) responses to a final test film that all participants were instructed to appraise. In Study 4, a comparable effect of appraisal practice was found using distressing autobiographical memories for participants with higher levels of negative affect.

Personality has been conceptualized from a variety of theoretical perspectives, and at various levels of Each of these levels has made unique contributions to our understanding of individual differences in behavior and experience. However, the number of personality traits, and scales designed to measure them, escalated without an end in sight (Goldberg, 1971). Researchers, as well as practitioners in the field of personality assessment, were faced with a bewildering array of personality scales from which to choose, with little guidance and no overall rationale at hand. What made matters worse was that scales with the same name often measure concepts that are not the same, and scales with different names often measure concepts that are quite similar. Although diversity and scientific pluralism are useful, the systematic accumulation of findings and the communication among researchers became difficult amidst the Babel of concepts and scales. Many personality researchers had hoped that they might devise the structure that would transform the Babel into a community speaking a common language. However, such an integration was not to be achieved by any one researcher or by any one theoretical perspective. As Allport once put it, "" each assessor has his own pet units and uses a pet battery of diagnostic devices "" (1958, p. 258). What personality psychology needed was a descriptive model, or taxonomy, of its subject matter. One of the central goals of scientific taxonomies is the definition of overarching domains within which large numbers of specific instances can be understood in a simplified way. Thus, in personality psychology, a taxonomy would permit researchers to study specified domains of personality characteristics, rather than examining separately the thousands of particular attributes that make human beings individual and unique. Moreover, a generally accepted taxonomy would greatly facilitate the accumulation and communication of empirical findings by offering a standard vocabulary, or nomenclature. After decades of research, the field is approaching consensus on a general taxonomy of personality traits, the "" Big Five "" personality dimensions. These dimensions do not represent a particular theoretical perspective but were derived from analyses of the natural-language terms people use to describe themselves 3 and others. Rather than replacing all previous systems, the Big Five taxonomy serves an integrative function because it can represent the various and diverse systems of personality …",1999.0,179.0,8453.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{John1999TheBF,\n author = {O.

Explanations for this behavior postulate that the cognitive demands of consistency to such a theory are too great. However, situations exist in which more than mental shortcuts are involved and these anomalies raise questions about expected utility theory as a guide to behavior. This paper explores the possibility that expected utility theory appears to fail because the single outcome descriptor—money—is not sufficient. After making a decision under uncertainty, a person may discover, on learning the relevant outcomes, that another alternative would have been preferable. This knowledge may impart a sense of loss, or regret. The decision maker who is prepared to tradeoff financial return in order to avoid regret will exhibit some of the behavioral paradoxes of decision theory. By explicitly incorporating regret, expected utility theory not only becomes a better descriptive predictor but also may become a more convincing guide for prescribing behavior to decision makers.",1982.0,14.0,2735.0,"{'volume': '30', 'pages': '961-981', 'name': 'Oper.

To show that members of a preliterate culture who had minimal exposure to literate cultures would associate the same emotion concepts with the same facial behaviors as do members of Western and Eastern literate cultures, data were gathered in New Guinea by telling subjects a story, showing them a set of three faces, and asking them to select the face which showed the emotion appropriate to the story.

Unlike existing procedural flow generators, tiling offers a natural user interface for field design. Tilings can be constructed to meet a wide variety of external and internal boundary conditions, making them suitable for inclusion in larger environments. Tiles offer memory savings through the re-use of prototypical elements. Each flow tile contains a small field and many tiles can be combined to produce large flows. The corners and edges of tiles are constructed to ensure continuity across boundaries between tiles. In addition, all our tiles and the resulting titing are divergence-free and hence suitable for representing a range of effects. We discuss issues that arise in designing flow tiles, algorithms for creating tilings, and three applications: a crowd on city streets, a river flowing between banks, and swirling fog. The first two applications use stationary fields, while the latter demonstrates a dynamic field.",2004.0,24.0,235.0,{'pages': '233-242'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Chenney2004FlowT,\n author = {Stephen Chenney},\n pages = {233-242},\n title = {Flow tiles},\n year = {2004}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '1687162', 'name': 'Stephen Chenney'}]"

Close interpersonal distance (IPD) increases emotional responses during interaction and has been related to avoidance behavior in social anxiety. However, a systematic investigation of the effects of IPD on subjective experience combined with measures of physiological arousal and behavioral responses during real-time social interaction has been missing. Virtual Reality allows for a controlled manipulation of IPD while maintaining naturalistic social encounters. The present study investigates IPD in social interaction using a novel paradigm in Virtual Reality. Thirty-six participants approached virtual agents and engaged in short interactions. IPD was varied between 3.5 and 1 m by manipulating the distance at which agents reacted to the participant's approach. Closer distances were rated as more arousing, less pleasant, and less natural than longer distances and this effect was significantly modulated by social anxiety scores. Skin conductance responses were also increased at short distances compared to longer distances. Finally, an interaction of IPD and social anxiety was observed for avoidance behavior, measured as participants' backward motion during interaction, with stronger avoidance related to close distances and high values of social anxiety. These results highlight the influence of IPD on experience, physiological response, and behavior during social interaction. The interaction of social anxiety and IPD suggests including the manipulation of IPD in behavioral tests in Virtual Reality as a promising tool for the treatment of social anxiety disorder.",2020.0,46.0,24.0,"{'volume': '11', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kroczek2020InterpersonalDD,\n author = {Leon O.

As group membership becomes salient, individuals come to behave as group members and, consequently, appraise interactions according to these salient group identities (Turner, 1987). The aim of the present article is to investigate the impact of social categorization on perceptions and appraisals of a distributive negotiation situation. An experiment is presented in which social categorization of the negotiation partner is manipulated. Results revealed that the social structural factors associated with the partner’s group (i.e. social status and group’s competition) influence fixed-pie perceptions as well as participants’ inferences about their counterpart’s target and resistance points. In addition, these effects are mediated by stereotypical evaluations of the counterpart in terms of warmth and competence, respectively.",2010.0,55.0,22.0,"{'volume': '13', 'pages': '765 - 777', 'name': 'Group Processes & Intergroup Relations'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Demoulin2010SocialCI,\n author = {S.

A full understanding of emotion perception and its neural substrate will require investigations that employ dynamic displays and means of expression other than the face. Our aims were: (i) to develop a set of dynamic and static whole-body expressions of basic emotions for systematic investigations of clinical populations, and for use in functional-imaging studies; (ii) to assess forced-choice emotion-classification performance with these stimuli relative to the results of previous studies; and (iii) to test the hypotheses that more exaggerated whole-body movements would produce (a) more accurate emotion classification and (b) higher ratings of emotional intensity. Ten actors portrayed 5 emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness) at 3 levels of exaggeration, with their faces covered. Two identical sets of 150 emotion portrayals (full-light and point-light) were created from the same digital footage, along with corresponding static images of the ‘peak’ of each emotion portrayal. Recognition tasks confirmed previous findings that basic emotions are readily identifiable from body movements, even when static form information is minimised by use of point-light displays, and that full-light and even point-light displays can convey identifiable emotions, though rather less efficiently than dynamic displays. Recognition success differed for individual emotions, corroborating earlier results about the importance of distinguishing differences in movement characteristics for different emotional expressions. The patterns of misclassifications were in keeping with earlier findings on emotional clustering. Exaggeration of body movement (a) enhanced recognition accuracy, especially for the dynamic point-light displays, but notably not for sadness, and (b) produced higher emotional-intensity ratings, regardless of lighting condition, for movies but to a lesser extent for stills, indicating that intensity judgments of body gestures rely more on movement (or form-from-movement) than static form information.",2004.0,83.0,691.0,"{'volume': '33', 'pages': '717 - 746', 'name': 'Perception'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Atkinson2004EmotionPF,\n author = {A.

We provide experimental evidence that emotional contagion occurs without direct interaction between people (exposure to a friend expressing an emotion is sufficient), and in the complete absence of nonverbal cues. Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’ positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.",2014.0,15.0,2533.0,"{'volume': '111', 'pages': '8788 - 8790', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kramer2014ExperimentalEO,\n author = {Adam D.

This project aims to train an emotion recognition model to allow the detection of multiple emotions. In addition, it aims to implement the self-attachment theory scenario to manage the dialogue between a user and a virtual therapist. The two parts of the project are to be integrated within the proposed virtual reality application. The devised multimodal and multi-emotion recognition model trained on CMUMOSEI dataset, achieves state-of-the-art results on happiness detection and competitive results for other emotions. The scenario was implemented using FAtiMA toolkit and together with the emotion recognition model was successfully integrated within the virtual reality application.",2020.0,79.0,1.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Edalat2020MultiemotionRA,\n author = {A.

Certain constraints need to be fulfilled, e.g., a collision avoidance strategy allowing users to maintain their personal space. Violating this flexible protective zone causes discomfort in real-world situations and in IVEs. However, no studies on collision avoidance for small-scale IVEs have been conducted yet. Our goal is to close this gap by presenting the results of a controlled user study in a CAVE. 27 participants were immersed in a small-scale office with the task of reaching the office door. Their way was blocked either by a male or female VA, representing their co-worker. The VA showed different behavioral patterns regarding gaze and locomotion. Our results indicate that participants preferred collaborative collision avoidance: they expect the VA to step aside in order to get more space to pass while being willing to adapt their own walking paths.",2016.0,15.0,27.0,"{'pages': '145-148', 'name': '2016 IEEE Symposium on 3D User Interfaces (3DUI)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bönsch2016CollisionAI,\n author = {A.

Nonetheless, as predicted, other-oriented empathic responsiveness was negatively related to proneness to shame but positively correlated with proneness to guilt. In contrast, an index of more self-oriented personal distress was positively linked to shame-proneness.

First, no simple criterion picks out propositions about morality from within the larger set of deontic propositions concerning what is permissible and impermissible in social relations, the law, games, and manners. Second, the mechanisms underlying emotions and deontic evaluations are independent and operate in parallel, and so some scenarios elicit emotions prior to moral evaluations, some elicit moral evaluations prior to emotions, and some elicit them at the same time. Third, deontic evaluations depend on inferences, either unconscious intuitions or conscious reasoning. Fourth, human beliefs about what is, and isn’t, moral are neither complete nor consistent.

The crowd emotional model could be used to simulate how crowd behavior in emergency scenarios and be helpful for developing crowd evacuation plans in emergency situations. However, existing crowd emotional models usually set model parameters in an empirical manner and are not validated by real cases. In this paper, a crowd emotional model is proposed to simulate the crowd movement in outdoor emergency situations. First of all, the crowd entropy and the movement difference are proposed to describe the emotional impact of the crowd scene on the agents. The perception of vision and hearing are considered, and the calculation formulas of the agent's emotional intensity and crowd emotional contagion are proposed. By calculating individual trajectories in the real video, the cumulative differences between the movements of the real crowd and the corresponding virtual crowd are analyzed. At last, a multi‐parameter optimization method is implemented by the differential evolution algorithm. To verify the parameters in models, three videos which are generated from three real cases, including explosion attack, shooting incident, and crowd disturbance are selected for experimental verification. The results showed that the proposed model could be a feasible method for optimizing parameters to simulate the emergency scenario.",2021.0,36.0,2.0,"{'name': 'Computer Animation and Virtual Worlds', 'volume': '32'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zhuo2021ModelingCE,\n author = {Lin Zhuo and Zhen Liu and Tingting Liu and Chih-Chieh Hung and Yanjie Chai},\n booktitle = {Comput.

The main characteristic of the considered systems is that they can be viewed as a class of multi-input multioutput systems in the nonstrict feedback structure. The similar control problem of this class of systems has been addressed in the past, but it focused on the continuous-time systems. Due to the complicacies of the system structure, it will become more difficult for the controller design and the stability analysis. To stabilize this class of systems, a new recursive procedure is developed, and the effect caused by the noncausal problem in the nonstrict feedback DT structure can be solved using a semirecurrent neural approximation. Based on the Lyapunov difference approach, it is proved that all the signals of the closed-loop system are semiglobal, ultimately uniformly bounded, and a good tracking performance can be guaranteed. The feasibility of the proposed controllers can be validated by setting a simulation example.",2017.0,67.0,61.0,"{'volume': '28', 'pages': '1531-1541', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Liu2017NeuralAA,\n author = {Yanjun Liu and Shu Li and Shaocheng Tong and C.

This was the birth of positive organizational scholarship, a new field that focused on what they called “positive deviance”—outcomes that far exceeded normal success. 
 
 In his previous book Positive Leadership, Cameron outlined four leadership strategies—Positive Climate, Positive Relationships, Positive Communications, and Positive Meaning—that characterize exceptionally high-performing organizations. Here he takes these strategies further by laying out tactics for implementing them: 
 
 • Creating a Culture of Abundance: five specific steps leaders can take to create an organizational culture that enables members to experience vitality, flourishing, and engagement 
 • Developing Positive Energy Networks: tools and practices for cultivating positive energy in oneself and for diffusing it throughout the organization 
 • Delivering Negative Feedback Positively: techniques for delivering difficult but necessary messages in ways that build and strengthen relationships 
 • Establishing and Achieving Everest Goals: guidelines for setting goals that have all the characteristics of SMART goals but go far beyond them 
 • Applying Positive Leadership in Organizations: a powerful tool for determining exactly how to implement positive leadership practices in the particular circumstances of your organization 
 
 Study after study (some of which are cited in the book) has shown that companies practicing positive leadership far outperform their competitors. So virtue may be its own reward, but it also delivers breakthrough results that any organization can achieve thanks to Kim Cameron’s concise, how-to guide.",2013.0,0.0,59.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Cameron2013PracticingPL,\n author = {K.

The amalgamation of computer graphics and artificial intelligence has lead to the possibility of creating believable virtual personalities. The focus has shifted from modeling and animation towards imparting personalities to virtual humans. The aim is to create virtual humans that can interact spontaneously using a natural language, emotions and gestures. This paper discusses a system that allows the design of personality for emotional virtual human. We adopt the Five Factor Model (FFM) of personality from psychology studies. To realize the model, we use Bayesian Belief Network. We introduce a layered approach for modeling personality, moods and emotions. In order to demonstrate a virtual human with emotional personality, we integrate the system into a chat application. Thus, the system enables the developer to design and implement personalities and enables the user to interact with them.",2002.0,13.0,227.0,{'pages': '107-115'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Kshirsagar2002AMP,\n author = {S.

The status of cognitive functions is of specific importance in case of affective disorders, due to their influence not only on patients' behaviour, but to a certain extent also on the success of psychotherapy. In addition, examining the impact of mood and affective disorders on cognitive functions also helps us understand the relationship between brain plasticity and neurocognitive networks. While the relationship between explicit, conscious memory and mood are relatively well-explored, the effect of mood and affective disorders on working memory and implicit sequence learning received less attention. The present review aims to overview available results in these less-explored areas. Research suggests that while working memory performance shows impairments in MDE and in some specific mood conditions, effects of affective disorders and mood on implicit sequence learning are more contradictory, highlighting the need for further studies in this field.",2014.0,189.0,8.0,"{'volume': '16 1', 'pages': '\n          29-42\n        ', 'name': 'Neuropsychopharmacologia Hungarica : a Magyar Pszichofarmakologiai Egyesulet lapja = official journal of the Hungarian Association of Psychopharmacology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Borbély-Ipkovich2014TheEO,\n author = {E.

2145,a828fd17399d0ec9f59801e21230e7f6391757f4,Emergence of Scaling in Random Networks,"level of Co and a maximum of inverse TMR is expected when the Fermi level of LSMO is approximately at the maximum of the spin2 DOS of Co. This is consistent with the maximum of inverse TMR observed at 20.4 V for Co/STO/LSMO junctions (Fig. 3A). For a positive bias, the TMR is expected to change sign and become normal above 1 V when the Fermi level of LSMO goes down into the energy range of the majority spin d-band of Co. This is also observed in Fig. 3A. For ALO and ALO/STO barriers, a predominant tunneling of s-character electrons (see arrow in Fig. 2B) is the usual explanation of the positive polarization (6–8). The rapid drop with bias (Fig. 3B) is similar to what has been observed in most junctions with ALO barriers, and completely different from what is obtained when the tunneling is predominantly by d-character electrons (Fig. 3A). The origin of this rapid decrease of the TMR at relatively small bias has never been clearly explained. This is roughly consistent with the energy dependence of the DOS induced by sp-d bonding effects on the first atomic layer of ALO in the calculation of Nguyen-Mahn et al. (8) for the Co-ALO interface. But Zhang et al. (13) have also shown that a large part of the TMR drop can be attributed to the excitation of spin waves. The experiments reported here and in several recent publications (3, 4) demonstrate the important role of the electronic structure of the metal-oxide interface in determining the spin polarization of the tunneling electrons. The negative polarization for the Co-STO interface has been ascribed to d-d bonding effects between Al and Ti (4). This interpretation is similar to that proposed to explain, in terms of sp-d bonding, the positive polarization at the Co-ALO interface (8). However, there is no general theory predicting the trend of the experimental results for Co—that is, a negative polarization with oxides of d elements (STO, CLO, Ta2O5) and a positive one when there are only s and p states (ALO). It is likely that the spin polarization should also depend on the position of the Fermi level with respect to the electronic levels of each character above and below the gap of the insulator. In addition, as an evanescent wave in an insulator is a Bloch wave with an imaginary wave vector, one can expect different decay lengths for Bloch waves of different character. This means that the final polarization could also depend on the thickness of the barrier, as illustrated by the calculations of MacLaren et al. for Fe/ZnSe/Fe junctions (14). The influence of the barrier on the spin polarization opens new ways to shape and optimize the TMR. Interesting bias dependencies can be obtained with barriers selecting the d electrons and probing the fine structure of the d-DOS, as in Fig. 3A. The DOS of a d-band can also be easily tailored by alloying (for example, by introduction of virtual bound states) to produce specific bias dependencies. Although here we concentrated on the problem of the spin polarization of the Co electrode and regarded the strongly spin-polarized LSMO only as a useful spin analyzer, the large TMR ratios obtained by combining Co and LSMO electrodes (50% with a STO barrier) are also an interesting result. The drawback arising from the low Curie temperature of LSMO (;350 K) is the reduction of the TMR at room temperature, down to about 5% at 300 K in Co/STO/ LSMO (4). However, other types of oxides of the double-perovskite family (for example, Sr2FeMoO6) combine electronic properties similar to those of manganites with a definitely higher Curie temperature (15). Their use in magnetic tunnel junctions is promising for a new generation of tunnel junctions with very high magnetoresistance for room-temperature applications.",1999.0,11.0,31333.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{McInnes1999EmergenceOS,\n author = {B.

These gestures are known as symbolic gestures, emblematic gestures, or emblems. Just as every culture has its own verbal language, every culture also develops its own emblem vocabulary in gestures. Although the meaning and function of emblems are similar across cultures, their form is different. Thus, emblematic gestures are culture specific (and some are gender specific within cultures). This is true not only of national cultures but also of organizational cultures (e.g., the military, sports teams). Unlike illustrators, emblems can stand on their own without speech and convey verbal meaning, such as the American A-OK sign, the peace sign (two fingers up, palm facing outward), or OK (thumb up, hand in fist). Many of the emblems of most cultures are devoted to insults or obscenities. Emblems are true body language, with clear verbal meanings, for good or bad.

We analyze the walking behavior of users when avoiding real and virtual static obstacles. In order to generalize our study, we consider both anthropomorphic and inanimate objects, each having his virtual and real counterpart. The results showed that users exhibit different locomotion behaviors in the presence of real and virtual obstacles, and in the presence of anthropomorphic and inanimate objects. Precisely, the results showed a decrease of walking speed as well as an increase of the clearance distance (i. e., the minimal distance between the walker and the obstacle) when facing virtual obstacles compared to real ones. Moreover, our results suggest that users act differently due to their perception of the obstacle: users keep more distance when the obstacle is anthropomorphic compared to an inanimate object and when the orientation of anthropomorphic obstacle is from the profile compared to a front position.

An Illustration with a Virtual Card Game Paradigm,"In recent decades, many studies have shown that schizophrenia is associated with severe social cognitive impairments affecting key components, such as the recognition of emotions, theory of mind, attributional style, and metacognition. Most studies investigated each construct separately, precluding analysis of the interactive and immersive nature of real-life situation. Specialized batteries of tests are under investigation to assess social cognition, which is thought now as a link between neurocognitive disorders and impaired functioning. However, this link accounts for a limited part of the variance of real-life functioning. To fill this gap, advances in virtual reality and affective computing have made it possible to carry out experimental investigations of naturalistic social cognition, in controlled conditions, with good reproducibility. This approach is illustrated with the description of a new paradigm based on an original virtual card game in which subjects interpret emotional displays from a female virtual agent, and decipher her helping intentions. Independent variables concerning emotional expression in terms of valence and intensity were manipulated. We show how several useful dependant variables, ranging from classic experimental psychology data to metacognition or subjective experiences records, may be extracted from a single experiment. Methodological issues about the immersion into a simulated intersubjective situation are considered. The example of this new flexible experimental setting, with regards to the many constructs recognized in social neurosciences, constitutes a rationale for focusing on this potential intermediate link between standardized tests and real-life functioning, and also for using it as an innovative media for cognitive remediation.",2015.0,89.0,14.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Oker2015HowAW,\n author = {A.

2167,a9ff6aeeafdb64cda62fd25b2badfb6ddf5349c3,Control Strategies for Crowd Emotional Contagion Coupling the Virtual and Physical Cyberspace in Emergencies,"Crowd emotional contagion occurs in both virtual and physical cyberspace at the same time. To realistically simulate the process of crowd emotional contagion, the influences of virtual cyberspace and physical cyberspace should be considered comprehensively. In addition, control strategies significantly affect the speed and scale of emotional contagion in a crowd. However, control strategies described by existing studies are inaccurate since few of them consider both physical and virtual cyberspace to jointly study the influence of control strategies on crowd emotional contagion. To achieve more accurate control, we first establish a novel personalized emotional contagion computational (NP-ECC) model to study control strategies of crowd emotional contagion coupling the physical and virtual cyberspace. Second, we construct a personalized BA scale-free network to calculate the phase transition threshold of the proposed NP-ECC model more accurately. Finally, we propose two algorithms, control strategies-BA (CS-BA) and threshold-BA (T-BA), to verify the stability of the NP-ECC model and the accuracy of the phase transition threshold, respectively. The experimental results show that our method can better control the speed and scale of crowd emotional contagion and thus can provide guidance for a large-scale crowd evacuation.",2020.0,55.0,5.0,"{'name': 'IEEE Access', 'pages': '37712-37726', 'volume': '8'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hong2020ControlSF,\n author = {Xiao Hong and Guijuan Zhang and Dianjie Lu},\n booktitle = {IEEE Access},\n journal = {IEEE Access},\n pages = {37712-37726},\n title = {Control Strategies for Crowd Emotional Contagion Coupling the Virtual and Physical Cyberspace in Emergencies},\n volume = {8},\n year = {2020}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2112811106', 'name': 'Xiao Hong'}, {'authorId': '3172102', 'name': 'Guijuan Zhang'}, {'authorId': '7382513', 'name': 'Dianjie Lu'}]"
2168,aa124a389ab617eedcbd4d33a718e2c1213e25ee,Social VR: How Personal Space is Affected by Virtual Agents' Emotions,"Personal space (PS), the flexible protective zone maintained around oneself, is a key element of everyday social interactions. It, e.g., affects people's interpersonal distance and is thus largely involved when navigating through social environments. However, the PS is regulated dynamically, its size depends on numerous social and personal characteristics and its violation evokes different levels of discomfort and physiological arousal. Thus, gaining more insight into this phenomenon is important. We contribute to the PS investigations by presenting the results of a controlled experiment in a CAVE, focusing on German males in the age of 18 to 30 years. The PS preferences of 27 participants have been sampled while they were approached by either a single embodied, computer-controlled virtual agent (VA) or by a group of three VAs. In order to investigate the influence of a VA's emotions, we altered their facial expression between angry and happy. Our results indicate that the emotion as well as the number of VAs approaching influence the PS: larger distances are chosen to angry VAs compared to happy ones; single VAs are allowed closer compared to the group. Thus, our study is a foundation for social and behavioral studies investigating PS preferences.",2018.0,48.0,50.0,"{'pages': '199-206', 'name': '2018 IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (VR)'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Bönsch2018SocialVH,\n author = {A.

Safety officers are often dispatched to scenes of emergencies because their positive emotions can calm the crowd down and avoid serious accidents. However, how to utilize the positive emotional contagion to maximize the “calm-down” effect remains a challenging problem in crowd evacuation. In this paper, we present an approach for optimizing positive emotional contagion in crowd evacuation. First, a computational model of positive emotional contagion is proposed to describe how safety officers calm a crowd down. To capture important influential factors for positive emotional contagion, such as the trust relationships among the individuals involved in a crisis situation and the variations of emotional contagion speed, we construct a trust-based emotional contagion network (Trust-ECN) and a heterogeneous emotional contagion speed computation model (HECS-CM). Based on these models, the emotional contagion process can be analyzed in a parametric way, and the infection probability for each individual in a given time window can be computed analytically with a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). Second, a maximization problem of emotional contagion is formulated. Since this optimization problem is NP-hard, an artificial bee colony optimized emotional contagion (ABCEC) algorithm is used to solve for the optimal positions of safety officers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both synthetic and real-world data at different scales. Finally, we implement a crowd simulation system to visualize the results of our theoretical analysis in a graphical manner. The proposed method can provide guidance for emergency response management.",2020.0,48.0,46.0,"{'volume': '11', 'pages': '708-721', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zhang2020StrategiesTU,\n author = {Guijuan Zhang and Dianjie Lu and Hong Liu},\n journal = {IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing},\n pages = {708-721},\n title = {Strategies to Utilize the Positive Emotional Contagion Optimally in Crowd Evacuation},\n volume = {11},\n year = {2020}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '3172102', 'name': 'Guijuan Zhang'}, {'authorId': '7382513', 'name': 'Dianjie Lu'}, {'authorId': '2118902760', 'name': 'Hong Liu'}]"

The participants’ behavior is, however, a response to cognitively processed stimuli. Consequently, researchers must ensure that virtually perceived stimuli resemble those present in the real world to ensure the ecological validity of collected findings. Our article provides a literature review relating to distance perception in virtual reality. Furthermore, we present a new study that compares verbal distance estimates within real and virtual environments. The virtual space—a replica of a real outdoor area—was displayed using a state-of-the-art head-mounted display. Investigated distances ranged from 8 to 13 m. Overall, the results show no significant difference between egocentric distance estimates in real and virtual environments. However, a more in-depth analysis suggests that the order in which participants were exposed to the two environments may affect the outcome. Furthermore, the study suggests that a rising experience of immersion leads to an alignment of the estimated virtual distances with the real ones. The results also show that the discrepancy between estimates of real and virtual distances increases with the incongruity between virtual and actual eye heights, demonstrating the importance of an accurately set virtual eye height.",2020.0,135.0,29.0,"{'volume': '49', 'pages': '940 - 967', 'name': 'Perception'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Feldstein2020EgocentricDP,\n author = {I.

The instructional impact of this interaction in learning environments has not been established, however. This study examined the impact of emotion and gender of a pedagogical agent as a learning companion (PAL) on social judgements, interest, self-efficacy, and learning. Two experiments investigated separately the effects of a PAL’s emotional expression and empathetic response. Experiment 1 focused on emotional expression (positive vs. negative vs. neutral) and gender (male vs. female) with a sample of 142 male and female college students in a computer literacy course. Experiment 2 investigated the impact of empathetic response (responsive vs. non-responsive) and gender with 56 pre-service teachers. Overall, the results yielded main and interaction effects of PAL emotion and gender on the dependent variables. In particular, the PAL’s empathetic response had a positive impact on learner interest and self-efficacy; PAL gender had a positive impact on recall. The findings imply that the emotion and the gender of the digital learning companion could be utilized to optimize college students’ motivation and learning.",2007.0,85.0,191.0,"{'volume': '23', 'pages': '220-234', 'name': 'J.

2196,ac6ec6a266df0d8245959319d55caa1c133adf7e,Emotional agents - state of the art and applications,"last decade, intensive research on emotional intelligence has advanced 
 significantly from its theoretical basis, analytical studies and processing 
 technology to exploratory applications in a wide range of real-life domains. 
 This paper brings new insights in the field of emotional, intelligent 
 software agents. The first part is devoted to an overview of the 
 state-of-the-art in emotional intelligence research with emphasis on 
 emotional agents. A wide range of applications in different areas like 
 modeling emotional agents, aspects of learning in emotional environments, 
 interactive emotional systems and so on are presented. After that we suggest 
 a systematic order of research steps with the idea of proposing an adequate 
 framework for several possible real-life applications of emotional agents. We 
 recognize that it is necessary to apply specific methods for dynamic data 
 analysis in order to identify and discover new knowledge from available 
 emotional information and data sets. The last part of the paper discusses 
 research activities for designing an agent-based architecture, in which 
 agents are capable of reasoning about and displaying some kind of emotions 
 based on emotions detected in human speech, as well as online documents.

To address this question, 50 participants (25 females and 25 males) were exposed to either a real-life contemplative scenario (a panoramic view of a lake) or to an immersive 360° footage of the same landscape. Next, type and valence of emotions, as well as sense of presence reported by participants, were compared across conditions. Findings showed that emotions elicited by virtual and natural conditions were not significantly different. The only exception was anger, which was significantly higher in the natural condition, and amusement, which was significantly higher in the virtual condition. Sense of physical presence and engagement dimensions of presence did not significantly differ between virtual and real conditions. However, different correlation patterns between emotions and key dimensions of presence were found after in vivo and in virtuo exposure. These findings provide initial evidence that emotions and sense of presence elicited by immersive videos are comparable with those evoked by real-life scenarios and warrant further investigations.",2019.0,23.0,113.0,"{'volume': '22 3', 'pages': '\n          220-226\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chirico2019WhenVF,\n author = {A.

The perceiver was given no opportunity to interact with the target, a condition we refer to as zero acquaintance. We reasoned that in order to make personality judgments, perceivers would use the information available to them (physical appearance). Consensus in personality judgments would result, then, from shared stereotypes about particular physical appearance characteristics. Results from three separate studies with 259 subjects supported this hypothesis. On two of the five dimensions (extraversion and conscientiousness) on which subjects rated each other, a significant proportion of variance was due to the stimulus target. Consensus on judgments of extraversion appears to have been largely mediated by judgments of physical attractiveness. Across the three studies there was also evidence that the consensus in judgments on these two dimensions had some validity, in that they correlated with self-judgments on those two dimensions.",1988.0,43.0,484.0,"{'volume': '55 3', 'pages': '\n          387-95\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Albright1988ConsensusIP,\n author = {L.

2201,ad07b99615407b4bf5c0967571d6bd8b9f969ff7,Empathy and Moral Development: Implications for caring and Justice.,"Empathy and Moral Development represents the life’s work of Professor Hoffman, integrating over 30 years of research with information and ideas gleaned from the psychological and social development theories of the last century. Starting with biblical concepts of sin and guilt and drawing on the germinal theories of historical figures such as Rousseau, Freud and Piaget, the author also discusses Kohlberg’s theory and modifications by later followers. 
 
The first chapter begins with a brief overview of the previous and current theories and the historical sources for the book, giving clear definitions and outlining the theory to follow. Each of the seven sections of the book expands on important key concepts introduced earlier. There are frequent references to and review of the previously discussed material. The first section of the book explains the “innocent bystander” model that has been used for decades to explore human moral development. Concepts from animal arousal and behavior models are linked with human infant research on early affective and cognitive development. The research quoted is illustrative and extensive. The section ends with a discussion of the differences between empathy, guilt, sympathy and injustice. Parts Two and Three introduce the concept of guilt and how parental discipline interacts with a child’s cognitive skills to guide moral development. This first half of the book could have been expanded further through the use of more examples and further exploration of how genetics and innate brain processes contribute to the development of empathy. Hoffman also seemed to emphasize the psychosocial aspects over the behavioral cognitive and genetic aspects, but it is a good review of the field to date. 
 
The second half of the book is very interesting. The examples given are more current, complete and involved. The author shines as he discusses his integration of existing theory and research into a comprehensive model. He sketches a brief picture of different types of guilt, and a theoretical hierarchy. He expands on his assertion that both parental discipline and peer interaction are necessary for the development of guilt and morality. His collected statistics on parental discipline and its effects on children’s moral development are impressive. He explains why empathy can operate in some situations and can be overwhelmed in others, even when the individuals involved are highly empathic (i.e. therapist burnout). Numerous examples are given of how guilt and empathy are motivators for human action, especially prosocial and “altruistic” actions. In light of the events of September 11, 2001, Hoffman’s concepts explain much of the individual and social group actions which followed. 
 
Section Four of the book asks the question “Is Empathy Enough” to explain moral action. Types of bias which may affect empathy and moral action are examined. Empathy’s self-destructive and self-limiting qualities are explored and integrated in Darwinian fashion. Hoffman states that a morality based on empathy alone would not be fair in large mixed or larger human groups and would lead to bias and conflict. To live together peaceably, Hoffman insists that empathy must be embedded in moral principles, the subject of the fifth part of the book. Hoffman shows how empathy (affect) becomes linked or bonded to moral principles (of cognitive and social origin) as the person develops. The synthesis is used powerfully to explain the perpetuation of social attributes of caring and justice in western society. Useful definitions of key concepts in justice research are included. 
 
Parts six and seven of the book are the slimmest and cover culture, wherein issues of the universal applicability of the key concepts are examined, and intervention, which hopefully can someday be expanded into its own volume. A few directions in designing empathic training for use in young offenders and other children at risk are given, but not in the kind of depth currently desperately needed in the field. 
 
The book is well organized in its scant 300 pages and set up as a graduate course. It is an easy book from which to learn. It would make an ideal text and makes for a brilliant discussion overall, as it presents the author’s theory that will, no doubt, form the basis for future research and intervention in this area.",2003.0,0.0,1822.0,"{'volume': '12', 'pages': '46-47', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Vogt2003EmpathyAM,\n author = {Lori Ann Vogt},\n pages = {46-47},\n title = {Empathy and Moral Development: Implications for caring and Justice.},\n volume = {12},\n year = {2003}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '115702696', 'name': 'Lori Ann Vogt'}]"

Existing studies on the relation between sense of presence and level of anxiety, however, have yielded mixed results on the correlation between the two. In this meta-analysis, we reviewed publications on VRET for anxiety that included self-reported presence and anxiety. The comprehensive search of the literature identified 33 publications with a total of 1196 participants. The correlation between self-reported sense of presence and anxiety was extracted and meta-analyzed. Potential moderators such as technology characteristics, sample characteristics including age, gender and clinical status, disorder characteristics and study design characteristics such as measurements were also examined. The random effects analysis showed a medium effect size for the correlation between sense of presence and anxiety (r = .28; 95% CI: 0.18–0.38). Moderation analyses revealed that the effect size of the correlation differed across different anxiety disorders, with a large effect size for fear of animals (r = .50; 95% CI: 0.30–0.66) and a no to small effect size for social anxiety disorder (r = .001; 95% CI: −0.19–0.19). Further, the correlation between anxiety and presence was stronger in studies with participants who met criteria for an anxiety disorder than in studies with a non-clinical population. Trackers with six degrees of freedom and displays with a larger field of view resulted in higher effect sizes, compared to trackers with three degrees of freedom and displays with a smaller field of view. In addition, no difference in effect size was found for the type of presence measurement and the type of anxiety measurement.

Due to the move toward including students with disabilities in the general education classroom, functional color applications are critical. This article reviews and analyzes existing literature and empirical evidence related to use of color in the classroom for students of all abilities. The three major areas reviewed were (1) the inclusive classroom for students with disabilities, (2) color theory, and (3) the physiological and psychological aspects of color. The results show that color is important in designing functional learning spaces. The results of this analysis may benefit educators, parents, and design professionals in designing beneficial learning environments for all students.",2011.0,38.0,64.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Gaines2011TheIC,\n author = {K.

A challenge in such environments is that the time that elapses between deciding to take an action and receiving a reward based on its outcome can be longer than the interval between successive decisions. We explore this in the context of a non-player character (NPC) in a modern first-person shooter game. Such games take place in 3D environments where players, both human and computer-controlled, compete by engaging in combat and completing task objectives. We investigate the use of RL to enable NPCs to gather experience from game-play and improve their shooting skill over time from a reward signal based on the damage caused to opponents. We propose a new method for RL updates and reward calculations, in which the updates are carried out periodically, after each shooting encounter has ended, and a new weighted-reward mechanism is used which increases the reward applied to actions that lead to damaging the opponent in successive hits in what we term “hit clusters”.",2015.0,14.0,13.0,"{'pages': '344-351', 'name': '2015 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Glavin2015LearningTS,\n author = {F.

Over the years the members of this group discussed even the most far-reaching ideas with me and without their professional and personal support this work would not have been possible. First and foremost, I am most grateful to my advisor Ipke Wachsmuth for trusting in my hidden abilities from the very beginning. With his idea to let me investigate the fascinating problem of emotion simulation for our virtual human MAX, he gave me the chance to experience the "" world of science "" to which I am now addicted. I would like to thank all members of the AI Group, including for reminding me from time to time that the emotion simulation cannot be applied to every problem of Computer Science. Special thanks go to Stefan Kopp for his long-standing technical and ideational support as my colleague and friend. I am also indebted to Helmut Prendinger for supervising me during three-month in 2005 as a Pre-doctoral fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science in Tokyo, Japan, and supporting me ever since. Further special thanks go to Klaus Scherer, who agreed to be the second reviewer of this thesis and found the time to share my fascination for this challenging research. I am also grateful to Roger Giles and Nick Thomas for proofreading parts of the manuscript and to for insightful discussions and advices. Finally, I owe many thanks to my family, especially to my mother Dorothea, my brother Jörg, and my son Jonas. But most importantly, without the love and practical as well as "" mental "" support of my wife Yoko, finishing this thesis would have been close to impossible— thank you so much for your love and encouragement.",2008.0,206.0,103.0,{'pages': '1-188'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Becker-Asano2008WASABIAS,\n author = {C.

This hypothesis has become widely acknowledged both in the popular media and scientific research. Surprisingly, empirical evidence for the hypothesis has remained inconsistent. In the present article, we reinterpret the original uncanny valley hypothesis and review empirical evidence for different theoretically motivated uncanny valley hypotheses. The uncanny valley could be understood as the naïve claim that any kind of human-likeness manipulation will lead to experienced negative affinity at close-to-realistic levels. More recent hypotheses have suggested that the uncanny valley would be caused by artificial–human categorization difficulty or by a perceptual mismatch between artificial and human features. Original formulation also suggested that movement would modulate the uncanny valley. The reviewed empirical literature failed to provide consistent support for the naïve uncanny valley hypothesis or the modulatory effects of movement. Results on the categorization difficulty hypothesis were still too scarce to allow drawing firm conclusions. In contrast, good support was found for the perceptual mismatch hypothesis. Taken together, the present review findings suggest that the uncanny valley exists only under specific conditions. More research is still needed to pinpoint the exact conditions under which the uncanny valley phenomenon manifests itself.",2015.0,83.0,275.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kätsyri2015ARO,\n author = {J.

2226,afb216f806006c5b173dc1d745d3371165695db8,Toward socially responsible agents: integrating attachment and learning in emotional decision‐making,"Our goal is to create socially responsible agents, either robots or virtual humans. In this paper, we present an integration of emotions, attachment, and learning in emotional decision‐making to achieve this goal. Based on emerging psychological theories, we aim at building human‐like emotional decision‐making, where emotions play a central role in selecting the next action to be performed by the agent. Here, we present our own approach for emotion appraisal where we use emotional attachment as an important impulse for determining the intensities of emotions. Emotions in their turn are used to calculate the emotional attachment toward the users and for learning to predict future consequences. We report on the results of a simulation evaluation where we assess the influence of emotions, attachment, and learning on decision‐making. It is our strong belief that by giving an agent the ability to have emotions and to feel empathy and emotional attachment toward others, we will ultimately give this agent the ability to learn and improve its social behavior skills through interactions with the users and through user feedback.

Unlike goal-oriented AR systems that augment reality with informative instructions, FingAR Puppet helps children associate expressive interpretations with immediate reality. Empirical results show that FingAR Puppet promotes reasoning about emotional states, communication and divergent thinking during social pretend play for children 4-6 years old. We suggest that this study opens an interesting space for future AR systems to support complex cognitive and social development in early childhood. We also identify broader implications from using theories of cognitive development to guide the design of tangible and augmented interactions.",2015.0,42.0,45.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Bai2015ExploringEA,\n author = {Zhen Bai and A.

However, it can be said that virtual reality is in the early days of adoption for education. Studies show that using virtual reality in education can positively affect students’ learning experiences. In this study, the effect of an educational virtual reality game, named “Keşfet Kurtul”, on fourth-grade students’ academic achievement in fractions and their engagement to mathematics was investigated. The experimental study was carried out using a quasi-experimental design. The educational VR game was used in the treatment group (N = 32). In the comparison group (N = 32), the method applied in school, which includes predominantly mobile applications developed in fractions, were used. As a result of the research; the educational VR game “Keşfet Kurtul” was found to increase academic achievement and to maintain the level of student engagement in mathematics. It was determined that the experimental method has the same effect as the method applied in school in the comparison group, in terms of academic achievement and student engagement to mathematics. Besides, in terms of social sub-dimension of student engagement, it was observed that Keşfet Kurtul was more effective than the method applied in school.",2020.0,73.0,21.0,"{'volume': '31', 'pages': '1467 - 1484', 'name': 'Interactive Learning Environments'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Akman2020TheEO,\n author = {Emrah Akman and R.

On the basis of a new process conception of emotion regulation, we hypothesized that in low-intensity negative situations, people would show a relative preference to choose to regulate emotions by engagement reappraisal, which allows emotional processing. However, we expected people in high-intensity negative situations to show a relative preference to choose to regulate emotions by disengagement distraction, which blocks emotional processing at an early stage before it gathers force. In three experiments, we created emotional contexts that varied in intensity, using either emotional pictures (Experiments 1 and 2) or unpredictable electric stimulation (Experiment 3). In response to these emotional contexts, participants chose between using either reappraisal or distraction as an emotion-regulation strategy. Results in all experiments supported our hypothesis. This pattern in the choice of emotion-regulation strategies has important implications for the understanding of healthy adaptation.",2011.0,25.0,1091.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '1391 - 1396', 'name': 'Psychological Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sheppes2011EmotionRegulationC,\n author = {G.

This paper outlines assumptions of a model on how emotions influence students' learning and achievement. Such effects have been studied empirically for test anxiety, and for positive vs. negative mood. It may be assumed, however, that many other emotions exert effects on performance as well. Assumptions on such influences imply that they may be mediated: (1) by cognitive mechanisms of storage and retrieval of information, of processing information, and of emotion's attentional demands; and (2) by motivational mechanisms of intrinsic and extrinsic academic task motivation. The overall effects of emotions are hypothesised to depend on the interplay of different mechanisms. The net effects of positive emotions are assumed to be positive in most cases, whereas overall effects of negative emotions may be ambivalent.

Load sharing varies by physical closeness and relationship quality. We investigated the effect of load sharing on emotional arousal via galvanic skin response, an indicator of sympathetic nervous system arousal, during a social stressor. Social stress was elicited in 66 adolescent girls (Mage = 15 years) using a spontaneous public-speaking task. Mother-daughter dyads reported their relationship quality, and physical closeness was manipulated by having mothers either touch or not touch their daughter's hand during the performance. We found evidence of load sharing among dyads who held hands, independent of relationship quality. However, without physical contact, load sharing was only evident among dyads with higher relationship quality. Thus, high relationship quality buffers against threat in a similar way to the physical comfort of a loved one.",2016.0,52.0,34.0,"{'volume': '16 1', 'pages': '\n          83-93\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lougheed2016SharingTB,\n author = {Jessica P.

Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in the emotion contagion phenomenon in order to model emerging group behaviour. 
 
Stemming from works on multi-agent systems environments, we propose an architecture to manage both internal and external emotion dynamics. Emotions evolve in function of three influences: punctual events, temporal dynamics and external influences. In an embodied agent approach, the first is the responsibility of the agent's mind, the second of the agent's body, and the third of the environment. This functional architecture is then adapted to a multi-agent architecture, adding a control responsibility to the agent body. Finally, we show the results of several experiments to examine the properties of the architecture and its efficiency by comparing it to a full agent approach.",2014.0,27.0,22.0,{'pages': '645-652'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Saunier2014MixedAD,\n author = {Julien Saunier and H.

We explore the feasibility of using a conversational agent to reduce this anxiety. We developed a public-speaking tutor on the Amazon Alexa platform that enables users to engage in cognitive reconstruction exercises. We also investigated how the sociability of the agent might affect its performance as a tutor. A user study of 53 college students with fear of public speaking showed that the interaction with the agent served to assuage pre-speech state anxiety. Agent sociability improved the sense of interpersonal closeness, which was associated with lower pre-speech anxiety. Moreover, sociability of the agent increased participants' satisfaction and their willingness to continue engagement. Our findings, thus, have implications not only for addressing public speaking anxiety in a scalable way but also for the design of future conversational agents using smart speaker platforms.",2020.0,54.0,53.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Wang2020AlexaAC,\n author = {Jinping Wang and Hyun Yang and Ruosi Shao and Saeed Abdullah and S.

We worked with parents of very sick babies who were cared for in a hospital's Neonatal Unit (NNU). Through a combination of interviews, a focus group, and surveys, we developed a user model of the information that parents wanted to share, and how they adapted this information to individual recipients. We then developed a prototype software tool which created adaptive updates for members of the parents' social network. The updates contained summaries of large volumes of complex medical data about the baby, nonmedical information about the parents, and practical information about the hospital. Updates were automatically adapted to individual members of parents' social networks, based on our user model. The tool was evaluated in a large NNU in the United Kingdom with parents of babies who were currently being cared for in the unit. We found that parents adapted the information that they shared about themselves and their babies based on the emotional proximity of their network members. They gave most detail to those who were emotionally closest to them and least to those who were less close. Parents also adapted information content to the recipient's tendency to worry and empathize. Two adaptive strategies were deployed by parents, (a) benign deceit—not telling the whole truth—and (b) promotion of empathetic members of the social network to a higher level of emotional proximity, so that they were given more information. We generated a number of directions for future work, and issues to consider around designing adaptive mediated communications systems for sensitive contexts. These include the potential to generalize our model to other medical contexts and considerations to apply when deliberately designing deceit into adaptive systems.",2014.0,101.0,20.0,"{'volume': '29', 'pages': '256 - 309', 'name': 'Human–Computer Interaction'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Moncur2014ProvidingAH,\n author = {Wendy Moncur and J.

The subject has obsessive compulsive behavior in the form of using a handbody on the sole of the foot repeatedly. Researchers provide interventions in the form of cognitive behavior therapy as interventions to reduce obsessive compulsive behavior, and to improve mental health in schools. This therapy aims to oppose wrong thoughts and emotions by presenting evidence that contradicts beliefs about the problem at hand. The method used in this research is qualitative with a case study approach. Subjects were female who were 16 years old and had obsessive compulsive behavior for 14 months. The cognitive behavior therapy procedure is first, the subject is asked for relaxation in the form of progressivrizkie muscle relaxation to learn to stretch and relax various muscle groups and learn to notice the difference between tension and relax. Second, cognitive restructuring, reducing the anxiety level of the subject caused by negative thoughts and replacing them with more positive thoughts, and. Third, exposure with response prevention, to overcome obsessive compulsive behavior. Where the subject is faced with a situation of having the belief that must perform the usual ritual behavior but the subject is prevented from doing the ritual. If the subject can prevent not doing the ritual and it turns out that something terrible did not happen, this can help in changing the subject's belief in compulsive behavior. The intervention consisted of eight sessions with two sessions a week and 60 minutes each for each session. The results of this study indicate that cognitive behavior therapy is effectively used to reduce the subject's obsessive compulsive behavior, which is shown by decreasing levels of anxiety, negative thinking and compulsive behavior.",2020.0,14.0,252.0,{'name': 'Definitions'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Chand2020CognitiveBT,\n author = {S.

Though queueing analysis has been used in hospitals and other healthcare settings, its use in this sector is not widespread. Yet, given the pervasiveness of delays in healthcare and the fact that many healthcare facilities are trying to meet increasing demands with tightly constrained resources, queueing models can be very useful in developing more effective policies for allocating and managing resources in healthcare facilities. Queueing analysis is also a useful tool for estimating capacity requirements and managing demand for any system in which the timing of service needs is random. This chapter describes basic queueing theory and models as well as some simple modifications and extensions that are particularly useful in the healthcare setting, and gives examples of their use. The critical issue of data requirements is also discussed as well as model choice, modelbuilding and the interpretation and use of results.",2011.0,24.0,17.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Green2011QUEUEINGTA,\n author = {L.

2272,b255474d62f082fa97f50ea1174bf339522f6c99,Facial mimicry in its social setting,"In interpersonal encounters, individuals often exhibit changes in their own facial expressions in response to emotional expressions of another person. Such changes are often called facial mimicry. While this tendency first appeared to be an automatic tendency of the perceiver to show the same emotional expression as the sender, evidence is now accumulating that situation, person, and relationship jointly determine whether and for which emotions such congruent facial behavior is shown. We review the evidence regarding the moderating influence of such factors on facial mimicry with a focus on understanding the meaning of facial responses to emotional expressions in a particular constellation. From this, we derive recommendations for a research agenda with a stronger focus on the most common forms of encounters, actual interactions with known others, and on assessing potential mediators of facial mimicry. We conclude that facial mimicry is modulated by many factors: attention deployment and sensitivity, detection of valence, emotional feelings, and social motivations. We posit that these are the more proximal causes of changes in facial mimicry due to changes in its social setting.",2015.0,171.0,109.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Seibt2015FacialMI,\n author = {Beate Seibt and A.

Thus, simulation of evacuation situations has been identified as an important tool for assessing design choices of urban areas, such as buildings, stadiums, etc., and Agent Based Modelling has been employed to tackle such problems. In this paper, we propose that formal modelling can rigorously define but also naturally lead to realistic simulations of such cases. Our main contribution is presenting how formal state based methods, namely X-machines, can be employed to model agents in emergency evacuation plans. We also discuss the role of emotions, model artificial emotions that change the behaviour of agents under emergency situations, and provide a formalism that models the role of emotions and personality traits in order to create a more realistic scenario. Finally, we demonstrate how the developed formal models can be refined to code, a combination of Net logo and Prolog in this case, that is able to simulate crowd behaviour with and without artificial emotions.",2012.0,32.0,15.0,"{'volume': '1', 'pages': '1133-1138', 'name': '2012 IEEE 24th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Stamatopoulou2012FormalAM,\n author = {I.

2282,b35ef05cf12c8980684eb7e1d63452d3a5ffbb13,Bystander Responses to a Violent Incident in an Immersive Virtual Environment,"Under what conditions will a bystander intervene to try to stop a violent attack by one person on another? It is generally believed that the greater the size of the crowd of bystanders, the less the chance that any of them will intervene. A complementary model is that social identity is critical as an explanatory variable. For example, when the bystander shares common social identity with the victim the probability of intervention is enhanced, other things being equal. However, it is generally not possible to study such hypotheses experimentally for practical and ethical reasons. Here we show that an experiment that depicts a violent incident at life-size in immersive virtual reality lends support to the social identity explanation. 40 male supporters of Arsenal Football Club in England were recruited for a two-factor between-groups experiment: the victim was either an Arsenal supporter or not (in-group/out-group), and looked towards the participant for help or not during the confrontation. The response variables were the numbers of verbal and physical interventions by the participant during the violent argument. The number of physical interventions had a significantly greater mean in the in-group condition compared to the out-group. The more that participants perceived that the Victim was looking to them for help the greater the number of interventions in the in-group but not in the out-group. These results are supported by standard statistical analysis of variance, with more detailed findings obtained by a symbolic regression procedure based on genetic programming.

The aim of this article was to assess the efficacy of computer-assisted cognitive remediation (CACR) in schizophrenia and to determine whether CACR enables selective treatment of specific cognitive domains. Method A meta-analysis was performed on 16 randomized controlled trials evaluating CACR. The effect sizes of differences between CACR and control groups were computed and classified according to the cognitive domain assessed. The possible influences of four potential moderator variables were examined: participants' age, treatment duration, weekly frequency, and control condition type. To test the domain-specific effect, the intended goal of each study was determined and the effect sizes were sorted accordingly. The effect sizes of the cognitive domains explicitly targeted by the interventions were then compared with those that were not. Results CACR enhanced general cognition with a mean effect size of 0.38 [confidence interval (CI) 0.20–0.55]. A significant medium effect size of 0.64 (CI 0.29–0.99) was found for Social Cognition. Improvements were also significant in Verbal Memory, Working Memory, Attention/Vigilance and Speed of Processing with small effect sizes. Cognitive domains that were specifically targeted by the interventions did not yield higher effects than those that were not. Conclusions The results lend support to the efficacy of CACR with particular emphasis on Social Cognition. The difficulty in targeting specific domains suggests a ‘non-specific’ effect of CACR. These results are discussed in the light of the possible bias in remediation tasks due to computer interface design paradigms.",2010.0,44.0,207.0,"{'volume': '41', 'pages': '163 - 173', 'name': 'Psychological Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Grynszpan2010EfficacyAS,\n author = {O.

Virtual reality (VR)-based interventions, which provide a safe nonjudging environment, may improve symptoms awareness in patients with depressive disorders. This study aimed to explore the feasibility of a novel VR software, the VRight, in depressive patients. Adult outpatients with depressive disorders presenting to our mental health clinic during December 2018 were invited to participate in the study. Participants completed a satisfaction survey at the end of the session, including questions about user-friendliness and about usefulness of the software. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was administered to participants before and after the VR-based intervention to assess depressive symptoms severity. We explored the correlation between the score difference and the variables: age, gender, and initial score. Twenty-eight patients (71.4 percent women, mean age: 51.18 ± 16.13 years) were recruited. Thirteen subjects had major depressive disorder (46.4 percent). Most of the patients (n = 26) were satisfied with the VR experience, which they found to be helpful. PHQ-9 score difference and the initial score correlated positively at a significant level. There was no significant correlation between score difference and age or gender. VRight was well accepted among depressive patients, showing high levels of satisfaction. The VRight could contribute to increase depressive symptoms awareness, which is of clinical relevance given the association of greater insight with positive outcomes in depression. Further studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of VRight as a psychoeducational tool in clinical practice.",2020.0,39.0,21.0,"{'name': 'Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Migoya-Borja2020FeasibilityOA,\n author = {Marta Migoya-Borja and D.

Therapists could benefit from extensive control of anxiety eliciting stimuli during virtual exposure. Two stimuli controls are studied in this study: the social dialogue situation, and the dialogue feedback responses (negative or positive) between a human and a virtual character. In the first study, 16 participants were exposed in three virtual reality scenarios: a neutral virtual world, blind date scenario, and job interview scenario. Results showed a significant difference between the three virtual scenarios in the level of self-reported anxiety and heart rate. In the second study, 24 participants were exposed to a job interview scenario in a virtual environment where the ratio between negative and positive dialogue feedback responses of a virtual character was systematically varied on-the-fly. Results yielded that within a dialogue the more positive dialogue feedback resulted in less self-reported anxiety, lower heart rate, and longer answers, while more negative dialogue feedback of the virtual character resulted in the opposite. The correlations between on the one hand the dialogue stressor ratio and on the other hand the means of SUD score, heart rate and audio length in the eight dialogue conditions showed a strong relationship: r(6) = 0.91, p = 0.002; r(6) = 0.76, p = 0.028 and r(6) = −0.94, p = 0.001 respectively. Furthermore, more anticipatory anxiety reported before exposure was found to coincide with more self-reported anxiety, and shorter answers during the virtual exposure.

A great challenge in this domain is that although the presence of hate speech can be deleterious to the quality of service provided by social platforms, it still comprises only a tiny fraction of the content that can be found online, which can lead to performance deterioration due to majority class overfitting. To this end, we perform a thorough study on the application of deep learning to the hate speech detection problem: a) we propose three text-based data augmentation techniques aimed at reducing the degree of class imbalance and to maximise the amount of information we can extract from our limited resources and b) we apply them on a selection of top-performing deep architectures and hate speech databases in order to showcase their generalisation properties. The data augmentation techniques are based on a) synonym replacement based on word embedding vector closeness, b) warping of the word tokens along the padded sequence or c) class-conditional, recurrent neural language generation. Our proposed framework yields a significant increase in multi-class hate speech detection, outperforming the baseline in the largest online hate speech database by an absolute 5.7% increase in Macro-F1 score and 30% in hate speech class recall.",2019.0,50.0,78.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Rizos2019AugmentTP,\n author = {Georgios Rizos and Konstantin Hemker and Björn Schuller},\n journal = {Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management},\n title = {Augment to Prevent: Short-Text Data Augmentation in Deep Learning for Hate-Speech Classification},\n year = {2019}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '40185455', 'name': 'Georgios Rizos'}, {'authorId': '2121244573', 'name': 'Konstantin Hemker'}, {'authorId': '145411696', 'name': 'Björn Schuller'}]"

Laughter is an important cue to reinforce the engagement in humancomputer interactions. As a first step toward this goal, we have implemented a system capable of recording the laugh of a user and responding to it with a similar laugh. The output laugh is automatically selected from an audiovisual laughter database by analyzing acoustic similarities with the input laugh. It is displayed by an Embodied Conversational Agent, animated using the audio-synchronized facial movements of the subject who originally uttered the laugh. The application is fully implemented, works in real time and a large audiovisual laughter database has been recorded as part of the project. This paper presents AVLaughterCycle, its underlying components, the freely available laughter database and the application architecture. The paper also includes evaluations of several core components of the application. Objective tests show that the similarity search engine, though simple, significantly outperforms chance for grouping laughs by speaker or type. This result can be considered as a first measurement for computing acoustic similarities between laughs.

2301,b507e8f4e1a527fcd9194bc9b0b3ba73600d8af0,Virtual Reality in Neurorehabilitation,"Virtual Reality or Virtual Realities (VR), which can be referred to as immersive multimedia or computer-simulated realities, replicates an environment that simulates physical presence in places in the real world or imagined worlds and lets the user interact in that world. Virtual realities artificially create sensory experiences, which can include sight, hearing, touch, and smell (concept cited from Wikipedia). Unlike other visual imaging technologies commonly related to “imagine”, Immersion and interactivity are the two major features of VR technology [1]. VR can be defined as a special humancomputer interaction technique effectively combining sensory control technology and computer graphics technology. User can receive signals from the PC-created virtual environment with the help of various sensors. In the same time, user's performance can be accurately recorded by computer, and the virtual environment will be accordingly adjusted to realize the human-computer interaction [2]. Despite some disputation, more and more studies have showed the beneficial effect of rich environment on post-stroke recovery [3]. In VR technology, various rich environments can be simulated for patients with software. Also, a real and safe training environment will provide subjects taskspecific training and accurate sensory feedback, in which key elements such as repetitive practice feedback and motivation maintaining should be included [4]. Rehabilitation physician should develop individualized rehabilitation program based on different dysfunctions to keep patients’ interest and active participation and such program can go far beyond traditional therapies [5]. In Schuster’s [6] research, stroke patients with over 6 months course receive VR training or conventional rehabilitation. In VR group, patients wearing special data glove with sensors could conduct a real-time interaction with various simulated rich environments presented on a screen to practice their hands. The motor function was evaluated at half month, one month and two months after recruit and the result indicated a significant progress of hand function in VR group than the control group. In Merians’ study [7], twelve subjects (over 6 months from attack) with wrist extension > 10°, finger extension ≥ 10° received 8-day training. VR training emphasized on upper arm movement as well as wrist and hand movement through four VR game-Plasma Pong, Hummingbird Hunt, Hammer Task and Virtual Piano-combined with the robotic technique. The kinematic measures demonstrated improvement of motion stability, smoothness of motion trail and motion velocity in joints such as shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist and finger. In addition, the selective movement of the affected hand was also improved significantly. Considering the different impairments of upper extremities in stroke patients, Monica [8] used VR-based interactive rehabilitation training games connected with multimodal interface systems such as motion capture system, force-feedback robotics system and anti-gravity exoskeleton support training system, which provided patients task-specific rehabilitation training games in different patterns. The final results showed that the patients had significant improvement in gross motion of shoulder, elbow and wrist as well as fine motor skills of hand. Judith [9] applied VR technology in rehabilitation of hand motor function, the operating system of which comprises data gloves [10], Rutgers control gloves [11] and a computer simulating virtual environment. To improve the range of motion, velocity, and enhance muscle strength and facilitate the emergence of discrete movements, the training was conducted with the games such as capture butterflies, play the piano, power gloves, aircraft, and pilot boat. In this process, various signals produced by the software system based on the training results provided a feedback for patients. After training, the final experimental data showed that the VR system significantly improved the range of motion, flexibility and grip strength of hand in stroke patients. In addition, the patients’ interest and active participation was enhanced greatly in training games.",2016.0,18.0,117.0,"{'volume': '3', 'pages': '1-2', 'name': 'international journal of neurorehabilitation'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tong2016VirtualRI,\n author = {Zhang Tong},\n journal = {international journal of neurorehabilitation},\n pages = {1-2},\n title = {Virtual Reality in Neurorehabilitation},\n volume = {3},\n year = {2016}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2072265705', 'name': 'Zhang Tong'}]"

2303,b524d8050121296244b502181e72717f50d44335,Reflections on Mirror Therapy,"Background. Mirror visual feedback (MVF), a phenomenon where movement of one limb is perceived as movement of the other limb, has the capacity to alleviate phantom limb pain or promote motor recovery of the upper limbs after stroke. The tool has received great interest from health professionals; however, a clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying the neural recovery owing to MVF is lacking. Objective. We performed a systematic review to assess the effect of MVF on brain activation during a motor task. Methods. We searched PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases for neuroimaging studies investigating the effect of MVF on the brain. Key details for each study regarding participants, imaging methods, and results were extracted. Results. The database search yielded 347 article, of which we identified 33 suitable for inclusion. Compared with a control condition, MVF increases neural activity in areas involved with allocation of attention and cognitive control (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, S1 and S2, precuneus). Apart from activation in the superior temporal gyrus and premotor cortex, there is little evidence that MVF activates the mirror neuron system. MVF increases the excitability of the ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1) that projects to the “untrained” hand/arm. There is also evidence for ipsilateral projections from the contralateral M1 to the untrained/affected hand as a consequence of training with MVF. Conclusion. MVF can exert a strong influence on the motor network, mainly through increased cognitive penetration in action control, though the variance in methodology and the lack of studies that shed light on the functional connectivity between areas still limit insight into the actual underlying mechanisms.",2015.0,88.0,158.0,"{'volume': '29', 'pages': '349 - 361', 'name': 'Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Deconinck2015ReflectionsOM,\n author = {F.

Here, we manipulated voice pitch in averaged men's and women's voices by 2 Hz intervals to create a range of male and female voices speaking monopthong vowel sounds and spanning a range of frequencies from normal to very low and very high pitch. With these voices, we used the method of constant stimuli to measure preferences for voice. Nineteen university students (ages: 20–25) participated in three experiments. On average, men preferred high-pitched women's voices to low-pitched women's voices across all frequencies tested. On average, women preferred men's voices lowered in pitch, but did not prefer very low men's voices. The results of this study may reflect selection pressures for men's and women's voices, and shed light on a perceptual link between voice pitch and vocal attractiveness.",2012.0,77.0,81.0,"{'volume': '7', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Re2012PreferencesFV,\n author = {Daniel E.

Propositions are tested using a paradigm that both controls features of queue structure and allows collection of real-time data from people waiting. Data collected from 134 participants confirm that people closer to a service agent are more pleased than those further away. But people waiting in a single-queue structure are shown to feel more predictability and arousal than those waiting in a multiple-queue structure. Waiting in a multiple-queue structure is, however, shown to produce a sense of lack of justice, even when no objective inequalities exist. The study suggests a useful paradigm for evaluating alternative queue structures in a laboratory setting and provides insights about psychological aspects of waiting.

However, the number of behavioral test paradigms specifically designed for zebrafish, and in general the amount of information available on the behavior of this species, is relatively small when compared with classical laboratory model organisms such as the mouse, the rat, and the fruit fly. A particularly typical behavioral feature of zebrafish is shoaling, i.e., group formation. Given the importance of social behavior in our own species and the fact that zebrafish possess several characteristics similar to those of other vertebrates, including humans, at many levels of biological organization (e.g., neuroanatomy, neurochemistry, biochemical processes, and amino acid sequence of proteins or nucleotide sequence of genes), the zebrafish is expected to be an excellent tool not only for basic research but perhaps also for translational research. Briefly, we propose that once social behavior of the zebrafish is better characterized and once appropriate behavioral methods have been developed, this species can be utilized for the analysis of the mechanisms of social behavior of other vertebrates including our own. In this review, we discuss general principles of shoaling and highlight what we know and what we do not know about this behavior as it pertains to zebrafish.",2011.0,105.0,143.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '17 - 25'}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Miller2011ShoalingIZ,\n author = {Noam Y.

The attributes that govern the BDI characteristics of the agent are studied by conducting human in the loop experiments in VR using the CAVE (cave automatic virtual environment). To enhance generality and interoperability of the proposed crowd simulation modeling scheme, input data models have been developed to define environment attributes.

In posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the stressful film paradigm is a frequently used analogue approach: Films depicting traumatic events are shown to non-clinical participants in order to elicit stress responses analogue to responses to traumatic events in real life. Previous studies used a large variety of films, which is problematic with regard to the comparability of results. The main goal of this study was to identify a film clip that (a) consistently provokes stress reactions and (b) provokes reactions that are as similar as possible to traumatic stress. We randomly exposed 105 male and female participants to one of four stressful films, differing, e.g., in content and origin. Intrusive memories of the film, reported immediately after the film and during a diary phase of three days, as well as distress, heart rate, and several mood states were measured. A film clip depicting rape elicited the most consistent reactions that were characterized by a higher heart rate, more distress and more intrusive memories, compared to the other three clips. Intrusive memories across all films were especially related to an increase in heart rate and disgust in response to the film.",2009.0,39.0,79.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '549 - 569', 'name': 'Anxiety, Stress, & Coping'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Weidmann2009UsingSF,\n author = {Anke Weidmann and Ania Conradi and Kathrin Gröger and L.

2311,b5b6d87f663fcc56cd7319ea49d6baaa653ecaae,Facial expression and emotion,"Zusammenfassung Die menschliche Mimik ist einzigartig in ihrer Fähigkeit unseren Emotionen Ausdruck zu verleihen und diese anderen Menschen zu übermitteln. Die mimische Expression grundlegender Emotionen ist über verschiedene Kulturen hinweg sehr ähnlich und du weist auch Gemeinsamkeiten zu anderen Säugetieren auf. Dies deutet auf einen gemeinsamen genetischen Ursprung des Zusammenhangs von Mimik und Emotion. Neuere Untersuchungen zeigen aber auch kulturelle Einflüsse und Unterschiede. Die Erkennung von Emotionen aus der Mimik und auch der Prozess des mimischen Ausdrucks der eigenen Emotionen erfolgt in einem äußerst komplexen zerebralen Netzwerk. Aufgrund der Komplexität des zerebralen Verarbeitungssystems gibt es eine Vielzahl von neurologischen und psychiatrischen Erkrankungen, welche die Kopplung von Mimik und Emotionen erheblich stören können. Auch durch das Tragen von Masken wird unsere Fähigkeit zur Übermittlung und zum Erkennen von Emotionen über die Mimik eingeschränkt. Durch die Mimik lassen sich aber nicht nur „echte“ Emotionen ausdrücken, sondern auch gespielte. Damit eröffnet die Mimik die Möglichkeit sozial erwünschten Ausdruck vorzuspielen und auch Emotionen bewusst vorzutäuschen. Diese Täuschungen sind jedoch zumeist nicht perfekt und können von kurzfristigen Gesichtsbewegungen begleitet sein, die auf die tatsächlich vorhandenen Emotionen hinweisen (Mikroexpressionen). Diese Mikroexpressionen sind von nur sehr kurzer Dauer und vom Menschen häufig kaum wahrnehmbar, jedoch das ideale Anwendungsgebiet für computergestützte Analysen. Diese automatische Identifikation von Mikroexpressionen hat in den letzten Jahren nicht nur wissenschaftliche Aufmerksamkeit erfahren, sondern ihr Einsatz wird auch in sicherheitsrelevanten Bereichen getestet. Der vorliegende Artikel fasst den aktuellen Wissensstand von Mimik und Emotionen zusammen. ABSTRACT Human facial expressions are unique in their ability to express our emotions and communicate them to others. The mimic expression of basic emotions is very similar across different cultures and has also many features in common with other mammals. This suggests a common genetic origin of the association between facial expressions and emotion. However, recent studies also show cultural influences and differences. The recognition of emotions from facial expressions, as well as the process of expressing one’s emotions facially, occurs within an extremely complex cerebral network. Due to the complexity of the cerebral processing system, there are a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders that can significantly disrupt the coupling of facial expressions and emotions. Wearing masks also limits our ability to convey and recognize emotions through facial expressions. Through facial expressions, however, not only “real” emotions can be expressed, but also acted ones. Thus, facial expressions open up the possibility of faking socially desired expressions and also of consciously faking emotions. However, these pretenses are mostly imperfect and can be accompanied by short-term facial movements that indicate the emotions that are actually present (microexpressions). These microexpressions are of very short duration and often barely perceptible by humans, but they are the ideal application area for computer-aided analysis. This automatic identification of microexpressions has not only received scientific attention in recent years, but its use is also being tested in security-related areas. This article summarizes the current state of knowledge of facial expressions and emotions.",2023.0,131.0,1351.0,"{'volume': '102', 'pages': 'S115 - S125', 'name': 'Laryngo- Rhino- Otologie'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Klingner2023FacialEA,\n author = {C.

A drawback of the commonly applied chi square test, in addition to the known problems related to sample size and power, is that it may indicate an increasing correspondence between the hypothesized model and the observed data as both the measurement properties and the relationship between constructs decline. Further, and contrary to common assertion, the risk of making a Type II error can be substantial even when the sample size is large. Moreover, the present testing methods are unable to assess a model's explanatory power. To overcome these problems, the authors develop and apply a testing system based on measures of shared variance within the structural model, measurement model, and overall model.",1981.0,29.0,24463.0,"{'volume': '18', 'pages': '39 - 50', 'name': 'Journal of Marketing Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fornell1981EvaluatingSE,\n author = {C.

Opinions in the educational domain are important information for decision making; they allow teachers to improve the teaching process and enable students to decide on the best educational resources. The large amount of data that is daily generated on the Web makes it difficult, however, to analyze opinions manually. Multiple opinion mining approaches are being proposed as a solution to this problem; this research work introduces EduRP, an education platform that integrates opinion mining techniques and ontology-based user profiling techniques. We specifically propose an opinion mining approach for Spanish text which consists of three main steps: 1) collect opinions from the EduRP platform, 2) process the opinions to normalize the text, and 3) obtain the polarity of the opinions using a machine learning approach. We also propose a profile customization approach that uses Semantic Web technologies, specifically ontologies, to integrate socio-demographic data from different social networks and from the platform itself. Finally, we assess the performance of our system under precision, recall, and F-measure metrics, obtaining average values of 81.85%, 81.80% and 81.54, respectively.",2018.0,24.0,14.0,"{'volume': '24', 'pages': '1515-1535', 'name': 'J.

Well-crafted questions lead to new insights, generate discussion, and promote the comprehensive exploration of subject matter. Poorly constructed questions can stifle learning by creating confusion, intimidating students, and limiting creative thinking. Teachers most often ask lower-order, convergent questions that rely on students’ factual recall of prior knowledge rather than asking higher-order, divergent questions that promote deep thinking, requiring students to analyze and evaluate concepts. This review summarizes the taxonomy of questions, provides strategies for formulating effective questions, and explores practical considerations to enhance student engagement and promote critical thinking.

To our knowledge, however, no one has yet proposed using remote virtual reality (e-virtual reality). The aim of the present study was to assess e-virtual reality in an acrophobic population. Six individuals with acrophobia each underwent six sessions (two sessions per week) of virtual reality exposure therapy. The first three were remote sessions, while the last three were traditional sessions in the physical presence of the therapist. Anxiety (STAI form Y-A, visual analog scale, heart rate), presence, technical difficulties and therapeutic alliance (Working Alliance Inventory) were measured. In order to control the conditions in which these measures were made, all the sessions were conducted in hospital. None of the participants dropped out. The remote sessions were well accepted. None of the participants verbalized reluctance. No major technical problems were reported. None of the sessions were cancelled or interrupted because of software incidents. Measures (anxiety, presence, therapeutic alliance) were comparable across the two conditions. e-Virtual reality can therefore be used to treat acrophobic disorders.

It takes place through various considerations such as emotional representation in their behavioral patterns, facial expressions, head pose, body stance, and so on. Deciding on the emotional state of a virtual human at a moment, however, is still a challenge. Computational models of emotion, stemming from appraisal theories, are suggested for modeling emotion in virtual agents. Despite their competence in extracting emotion from appraisal values, they are poorly defined in describing how to assess appraisal values within a sense-think-act behavior model. Motivated by this lack of empirical knowledge on the appraisal stage, in this preliminary work, we propose a framework to bridge the gap between a computational model of emotion and a behavior model of virtual humans. To this end, we use a need-based, goal- oriented, autonomous behavior model to generate salient stimuli for eliciting emotions. Our simulation of a case study suggests that the proposed framework can produce sensible emotional states that conform to the essential principles of appraisal-based emotion theories.",2022.0,17.0,0.0,"{'name': '2022 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality (AIVR)', 'pages': '135-139'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Roohi2022TheDA,\n author = {S.

Participants then made a behavioral decision based on how credible they perceived the confederate’s statement to be.

The human visual system is highly sensitive to biological motion and capable of extracting socially relevant information from it. Here we investigate the question of how such information is encoded in biological motion patterns and how such information can be retrieved. A framework is developed that transforms biological motion into a representation allowing for analysis using linear methods from statistics and pattern recognition. Using gender classification as an example, simple classifiers are constructed and compared to psychophysical data from human observers. The analysis reveals that the dynamic part of the motion contains more information about gender than motion-mediated structural cues. The proposed framework can be used not only for analysis of biological motion but also to synthesize new motion patterns. A simple motion modeler is presented that can be used to visualize and exaggerate the differences in male and female walking patterns.",2002.0,63.0,968.0,"{'volume': '2 5', 'pages': '\n          371-87\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of vision'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Troje2002DecomposingBM,\n author = {N.

The focus is on human territorial behaviors during social interactions, such as during conversations and gatherings. Driven by theories on human territoriality, we define a reactive framework that generates avatar group dynamics during social interaction. We model the territorial dynamics of social interactions as a set of social norms that constrain the avatar's reactive motion by running a set of behaviors that blend together. The resulting social group behavior appears relatively robust, but, perhaps more importantly, it starts to bring a new sense of relevance and continuity to virtual bodies that often get left behind when social situations are simulated.

Without consensual conceptualization and operationalization of exactly what phenomenon is to be studied, progress in theory and research is difficult to achieve and fruitless debates are likely to proliferate. A particularly unfortunate example is William James’s asking the question “What is an emotion?” when he really meant “feeling”, a misnomer that started a debate which is still ongoing, more than a century later. This contribution attempts to sensitize researchers in the social and behavioral sciences to the importance of definitional issues and their consequences for distinguishing related but fundamentally different affective processes, states, and traits.

While emotional contagion has been traditionally considered to be a prerogative of mammals and birds, recent findings are demonstrating otherwise. Here, we investigate emotional contagion in groups of zebrafish, a freshwater model species which is gaining momentum in preclinical studies. Zebrafish have high genetic homology to humans, and they exhibit a complex behavioral repertoire amenable to study social behavior. To investigate whether individual emotional states can be transmitted to group members, we pharmacologically modulated anxiety-related behaviors of a single fish through Citalopram administration and we assessed whether the altered emotional state spread to a group of four untreated conspecifics. By capitalizing upon our in-house developed tracking algorithm, we successfully preserved the identity of all the subjects and thoroughly described their individual and social behavioral phenotypes. In accordance with our predictions, we observed that Citalopram administration consistently reduced behavioral anxiety of the treated individual, in the form of reduced geotaxis, and that such a behavioral pattern readily generalized to the untreated subjects. A transfer entropy analysis of causal interactions within the group revealed that emotional contagion was directional, whereby the treated individual influenced untreated subjects, but not vice-versa. This study offers additional evidence that emotional contagion is biologically preserved in simpler living organisms amenable to preclinical investigations.",2021.0,63.0,6.0,"{'volume': '15', 'name': 'Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lombana2021CollectiveEC,\n author = {Daniel Alberto Burbano Lombana and S.

We developed an agent-based crowd model with rich properties including eye gaze, facial expression, body motion, and verbal and non-verbal behaviors. The scenario was a virtual market in which the users needed to gather specific items. In a betweensubjects design, users interacted with a virtual human crowd that showed opposite valenced emotional expressions. There are four conditions in the between-subjects design. These includes different affective virtual crowds namely, Positive, Negative, Neutral, and a Mix condition. The Mix group is defined by a combination of Positive, Negative and Neutral emotional expressive characters. Depending on the specific condition, the virtual humans showed specific verbal and non-verbal behaviors. During the experiment we collected objective measures such as skin electrodermal activity, total time in the simulation, the number of interactions with the agents and performance measures. The subjective measures were the differential emotional survey (DES), and a user experience survey.

In social psychology, rapport is described as the establishment of a positive relationship among interaction partners by rapidly detecting and responding to each other’s nonverbal behavior (Gratch et al., 2007a). This includes displaying behaviors that indicate positive emotions (such as head nods and smiles), showing mutual attentiveness (such as mutual gaze) and certain coordination behaviors (such as postural mimicry and synchronized movement) (Tickle-Degnan & Rosenthal, 1990). Niewiadomski et al. (2010) reports that when an agent displays appropriate and socially adapted emotional expressions, he is perceived as more human-like than an agent that shows human expressions which are inappropriate or not socially adapted. Garau et al. (2005) conducted a study showing that only participants who interacted with an agent that was responsive to their movements, experienced a sense of personal contact with the agent which influenced them to behave more socially considerate as opposed to interacting with a static or moving but unresponsive agent. This indicates that rapport is an important feature in order for the agent to be perceived as human-like and for any social effects, such as social facilitation, to occur. Previous research on social facilitation/inhibition illustrates how the presence of others affects an individuals’ task performance either positively or negatively (Guerin & Innes, 1982; Zanjonc, 1965; Sanders, Baron & Moore, 1978). Whether or not similar facilitation/inhibition effects occur in presence of virtual agents has been subject to several studies. Rickenberg and Reeves (2000) found that tasks are facilitated or inhibited by the “social” presence of a virtual agent. A study by Zanbaka et al. (2004) indicates that when asked to perform a task, participants reacted similarly to the presence of a virtual agent as they would have in the presence of another human. A follow-up study by Zanbaka et al. (2007) demonstrates that the presence of a virtual agent inhibits the performance of participants on a mathematical task. The limitation of this study was that the sample consisted of only female participants being confronted with an agent of matching gender. Hayes et al. (2010) found a similar decrease in performance with regard Abstract The purpose of the present research is to investigate whether virtual agents can help enhance participants’ performance, effort and motivation in mathematics. We hypothesize that a minimal amount behavioral realism induced by display of rapport is necessary for any social effects to occur in human- computer interaction. Further, we examine whether social facilitation effects occur depending on the gender of the participants and the interacting virtual agents. In a 2x2 between subjects design, participants interacted with a male or female virtual agent that either displayed rapport or no rapport. Our results confirm that gender plays a role when interacting with virtual agents that are capable of establishing rapport. Participants’ performance and effort were significantly enhanced when interacting with an agent of opposite gender that displayed rapport . Our results have implications on designing agents for education and training purposes. Keywords: social facilitation, STEM, rapport, virtual agents Introduction There is considerable interest in factors that enhance science and math performance. Recently, there has been an upsurge of interest in educational technology that exploits social and motivational factors that enhance math performance in general, and reduce gender inequality in particular (Kim, 2004; Baylor & Ryu, 2003). This work builds on the phenomena that people often treat computers as social actors. Therefore, psychological factors that improve people's performance in traditional face-to-face settings can be simulated by technologies in form of virtual learning companions or virtual instructors. In this paper, we seek to address two related goals. First, we aim to show that certain social psychological phenomena can enhance math performance in a human-computer setting. Specifically, we show that a form of social facilitation can improve performance on standardized math tests. Second, we seek to provide further evidence that people do treat computers as social actors and help elucidate the design principles that foster this effect. We specifically demonstrate that virtual agents must possess a minimum level of behavioral realism to achieve any social effects.",2012.0,22.0,21.0,"{'volume': '34', 'name': 'Cognitive Science'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Karacora2012TheIO,\n author = {Bilge Karacora and Morteza Dehghani and Nicole Krämer-Mertens and J.

From a questionnaire developed in a previous mind perception study, authors found that perceived minds could be located on two dimensions “experience” and “agency.” This questionnaire allowed the assessment of how we perceive minds of various entities from a multi-dimensional point of view. In this questionnaire, subjects had to evaluate explicit mental capacities of target characters (e.g., capacity to feel hunger). However, we sometimes perceive minds in non-living entities, even though we cannot attribute these evidently biological capacities to the entity. In this study, we performed a large-scale web survey to assess mind perception by using the semantic differential scale method. We revealed that two mind dimensions “emotion” and “intelligence,” respectively, corresponded to the two mind dimensions (experience and agency) proposed in a previous mind perception study. We did this without having to ask about specific mental capacities. We believe that the semantic differential scale is a useful method to assess the dimensions of mind perception especially for non-living entities that are hard to be attributed to biological capacities.",2016.0,24.0,36.0,"{'volume': '7', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Takahashi2016SemanticDS,\n author = {Hideyuki Takahashi and Midori Ban and M.

Various training paradigms have been proposed, most of them relying on some form of graphical feedback provided to the trainee in real-time during their training or after training using an after-action review tool. Another paradigm consists of using virtual characters to provide feedback through their behavior during simulated social interactions. Preliminary studies have started to explore the effectiveness of these different training paradigms; however, these have not investigated the impact of individual differences on which interaction paradigm is more efficient or motivating for different populations of users. In this article, we explore the impact of personality, public speaking anxiety, and immersive tendencies on the experiences of users training public speaking with an interactive virtual audience system providing realtime feedback through virtual audience behavior as well as delayed feedback with an after-action review tool.

Growing evidence indicates that a significant proportion of individuals with TBI demonstrate an inability to recognize affective information from the face, voice, bodily movement, and posture. Because accurate interpretation of emotion in others is critical for the successful negotiation of social interactions, effective treatments are necessary. Until recently, however, there have been no rehabilitation efforts in this area. The present review examines the literature on emotion perception deficits in TBI and presents a theoretical rationale for targeted intervention. Several lines of research relevant to the remediation of emotion perception in people with TBI are considered. These include work on emotion perception remediation with other cognitively impaired populations, current neuropsychological models of emotion perception and underlying neural systems, and recent conceptualizations of remediation processes. The article concludes with a discussion of the importance of carrying out efforts to improve emotion perception within a contextualized framework in which the day-to-day relevance of training is clear to all recipients.

However, functional imaging results cannot definitively establish that a brain area is necessary for a particular cognitive process. This requires evidence from lesion techniques, such as studies of human patients with focal brain damage. Here, we tested 7 patients with lesions in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and 12 healthy individuals in personal moral dilemmas, impersonal moral dilemmas and non-moral dilemmas. Compared to normal controls, patients were more willing to judge personal moral violations as acceptable behaviors in personal moral dilemmas, and they did so more quickly. In contrast, their performance in impersonal and non-moral dilemmas was comparable to that of controls. These results indicate that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is necessary to oppose personal moral violations, possibly by mediating anticipatory, self-focused, emotional reactions that may exert strong influence on moral choice and behavior.",2007.0,59.0,401.0,"{'volume': '2 2', 'pages': '\n          84-92\n        ', 'name': 'Social cognitive and affective neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ciaramelli2007SelectiveDI,\n author = {E.

Our model accounts for permanent, stable disposition and the dynamic nature of human behaviors that change in response to the situation. The resulting approach accounts for changes in behavior in response to external stressors based on well-known theories in psychology. We combine this model with recent techniques on personality modeling for multi-agent simulations to capture a wide variety of behavioral changes and stressors. The overall formulation allows different stressors, expressed as functions of space and time, including time pressure, positional stressors, area stressors and inter-personal stressors. This model can be used to simulate dynamic crowd behaviors at interactive rates, including walking at variable speeds, breaking lane-formation over time, and cutting through a normal flow.

Participants were videotaped as they delivered talks, and their nonverbal behavior and personality were judged from videotapes. Participants' extraversion and masculinity–femininity (M–F) were reliably and accurately judged from videotapes. Judged extraversion correlated significantly with E, and judged M–F correlated most with GD, less with M, but not with F. For women but not men, judged M–F correlated strongly ( r = .67) with judged physical attractiveness. The current research identified nonverbal cues that correlated with judged and assessed extraversion more successfully than it identified cues that correlated with GD, M, F, and judged M–F.

We deal with a hierarchy composed of virtual crowds, groups and individuals. The groups are the most complex structure that can be controlled in different degrees of autonomy. This autonomy refers to the extent to which the virtual agents are independent of the user intervention and also the amount of information needed to simulate crowds. Thus, depending on the complexity of the simulation, simple behaviors can be sufficient to simulate crowds. Otherwise, more complicated behavioral rules can be necessary, and in this case, it can be included in the simulation data in order to improve the realism of the animation. We present three different ways for controlling crowd behaviors: i) by using innate and scripted behaviors; ii) by defining behavioral rules, using events and reactions, and, iii) by providing an external control to guide crowd behaviors in real time. The two main contributions of our approach are: the possibility of increasing the complexity of group/agent behaviors according to the problem to be simulated, and the hierarchical structure based on groups to compose a crowd.",2001.0,29.0,484.0,"{'pages': '13 pp.-', 'name': '5th IEEE EMBS International Summer School on Biomedical Imaging, 2002.'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Musse2001HierarchicalMF,\n author = {S.

Several topics pertaining to Valkyrie's series elastic actuators are presented including control architecture, controller design, and implementation in hardware. A decentralized approach is taken in controlling Valkyrie's many series elastic degrees of freedom. By conceptually decoupling actuator dynamics from robot limb dynamics, the problem of controlling a highly complex system is simplified and the controller development process is streamlined compared to other approaches. This hierarchical control abstraction is realized by leveraging disturbance observers in the robot's joint‐level torque controllers. A novel analysis technique is applied to understand the ability of a disturbance observer to attenuate the effects of unmodeled dynamics. The performance of this control approach is demonstrated in two ways. First, torque tracking performance of a single Valkyrie actuator is characterized in terms of controllable torque resolution, tracking error, bandwidth, and power consumption. Second, tests are performed on Valkyrie's arm, a serial chain of actuators, to demonstrate the robot's ability to accurately track torques with the presented decentralized control approach.",2015.0,37.0,209.0,"{'volume': '32', 'name': 'Journal of Field Robotics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Paine2015ActuatorCF,\n author = {N.

Its fidelity depends in part on the extent to which the VR environment provides a convincing simulation, for example whether a putatively stressful VR situation actually produces a stress response. Methods: We studied the stress response in 28 healthy men exposed either to a stressor VR elevator (which simulated travelling up the outside of a tall building and culminated in the participant being asked to step off the elevator platform), or to a control elevator. We measured psychological and physiological (salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase, blood pressure, pulse, skin conductance) stress indices. We also measured subsequent performance on the N-back task because acute stress has been reported to impact on working memory. Results: Compared to participants in the control elevator, those in the external elevator had increases in skin conductance, pulse and subjective stress and anxiety ratings, altered heart rate variability, and a delayed rise in cortisol. N-back performance was unaffected.

Informed by recent ecological tendencies within cognitive science and distributed language studies a distinction between first order languaging (language as whole-body sense making) and second order language (language as system like constraints) is put forward. Contrary to common assumptions within linguistics and communication studies separating language-as-a-system from language use (resulting in separations between language vs. body-language and verbal vs. non-verbal communication etc.) the first/second order distinction sees language as emanating from behavior making it possible to view emotion and affect as integral parts languaging behavior. Likewise, emotion and affect are studied, not as inner mental states, but as processes of organism-environment interactions. Based on video recordings of interaction between (1) children with special needs, and (2) couple in therapy and the therapist patterns of reciprocal influences between interactants are examined.

Inspired by the visual field and movement characteristic of pedestrians, we developed a 2-D continuous model that integrates a self-slowing, local direction-changing mechanism, and visual hindrance information. The model allows for the movement in continuous space and time, only controlled by simple kinematic equations and visual hindrance distribution. In order to get the parameters of the kinematic equations, we conducted controlled experiments, collected empirical data, and obtained velocity-changing and direction-changing relations. We then validate the model by simulating three experimental scenarios, i.e., passage, bottleneck, and classroom evacuation. It is found that some typical phenomena such as the stop-and-go waves in the passage and lane formation in the bottleneck can be reproduced. The obtained fundamental diagram and specific flow agree with classic conclusions and experimental measures very well. It is hoped that the idea of this study may be helpful in promoting the modeling and simulation study of pedestrian flow.",2013.0,52.0,51.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '1753-1763', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Lv2013ATO,\n author = {W.

This paper reviews studies concerning face recognition and emotional facial expression during normal aging as well as in neurodegenerative diseases occurring in the elderly. It focuses on Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal and semantic dementia, and also Parkinson's disease. The results of studies on healthy elderly individuals show subtle alterations in the recognition of facial identity and emotional facial expression from the age of 50 years, and increasing after 70. Studies in neurodegenerative diseases show that - during their initial stages - face recognition and facial expression can be specifically affected. Little has been done to assess these difficulties in clinical practice. They could constitute a useful marker for differential diagnosis, especially for the clinical differentiation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Social difficulties and some behavioural problems observed in these patients may, at least partly, result from these deficits in face processing. Thus, it is important to specify the possible underlying anatomofunctional substrates of these deficits as well as to plan suitable remediation programs.",2009.0,0.0,25.0,"{'volume': '7', 'pages': '31-42', 'name': 'Psychologie & Neuropsychiatrie Du Vieillissement'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chaby2009LaRD,\n author = {L.

Highly personalized practising can be required before patients are ready to perform in vivo exposure. Virtual reality-based therapy could be beneficial for this group. Aims: To assess the feasibility and potential effect of virtual reality-based cognitive behavioural therapy (VR-CBT) for patients with severe generalized SAD. Methods: Fifteen patients with generalized SAD attended up to 16 VR-CBT sessions. Questionnaires on clinical and functional outcomes, and diary assessments on social activity, social anxiety and paranoia were completed at baseline, post-treatment and at 6-months follow-up. Results: Two patients dropped out of treatment. Improvements in social anxiety and quality of life were found at post-treatment. At follow-up, depressive symptoms had decreased, and the effect on social anxiety was maintained. With respect to diary assessments, social anxiety in company and paranoia were significantly reduced by post-treatment. These improvements were maintained at follow-up. No increase was observed in social activity. Conclusions: This uncontrolled pilot study demonstrates the feasibility and treatment potential of VR-CBT in a difficult-to-treat group of patients with generalized SAD. Results suggest that VR-CBT may be effective in reducing anxiety as well as depression, and can increase quality of life.",2019.0,7.0,37.0,"{'volume': '47', 'pages': '745 - 750', 'name': 'Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Geraets2019VirtualRC,\n author = {C.

Here, we provide support for the cultural universality of bodily sensations associated with 13 emotions in a large international sample (3,954 individuals from 101 countries; age range = 18-90). Participants were presented with 2 silhouettes of bodies alongside emotional words and asked to color the bodily regions whose activity they felt increasing or decreasing while they experienced each given emotion. We tested the effects of various background factors (i.e., age, sex, education, body mass index, nationality, civilization, and language) on the bodily sensation maps. Bodily sensations associated with emotions were concordant across the tested cultures (rs > 0.82) and across the sexes (r > 0.80). Bodily sensations weakened during aging (M rs = 0.11 across emotions). We conclude that universality in experiencing emotions in the body is stronger than the differences due to culture or sex.

Using the CrAg 2 language generation system we examine how accurately judges can perceive character personality from short, automatically generated dialogues, and how alignment (similarity between speakers) alters judge perceptions of the characters' relationship. Whilst personality perception of our dialogues is consistent with perceptions of human behaviour, we find that the introduction of alignment leads to negative perceptions of the dialogues and the inter-locutors' relationship. A follow up evaluation study of the perceptions of different forms of alignment in the dialogues reveals that while similarity at polarity, topic and construction levels is viewed positively, similarity at the word level is regarded negatively.

In these experiments we tested the hypothesis that similar physiological responses can be evoked by observing emotional face and body signals and that the reaction to angry signals is amplified in anxious individuals. We designed three experiments in which participants categorized emotional expressions from isolated facial and bodily expressions and emotionally congruent and incongruent face-body compounds. Participants’ fixations were measured and their pupil size recorded with eye-tracking equipment and their facial reactions measured with electromyography. The results support our prediction that the recognition of a facial expression is improved in the context of a matching posture and importantly, vice versa as well. From their facial expressions, it appeared that observers acted with signs of negative emotionality (increased corrugator activity) to angry and fearful facial expressions and with positive emotionality (increased zygomaticus) to happy facial expressions. What we predicted and found, was that angry and fearful cues from the face or the body, attracted more attention than happy cues. We further observed that responses evoked by angry cues were amplified in individuals with high anxiety scores. In sum, we show that people process bodily expressions of emotion in a similar fashion as facial expressions and that the congruency between the emotional signals from the face and body facilitates the recognition of the emotion.",2013.0,67.0,148.0,"{'volume': '4', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kret2013PerceptionOF,\n author = {M.

These states--called core affect--influence reflexes, perception, cognition, and behavior and are influenced by many causes internal and external, but people have no direct access to these causal connections. Core affect can therefore be experienced as free-floating (mood) or can be attributed to some cause (and thereby begin an emotional episode). These basic processes spawn a broad framework that includes perception of the core-affect-altering properties of stimuli, motives, empathy, emotional meta-experience, and affect versus emotion regulation; it accounts for prototypical emotional episodes, such as fear and anger, as core affect attributed to something plus various nonemotional processes.",2003.0,272.0,4718.0,"{'volume': '110 1', 'pages': '\n          145-72\n        ', 'name': 'Psychological review'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Russell2003CoreAA,\n author = {J.

To assess emotional intelligence (EQ) and the construct validity of the EQ Appraisal survey among academic faculty, residents, and medical students.


STUDY DESIGN
From 2007 to 2011, 155 medical education personnel participated in 4 self-administered surveys. The EQ Appraisal survey measures Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness, and Relationship Management. The DISC survey defines 4 personality domains: Dominance, Influence, Steadiness/ Submissiveness, and Conscientious/Compliance. The Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Instrument defines 5 conflict styles: Competing, Collaborating, Compromising, Accommodating, and Avoiding. The Interpersonal Influence Inventory categorizes 4 behavior styles: Openly Aggressive, Assertive, Concealed Aggressive, and Passive behaviors. Statistical analysis was done as indicated. The p value of < 0.05 was taken as significant.


RESULTS
The overall mean EQ score was 75.9 (SD 8.2), and components scores were: Self-Awareness = 74.6 (SD 10), Self-Management = 74.8 (SD 10.6), Social Awareness = 77.0 (SD 9.6), and Relationship Management = 76.8 (SD 9.9). Faculty and residents had higher Social Awareness scores as compared to medical students (79.33 [SD 8] vs. 75.59 [SD 10.3], p = 0.01). Mean EQ scores correlated positively with Collaborating conflict style, Assertive Behavior, Influence, and Steadiness/Submissiveness but correlated negatively with Dominance personality domain, Passive, and Concealed Aggressive behaviors.


CONCLUSION
EQ varied with level of training. EQ competence may occur by Collaborating and Assertive Behaviors utilizing Influence and Steadiness/Submissiveness personality domains.",2014.0,0.0,5.0,"{'volume': '59 5-6', 'pages': '\n          279-84\n        ', 'name': 'The Journal of reproductive medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ogunyemi2014EmotionalIC,\n author = {D.

Secondly, made an adjacent test to generate the nearer neighbors as emotional contagions usually occurred between neighbors. And then we treated the emotional contagions between individuals and their neighbors as the information spreading process so that we calculated the influences on their moving directions through the emotional information spreading model SIR (Susceptible Infective Removal).

However, until recently, the impact of emotion regulation difficulties for adolescents and young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has received little attention. We investigated emotion regulation difficulties from the perspective of those who would experience the sequelae. This included parents, teachers, and psychologists. Method Seven focus groups with parents, teachers, and psychologists, and 7 interviews with adolescents and young adults with ASD were conducted. Results Across the groups, participants discussed their triggers of distressing emotions, difficulties with emotional awareness, emotion regulation strategies, and the consequences of their distressing emotions. Both depression and anxiety were perceived as the most experienced distressing issues with the greatest consequences. Conclusions The implications of the themes revealed in the interviews and focus groups are discussed in light in previous literature and may help to inform future interventions.",2017.0,59.0,15.0,"{'volume': '42', 'pages': '275 - 284', 'name': 'Journal of Intellectual & Developmental Disability'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Santomauro2017InvestigationsIE,\n author = {D.

With a difficult criterion, supportive audiences elicited cautious, protective strategies that were associated with poor performance: Speed decreased without improving accuracy. Despite impairments caused by supportive audiences, performers found supportive audiences more helpful and less stressful than neutral or adversarial audiences, and participants believed (wrongly) that they performed better with a supportive audience.

We then report the results of a novel sequence learning task which combines aspects of the SRT and AGL paradigms to meet our suggested criteria for how implicit learning experiments can be adapted to increase their relevance to situations of social intuition. The sequences followed standard finite-state grammars. Sequence learning and consciousness of acquired knowledge were compared between 2 groups of 24 participants viewing either sequences of individually presented letters or sequences of body-posture pictures, which were described as series of yoga movements. Participants in both conditions showed above-chance classification accuracy, indicating that sequence learning had occurred in both stimulus conditions. This shows that sequence learning can still be found when learning procedures reflect the characteristics of social intuition. Rule awareness was measured using trial-by-trial evaluation of decision strategy (Dienes & Scott, 2005; Scott & Dienes, 2008). For letters, sequence classification was best on trials where participants reported responding on the basis of explicit rules or memory, indicating some explicit learning in this condition.

We are interested in the circumstances under which bystanders are likely to intervene in order to prevent harm to the victim.

In the rest of this paper we fi rst briefl y review some of the literature relating to responses to violence in desktop based systems such as video games, before going on to describe what we mean by immersive virtual reality, and how this is profoundly different with respect to engaging people in realistic responses to virtual situations. Next we review one experiment where participants infl ict violence on virtual characters in immersive virtual reality, a reprise of the Stanley Milgram obedience experiments. Next we apply these ideas to new research that is using virtual reality to study bystander responses to violent incidents, and we describe some qualitative results from ongoing pilot studies.

Virtually mediated environments lie at the heart of immersive journalism (IJ) experiences, foregrounding a sense of presence and bridging the connection between the user and the character. Mediated environments in VR stories provide more than a setting since the user can interact with and respond to the surroundings. Drawing on the theory of spatial narrative, documentary and cinema literature and studies on media morality, this article examines the meaning of place in VR news stories and its ability to engage the user with the story. This study contributes to the discussion of creating and communicating places in journalism studies by examining spatial storytelling in immersive news stories, which are available in the NYT VR smartphone application. This paper argues that spatial storytelling eventually affects what is experienced and how it is experienced either by demonstrating the circumstances with aesthetical elements or via the selection of spaces.",2020.0,71.0,24.0,"{'volume': '15', 'pages': '785 - 802', 'name': 'Journalism Practice'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kukkakorpi2020ASO,\n author = {M.

A substantial body of research has highlighted the evolution of ToM in nonhuman primates, its emergence during human ontogeny, and impaired ToM in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. There is good empirical evidence that ToM is specifically impaired in schizophrenia and that many psychotic symptoms-for instance, delusions of alien control and persecution, the presence of thought and language disorganization, and other behavioral symptoms-may best be understood in light of a disturbed capacity in patients to relate their own intentions to executing behavior, and to monitor others' intentions. However, it is still under debate how an impaired ToM in schizophrenia is associated with other aspects of cognition, how the impairment fluctuates with acuity or chronicity of the schizophrenic disorder, and how this affects the patients' use of language and social behavior. In addition to these potential research areas, future studies may also address whether patients could benefit from cognitive training in this domain.",2005.0,140.0,989.0,"{'volume': '31 1', 'pages': '\n          21-42\n        ', 'name': 'Schizophrenia bulletin'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Brüne2005TheoryOM,\n author = {M.

Therefore, the analysis of crowd aggregation behavior has been a new research focus in the field of intelligent video surveillance. However, such public area scenes not only contain moving crowd but also contain other types of objects. The sizes of these objects are usually small, which make their appearances quite similar. Moreover, the individuals in a crowd move randomly and often occlude each other. All the above factors make the analysis of crowd aggregation very difficult. In this paper, the authors attempt to solve this problem in three aspects. First, a novel global feature is used to represent the moving crowd. This feature can well describe the spatial and the temporal motion information of points-of-interest. Second, a strategy is adopted to cluster the feature points first and then calculate the collectiveness. This makes the collectiveness computation of individual groups more consistent and effective. Finally, more comprehensive collective crowd descriptors are proposed to provide a detailed description of the crowd status. Based on the proposed descriptor, the authors realize the evolution analysis of the group movement and the crowd abnormal detection. The experiment results show that the proposed method is able to efficiently compute the crowd collectiveness in various public areas and provide a reliable reference for the public safety management.",2018.0,38.0,79.0,"{'volume': '28', 'pages': '2814-2825', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Xu2018AnEM,\n author = {Mingliang Xu and Chunxue Li and Pei Lv and Nie Lin and Rui Hou and Bing Zhou},\n journal = {IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology},\n pages = {2814-2825},\n title = {An Efficient Method of Crowd Aggregation Computation in Public Areas},\n volume = {28},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2285442', 'name': 'Mingliang Xu'}, {'authorId': '2209785707', 'name': 'Chunxue Li'}, {'authorId': '144470801', 'name': 'Pei Lv'}, {'authorId': '2065999365', 'name': 'Nie Lin'}, {'authorId': '2073313412', 'name': 'Rui Hou'}, {'authorId': '2118868255', 'name': 'Bing Zhou'}]"

For this purpose, a grid of particles is placed over the image and it is advected with the space-time average of optical flow. By treating the moving particles as individuals, their interaction forces are estimated using social force model. The interaction force is then mapped into the image plane to obtain Force Flow for every pixel in every frame. Randomly selected spatio-temporal volumes of Force Flow are used to model the normal behavior of the crowd. We classify frames as normal and abnormal by using a bag of words approach. The regions of anomalies in the abnormal frames are localized using interaction forces. The experiments are conducted on a publicly available dataset from University of Minnesota for escape panic scenarios and a challenging dataset of crowd videos taken from the web. The experiments show that the proposed method captures the dynamics of the crowd behavior successfully. In addition, we have shown that the social force approach outperforms similar approaches based on pure optical flow.",2009.0,31.0,1639.0,"{'pages': '935-942', 'name': '2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mehran2009AbnormalCB,\n author = {Ramin Mehran and Alexis Oyama and M.

The face and the body both normally contribute in conveying the emotional state of the individual. Here we show that observers judging a facial expression are strongly influenced by emotional body language. Photographs of fearful and angry faces and bodies were used to create face-body compound images, with either matched or mismatched emotional expressions. When face and body convey conflicting emotional information, judgment of facial expression is hampered and becomes biased toward the emotion expressed by the body. Electrical brain activity was recorded from the scalp while subjects attended to the face and judged its emotional expression. An enhancement of the occipital P1 component as early as 115 ms after presentation onset points to the existence of a rapid neural mechanism sensitive to the degree of agreement between simultaneously presented facial and bodily emotional expressions, even when the latter are unattended.",2005.0,56.0,633.0,"{'volume': '102 45', 'pages': '\n          16518-23\n        ', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Meeren2005RapidPI,\n author = {H.

This article extends that work in 2 ways. First, examples are given of how to estimate these models when the single-case designs have features that have not been considered by past authors. These include the use of polynomial coefficients to model nonlinear change, the modeling of counts (Poisson distributed) or proportions (binomially distributed) as outcomes, the use of 2 different ways of modeling treatment effects in ABAB designs, and applications of these models to alternating treatment and changing criterion designs. Second, issues that arise when multilevel models are used for the analysis of single-case designs are discussed; such issues can form part of an agenda for future research on this topic. These include statistical power and assumptions, applications to more complex single-case designs, the role of exploratory data analyses, extensions to other kinds of outcome variables and sampling distributions, and other statistical programs that can be used to do such analyses.",2013.0,76.0,125.0,"{'volume': '18 3', 'pages': '\n          385-405\n        ', 'name': 'Psychological methods'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Shadish2013AnalyzingDF,\n author = {W.

To provide a systematic comparison of these 2 measures, the authors examined the relative form and strength of affective influences on activity over zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii. Self-reported positive and negative affective reactions and facial EMG were collected as women (n = 68) were exposed to series of affective pictures, sounds, and words. Consistent with speculations based on known properties of the neurophysiology of the facial musculature, results revealed a stronger linear effect of valence on activity over corrugator supercilii versus zygomaticus major. In addition, positive and negative affect ratings indicated that positive and negative affect have reciprocal effects on activity over corrugator supercilii, but not zygomaticus major.",2003.0,35.0,694.0,"{'volume': '40 5', 'pages': '\n          776-85\n        ', 'name': 'Psychophysiology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Larsen2003EffectsOP,\n author = {Jeff T.

By default, the relationship between construct and item is assumed to be reflective, meaning that the measurement items are a reflection of the construct. Many times, though, the nature of the construct is not reflective, but rather formative. Formative constructs occur when the items describe and define the construct rather than vice versa. 
 
In this research, we examine whether formative constructs are indeed being mistaken for reflective constructs by information systems researchers. By examining complete volumes of MIS Quarterly and Information Systems Research over the last 3 years, we discovered that a significant number of articles have indeed misspecified formative constructs. For scientific results to be valid, we argue that researchers must properly specify formative constructs. This paper discusses the implications of different patterns of common misspecifications of formative constructs on both Type I and Type II errors. To avoid these errors, the paper provides a roadmap to researchers to properly specify formative constructs. We also discuss how to address formative constructs within a research model after they are specified.",2007.0,100.0,2896.0,"{'volume': '31', 'pages': '623-656', 'name': 'MIS Q.'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Petter2007SpecifyingFC,\n author = {S.

However, the World Wide Web is a fruitful environment for the massive diffusion of unverified rumors. In this work, using a massive quantitative analysis of Facebook, we show that information related to distinct narratives––conspiracy theories and scientific news––generates homogeneous and polarized communities (i.e., echo chambers) having similar information consumption patterns. Then, we derive a data-driven percolation model of rumor spreading that demonstrates that homogeneity and polarization are the main determinants for predicting cascades’ size. The wide availability of user-provided content in online social media facilitates the aggregation of people around common interests, worldviews, and narratives. However, the World Wide Web (WWW) also allows for the rapid dissemination of unsubstantiated rumors and conspiracy theories that often elicit rapid, large, but naive social responses such as the recent case of Jade Helm 15––where a simple military exercise turned out to be perceived as the beginning of a new civil war in the United States. In this work, we address the determinants governing misinformation spreading through a thorough quantitative analysis. In particular, we focus on how Facebook users consume information related to two distinct narratives: scientific and conspiracy news. We find that, although consumers of scientific and conspiracy stories present similar consumption patterns with respect to content, cascade dynamics differ. Selective exposure to content is the primary driver of content diffusion and generates the formation of homogeneous clusters, i.e., “echo chambers.” Indeed, homogeneity appears to be the primary driver for the diffusion of contents and each echo chamber has its own cascade dynamics. Finally, we introduce a data-driven percolation model mimicking rumor spreading and we show that homogeneity and polarization are the main determinants for predicting cascades’ size.",2016.0,45.0,1446.0,"{'volume': '113', 'pages': '554 - 559', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vicario2016TheSO,\n author = {Michela Del Vicario and Alessandro Bessi and Fabiana Zollo and Fabio Petroni and Antonio Scala and G.

Our method is shown to be valid and solves major drawbacks compared to previous approaches such as oscillations due to a lack of anticipation. We first describe the mathematical representation used in our model, we then detail its implementation, and finally, its calibration and validation from real data.",2007.0,21.0,284.0,"{'volume': '26', 'name': 'Computer Graphics Forum'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Paris2007PedestrianRN,\n author = {Sébastien Paris and J.

Progress quickened with the spread of low-latency networking, then accelerated dramatically a few years ago. In 2016, task-focused chatbots became a centerpiece of machine intelligence, promising interfaces that are more engaging than robotic answering systems and that can accommodate our increasingly phone-based information needs. Hundreds of thousands were built. Creating successful non-trivial chatbots proved more difficult than anticipated.

There were no age effects on the ability to decode emotions from verbal material.

Our Mii research – or ‘Miisearch’ – is motivated by our desire to highlight the agency these interfaces have in self-representational practices; specifically, to understand the effects of interface affordances on avatar customisation in games. Furthermore, as self-representational practices are often studied using distance methods and self-reporting (e.g. surveys), we compare data on avatar customisation from two sources: a survey and participant observation via micro-ethnography. Results of our study reveal discrepancies between the survey data and participant observation, challenging popular methodological approaches in both the game studies and HCI communities. Most significantly, our findings illustrate the combined effects of gaming contexts and interface affordances on avatar customisation.",2018.0,56.0,3.0,"{'volume': '38', 'pages': '230 - 243', 'name': 'Behaviour & Information Technology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{McArthur2018MakingMS,\n author = {Victoria McArthur},\n journal = {Behaviour & Information Technology},\n pages = {230 - 243},\n title = {Making Mii: studying the effects of methodological approaches and gaming contexts on avatar customization},\n volume = {38},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2532558', 'name': 'Victoria McArthur'}]"

This paper presents our work on designing behavior model for virtual humans in a crowd simulation under normal‐life and emergency situations. Our model adopts an agent‐based approach and employs a layered framework to reflect the natural pattern of human‐like decision making process, which generally involves a person's awareness of the situation and consequent changes on the internal attributes. The social group and crowd‐related behaviors are modeled according to the findings and theories observed from social psychology (e.g., social attachment theory). By integrating our model into an agent execution process, each individual agent can response differently to the perceived environment and make realistic behavioral decisions based on various physiological, emotional, and social group attributes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, a case study has been conducted, which shows that realistic human behaviors can be generated at both individual and group level.

Volunteers played a negotiation game in which an embodied, digital virtual agent both displayed an angry, happy, or neutral facial expression and played either cooperatively or competitively. Results indicated that users who negotiated with the angry virtual agent performed significantly worse on the Mind in the Eye Task compared to those who interacted with the happy virtual agent. The results indicate that exposure to an angry virtual agent decreased humans' ability to take the mental perspective of another person. These results offer speculations about how negative affect associated with virtual agents can have detrimental implications for human-agent interactions that requires theory of mind type situational awareness, especially regarding virtual agent technology for rehabilitating theory of mind deficits (e.g., for individuals on the Autism spectrum).",2016.0,24.0,1.0,"{'name': '2016 IEEE International Multi-Disciplinary Conference on Cognitive Methods in Situation Awareness and Decision Support (CogSIMA)', 'pages': '83-87'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Garcia2016TheEO,\n author = {Yesenia Garcia and P.

2505,c55e7fbc18c4816cc4e73e7877a0ca20a0577922,"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","Abstract Background The initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP. Methods We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions. In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number. Results Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male. The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9). Conclusions On the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere. Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.

Normative data are presented, as well as the results of various psychometric analyses. The major findings of conceptual interest are: (a) the dimensions of masculinity and femininity are empirically as well as logically independent; (6) the concept of psychological androgyny is a reliable one; and (c) highly sex-typed scores do not reflect a general tendency to respond in a socially desirable direction, but rather a specific tendency to describe oneself in accordance with sex-typed standards of desirable behavior for men and women. Both in psychology and in society at large, masculinity and femininity have long been conceptualized as bipolar ends of a single continuum; accordingly, a person has had to be either masculine or feminine, but not both. This sex-role dichotomy has served to obscure two very plausible hypotheses: first, that many individuals might be ""androgynous"" ; that is, they might be both masculine and feminine, both assertive and yielding, both instrumental and expressive—depending on the situational appropriateness of these various behaviors; and conversely, that strongly sex-typed individuals might be seriously limited in the range of behaviors available to them as they move from situation to situation. According to both Kagan (1964) and Kohlberg (1966), the highly sex-typed individual is motivated to keep his behavior consistent with an internalized sex-role standard, a goal that he presumably accomplishes by suppressing any behavior that might be con",1974.0,4.0,8196.0,"{'volume': '42 2', 'pages': '\n          155-62\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of consulting and clinical psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bem1974TheMO,\n author = {S.

The mapping problem between textual information and elementary head motion patterns is modeled by Classification and Regression Trees (CART). With the emotional state specified by users, results from text analysis are utilized to drive corresponding CART model to create emotional head motion sequence.

This kind of coordination often permits group-living species to achieve collective tasks that are far beyond single individuals' capabilities. In particular, a key benefit lies in the integration of partial knowledge of the environment at the collective level. In this contribution, we discuss various self-organization phenomena in animal swarms and human crowds from the point of view of information exchange among individuals. In particular, we provide a general description of collective dynamics across species and introduce a classification of these dynamics not only with respect to the way information is transferred among individuals but also with regard to the knowledge processing at the collective level.

This review focuses on social cognition, that is, the capacity to attend to, recognize and interpret interpersonal cues that guide social behavior. Social cognition entails “hot” processes, that is, emotion perception and emotional empathy and “cold” processes, that is, the ability to infer the beliefs, feelings, and intentions of others (theory of mind: ToM) to see their point of view (cognitive empathy) and what they mean when communicating (pragmatic inference). This review critically examines research attesting to deficits in each of these domains and also examines evidence for theorized mechanisms including specific neural networks, the role of simulation, and non-social cognition. Current research is hampered by small, heterogeneous samples and the inherent complexity of TBI pathology. Nevertheless, there is evidence that facets of social cognition are impaired in this population. New assessment tools to measure social cognition following TBI are required that predict everyday social functioning. In addition, research into remediation needs to be guided by the growing empirical base for understanding social cognition that may yet reveal how deficits dissociate following TBI.

We reasoned that increased exposure to the sequence may particularly benefit individuals with autism, especially those who are lower functioning. Seven individuals with autism participated in six training and test sessions of an eight-length SRT task (Experiment 1), and 5 performed a four-length SRT task (Experiment 2). Sequence learned was demonstrated at a group level on the eight-length sequence, and on an individual basis with the four-length sequence.

We find that agents consistently obtain significantly larger gains from trade than their human counterparts. This was unexpected because both humans and agents have approached theoretically perfect efficiency in prior all-human or allagent CDA experiments.

The model suggests that the stereotype is automatically activated in the presence of a member (or some symbolic equivalent) of the stereotyped group and that Iow-prejudiee responses require controlled inhibition of the automatically activated stereotype. Study 2, which examined the effects of automarie stereotype activation on the evaluation of ambiguous stereotype-relevant behaviors performed by a race-unspecified person, suggested that when subjects' ability to consciously monitor stereotype activation is precluded, both high- and low-prejudice subjects produce stereotype-congruent evaluations of ambiguous behaviors. Study 3 examined high- and low-prejudice subjects' responses in a consciously directed thought-listing task.

This review provides an organized account of existing empirical evidence assessing emotion regulation within close relationships across the life span. Specifically, the reviewed research includes studies examining parent-child relationships, sibling relationships, friendships, and romantic relationships in relation to emotion regulation. The review highlights evidence concerning how relationship processes influence emotion regulation. Based on the current state of the literature, future directions for research in this area are recommended. This review seeks to advance a more nuanced approach to the study of the social processes associated with emotion regulation. An argument is made for how building upon research concerning the relationship context as a basis for emotion regulation can further elucidate theorizing on the determinants of emotion regulation.

Although virtual human tutors hold significant promise for providing affective support, a key open question is how a tutor's facial expressions can influence learners' performance. In this paper, we report on a study to examine the influence of a human tutor agent's facial expressions on learners' performance and emotions during learning. Results from the study suggest that learners' performance is significantly better when a human tutor agent facially expresses emotions that are congruent with the content relevancy. Results also suggest that learners facially express significantly more confusion when the human tutor agent provides incongruent facial expressions. These results can inform the design of virtual humans as pedagogical agents can inform the design of virtual humans as pedagogical agents and designing intelligent learner-agent interactions.",2017.0,14.0,10.0,"{'pages': '184-189', 'name': '2017 Seventh International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mudrick2017TowardAV,\n author = {Nicholas V.

The final version of the instrument consists of four seven-item subscales, each of which taps a separate aspect of the global concept ""empathy."" One scale, the perspective-taking scale, contains items which assess spontaneous attempts to adopt the perspectives of other people and see things from their point of view. Items on the fantasy scale measure the tendency to identify with characters in movies, novels, plays and other fictional situations. The other two subscales explicitly tap respondents' chronic emotional reactions to the negative experiences of others. The empathic concern scale inquires about respondents' feelings of warmth, compassion, and concern for others, while the personal distress scale measures the personal feelings of anxiety and discomfort that result from observing another's negative experience. The factor structure underlying these scales is the same for both sexes, and emerged in two independent samples. Test-retest and internal reliabilities of all four scales were substantial. The pattern of sex differences and the intercorrelations of these four scales are discussed in terms of recent theoretical treatments of the development of empathy (Hoffman, 1976).

However, the mechanism through which people judge the multimodal emotional display of these agents is not yet well understood. This study is an attempt to provide a better understanding of the interaction between video and audio channels through the use of a continuous dimensional evaluation framework of valence, activation, and dominance. The results indicate that the congruent audio-visual presentation contains information allowing users to differentiate between happy and angry emotional expressions to a greater degree than either of the two channels individually. Interestingly, however, sad and neutral emotions which exhibit a lesser degree of activation show more confusion when presented using both channels. Furthermore, when faced with a conflicting emotional presentation, users predominantly attended to the vocal channel. It is speculated that this is most likely due to the limited level of facial emotion expression inherent in the current animated face. The results also indicate that there is no clear integration of audio and visual channels in emotion perception as in speech perception indicated by the McGurk effect.

To illustrate the functioning of the ontology we introduce a running example from an excerpt of the drama Hamlet. Finally, we carry out an evaluation of the approach on an annotation task that is relevant for drama studies research and teaching.

Data were obtained on the general population epidemiology of DSM-III-R posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including information on estimated life-time prevalence, the kinds of traumas most often associated with PTSD, sociodemographic correlates, the comorbidity of PTSD with other lifetime psychiatric disorders, and the duration of an index episode.


METHODS
Modified versions of the DSM-III-R PTSD module from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule and of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview were administered to a representative national sample of 5877 persons aged 15 to 54 years in the part II subsample of the National Comorbidity Survey.


RESULTS
The estimated lifetime prevalence of PTSD is 7.8%. Prevalence is elevated among women and the previously married. The traumas most commonly associated with PTSD are combat exposure and witnessing among men and rape and sexual molestation among women. Posttraumatic stress disorder is strongly comorbid with other lifetime DSM-III-R disorders. Survival analysis shows that more than one third of people with an index episode of PTSD fail to recover even after many years.


CONCLUSIONS
Posttraumatic stress disorder is more prevalent than previously believed, and is often persistent. Progress in estimating age-at-onset distributions, cohort effects, and the conditional probabilities of PTSD from different types of trauma will require future epidemiologic studies to assess PTSD for all lifetime traumas rather than for only a small number of retrospectively reported ""most serious"" traumas.",1995.0,59.0,9764.0,"{'volume': '52 12', 'pages': '\n          1048-60\n        ', 'name': 'Archives of general psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kessler1995PosttraumaticSD,\n author = {R.

The nature and consequences of emotion regulation, therefore, are likely to depend on the motives it is intended to serve. Nonetheless, limited attention has been devoted to studying what motivates emotion regulation. By mapping the potential benefits of emotion to key human motives, this review identifies key classes of motives in emotion regulation. The proposed taxonomy distinguishes between hedonic motives that target the immediate phenomenology of emotions, and instrumental motives that target other potential benefits of emotions. Instrumental motives include behavioral, epistemic, social, and eudaimonic motives.

One of them that is becoming very popular is hand tracking, as the idea to replace controllers for interactions in virtual worlds. This experiment aims to compare different interaction types in VR using either controllers or hand tracking. Participants had to play two simple VR games with various types of tasks in those games — grabbing objects or typing numbers. While playing, they were using interactions with different visualizations of hands and controllers. The focus of this study was to investigate user experience of varying interactions (controller vs. hand tracking) for those two simple tasks. Results show that different interaction types statistically significantly influence reported emotions with Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM), where for hand tracking participants were feeling higher valence, but lower arousal and dominance. Additionally, task type of grabbing was reported to be more realistic, and participants experienced a higher presence. Surprisingly, participants rated the interaction type with controllers where both where hands and controllers were visualized as statistically most preferred. Finally, hand tracking for both tasks was rated with the System Usability Scale (SUS) scale, and hand tracking for the task typing was rated as statistically significantly more usable.

Thirty (30) participants with various chronic pain conditions were offered a five-minute session using a virtual reality application called Cool! Participants were asked about their pain using a 0–10 visual analog scale rating before the VR session, during the session and immediately after the session. They were also asked about immersion into the VR world and about possible side effects. Pain was reduced from pre-session to post-session by 33%. Pain was reduced from pre-session during the VR session by 60%. These changes were both statistically significant at the p < .001 level.

2562,c84539a89bc0a2a2425ca1b0046833f57d86e7b0,Using Bayesian networks to analyze expression data,"DNA hybridization arrays simultaneously measure the expression level for thousands of genes. These measurements provide a “snapshot” of transcription levels within the cell. A major challenge in computational biology is to uncover, from such measurements, gene/protein interactions and key biological features of cellular systems.
In this paper, we propose a new framework for discovering interactions between genes based on multiple expression measurements This framework builds on the use of Bayesian networks for representing statistical dependencies. A Bayesian network is a graph-based model of joint multi-variate probability distributions that captures properties of conditional independence between variables. Such models are attractive for their ability to describe complex stochastic processes, and for providing clear methodologies for learning from (noisy) observations.
We start by showing how Bayesian networks can describe interactions between genes. We then present an efficient algorithm capable of learning such networks and statistical method to assess our confidence in their features. Finally, we apply this method to the S. cerevisiae cell-cycle measurements of Spellman et al. [35] to uncover biological features",2000.0,66.0,3522.0,{'pages': '127-135'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Friedman2000UsingBN,\n author = {N. Friedman and M. Linial and I. Nachman and D.

The term 'immoral behaviour' represents a complex array of conduct, ranging from insensitivity to topics of conversation through to violent assault and murder. To better understand the neuroscience of immoral behaviour, this review investigates two clinical populations that commonly present with changes in moral behaviour - behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia and acquired brain injuries. Based on evidence from these groups, it is argued that rather than a single underlying cause, immoral behaviour can result from three distinct types of cognitive failure: (1) problems understanding others; (2) difficulties controlling behaviour; or (3) deficits in the capacity to make appropriate emotional contributions. Each of these failures is associated with damage to different brain regions. A more nuanced approach to the neuroscience of immoral behaviour has important implications for our understanding of immoral behaviour in a wide range of clinical groups, as well as human society more broadly.",2019.0,181.0,16.0,{'name': 'Journal of neuropsychology'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Roberts2019ImmoralBF,\n author = {S.

Thirty-ﬁve female students were confronted with the approach of a male stranger, and blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were monitored. Throughout the model's approach, HR showed a signiﬁcant triphasic change (an initial decrease, a subsequent increase, and then a secondary decrease), whereas subjective feelings of anxiety and tension showed signiﬁcant, gradual increases. These trends were similar to those of Yaezawa and Yoshida’s. Nonetheless, their explanation that the triphasic change in HR reﬂected once hightened and then relieved tension, which was incongruent with the subjective ratings, seemed questionable. As the BP elevated to a moderate degree in spite of the modest HR changes, total peripheral resistance must have been increasing during the model's approach. Blood pressure elevations via this sort of hemodynamic pressor mechanisms have often been reported when a person can only tolerate passively during exposure to stress.

While stylistic control has traditionally relied on handcrafted rules, statistical methods are likely to be needed for generation systems to scale to the production of the large range of variation observed in human dialogues. Previous work on statistical natural language generation (SNLG) has shown that the grammaticality and naturalness of generated utterances can be optimized from data; however these data-driven methods have not been shown to produce stylistic variation that is perceived by humans in the way that the system intended. This paper describes Personage, a highly parameterizable language generator whose parameters are based on psychological findings about the linguistic reflexes of personality. We present a novel SNLG method which uses parameter estimation models trained on personality-annotated data to predict the generation decisions required to convey any combination of scalar values along the five main dimensions of personality. A human evaluation shows that parameter estimation models produce recognizable stylistic variation along multiple dimensions, on a continuous scale, and without the computational cost incurred by overgeneration techniques.",2011.0,91.0,142.0,"{'volume': '37', 'pages': '455-488', 'name': 'Computational Linguistics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mairesse2011ControllingUP,\n author = {François Mairesse and M.

In this paper, we investigate whether this Midas touch phenomenon would also occur under mediated conditions (i.e., touching via an arm strap equipped with electromechanical actuators). Helping behavior was more frequently endorsed in the touch, compared to the no-touch condition, but this difference was not found to be statistically significant. However, a meta-analytical comparison with published research demonstrated that the strength of the virtual Midas touch is of the same magnitude as that of the Midas touch in unmediated situations. The present experiment, thus, provides empirical evidence that touch-like qualities can be attributed to electromechanical stimulation. This is important for the field of mediated social touch of which the design rationale is based on the assumption that mediated touch by means of tactile feedback technologies is processed in ways similar to real physical contact.",2008.0,36.0,89.0,"{'volume': '2', 'pages': '136-140', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Haptics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Haans2008TheVM,\n author = {A.

Subjects rated the 100 personality items of the California Q-Set on nine subjective dimensions, six of which loaded highly on a first principal component. This factor was interpreted as reflecting each trait's ""easy visibility"" to an outside observer. Actual interjudge agreement in applying each trait to real individuals was assessed in two ways: Self-other agreement was assessed in two independent samples, and interpeer agreement was assessed in three samples. Impressive and stable agreement was found for most Q items. The traits that were applied to individuals with the greatest interjudge agreement were the same ones that seemed most easily visible and tended to be positively relevant to extraversion and negatively relevant to neuroticism (identified through a factor analysis by McCrae, Costa, & Busch, 1986). The results suggest that traits defining extraversion are revealed relatively directly in social behavior and, therefore, are easy to judge, that traits defining neuroticism are less visible and, so, are judged less accurately, and that lay perceivers of personality are generally sensitive to this difference between traits.",1987.0,57.0,431.0,"{'volume': '52 2', 'pages': '\n          409-18\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Funder1987DifferencesBT,\n author = {D.

2600,cab2694aa162456fec49023648f3f7c2e31e8d97,Evaluating models of speaker head nods for virtual agents,"Virtual human research has often modeled nonverbal behaviors based on the findings of psychological research. In recent years, however, there have been growing efforts to use automated, data-driven approaches to find patterns of nonverbal behaviors in video corpora and even thereby discover new factors that have not been previously documented. However, there have been few studies that compare how the behaviors generated by different approaches are interpreted by people. In this paper, we present an evaluation study to compare the perception of nonverbal behaviors, more specifically head nods, generated by different approaches. Studies have shown that head nods serve a variety of communicative functions and that the head is in constant motion during speaking turns. To evaluate the different approaches of head nod generation, we asked human subjects to evaluate videos of a virtual agent displaying nods generated by a human, by a machine learning data-driven approach, or by a hand-crafted rule-based approach. Results show that there is a significant effect on the perception of head nods in terms of appropriate nod occurrence, especially between the data-driven approach and the rule-based approach.",2010.0,28.0,12.0,{'pages': '1257-1264'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Lee2010EvaluatingMO,\n author = {Jina Lee and Zhiyang Wang and S.

Multilevel models are used with data from the British Household Panel Survey and the Census of UK population to assess the nature and extent of variations in happiness and well-being to determine the relative importance of the area (district, region), household, and individual characteristics on these outcomes. Having taken into account the characteristics at these different levels, we are able to determine whether any areas are associated with especially positive or negative feelings of happiness and well-being. Whilst we find that most of the variation in happiness and well-being is attributable to the individual level, some variation in these measures is also found at the household and area levels, especially for the measure of well-being, before we control for the full set of individual, household, and area characteristics. However, once we control for these characteristics, the variation in happiness and well-being is not found to be statistically significant between areas.",2012.0,64.0,178.0,"{'volume': '35', 'pages': '102 - 70', 'name': 'International Regional Science Review'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ballas2012HappyPO,\n author = {D.

To understand how travel and quarantine influence the dynamics of the spread of this novel human virus, Chinazzi et al. applied a global metapopulation disease transmission model to epidemiological data from China. They concluded that the travel quarantine introduced in Wuhan on 23 January 2020 only delayed epidemic progression by 3 to 5 days within China, but international travel restrictions did help to slow spread elsewhere in the world until mid-February. Their results suggest that early detection, hand washing, self-isolation, and household quarantine will likely be more effective than travel restrictions at mitigating this pandemic. Science, this issue p. 395 A SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological model reveals the effects of travel restrictions and transmission reduction efforts on the spread of this novel virus. Motivated by the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China, we use a global metapopulation disease transmission model to project the impact of travel limitations on the national and international spread of the epidemic. The model is calibrated on the basis of internationally reported cases and shows that, at the start of the travel ban from Wuhan on 23 January 2020, most Chinese cities had already received many infected travelers. The travel quarantine of Wuhan delayed the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days in mainland China but had a more marked effect on the international scale, where case importations were reduced by nearly 80% until mid-February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.",2020.0,84.0,2972.0,"{'volume': '368', 'pages': '395 - 400', 'name': 'Science (New York, N.y.)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chinazzi2020TheEO,\n author = {Matteo Chinazzi and Jessica T.

However so far the recognition of facial emotions is mainly addressed by computer vision researchers, based on facial display. Also detection of vocal expressions of emotions can be found in research work done by acoustic researchers. Most of these research paradigms are devoted purely to visual or purely to auditory human emotion detection. However we found that it is very interesting to consider both these auditory and visual information together, for processing, since we hope this kind of multi-modal information processing will become a datum of information processing in future multimedia era. By several intensive subjective evaluation studies we found that human beings recognise anger, happiness, surprise and dislike by their visual appearance, compared to voice only detection. When the audio track of each emotion clip is dubbed with a different type of auditory emotional expression, still anger, happiness and surprise were video dominant. However the dislike emotion gave mixed responses to different speakers. In both studies we found that sadness and fear emotions were audio dominant. As a conclusion, we propose a method of facial emotion detection by using a hybrid approach, which uses multi-modal information for facial emotion recognition.",1997.0,12.0,231.0,"{'volume': '1', 'pages': '397-401 vol.1', 'name': 'Proceedings of ICICS, 1997 International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing.

Boredom is considered as a main unpleasant emotional state at the workplace, which could lead to stress, depression and decreased well-being. Boredom is related to the situation at hand and may lead to decreased performance. We frame the situation by connecting socio-emotional and cognitive conflict and individual differences to shed light onto the function of boredom. We look at the relation of boredom to theoretically connected emotions and their regulation. We conducted an online experiment in a virtual workplace setting (N = 57). We induced a socio-emotional and cognitive conflict situation by using a socially interactive agent which shames participants. Individual differences were operationalised through social identity and self-consciousness. We tested how social identity (predictor) and self-consciousness (moderator) influence cognitive appraisal of threat (mediator) and boredom (outcome). The results revealed that self-consciousness moderates the effect of social identity on cognitive appraisal of threat which then mediates the effect of social identity on boredom.",2021.0,0.0,0.0,"{'name': '2021 9th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction Workshops and Demos (ACIIW)', 'pages': '1-8'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chehayeb2021IndividualDA,\n author = {Lara Chehayeb and Dimitra Tsovaltzi and Rhythm Arora and Patrick Gebhard},\n booktitle = {2021 9th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction Workshops and Demos (ACIIW)},\n journal = {2021 9th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction Workshops and Demos (ACIIW)},\n pages = {1-8},\n title = {Individual Differences and the Function of Emotions in Socio-Emotional and Cognitive Conflict: If an Agent Shames you, will you still be Bored?},\n year = {2021}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2149701012', 'name': 'Lara Chehayeb'}, {'authorId': '1722662', 'name': 'Dimitra Tsovaltzi'}, {'authorId': '31428092', 'name': 'Rhythm Arora'}, {'authorId': '48785659', 'name': 'Patrick Gebhard'}]"

2620,ccfa7e011aa23b2477d11f6c4f779f998db382ac,Expressive Copying Behavior for Social Agents: A Perceptual Analysis,"Successful human interaction commonly involves prototypical exchanges where interactors are engaged, synchronized, and harmonious in their behaviors. The copying of aspects of the other's behavior, at different levels, seems central to establishing and maintaining such empathic connections. Yet, many questions remain unanswered, particularly how it is possible to reflect the same affective content back to the other when the actual motion itself is not exactly the same as theirs. This paper presents a perceptual study in which emotional gestures conducted by an actor were mapped onto synthesized versions generated by an embodied virtual agent. Copying is at the expressive level, where qualities such as the fluidity or expansiveness of gestures are considered, rather than exact low-level motion matching. Participants were later asked to rate the emotional content of video recordings of both the original and the synthesized gestures. A statistical analysis shows that, in most cases, participants associated the emotional content of the agent's gestures with that intended to be expressed by the original actor. The results suggest that a combination of the type of movement performed and its quality is important for successfully communicating emotions.",2012.0,55.0,52.0,"{'volume': '42', 'pages': '776-783', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Castellano2012ExpressiveCB,\n author = {Ginevra Castellano and M.

In the research reported here, we demonstrated that predictive mechanisms play a role in this behavior. In natural interactions (Study 1), participants anticipated a substantial proportion of genuine smiles but almost no polite ones. We propose that reinforcement-learning mechanisms underpin this social prediction and that smile-reciprocity differences arise because genuine smiles are more rewarding than polite smiles. In Study 2, we tested this idea using a learning task in which correct responses were rewarded with genuine or polite smiles. We measured participants’ smile reactions with electromyography (EMG). As in natural interactions, people mimicked polite smiles reactively, after seeing them appear. Interestingly, the EMG data showed predictive responding to genuine smiles only. These results demonstrate that anticipating social rewards drives predictive social responding and therefore represent a significant advance in understanding the mechanisms that underpin the neural control of real-world social behavior.",2013.0,42.0,63.0,"{'volume': '24', 'pages': '1446 - 1455', 'name': 'Psychological Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Heerey2013PredictiveAR,\n author = {E.

Drawing together the threads of current research on the nature and funactions of emotional expression, of physiological reactions, and of emotional experience, this book offers a balanced survey of facts and theory. Nico Frijda discusses the motivational and neurophysiological preconditions for emotions, and the ways in which emotions are regulated by the individual. Considering the kinds of events that elicit emotions, he argues that emotions arise because events are appraised by people as favorable or harmful to their own interests. he takes an information-processing perspective: Emotions are viewed as outcomes of the process of assessing the world in terms of one's own concerns, which, in turn, modify action readiness. This analysis leads him to address such fundamental issues as the place of emotion in motivation generally and the discrepancy between the functions of the emotions and their often irrational and disruptive character. An important contribution to recent debates, The Emotions does not presuppose extensive prior knowledge.",2011.0,0.0,362.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Frijda2011THEE,\n author = {N.

2626,cd6288770cdc7ad1ebe4372ce1ddb970c6e5e585,Is Photorealism Important for Perception of Expressive Virtual Humans in Virtual Reality?,"In recent years, the quality of real-time rendering has reached new heights—realistic reflections, physically based materials, and photometric lighting are all becoming commonplace in modern game engines and even interactive virtual environments, such as virtual reality (VR). As the strive for realism continues, there is a need to investigate the effect of photorealism on users’ perception, particularly for interactive, emotional scenarios in VR. In this article, we explored three main topics, where we predicted photorealism will make a difference: the illusion of being present with the virtual person and in an environment, altered emotional response toward the character, and a subtler response—comfort of being in close proximity to the character. We present a perceptual experiment, with an interactive expressive virtual character in VR, which was designed to induce particular social responses in people. Our participant pool was large (N = 797) and diverse in terms of demographics. We designed a between-group experiment, where each group saw either the realistic rendering or one of our stylized conditions (simple and sketch style), expressing one of three attitudes: Friendly, Unfriendly, or Sad. While the render style did not particularly effect the level of comfort with the character or increase the illusion of presence with it, our main finding shows that the photorealistic character changed the emotional responses of participants, compared to the stylized versions. We also found a preference for realism in VR, reflected in the affinity and higher place illusion in the scenario, rendered in the realistic render style.",2019.0,42.0,48.0,"{'volume': '16', 'pages': '1 - 19', 'name': 'ACM Transactions on Applied Perception (TAP)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zibrek2019IsPI,\n author = {Katja Zibrek and Seán J.

These disease descriptions remain invaluable for guiding public health policy and research, as the introduction of effective chemotherapy radically changed the history of disease. Specific high-risk groups were identified. Primary infection before 2 years of age frequently progressed to serious disease within the first 12 months without significant prior symptoms. Primary infection between 2 and 10 years of age rarely progressed to serious disease, and such progression was associated with significant clinical symptoms. In children aged >3 years the presence of symptoms represented a window of opportunity in which to establish a clinical diagnosis before serious disease progression. Primary infection after 10 years of age frequently progressed to adult-type disease. Early effective intervention in this group will reduce the burden of cavitating disease and associated disease transmission in the community. Although the pre-chemotherapy literature excluded the influence of human immune deficiency virus (HIV) infection, recent disease descriptions in HIV-infected children indicate that immune-compromised children behave in a similar fashion to immune immature children (less than 2 years of age). An important concept deduced from the natural history of tuberculosis in childhood is that of relevant disease. Deciding which children to treat may be extremely difficult in high-prevalence, low-resource settings. The concept of relevant disease provides guidance for more effective public health intervention.",2004.0,22.0,763.0,"{'volume': '8 4', 'pages': '\n          392-402\n        ', 'name': 'The international journal of tuberculosis and lung disease : the official journal of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Marais2004TheNH,\n author = {B.

Existing emergencies have shown that individuals are easy to be influenced by others' emotion during the evacuation. This will make it easier for people to aggregate together and increase security risks. Some of the existing evacuation models without considering emotion are therefore not suitable for describing crowd behaviors in emergencies. We propose a perception‐based emotion contagion model and use multiagent technology to simulate crowd behaviors. Navigation points are introduced to guide the movement of the agents. Based on the proposed model, a prototype simulation system for crowd emotion contagion is developed. The comparative simulation experiments verify that the model can effectively deduct the evacuation time and crowd emotion contagion.

Many factors impact on empathic interaction; here we focus on the role of ‘similarity’ in developing empathic relations.

To investigate this, 345 children aged 10-11 years interacted with FearNot (Fun with Empathic Agents to Reach Novel Outcomes in Teaching), a virtual world populated by synthetic characters involved in bullying scenarios. Children completed an Agent Evaluation Questionnaire, which enquired about perceptions of similarity and empathy with the characters.

The turning rate is often estimated from the trajectory of the fish centroid that is output by commercial or custom-made target tracking software run on overhead videos of fish swimming. However, the accuracy of such indirect methods with respect to the turning rate associated with changes in heading during zebrafish locomotion is largely untested. Here, we compare two indirect methods for the turning rate estimation using the centroid velocity or position data, with full shape tracking for three different video sampling rates. We use tracking data from the overhead video recorded at 60, 30, and 15 frames per second of zebrafish swimming in a shallow water tank. Statistical comparisons of absolute turning rate across methods and sampling rates indicate that, while indirect methods are indistinguishable from full shape tracking, the video sampling rate significantly influences the turning rate measurement. The results of this study can aid in the selection of the video capture frame rate, an experimental design parameter in zebrafish behavioral experiments where activity is an important measure.",2015.0,23.0,16.0,"{'volume': '12 3', 'pages': '\n          250-4\n        ', 'name': 'Zebrafish'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mwaffo2015MeasuringZT,\n author = {Violet Mwaffo and S.

Stress reduction is particularly helpful, but face-to-face delivery systems cannot reach all those who might benefit. An online, 3-dimensional virtual world may be able to support the rich interpersonal interactions required of this approach. In this pilot study, we explore the feasibility of translating a face-to-face stress reduction program into an online virtual setting and estimate the effect size of the intervention. Methods and Findings Domain experts in virtual world technology joined with mind body practitioners to translate an existing 8 week relaxation response-based resiliency program into an 8-week virtual world-based program in Second Life™ (SL). Twenty-four healthy volunteers with at least one month's experience in SL completed the program. Each subject filled out the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Symptom Checklist 90- Revised (SCL-90-R) before and after taking part. Participants took part in one of 3 groups of about 10 subjects. The participants found the program to be helpful and enjoyable. Many reported that the virtual environment was an excellent substitute for the preferred face-to-face approach. On quantitative measures, there was a general trend toward decreased perceived stress, (15.7 to 15.0), symptoms of depression, (57.6 to 57.0) and anxiety (56.8 to 54.8). There was a significant decrease of 2.8 points on the SCL-90-R Global Severity Index (p<0.05). Conclusions This pilot project showed that it is feasible to deliver a typical mind-body medical intervention through a virtual environment and that it is well received. Moreover, the small reduction in psychological distress suggests further research is warranted. Based on the data collected for this project, a randomized trial with less than 50 subjects would be appropriately powered if perceived stress is the primary outcome.",2012.0,33.0,38.0,"{'volume': '7', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hoch2012TheFA,\n author = {D.

In particular, social learning allows animals to learn about dangers without incurring in the costs of trial‐and‐error learning. In zebrafish, both chemical and visual social cues elicit an innate alarm response, which consists of erratic movement followed by freezing behavior. Injured zebrafish release an alarm substance from their skin that elicits the alarm response. Similarly, the sight of conspecifics displaying the alarm response can also elicit the expression of this response in observers. In this study, we investigated if these social cues of danger can also be used by zebrafish as unconditioned stimulus (US) in learning. We found that only the chemical cue was effective in the social fear conditioning. We suggest that this differential efficacy of social cues results from the fact that the alarm cue is a more reliable indicator of threat, than the sight of an alarmed conspecific. Therefore, although multiple social cues may elicit innate responses not all have been evolutionarily co‐opted to act as US in associative learning. Furthermore, the use of the expression of the immediate early genes as markers of neuronal activity showed that chemical social fear conditioning is paralleled by a differential activation of the olfactory bulbs and by a different pattern of functional connectivity across brain regions involved in olfactory processing.",2020.0,89.0,8.0,"{'volume': '19', 'name': 'Genes'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Pinho2020InnateCB,\n author = {Júlia Pinho and M.

Meanwhile, emotional contagion, the spread of vigilance or panic, serves as a negative feedback to the epidemic, but few existing models take it into consideration. In this study, we proposed an innovative multi-layer hybrid modelling and simulation approach to simulate disease transmission and emotional contagion together. In each layer, we used a hybrid simulation method combining agent-based modelling (ABM) with system dynamics modelling (SDM), keeping spatial heterogeneity while reducing computation costs. We designed a new emotion dynamics model IWAN (indifferent, worried, afraid and numb) to simulate emotional contagion inside a community during an epidemic. Our model was well fit to the data of China, the UK and the US during the COVID-19 pandemic. If there weren’t emotional contagion, our experiments showed that the confirmed cases would increase rapidly, for instance, the total confirmed cases during simulation in Guangzhou, China would grow from 334 to 2096, which increased by 528%. We compared the calibrated emotional contagion parameters of different countries and found that the suppression effect of emotional contagion in China is relatively more visible than that in the US and the UK. Due to the experiment results, the proposed multi-layer network model with hybrid simulation is valid and can be applied to the quantitative analysis of the epidemic trends and the suppression effect of emotional contagion in different countries. Our model can be modified for further research to study other social factors and intervention policies in the COVID-19 pandemic or future epidemics.",2021.0,34.0,6.0,"{'name': 'PLoS ONE', 'volume': '16'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Guo2021TheSE,\n author = {Xudong Guo and Junbo Tong and Peiyu Chen and Wenhui Fan},\n booktitle = {PLoS ONE},\n journal = {PLoS ONE},\n title = {The suppression effect of emotional contagion in the COVID-19 pandemic: A multi-layer hybrid modelling and simulation approach},\n volume = {16},\n year = {2021}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2124466167', 'name': 'Xudong Guo'}, {'authorId': '150165151', 'name': 'Junbo Tong'}, {'authorId': '47978509', 'name': 'Peiyu Chen'}, {'authorId': '2113532692', 'name': 'Wenhui Fan'}]"

2652,d012997e58d38de3f26ef75ae2fab0ad91ae102c,The Usability of Collaborative Virtual Environments: Towards an Evaluation Framework,"Collaboration is often a necessity in order to reach one's goals in society, organizations, or among individuals. Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs) can be used as a medium supporting communication and interaction between people. By allowing real-time co-work with graphical representations, they offer new possibilities to facilitate collaboration. 
Yet, while the use of CVEs is continuously increasing, there is still little research on understanding the consequences of using them or about their usability. By reviewing previous research, we can see that existing studies have focused almost exclusively on improving technical aspects for these environments. Problems originating from multiple users and the collaborative characteristics associated with the technology have been neglected. This thesis addresses these problems. 
The empirical background consists of five experimental studies that comparatively evaluated different CVE technologies and applications. The first three studies used quantitative evaluations to show how new immersive technologies, where the projected environments surround the users, have both benefits and drawbacks for use in comparison to desktop systems or for working with full-scale models. The evaluation focused on users' experiences and on their performance. It was found that although immersive technologies provided greater presence, effectiveness varied more with the tasks than with the technology used. The symmetry or asymmetry in the distributed settings was also found to have a major impact on effectiveness. 
The methods used for the first three studies were found to have certain limitations in analyzing collaboration. In the other two studies additional methods were therefore developed for identifying successes and failures in interaction with the technology, and social interaction. By focusing on social interaction, interaction via technology and problem solving separately, small sequences of successes and failures during collaboration were analyzed. Many of these sequences can be considered as patterns since they recurred during several tasks. The results show that problems, particularly in social interaction, have an impact on the efficiency of interaction via technology, and vice versa. Adding problem solving as a third process provides a means of developing a systematic evaluation framework. This framework, moreover, includes both qualitative and quantitative analyses. 
The findings presented in this thesis contribute to developing better usability evaluation methods for CVEs, and hence to the design of new CVEs. The results from the comparative evaluations from the experiments can be used to examine the social implications of using CVEs and also to support the selection and practical use of different types of CVE.",2010.0,0.0,12.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Heldal2010TheUO,\n author = {I.

VEs present new possibilities for mediated communication by placing people in a shared 3D context. However, there are technical constraints in creating photorealistic and behaviourally realistic avatars capable of mimicking a person’s actions or intentions in real time. At the same time, previous research findings indicate that virtual humans can elicit social responses even with minimal cues, suggesting that full realism may not be essential for effective social interaction. This research explores the lower boundaries of fidelity by investigating how different levels of responsiveness, photorealism and behavioural realism affect people’s experience of interacting with virtual humans. The research presented comprises three between-group experiments involving over 200 participants. The experiments focus on distinct but interrelated questions. In the first experiment, conducted in an immersive Cave-like system, participants explored a library containing a group of seated virtual readers. The aim was to investigate the degree to which the virtual humans were responded to as social entities as their responsiveness increased across the conditions. Results indicated that responsiveness significantly affected a range of responses, including the degree of sentience attributed to the agents. The findings signalled the need to further define the different social responses affected by virtual humans. Participants’ heart rate and electrodermal activity were also recorded to explore the possibility of employing objective measures to study responses to virtual humans. The remaining two experiments focused on behavioural realism and photorealism in the context of mediated communication between pairs of human participants. In the second experiment, participants interacted via a video-tunnel that provided them with a head-and-shoulders view of an avatar representing their conversation partner. Analysis of questionnaire responses indicated that the avatar whose gaze behaviour was inferred from conversational turntaking significantly outperformed the visually identical, but behaviourally less realistic, random-gaze avatar. An in-depth qualitative analysis of the interview responses yielded a theoretical model of the possible effects of avatar appearance and behaviour on perceptions of the communication",2003.0,172.0,83.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Garau2003TheIO,\n author = {Maia Garau and Dirk Weirich},\n title = {The Impact of Avatar Fidelity on Social Interaction in Virtual Environments},\n year = {2003}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '11554704', 'name': 'Maia Garau'}, {'authorId': '1752753', 'name': 'Dirk Weirich'}]"

There are many heuristics in the literature, based on elements such as the game interface, mechanics, gameplay, and narrative. However, there is a need to integrate these heuristics into a validated model that can be used to design, evaluate, and understand enjoyment in games. We have drawn together the various heuristics into a concise model of enjoyment in games that is structured by flow. Flow, a widely accepted model of enjoyment, includes eight elements that, we found, encompass the various heuristics from the literature. Our new model, GameFlow, consists of eight elements -- concentration, challenge, skills, control, clear goals, feedback, immersion, and social interaction. Each element includes a set of criteria for achieving enjoyment in games. An initial investigation and validation of the GameFlow model was carried out by conducting expert reviews of two real-time strategy games, one high-rating and one low-rating, using the GameFlow criteria. The result was a deeper understanding of enjoyment in real-time strategy games and the identification of the strengths and weaknesses of the GameFlow model as an evaluation tool. The GameFlow criteria were able to successfully distinguish between the high-rated and low-rated games and identify why one succeeded and the other failed. We concluded that the GameFlow model can be used in its current form to review games; further work will provide tools for designing and evaluating enjoyment in games.",2005.0,41.0,2163.0,"{'volume': '3', 'pages': '3', 'name': 'Comput.

According to the classic view on emotional mimicry (the Matched Motor Hypothesis), people mimic the specific facial movements that comprise a discrete emotional expression. However, little evidence exists for the mimicry of discrete emotions; rather, the extant evidence supports only valence-based mimicry. We propose an alternative Emotion Mimicry in Context view according to which emotional mimicry is not based on mere perception but rather on the interpretation of signals as emotional intentions in a specific context. We present evidence for the idea that people mimic contextualized emotions rather than simply expressive muscle movements. Our model postulates that (implicit or explicit) contextual information is needed for emotional mimicry to take place.

Agents are modeled from multidisciplinary perspectives and their strategies are evolved over time via collective coevolution and independent learning. Spatial and temporal simulation results reveal fascinating global emergence phenomena and interesting patterns of group movement and autonomous behavioral development. Extensions of differing complexity are also used to investigate the impact of various decision parameters on the outcome of unrest. Analysis of the results provides new insights into the intricate dynamics of civil upheavals and serves as an avenue to gain a more holistic understanding of the fundamental nature of civil violence.",2009.0,53.0,34.0,"{'volume': '13', 'pages': '780-800', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Quek2009EvolutionaryGT,\n author = {H.

An Empathic Virtual Agent Delivers Behavior Change Health Interventions,"We discuss our approach to developing a novel modality for the computer-delivery of Brief Motivational Interventions (BMIs) for behavior change in the form of a personalized On-Demand VIrtual Counselor (ODVIC), accessed over the internet. ODVIC is a multimodal Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) that empathically delivers an evidence-based behavior change intervention by adapting, in real-time, its verbal and nonverbal communication messages to those of the user’s during their interaction. We currently focus our work on excessive alcohol consumption as a target behavior, and our approach is adaptable to other target behaviors (e.g., overeating, lack of exercise, narcotic drug use, non-adherence to treatment). We based our current approach on a successful existing patient-centered brief motivational intervention for behavior change---the Drinker’s Check-Up (DCU)---whose computer-delivery with a text-only interface has been found effective in reducing alcohol consumption in problem drinkers. We discuss the results of users’ evaluation of the computer-based DCU intervention delivered with a text-only interface compared to the same intervention delivered with two different ECAs (a neutral one and one with some empathic abilities). Users rate the three systems in terms of acceptance, perceived enjoyment, and intention to use the system, among other dimensions.

2676,d21792b581d5dd504c6c6344cbba417155f7aa55,A Process Model of Empathy For Virtual Agents,"For more than a century, empathy has been a central topic in the study of human emotion. It plays a crucial role in our everyday social life, having implications for the survival of the species. In the case of agents that inhabit virtual worlds and interact socially among each other and with humans, empathy has also been considered to be an important mechanism to promote engaging and believable interactions. However, creating empathic agents, until recently, has been accomplished mostly through the implementation of specific empathic behaviors or by using domain-dependent empirical models. In this article, we propose a generic computational model of empathy that is grounded on recent psychological theories about empathy. The proposed model treats empathy as a process in which the intensity of the empathic response is modulated by a set of factors that involve the relationship between the agents of the empathic interaction, namely, the similarity and affective link, as well as some characteristics of the empathizer agent, such as mood and personality. This model was implemented into an affective agent architecture, which was then used in an evaluation that had 77 participants. The results indicate that our empathy model, when used to simulate a social scenario with a small group of agents, significantly changed the way that the users perceived and described the interactions between those agents.",2015.0,54.0,31.0,"{'volume': '27', 'pages': '371-391', 'name': 'Interact.

Several characteristics have been described for this species, including scototaxis, which is the natural preference for dark environments in detriment of bright ones. However, there is no evidence regarding the influence of “natural stimuli” in zebrafish subjected to novelty-based paradigms. In this report, we evaluated the spatio-temporal exploratory activity of the short-fin zebrafish phenotype in the open tank after a short-period confinement into dark/bright environments. A total of 44 animals were individually confined during a 10-min single session into one of three environments: black-painted, white-painted, and transparent cylinders (dark, bright, and transparent groups). Fish were further subjected to the novel tank test and their exploratory profile was recorded during a 15-min trial. The results demonstrated that zebrafish increased their vertical exploratory activity during the first 6-min, where the bright group spent more time and travelled a higher distance in the top area. Interestingly, all behavioral parameters measured for the dark group were similar to the transparent one. These data were confirmed by automated analysis of track and occupancy plots and also demonstrated that zebrafish display a classical homebase formation in the bottom area of the tank. A detailed spatio-temporal study of zebrafish exploratory behavior and the construction of representative ethograms showed that the experimental groups presented significant differences in the first 3-min vs. last 3-min of test. Although the main factors involved in these behavioral responses still remain ambiguous and require further investigation, the current report describes an alternative methodological approach for assessing the zebrafish behavior after a forced exposure to different environments. Additionally, the analysis of ethologically-relevant patterns across time could be a potential phenotyping tool to evaluate the zebrafish exploratory profile in the open tank task.",2011.0,48.0,141.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rosemberg2011DifferencesIS,\n author = {D.

The performance of steering approaches, both in terms of quality of results and computational efficiency, depends on internal parameters that are manually tuned to satisfy application-specific requirements. This paper investigates the effect that these parameters have on an algorithm's performance. Using three representative steering algorithms and a set of established performance criteria, we perform a number of large scale optimization experiments that optimize an algorithm's parameters for a range of objectives. For example, our method automatically finds optimal parameters to minimize turbulence at bottlenecks, reduce building evacuation times, produce emergent patterns, and increase the computational efficiency of an algorithm. We also propose using the Pareto Optimal front as an efficient way of modelling optimal relationships between multiple objectives, and demonstrate its effectiveness by estimating optimal parameters for interactively defined combinations of the associated objectives.

Particular attention was given to the role of nonverbal behaviors in the formation of initial impressions. Sixty-two subjects were measured on self-report personality and communication skill scales, on posed emotional sending ability, and on physical attractiveness. Subjects were then videotaped while giving a spontaneous ""explanation."" Trained coders measured five separate nonverbal cue factors displayed by the subjects in the videotapes. Groups of untrained judges viewed the tapes and rated their impressions of the subjects on scales of likability, speaking effectiveness, and expressivity-confidence. Male subjects who were nonverbally skilled and extraverted tended to display more outwardly focused and fluid expressive behaviors, and made more favorable impressions on judges, than did males who scored low on the measures of nonverbal skills and extraversion. Females who were nonverbally skilled displayed more facial expressiveness, which led to more favorable initial impressions. Sex differences may reflect basic differences in the acquisition and use of expressive nonverbal cues by males and females.",1986.0,34.0,213.0,"{'volume': '50 2', 'pages': '\n          421-7\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Riggio1986ImpressionFT,\n author = {R.

The congestion at exits may slow down the egress rate due to the effect of “faster-is-slower”. This inspires us to study how human behavior dynamically changes over time at an emergency in a complex indoor environment. In this paper, we refer the panic of evacuees to their perception of the threat and propose a panic propagation model to model how crowd panic changes during evacuation at an emergency. Combined with the existing social force model, our panic model interprets the self-driven force and interactive forces with others in human mobility. To improve evacuation efficiency, robots are introduced to guide evacuees to escape. Using dynamic environment information, we design an evacuation exit selection algorithm where the optimal exit is automatically selected by the robot with the minimum escape time. In our experiments, a real shopping mall is examined, and the dynamic behavior of panicked evacuees is simulated with the proposed panic model. The evacuation performance of using emergency evacuation robots is evaluated. The improvement of evacuation efficiency validates the effectiveness of our robot-assisted evacuation system.",2016.0,48.0,42.0,"{'volume': '46', 'pages': '694-707', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tang2016HumanMM,\n author = {Bo Tang and Chao Jiang and Haibo He and Yi Guo},\n journal = {IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems},\n pages = {694-707},\n title = {Human Mobility Modeling for Robot-Assisted Evacuation in Complex Indoor Environments},\n volume = {46},\n year = {2016}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '37078378', 'name': 'Bo Tang'}, {'authorId': '2115484380', 'name': 'Chao Jiang'}, {'authorId': '2198278', 'name': 'Haibo He'}, {'authorId': '144979422', 'name': 'Yi Guo'}]"

Interpersonal distance is an important nonverbal behavior, and is used to regulate personal space in a complex interplay with other nonverbal behaviors such as eye gaze. In social anxiety, studies regarding the impact of interpersonal distance on within-situation avoidance behavior are so far rare. Thus the present study aimed to scrutinize the relationship between gaze direction, sex, interpersonal distance, and social anxiety in social interactions. Social interactions were modeled in a virtual-reality (VR) environment, where 20 low and 19 high socially anxious women were confronted with approaching male and female characters, who stopped in front of the participant, either some distance away or close to them, and displayed either a direct or an averted gaze. Gaze and head movements, as well as heart rate, were measured as indices of avoidance behavior and fear reactions. High socially anxious participants showed a complex pattern of avoidance behavior: when the avatar was standing farther away, high socially anxious women avoided gaze contact with male avatars showing a direct gaze. Furthermore, they showed avoidance behavior (backward head movements) in response to male avatars showing a direct gaze, regardless of the interpersonal distance. Overall, the current study proved that VR social interactions might be a very useful tool for investigating avoidance behavior of socially anxious individuals in highly controlled situations. This might also be the first step in using VR social interactions in clinical protocols for the therapy of social anxiety disorder.",2010.0,48.0,84.0,"{'volume': '13 5', 'pages': '\n          547-54\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wieser2010VirtualSI,\n author = {M.

Today, they often embody more and more roles typically endowed by humans, such as a tutor in a virtual learning class or an assistant for virtual task realization. Moreover, the paradigm highlighted in [1] reveals that the user's relation with the computer is intrinsically social, with high similarities compared to interpersonal relationships. For instance, people have no problem using communicative means (verbal and nonverbal behavior) to interact with artificial entities and apply polite rules. One particularly interesting aspect of the human machine interaction is the bidirectionality of the relation: users exhibit social behaviors to the computer, and the machine's behavior affects users. Reeves and Nass [1] have shown that people tend to react naturally and socially to computers, as they would do to another person.

However, few studies compare its capacity to evoke the same emotional responses as in real scenarios. This study investigates psycho-physiological patterns evoked during the free exploration of an art museum and the museum virtualized through a 3D immersive virtual environment (IVE). An exploratory study involving 60 participants was performed, recording electroencephalographic and electrocardiographic signals using wearable devices. The real vs. virtual psychological comparison was performed using self-assessment emotional response tests, whereas the physiological comparison was performed through Support Vector Machine algorithms, endowed with an effective feature selection procedure for a set of state-of-the-art metrics quantifying cardiovascular and brain linear and nonlinear dynamics. We included an initial calibration phase, using standardized 2D and 360° emotional stimuli, to increase the accuracy of the model. The self-assessments of the physical and virtual museum support the use of IVEs in emotion research. The 2-class (high/low) system accuracy was 71.52% and 77.08% along the arousal and valence dimension, respectively, in the physical museum, and 75.00% and 71.08% in the virtual museum. The previously presented 360° stimuli contributed to increasing the accuracy in the virtual museum. Also, the real vs. virtual classifier accuracy was 95.27%, using only EEG mean phase coherency features, which demonstrates the high involvement of brain synchronization in emotional virtual reality processes.

To reach this goal, the TRAVEE has benefited from several innovative ideas and technologies—virtual reality, brain–computer interfaces, functional electrical stimulation, robotics, haptics, multimodal feedback, and a novel idea in information and communications technology systems for rehabilitation—visual augmentation as a form of feedback to the patient. Through visual augmentation, the TRAVEE immerses the patient in a virtual environment where his movements are rendered as being better than in the real world, and in this way diminishing his disability.

Our aim in this paper is to point the reader at what we perceive to be the most important theoretical and practical issues associated with the design and construction of intelligent agents. For convenience, we divide these issues into three areas (though as the reader will see, the divisions are at times somewhat arbitrary). Agent theory is concerned with the question of what an agent is, and the use of mathematical formalisms for representing and reasoning about the properties of agents. Agent architectures can be thought of as software engineering models of agents; researchers in this area are primarily concerned with the problem of designing software or hardware systems that will satisfy the properties specified by agent theorists. Finally, agent languages are software systems for programming and experimenting with agents; these languages may embody principles proposed by theorists. The paper is not intended to serve as a tutorial introduction to all the issues mentioned; we hope instead simply to identify the most important issues, and point to work that elaborates on them. The article includes a short review of current and potential applications of agent technology.",1995.0,233.0,7007.0,"{'volume': '10', 'pages': '115 - 152', 'name': 'The Knowledge Engineering Review'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wooldridge1995IntelligentAT,\n author = {M.

Keystroke analysis i.e. study of the typing behavior in desktop computer is found to be an effective modality for emotion detection because of its reliability, non-intrusiveness and low resource overhead. As smartphones proliferate, typing behavior on smartphone presents an equally powerful modality for emotion detection. It has the added advantage to run in-situ experiments with better coverage than the experiments using desktop computer keyboards. This work explores the efficacy of smartphone typing to detect multiple affective states. We use a qualitative and experimental approach to answer the question. We conduct an online survey among 120 participants to understand the typing habits in smartphones and collect feedback on multiple measurable parameters that affect their emotion while typing. The findings lead us to design and implement an Android based emotion detection system, TapSense, which can identify four different emotion states (happy, sad, stressed, relaxed) with an average accuracy (AUCROC) of 73% (maximum of 94%) based on typing features only. The analysis also reveals that among different features, typing speed is the most discriminative one.",2017.0,15.0,25.0,"{'pages': '146-151', 'name': '2017 Seventh International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ghosh2017EvaluatingEO,\n author = {Surjya Ghosh and Niloy Ganguly and Bivas Mitra and Pradipta De},\n journal = {2017 Seventh International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII)},\n pages = {146-151},\n title = {Evaluating effectiveness of smartphone typing as an indicator of user emotion},\n year = {2017}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '40598977', 'name': 'Surjya Ghosh'}, {'authorId': '4213990', 'name': 'Niloy Ganguly'}, {'authorId': '144985652', 'name': 'Bivas Mitra'}, {'authorId': '50430940', 'name': 'Pradipta De'}]"

Associationism accounts for the phenomena of both conditioning and ""higher"" forms of learning via concepts such as excitation, inhibition, and reinforcement, whereas cognitive theories assume that learning depends on hypothesis testing, cognitive models, and propositional reasoning. Cognitive theories have received considerable impetus in regard to both human and animal learning from recent research suggesting that the key illustration of cue selection in learning, blocking, often arises from inferential reasoning. At the same time, a dichotomous view that separates noncognitive, unconscious (implicit) learning from cognitive, conscious (explicit) learning has gained favor. This review selectively describes key findings from this research, evaluates evidence for and against associative and cognitive explanatory constructs, and critically examines both the dichotomous view of learning as well as the claim that learning can occur unconsciously.",2010.0,132.0,249.0,"{'volume': '61', 'pages': '\n          273-301\n        ', 'name': 'Annual review of psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Shanks2010LearningFA,\n author = {D.

Each agent has an exclusion radius r(P), which accounts for the population viscosity, and an interaction radius r(int), which defines the instantaneous contact network for the game dynamics. We show that, differently from the r(P)=0 case, the model with finite-sized agents presents a coexistence phase with both cooperators and defectors, besides the two absorbing phases, in which either cooperators or defectors dominate. We provide, in addition, a geometric interpretation of the transitions between phases. In analogy with lattice models, the geometric percolation of the contact network (i.e., irrespective of the strategy) enhances cooperation. More importantly, we show that the percolation of defectors is an essential condition for their survival. Differently from compact clusters of cooperators, isolated groups of defectors will eventually become extinct if not percolating, independently of their size.",2014.0,109.0,21.0,"{'volume': '90 2', 'pages': '\n          022132\n        ', 'name': 'Physical review.

This paper builds an improved SIRS model of passengers’ panic spread in subway emergency with consideration of passengers’ density, the characteristic of subway car with the confined space, and passengers’ psychological factors. The spread of passengers’ panic is simulated by use of Matlab, which draws the rules of how group panic spreads dynamically. The trend of stable point of the infection ratio is analyzed by changing different parameters, which help to draw a conclusion that immunization rate, spontaneous immune loss rate, and passenger number have a great influence on the final infected ratio. Finally, we propose an integrated control strategy and find the peak of passengers’ panic and the final infected ratio is greatly improved through the numerical simulation. The research plays a vital role in helping the government and subway administration to master the panic spread mechanism and reduce the panic spread by improving measures and also provides certain reference significance for rail system construction, emergency contingency plans, and the construction and implementation of emergency response system.",2014.0,48.0,21.0,"{'volume': '2014', 'pages': '1-12', 'name': 'Mathematical Problems in Engineering'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Zhao2014SIRSMO,\n author = {Haifeng Zhao and Jie Jiang and Rongyu Xu and Yang Ye},\n journal = {Mathematical Problems in Engineering},\n pages = {1-12},\n title = {SIRS model of passengers' panic propagation under self-organization circumstance in the subway emergency},\n volume = {2014},\n year = {2014}\n}\n""}","[{'authorId': '3027721', 'name': 'Haifeng Zhao'}, {'authorId': '2219039372', 'name': 'Jie Jiang'}, {'authorId': '2115802613', 'name': 'Rongyu Xu'}, {'authorId': '2114058314', 'name': 'Yang Ye'}]"

It has evolved in the context of parental care for offspring, as well as within kinship bonds, to help facilitate group living. In this paper, we integrate the perspectives of evolution, animal behaviour, developmental psychology, and social and clinical neuroscience to elucidate our understanding of the proximate mechanisms underlying empathy. We focus, in particular, on processing of signals of distress and need, and their relation to prosocial behaviour. The ability to empathize, both in animals and humans, mediates prosocial behaviour when sensitivity to others' distress is paired with a drive towards their welfare. Disruption or atypical development of the neural circuits that process distress cues and integrate them with decision value leads to callous disregard for others, as is the case in psychopathy. The realization that basic forms of empathy exist in non-human animals is crucial for gaining new insights into the underlying neurobiological and genetic mechanisms of empathy, enabling translation towards therapeutic and pharmacological interventions.",2016.0,132.0,394.0,"{'volume': '371', 'name': 'Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Decety2016EmpathyAA,\n author = {J.

Event related potential findings of increased dependency on intentional learning in a serial reaction time task,"It has been suggested that people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have an increased tendency to use explicit (or intentional) learning strategies. This altered learning may play a role in the development of the social communication difficulties characterizing ASD. In the current study, we investigated incidental and intentional sequence learning using a Serial Reaction Time (SRT) task in an adult ASD population. Response times and event related potentials (ERP) components (N2b and P3) were assessed as indicators of learning and knowledge. Findings showed that behaviorally, sequence learning and ensuing explicit knowledge were similar in ASD and typically developing (TD) controls. However, ERP findings showed that learning in the TD group was characterized by an enhanced N2b, while learning in the ASD group was characterized by an enhanced P3. These findings suggest that learning in the TD group might be more incidental in nature, whereas learning in the ASD group is more intentional or effortful. Increased intentional learning might serve as a strategy for individuals with ASD to control an overwhelming environment. Although this led to similar behavioral performances on the SRT task, it is very plausible that this intentional learning has adverse effects in more complex social situations, and hence contributes to the social impairments found in ASD.

Social exposure conducted in virtual reality (VR), embedded in individual cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT), could be an answer. Aims To show that conducting VR exposure in CBT for SAD is effective and is more practical for therapists than conducting exposure in vivo. Method Participants were randomly assigned to either VR exposure (n = 17), in vivo exposure (n = 22) or waiting list (n = 20). Participants in the active arms received individual CBT for 14 weekly sessions and outcome was assessed with questionnaires and a behaviour avoidance test. (Trial registration number ISRCTN99747069.) Results Improvements were found on the primary (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale) and all five secondary outcome measures in both CBT groups compared with the waiting list. Conducting exposure in VR was more effective at post-treatment than in vivo on the primary outcome measure and on one secondary measure. Improvements were maintained at the 6-month follow-up. VR was significantly more practical for therapists than in vivo exposure. Conclusions Using VR can be advantageous over standard CBT as a potential solution for treatment avoidance and as an efficient, cost-effective and practical medium of exposure.",2017.0,53.0,222.0,"{'volume': '210', 'pages': '276 - 283', 'name': 'British Journal of Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bouchard2017VirtualRC,\n author = {S.

This model integrates robot behavior planning models with spoken dialogue management that is robust enough to engage in mixed-initiative dialogues in specific domains. It has two layers; the upper layer is responsible for global task planning using hierarchical planning and the lower layer engages in local planning by utilizing modules called experts, which are specialized for performing certain kind of tasks by performing physical actions and engaging in dialogues.

However, which of these “big three” health behaviors most strongly predicts mental health and well-being, and their higher-order relationships in predictive models, is less known. This study investigated the differential and higher-order associations between sleep, physical activity, and dietary factors as predictors of mental health and well-being in young adults. Method In a cross-sectional survey design, 1,111 young adults (28.4% men) ages 18–25 from New Zealand and the United States answered an online survey measuring typical sleep quantity and quality; physical activity; and consumption of raw and processed fruit and vegetables, fast food, sweets, and soda, along with extensive covariates (including demographics, socioeconomic status, body mass index, alcohol use, smoking, and health conditions) and the outcome measures of depressive symptoms [measured by the Center for Epidemiological Depression Scale (CES-D)] and well-being (measured by the Flourishing Scale). Results Controlling for covariates, sleep quality was the strongest predictor of depressive symptoms and well-being, followed by sleep quantity and physical activity. Only one dietary factor—raw fruit and vegetable consumption—predicted greater well-being but not depressive symptoms when controlling for covariates. There were some higher-order interactions among health behaviors in predicting the outcomes, but these did not survive cross-validation. Conclusion Sleep quality is an important predictor of mental health and well-being in young adults, whereas physical activity and diet are secondary but still significant factors. Although strictly correlational, these patterns suggest that future interventions could prioritize sleep quality to maximize mental health and well-being in young adults.",2020.0,70.0,51.0,"{'volume': '11', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wickham2020TheBT,\n author = {Shay-Ruby Wickham and Natasha A.

It is argued that in each domain of automaticity, researchers should specify the aspects of which consumers are presumably unaware. Three types of awareness are identified. These include awareness of (a) the environmental features that trigger an automatic process, (b) the automatic process itself, and (c) the outcome of that automatic process. Individuals may be unaware of one or more of these stages, thereby making the process nonconscious. With additional clarity regarding which aspects are nonconscious in which domains and the specific role that awareness plays, we can begin building a more comprehensive model of nonconscious processes in consumer behavior.",2005.0,20.0,256.0,"{'volume': '15', 'pages': '203-210', 'name': 'Journal of Consumer Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chartrand2005TheRO,\n author = {T.

While real- world observations of collective violence are difficult and rare, simulation models can help us to explore its evolution process. We propose an Agent-Based Emotion Contagion (ABEC) model that simulates the spread of group violence when the mechanism of contagious grievance is at work. The model is motivated by related social psychological theories of group behavior and is implemented by incorporating the epidemiological emotion contagion mechanism with crowd's game-theoretic behaviors with an agent-based approach. Our simulation model generates some crowd patterns, including local outbursts of collective violence with grievance contagion, dynamic spatial clustering of violent civilians and the nonlinear evolution of collective violence. We also explore the variations of violence evolution by varying some parameters of our model. Results show that the high-density crowds and the widespread of grievance promote violence outburst. These results suggest opportunities to curb collective violence through dispersing crowds and allaying the grievance.",2018.0,18.0,4.0,"{'pages': '193-198', 'name': '2018 IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Huang2018FromPG,\n author = {Lida Huang and Guoray Cai and Hongyong Yuan and Jianguo Chen},\n journal = {2018 IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI)},\n pages = {193-198},\n title = {From Public Gatherings to the Burst of Collective Violence: An Agent-based Emotion Contagion Model},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '1761143', 'name': 'Lida Huang'}, {'authorId': '34523959', 'name': 'Guoray Cai'}, {'authorId': '2605401', 'name': 'Hongyong Yuan'}, {'authorId': '2108311315', 'name': 'Jianguo Chen'}]"

Contrary to expectation, the effect was independent of the similarity between the report arid the estimated risk. An account of a fatal stabbing did not increase the frequency estimate of a closely related risk, homicide, more than the estimates of unrelated risks such as natural hazards. An account of a happy event that created positive affect produced a comparable global decrease in judged frequency of risks. As a society, we have never been more concerned with the assessment, the management, and the regulation of risk. Because public reaction to hazards from pesticides, nuclear power, or food additives appears to influence the regulation and management of these technologies, it is important to understand how the lay person perceives and evaluates risks. This is particularly true for hazards such as terrorism, nuclear power, or genetic engineering for which the available statistical data are very limited and where the assessments of the risks are based on subjective and intuitive judgments. Indeed, psychologists and other researchers have shown increasing interest in the manner in which people perceive and estimate the severity of various risks. Lichtenstein, Slovic, Fischhoff, Layman, and Combs (1978) asked lay people to estimate the number of deaths per year that are due to various hazards. These investigators found that the subjective estimates were consistent across several methods of elicitation and correlated reasonably well (median r = .7) with actuarial estimates of frequency.

Emotions, such as anger and happiness, affect concession-making, not only in human vs. human negotiations but also in human vs. agent negotiations. Recent research has demonstrated the impact of emotional expressions in morally-charged negotiations. Thus, taking people’s moral concerns into account is crucial for building agents that operate in morally sensitive domains. This paper explores the interplay between people’s moral concerns, emotional expressions and concession-making during a morally charged negotiation. Our results demonstrate that participants who had stronger concerns for the Individualizing foundations (Harm and Fairness) make greater concessions for sacred negotiation items when faced with a sad opponent than an angry opponent. Also, we find that participants who had high Binding foundations (In-group, Authority and Purity) are more sensitive to social status, and make greater concessions in scenarios that involve agents in a higher social status. Keywords: Emotion; Moral Foundations Theory; Sacred values; Negotiation; Agent Modeling. Introduction With the growing interest in understanding the role of emotional expressions in negotiation (e.g., Barry, Fulmer & Goates, 2006; Van Kleef et al., 2010), many studies have investigated how emotional expression affects negotiation processes and outcomes (Ames & Johar, 2009; Choi et al., 2012; de Melo et al., 2014). For instance, negotiators concede more when their opponent expresses anger instead of happiness (Van Kleef, De Dreu & Manstead, 2004a, 2004b). Sinaceur & Tiedens (2006) further reveal that the effect of anger on concession works only when anger recipients have poor alternatives. The past works on emotional expression suggest that emotion plays an important role as a signal (e.g., anger indicates a negotiator’s dissatisfaction with his opponent’s offer). Furthermore, negotiators respond to emotional expressions depending on their own conditions (e.g., alternatives). Thus, it is important to understand what moderates a negotiator’s reaction to emotional expression. Past studies have shown that positive moods in negotiation foster concession-making (e.g., Carnevale & Isen, 1986). Mood effects may be mediated by expression of positive emotion, for example, a positive-mood induction procedure may lead negotiators to smile more and this smiling may have an impact on perceptions and concession- making. Regardless, the possible interaction of emotion and other variables, for example, cognition as in decision frame (Carnevale, 2008), or motivation as in moral concerns, is a domain highly worthy of inquiry. Although some studies have tried to understand how people’s innate personality interacts with their emotion during negotiation games (Bolton, Katok, & Zwick, 1998; Batson & Moran, 1999), little research has paid attention to how moral concerns impact reactions to emotional expressions and affect concession-making. Our recent research demonstrates that emotional expressions can potentially shift moral concerns during a negotiation, such that displays of anger would backfire if the negotiator associates moral significance to the objects of the negotiation, whereas displays of sadness promote higher concession-making (Dehghani, Gratch and Carnevale, 2012). Because morality significantly influences decision- making (e.g., Sjoberg & Winroth, 1986; Gintis et al., 2003), the present research aims to examine the role of people’s moral concerns on how they react to emotional expressions and make concessions. Adapting the Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt & Graham, 2007; Haidt & Joseph, 2007; Graham, 2013), we examine effects of two different types of foundations (i.e., Individualizing foundations and Binding foundations) on concession-making. We predict that people who have stronger Individualizing foundations would react more to emotional expressions because the Individualizing foundations indicate the tendency to care about other people’s emotions (whether others are emotionally or physically suffering, or being treated fairly) and therefore, that would effect their concession-making. On the other hand, we predict that people with stronger Binding foundations be more sensitive to their negotiation partner’s social status because Binding foundations indicate concern about other people’s roles in the group (whether negotiation partner is their boss or co-worker). Understanding the interaction between moral concerns and emotion are crucial in designing autonomous decision- making agents that operate in morally sensitive domains. Progress in agent research has enabled us to work closely with software agents in morally sensitive situations where agents’ actions may lead to significant results, such as loss of life (Tambe, 2011; Dehghani et al., 2013). Therefore, it is important to better understand the interactions between people’s moral concerns, emotion and agent decision- making strategies. Our results suggest that incorporating",2014.0,26.0,4.0,"{'volume': '36', 'name': 'Cognitive Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kim2014EffectsOM,\n author = {Eunkyung Kim and Morteza Dehghani and Y.

Despite its significance, the neural basis remains elusive. To investigate the neural correlates of joint attention, we developed a novel, interactive research paradigm in which participants' gaze behavior—as measured by an eye tracking device—was used to contingently control the gaze of a computer-animated character. Instructed that the character on screen was controlled by a real person outside the scanner, 21 participants interacted with the virtual other while undergoing fMRI. Experimental variations focused on leading versus following the gaze of the character when fixating one of three objects also shown on the screen. In concordance with our hypotheses, results demonstrate, firstly, that following someone else's gaze to engage in joint attention resulted in activation of anterior portion of medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) known to be involved in the supramodal coordination of perceptual and cognitive processes. Secondly, directing someone else's gaze toward an object activated the ventral striatum which—in light of ratings obtained from participants—appears to underlie the hedonic aspects of sharing attention. The data, therefore, support the idea that other-initiated joint attention relies upon recruitment of MPFC previously related to the “meeting of minds.” In contrast, self-initiated joint attention leads to a differential increase of neural activity in reward-related brain areas, which might contribute to the uniquely human motivation to engage in the sharing of experiences.",2010.0,58.0,368.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '2702-2715', 'name': 'Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Schilbach2010MindsMF,\n author = {L.

2756,da76d35771621e00a9dad43cb885862eb0f1af86,Conscious versus unconscious learning of structure,"The ways we come to learn about the structure of complex environments is intimately linked to the conscious-unconscious distinction. Indeed, Reber (1967, 1989) argued that we could acquire unconscious knowledge of some structures we could not readily consciously learn about because of their complexity. Some authors agree there are two modes of learning distinguished by their conscious versus unconscious phenomenology (e.g. Scott & Dienes, 2010a). Others at least agree there are striking di¤erences in phenomenology in di¤erent learning situations. For example, Shanks (2005), who does not accept there is such thing as unconscious knowledge, nonetheless notes that when he himself performed a standard implicit learning task that he found that ‘‘trying to articulate my knowledge, even only moments after performing the task, seem[ed] to require a Herculean e¤ort of mental will that yield[ed] only the sketchiest useful information. (p. 211)’’ By contrast, in yet other learning situations, knowledge can be readily described as it is being applied. The everyday example of natural language makes the contrast between these phenomenologies stark. We all learnt the main grammatical constructions of our native language by about age five without even consciously knowing there was a grammar to be learnt. And as adults we still cannot describe all the rules we spontaneously use. Yet when we learn a second language as an adult we may spend considerable time memorising rules of grammar. The two methods of learning feel very di¤erent and produce di¤erent results. By suitably defining conscious versus unconscious we can describe the di¤erence in phenomenologies. And that di¤erence may well be a marker of di¤erent mechanisms of learning. Indeed, the di¤erence in phenomenology is so striking that the distinction was constantly reinvented before it became part of an established literature, despite behaviouristic tendencies in psychologists to avoid the conscious versus unconscious terms (e.g. Broadbent, 1977; Hull, 1920; Lewicki, 1986; Phelan, 1965; Reber, 1967; Rommetveit, 1960; Smoke, 1932). Thus, the starting point for a definition of conscious versus unconscious should be one that picks out the real life examples that motivate the distinction, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40",2012.0,69.0,62.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Dienes2012ConsciousVU,\n author = {Z.

The proposed model of empathy was implemented into an affective agent architecture. To evaluate the implementation a small scenario was defined and we asked a group of users to visualize it with the empathy model and another group to visualize it without the model.

This study compares how abusive behaviour towards a human is perceived differently in comparison with identical behaviour towards a robot. We showed participants 16 video clips of unparalleled quality that depicted different levels of violence and abuse. For each video, we asked participants to rate the moral acceptability of the action, the violence depicted, the intention to harm, and how abusive the action was. The results indicate no significant difference in the perceived morality of the actions shown in the videos across the two victim agents. When the agents started to fight back, their reactive aggressive behaviour was rated differently. Humans fighting back were seen as less immoral compared with robots fighting back. A mediation analysis showed that this was predominately due to participants perceiving the robot’s response as more abusive than the human’s response.",2020.0,61.0,19.0,"{'volume': '11', 'pages': '271 - 283', 'name': 'Paladyn, Journal of Behavioral Robotics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bartneck2020TheMO,\n author = {C.

The findings, which were cross-validated in two samples, suggest that agreement is a function of four factors: which Big Five content domain the trait represents, how observable relevant behaviors are, how evaluative the trait is, and whether the self is one of the judges. Agreement was highest for traits related to Extraversion and lowest for traits related to Agreeableness. More observable and less evaluative traits elicited higher interjudge agreement. On average, self-peer agreement was lower than peer-peer agreement. However, this effect was limited to evaluative traits; for neutral traits, self-peer agreement was as high as peer-peer agreement.

The findings from a laboratory experiment indicate that using humanoid embodiment and human voice-based communication significantly influences users' perceptions of social presence, which in turn enhances users' trusting beliefs, perceptions of enjoyment, and ultimately, their intentions to use the agent as a decision aid.

2770,dbbed0642db695dfc983683269f11b6a0e174653,Processing Information About Covariations That Cannot Be Articulated,"Processing of covariation (among features) present in stimulus material was investigated. Subjects were unable to articulate the manipulated covariation between verbally described psychological characteristics and appearance of a set of stimulus persons. Based on the two-stage question answering model (Glucksberg & McCloskey, 1981), it was hypothesized that if the information related to the manipulated covariation was processed and registered, it would result in an increase of processing time for the questions that might be considered relevant to the covariation. The pattern of response latencies obtained in each of 3 experiments conformed exactly to the predictions. In 2 of these experiments, effects of the stimulus material on subjects' subsequent judgments were found, consistent with the model. Subjects behaved as if they had ""learned"" the rule (implied by the covariation) and followed it in their subsequent judgments. The demonstrated phenomenon pertains to an important and presumably ubiquitous aspect of processing categorical information. Research on ""implicit learning"" suggests that people can process information about complex relations between elements of stimulus material without being able to articulate these relations. In a series of studies, Reber and his colleagues demonstrated that after being exposed to a number of items (strings of letters) generated by a set of specific rules (a ""grammar"" that specifies permissible orders of letters), people are able to use these rules (or information related somehow to these rules) in their subsequent judgments pertaining to whether novel items obey these rules, although the perceivers are not able to articulate the rules they use (Reber, 1967, 1976; Reber & Allen, 1978; Reber & Lewis, 1977). Reber concluded that such implicit and unconscious' learning is a natural product of attending to structured stimuli. Although the specific mechanism of implicit learning is far from being clear, these results indicate that people are able to process information about certain rules contained implicitly in stimulus material and to use these rules (or information related somehow to these rules) in their subsequent perceptions, and still be unable to articulate the rules (see also Brooks, 1978; Gordon & Holyoak, 1983). The research on implicit learning raises the question as to what kind of formal aspect or ""hidden"" structure contained in stimulus material is subject to such processing without a perceiver's being able to articulate what in particular is being processed. Recent research by Lewicki (1982, in press) suggests that one of these formal aspects might be the covariation among events",1986.0,32.0,241.0,"{'volume': '12', 'pages': '135-146', 'name': 'Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory and Cognition'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lewicki1986ProcessingIA,\n author = {P.

As a result, some people are too busy to communicate with their families. In this paper, we propose an Augmented Reality (AR) system using smartphone. The system allows us to leave emotional notes in the real environment using Virtual-Agent. The crucial part of the system focuses on the emotional short voice message exchange with the Virtual-Agents. Spatial note system is based on two parts, one is the virtual agent services and the other is the AR system. The virtual agent services allow users to make a voice message by recording user’s voice. Then, a Virtual-Agent with the appropriate facial expression is generated. User can also change the facial expressions as he likes. There are 4 emotions of the virtual agents: happy, sorrow, angry and calm. Each emotion has 4 levels to express. The AR system will detect planes from the smartphone view of the real world.

Although the same emotional intensity was added to both trustworthy and untrustworthy faces, trustworthy faces who expressed happiness were perceived as happier than untrustworthy faces, and untrustworthy faces who expressed anger were perceived as angrier than trustworthy faces. The authors also manipulated changes in face trustworthiness simultaneously with the change in expression. Whereas transitions in face trustworthiness in the direction of the expressed emotion (e.g., high-to-low trustworthiness and anger) increased the perceived intensity of the emotion, transitions in the opposite direction decreased this intensity. For example, changes from high to low trustworthiness increased the intensity of perceived anger but decreased the intensity of perceived happiness. These findings support the hypothesis that changes along the trustworthiness dimension correspond to subtle changes resembling expressions signaling whether the person displaying the emotion should be avoided or approached.",2009.0,28.0,286.0,"{'volume': '9 1', 'pages': '\n          128-33\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Oosterhof2009SharedPB,\n author = {N.

We analyze the contractive nature of the related operator under both off-policy policy evaluation and control settings and derive online sample-based algorithms. We believe this is the first return-based off-policy control algorithm converging a.s. to $Q^*$ without the GLIE assumption (Greedy in the Limit with Infinite Exploration).

The aim of the present study was to investigate how gender differences are related to different exposure times, representing information processing levels from subliminal (spontaneous) to supraliminal (emotionally regulated). Further, the study aimed at exploring correlations between verbally reported emotional contagion and facial responses for men and women. Masked pictures of angry, happy and sad facial expressions were presented to 102 participants (51 men) at exposure times from subliminal (23 ms) to clearly supraliminal (2500 ms). Myoelectric activity (EMG) from the corrugator and the zygomaticus was measured and the participants reported their hedonic tone (verbally reported emotional contagion) after stimulus exposures. The results showed an effect of exposure time on gender differences in facial responses as well as in verbally reported emotional contagion. Women amplified imitative responses towards happy vs. angry faces and verbally reported emotional contagion with prolonged exposure times, whereas men did not. No gender differences were detected at the subliminal or borderliminal exposure times, but at the supraliminal exposure gender differences were found in imitation as well as in verbally reported emotional contagion. Women showed correspondence between their facial responses and their verbally reported emotional contagion to a greater extent than men. The results were interpreted in terms of gender differences in emotion regulation, rather than as differences in biologically prepared emotional reactivity.",2008.0,50.0,107.0,"{'volume': '49 2', 'pages': '\n          111-22\n        ', 'name': 'Scandinavian journal of psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sonnby-Borgström2008GenderDI,\n author = {M.

2779,dce8146987557735a19771aefa1f027211a2c275,Statistical mechanics of complex networks,"The emergence of order in natural systems is a constant source of inspiration for both physical and biological sciences. While the spatial order characterizing for example the crystals has been the basis of many advances in contemporary physics, most complex systems in nature do not offer such high degree of order. Many of these systems form complex networks whose nodes are the elements of the system and edges represent the interactions between them. 
Traditionally complex networks have been described by the random graph theory founded in 1959 by Paul Erdohs and Alfred Renyi. One of the defining features of random graphs is that they are statistically homogeneous, and their degree distribution (characterizing the spread in the number of edges starting from a node) is a Poisson distribution. In contrast, recent empirical studies, including the work of our group, indicate that the topology of real networks is much richer than that of random graphs. In particular, the degree distribution of real networks is a power-law, indicating a heterogeneous topology in which the majority of the nodes have a small degree, but there is a significant fraction of highly connected nodes that play an important role in the connectivity of the network. 
The scale-free topology of real networks has very important consequences on their functioning. For example, we have discovered that scale-free networks are extremely resilient to the random disruption of their nodes. On the other hand, the selective removal of the nodes with highest degree induces a rapid breakdown of the network to isolated subparts that cannot communicate with each other. 
The non-trivial scaling of the degree distribution of real networks is also an indication of their assembly and evolution. Indeed, our modeling studies have shown us that there are general principles governing the evolution of networks. Most networks start from a small seed and grow by the addition of new nodes which attach to the nodes already in the system. This process obeys preferential attachment: the new nodes are more likely to connect to nodes with already high degree. We have proposed a simple model based on these two principles wich was able to reproduce the power-law degree distribution of real networks. Perhaps even more importantly, this model paved the way to a new paradigm of network modeling, trying to capture the evolution of networks, not just their static topology.",2001.0,237.0,18668.0,"{'volume': 'cond-mat/0106096', 'name': 'ArXiv'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Albert2001StatisticalMO,\n author = {R.

2782,dd764843b49056f7eb6d9c3b6de632e91552bfbd,Facial expressions: What the mirror neuron system can and cannot tell us,"Abstract Facial expressions contain both motor and emotional components. The inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and posterior parietal cortex have been considered to compose a mirror neuron system (MNS) for the motor components of facial expressions, while the amygdala and insula may represent an “additional” MNS for emotional states. Together, these systems may contribute to our understanding of facial expressions. Here we further examine this possibility. In three separate event-related fMRI experiment, subjects had to (1) observe (2) discriminate and (3) imitate facial expressions. Stimuli were dynamic neutral, happy, fearful and disgusted facial expressions, and in Experiments 1 and 2, an additional pattern motion condition. Importantly, during each experiment, subjects were unaware of the nature of the next experiments. Results demonstrate that even passive viewing of facial expressions activates a wide network of brain regions that were also involved in the execution of similar expressions, including the IFG/insula and the posterior parietal cortex. Only a subset of these regions responded more during the observation of facial than pattern motion (bilateral ventral IFG, bilateral STS/MTG, bilateral amygdala, SMA). While the viewing of facial expressions recruited similar brain regions in all three experiments, adding an active task (discrimination, imitation) augmented the magnitude of these activations. Brain activations reflected differences in observed facial expressions, with emotional expressions activating relatively more the insula/frontal operculum, and neutral ones (blowing up the cheeks) the somatosensory cortices (SII). Using movies, fear activated the amygdala and disgust the insula, but other emotions activated these structures to a similar degree.",2007.0,93.0,272.0,"{'volume': '2', 'pages': '179 - 222', 'name': 'Social Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gaag2007FacialEW,\n author = {Christiaan van der Gaag and R.

Conversational agents may offer a convenient, engaging way of getting support at any time. Objective The objective of the study was to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a fully automated conversational agent to deliver a self-help program for college students who self-identify as having symptoms of anxiety and depression. Methods In an unblinded trial, 70 individuals age 18-28 years were recruited online from a university community social media site and were randomized to receive either 2 weeks (up to 20 sessions) of self-help content derived from CBT principles in a conversational format with a text-based conversational agent (Woebot) (n=34) or were directed to the National Institute of Mental Health ebook, “Depression in College Students,” as an information-only control group (n=36). All participants completed Web-based versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale at baseline and 2-3 weeks later (T2). Results Participants were on average 22.2 years old (SD 2.33), 67% female (47/70), mostly non-Hispanic (93%, 54/58), and Caucasian (79%, 46/58). Participants in the Woebot group engaged with the conversational agent an average of 12.14 (SD 2.23) times over the study period. No significant differences existed between the groups at baseline, and 83% (58/70) of participants provided data at T2 (17% attrition). Intent-to-treat univariate analysis of covariance revealed a significant group difference on depression such that those in the Woebot group significantly reduced their symptoms of depression over the study period as measured by the PHQ-9 (F=6.47; P=.01) while those in the information control group did not. In an analysis of completers, participants in both groups significantly reduced anxiety as measured by the GAD-7 (F1,54= 9.24; P=.004). Participants’ comments suggest that process factors were more influential on their acceptability of the program than content factors mirroring traditional therapy.

Results strongly supported the convergent validity of pleasure-displeasure and degree of arousal, but were equivocal on additional dimensions. Separate multidimensional scalings of pleasant, intermediate, and unpleasant affect terms (a) confirmed the presence of an arousal dimension at each level of pleasure and (b) obtained three additional dimensions: control/potency/dominance, depth of experience, and locus of causation.

2787,dde037402363fde92e5f61c3c1d7f25620e1ef3d,Learning Science in Immersive Virtual Reality,"The goals of the study were (a) to compare the instructional effectiveness of immersive virtual reality (VR) versus a desktop slideshow as media for teaching scientific knowledge, and (b) to examine the efficacy of adding a generative learning strategy to a VR lesson. In Experiment 1, college students viewed a biology lesson about how the human body works either in immersive VR or via a self-directed PowerPoint slideshow on a desktop computer. Based on interest theory, it was predicted that students who learned in immersive VR would report more positive ratings of interest and motivation and would score higher on a posttest covering material in the lesson. In contrast, based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning, it was predicted that students who learned with a well-designed slideshow would score higher on a posttest, although they might not report higher levels of interest and motivation. The results showed that students who viewed the slideshow performed significantly better on the posttest than the VR group, but reported lower motivation, interest, and engagement ratings. In Experiment 2, students either viewed a segmented VR lesson and produced a written summary after each segment or viewed the original, continuous VR lesson as in Experiment 1. Students who summarized the lesson after each segment performed significantly better on the posttest and the groups did not differ on reported interest, engagement, and motivation. These results support the cognitive theory of multimedia learning and demonstrate the value of generative learning strategies in immersive VR environments.",2018.0,88.0,440.0,"{'volume': '110', 'pages': '785–797', 'name': 'Journal of Educational Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Parong2018LearningSI,\n author = {Jocelyn Parong and R.

The Roles of Contingency and Similarity in Pro-Social Effects of Imitation","Being imitated has a wide range of pro-social effects, but it is not clear how these effects are mediated. Naturalistic studies of the effects of being imitated have not established whether pro-social outcomes are due to the similarity and/or the contingency between the movements performed by the actor and those of the imitator. Similarity is often assumed to be the active ingredient, but we hypothesized that contingency might also be important, as it produces positive affect in infants and can be detected by phylogenetically ancient mechanisms of associative learning. We manipulated similarity and contingency between performed and observed actions in a computerized task. Similarity had no positive effects; however, contingency resulted in greater enjoyment of the task, reported closeness to others, and helping behavior. These results suggest that the pro-social effects of being imitated may rely on associative mechanisms.",2013.0,32.0,51.0,"{'volume': '37 8', 'pages': '\n          1541-52\n        ', 'name': 'Cognitive science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Catmur2013IsIW,\n author = {C.

The variability in personality states may be the reaction to specific characteristics of situations. The aim of our study is to investigate whether specific situational factors, that is, different configurations of face-to-face interactions, are predictors of variability of personality states in a work environment. The obtained results provide evidence that within-person variability in personality is associated with variation in face-to-face interactions. Interestingly, the effects differ by type and level of the personality states: adaptation effects for Agreeableness and Emotional Stability, whereby the personality states of an individual trigger similar states in other people interacting with them and complementarity effects for Openness to Experience, whereby the personality states of an individual trigger opposite states in other people interacting with them.

With newspapers going online and television becoming increasingly digital, the current generation of youth has little reason to consume analog media. Music, movies, and all other forms of mass-mediated content can be obtained via a wide array of digital devices, ranging from CDs to DVDs, from iPods to PDAs. Even their nonmedia experiences are often characterized by a reliance on digital devices. Most young people communicate with most of their acquaintances through cell phones and computer-mediated communication tools such as instant messengers and e-mail systems. 1 And, with the arrival of personal broadcasting technologies such as blogs and social networking sites, many youngsters experience the world through their own self-expression and the expressions of their peers. This serves to blur the traditional boundary between interpersonal and mass communication, leading to an idiosyncratic construction of one's media world. Customization in the digital age—be it in the form of Web sites such as cus-tomizable portals that allow users to shape content or devices such as iPods that allow for customized playlists—enables the user to serve as the gatekeeper of content. As media get highly interactive, multimodal, and navigable, the receiver tends to become the source of communication. 2 While this leads naturally to egocentric construals of one's information environment, it also raises questions about the veracity of all the material that is consumed. The ease of digital publishing has made authors out of us all, leading to a dramatic profusion of information available for personal as well as public consumption. Much of this information, however, is free-floating and does not follow any universally accepted gatekeeping standards, let alone a professional process of writing and editing. Therefore, the veridicality of information accessed on the Web and other digital media is often suspect. 3 This makes credibility a supremely key concern in the new media environment, necessitating the constant need to critically assess information while consuming it. Credibility is classically ascertained by considering the source of information. If the attributed source of a piece of information is a credible person or organization, then, according to conventional wisdom, that information is probably reliable. However, in Internet-based media, source is a murky entity because there are often multiple layers of sources in online transmission of information (e.g., e-mail from a friend giving you a piece of information that he or she found on a newsgroup, posted …",2007.0,107.0,943.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Sundar2007TheMM,\n author = {S.

To address this question, I draw on research on the interpersonal effects of emotions on behavior in personal relationships, parent–child interactions, conflict, negotiation, and leadership, and propose a new framework that can account for existing findings and guide future research: the emotions as social information (EASI) model. I demonstrate that emotional expressions affect observers' behavior by triggering inferential processes and/or affective reactions in them. The predictive strength of these two processes—which may inspire different behaviors—depends on the observer's information processing and on social-relational factors. Examples of moderators that determine the relative predictive strength of inferences and affective reactions include power, need for cognitive closure, time pressure, display rules, and the appropriateness and target of the emotional expression, which are all discussed.",2009.0,26.0,992.0,"{'volume': '18', 'pages': '184 - 188', 'name': 'Current Directions in Psychological Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kleef2009HowER,\n author = {Gerben A. van Kleef},\n journal = {Current Directions in Psychological Science},\n pages = {184 - 188},\n title = {How Emotions Regulate Social Life},\n volume = {18},\n year = {2009}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '5980688', 'name': 'Gerben A. van Kleef'}]"

We hypothesize that individuals do not mimic facial expressions that can be perceived as offensive, such as disgust, and mimic positive emotion displays, but only when the context is affiliative (i.e., with intimates). Second, we expect that in spontaneous interactions not mimicry, but empathic feelings with the other predict the accurateness of emotion recognition. Data were collected in a pseudo-experimental setting, during an event organized for subscribers of a large Dutch women’s magazine. One woman (expresser) was exposed to two emotional stimuli (i.e., a vile smell, a compliment) in order to evoke disgust and pride respectively. Another woman (observer: intimate or stranger) was sitting opposite of her. We collected self-report measures on emotions and empathy, and coded facial expressions of disgust and smiling on the basis of FACS. The results show that participants do not mimic disgust. In contrast, smiles displayed after the vile smell and the compliment were mimicked, but only among intimates. We also found that self-reported empathy and not mimicry is related to the recognition of disgust.

Emotions are conveyed by many and varied factors, from very low-level cues, such as the colors of the stimulus, to high-level aspects, such as the semantics of the scene. One of the main challenges is the fact that even though some of these factors are known by neuro-scientists, computer scientists or artists, many of the stimulus features that play a role in eliciting emotion probably remain unknown. The recent success of deep learning methods, which are able to automatically learn relevant stimuli representations, seems to set a promising path to follow.

Despite the prevalence of robots with rendered faces, there are no systematic explorations of this design space. Our work aims to fill that gap. We conducted a survey and identified 157 robots with rendered faces and coded them in terms of 76 properties. We present statistics, common patterns, and observations about this data set of faces. Next, we conducted two surveys to understand people’s perceptions of rendered robot faces and identify the impact of different face features.

Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers.

In this study, eye-tracking was used to monitor scanning behavior of healthy participants while looking at different facial expressions. Locations of fixations and their durations were recorded, and a dominance ratio (i.e., eyes and mouth relative to the rest of the face) was calculated. Across all emotional expressions, initial fixations were most frequently directed to either the eyes or the mouth. Especially in sad facial expressions, participants more frequently issued the initial fixation to the eyes compared with all other expressions. In happy facial expressions, participants fixated the mouth region for a longer time across all trials. For fearful and neutral facial expressions, the dominance ratio indicated that both the eyes and mouth are equally important. However, in sad and angry facial expressions, the eyes received more attention than the mouth. These results confirm the relevance of the eyes and mouth in emotional decoding, but they also demonstrate that not all facial expressions with different emotional content are decoded equally.

Furthermore, we found distinct effects of touch on event-related potentials evoked by (a) feedback regarding accepted and rejected offers, (b) decision cues related to proposals, and (c) the haptic and auditory cues themselves. In each case, a late positive effect of touch was observed and related to the P3.

2806,df619024edc7c1cd297e7cc3a88858336332a758,Agent-Based Distributed Learning Applied to Fraud Detection,"Inductive learning and classification techniques have been applied in many problems in diverse areas. In this paper we describe an AI-based approach that combines inductive learning algorithms and meta-learning methods as a means to compute accurate classification models for detecting electronic fraud. Inductive learning algorithms are used to compute detectors of anomalous or errant behavior over inherently distributed data sets and meta-learning methods integrate their collective knowledge into higher level classification models or meta-classifiers. By supporting the exchange of models or classifier agents among data sites, our approach facilitates the cooperation between financial organizations and provides unified and cross-institution protection mechanisms against fraudulent transactions. Through experiments performed on actual credit card transaction data supplied by two different financial institutions, we evaluate this approach and we demonstrate its utility. Introduction Agent-based learning systems have attracted considerable attention recently. One such system, JAM (Java Agents for Meta-learning) (Stolfo et al. 1997), provides the means of dispatching and executing learning agents at remote database sites, with each learning agent being a Java encapsulated machine learning program. One of JAM ’s key features is meta-learning, a general technique that combines multiple classification models, each of which may have been computed over distributed sites. In this paper, we describe the application of JAM in fraud and intrusion detection in network-based information systems by detailing a comprehensive set of experiments in the real-world application of credit card fraud. Several key new teachniques are reported that address the issues of pruning combined meta-classifiers in order to improve efficiency while maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, experiments are reported on combining classifiers computed over distributed databases with different schemas. We begin with a brief overview of the fraud detection application to highlight the advantages of JAM in distributed learning. Fraud detection A secured and trusted interbanking network for electronic commerce requires high speed verification and authentication mechanisms that allow legitimate users easy access to conduct their business, while thwarting fraudulent transaction attempts by others. Fraudulent electronic transactions are a significant problem, one that grows in importance as the number of access points increase and more services are provided. The traditional way to defend financial information system has been to protect the routers and network infrastructure. Furthermore, to intercept intrusions and fraudulent transactions that inevitably leak through, financial institutions have developed custom fraud detection systems targeted to their own asset bases. Recently however, banks have come to realize that a unified, global approach that involves the periodic sharing of information regarding fraudulent practices is required. In this paper, we describe an AI-based approach that supports the cooperation among different institutions and consists of pattern-directed inference systems that use models of anomalous or errant transaction behaviors to forewarn of fraudulent practices. This approach requires the analysis of large and inherently distributed databases of information about transaction behaviors to produce models of “probably fraudulent” transactions. The key difficulties in this approach are: financial companies don’t share their data for a number of (competitive and legal) reasons; the databases that companies maintain on transaction behavior are huge and growing rapidly; real-time analysis is highly desirable to update models when new events are detected and easy distribution of models in a networked environment is essential to maintain up to date detection capability. To address these difficulties and thereby protect against electronic fraud our approach has two key component technologies: local fraud detection agents that learn how to detect fraud within a single information system, and an integrated meta-learning mechanism that combines the collective knowledge acquired by the An alternative approach to modeling transactions would be to model user behavior. An application of this method, but in cellular phone fraud detection has been examined in (Fawcett & Provost 1997). individual local agents. The fraud detection agents consist of classification models computed by machine learning programs at one or more sites, while meta-learning provides the means to combining a number of separately learned classifiers. Thus, meta-learning allows financial institutions to share their models of fraudulent transactions without disclosing their proprietary data. This way their competitive and legal restrictions can be met, but they can still share information. Furthermore, by supporting the training of classifiers over distributed databases, meta-learning can substantially reduce the total learning time (parallel learning of classifiers over (smaller) subsets of data). The final meta-classifiers (the combined ensemble of fraud detectors) can be used as sentries forewarning of possible fraud by inspecting and classifying each incoming transaction. This paper presents a comprehensive set of experiments evaluating the applicability of our approach in the security of financial information systems. As a test set we use a data set of credit card transactions supplied by two different financial institutions. The task is to compute classification models that accurately discern fraudulent credit card transactions. Our experiments are structured as follows. First we apply several machine learning algorithms on different subsets of data from both banks to establish the potential of inductive learning methods in fraud detection. Then, we overview meta-learning and evaluate its utility by combining the fraud detectors of each bank. In the last part of the paper, we describe the exchange of classifiers between the two banks and provide empirical results for assessing the validity and merit of this approach. By way of summary, we find that pattern-directed inference systems coupled with meta-learning methods constitute a protective shield against fraud with the potential to exceed the performance of existing fraud detection techniques. Computing fraud detectors Machine Learning In this study we employ five different inductive learning programs, Bayes, C4.5, ID3, CART and Ripper. Bayes, implements a naive Bayesian learning algorithm described in (Minksy & Papert 1969), ID3 (Quinlan 1986), its successor C4.5 (Quinlan 1993), and CART (Breiman et al. 1984) are decision tree based algorithms, and Ripper (Cohen 1995) is a rule induction algorithm. Data sets We obtained two large databases from Chase and First Union banks, each with 500,000 records of credit card transaction data spanning one year (Oct.95-Sept.96). Chase bank data consisted, on average, of 42,000 sampled credit card transactions records per month with a 20% fraud and 80% legitimate distribution, whereas First Union data were sampled in a non-uniform (many records from some months, very few from others, very skewed fraud distributions for some months) manner with a total of 15% versus 85% distribution. The schemas of the databases was developed over years of experience and continuous analysis by bank personnel to capture important information for fraud detection. The records have a fixed length of 137 bytes each and about 30 numeric and categorical attributes including the binary class label (fraud/legitimate transaction). Under the terms of the non-disclosure agreement, we can not reveal the details of the schema beyond the following general description: • A (jumbled) account number (no real identifiers) • Scores produced by a COTS authorization/detection system • Date/Time of transaction • Past payment information of the transactor • Amount of transaction • Geographic information: where the transaction was initiated, the location of the merchant and transactor • Codes for validity and manner of entry of the transaction • An industry standard code for the type of merchant • A code for other recent “non-monetary” transaction types by transactor • The age of the account and the card • Other card/account information • Confidential/Proprietary Fields (other potential indicators)",1999.0,14.0,49.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Prodromidis1999AgentBasedDL,\n author = {A.

From a biological perspective, this idea is manifested in the belief that there might be neurophysiological and anatomical substrates corresponding to the basic emotions. From a psychological perspective, basic emotions are often held to be the primitive building blocks of other, nonbasic emotions. The content of such claims is examined, and the results suggest that there is no coherent nontrivial notion of basic emotions as the elementary psychological primitives in terms of which other emotions can be explained. Thus, the view that there exist basic emotions out of which all other emotions are built, and in terms of which they can be explained, is questioned, raising the possibility that this position is an article of faith rather than an empirically or theoretically defensible basis for the conduct of emotion research. This suggests that perhaps the notion of basic emotions will not lead to significant progress in the field.

Perhaps triggered by the success of computer games, VEs are seen as an emergent and engaging new way by which children can learn experimental sciences and other disciplines. Inhabiting these IVEs can be agents or intelligent characters that are responsible for events that happen in the environment and make it not predictive or completely controlled. However, to build such environments, in particular, if populated by synthetic characters, one needs to carefully address the problem of how do the learners respond to the characters in the virtual environment. Do learners like the characters? Do learners identify themselves with characters in virtual environments? This relation between learners and characters in virtual environments can be studied in several perspectives. In this paper, we will focus primarily on the issue of empathy as one desirable aspect of the affective interaction between learners and synthetic characters. In particular, we will defend that in order for such affective relations to happen, characters should be created and designed taking into account what we call the proximity factor. This is based on the fact that children are found to respond more empathically to those that are perceived as similar to the self than those who are perceived as dissimilar (Barnett 1987). This appears to be the case when similarity is defined in terms of a shared characteristic, such as sex (Bryant 1982), race or in terms of shared personal experiences (Bryant 1982). Thus, designing characters aiming at pedagogical empathic interactions, we should carefully address how close the learner will feel with the synthetic characters developed in terms of situation, behavior or even physical appearance. In order to illustrate this factor in eliciting emotional reactions to synthetic characters, we will present a specific system called FearNot!. FearNot! was developed to address the difficult and often devastating problem of bullying in schools. By using role-playing and synthetic characters in a 3D environment, FearNot! allows children from age 8 to 12 to experience a virtual scenario where they can witness (in a third-person perspective) bullying situations. To build empathy into FearNot, we have considered the following components: agent's architecture, the characters' embodiment, the environment itself, and emotionally charged situations. All these elements were built to allow for a stronger proximity with the user and the system. In this paper, we will focus primarily on this problem and report some results achieved in the evaluation executed with 127 children and 95 adults on the system.",2005.0,33.0,188.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '235 - 266', 'name': 'Applied Artificial Intelligence'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Paiva2005LEARNINGBF,\n author = {Ana Paiva and João Dias and Daniel Sobral and R.

Humans use a range of different cues to communicate to others how they feel, including facial, vocal, and gestural signals. Although much is known about facial expressions of emotion, less research has focused on affect in the voice. We compare British listeners to individuals from remote Namibian villages who have had no exposure to Western culture, and examine recognition of non-verbal emotional vocalizations, such as screams and laughs. We show that a number of emotions can be universally recognized from non-verbal vocal signals. In addition we demonstrate the specificity of this pattern, with a set of additional emotions only recognized within, but not across these cultural groups. Our findings indicate that a small set of primarily negative emotions have evolved signals across several modalities, while most positive emotions are communicated with culture-specific signals. Keywords: emotion; voice; happiness; affective signals. Background Some human traits are shared by all human beings, despite differences in language, culture and ecology. These psychological universals tell us what features of the human mind are part of our shared biological heritage and which are products of culture and language. Because all humans share the vast majority of their genetic makeup with all other humans, there is great similarity in the physical features that are typical for our species, while minor characteristics vary between individuals. Similarly to physical features, many aspects of the human psychology are shared. For example, all human societies have complex systems of communication to convey their thoughts, feelings, and intentions to those around them (Hauser, Chomsky & Fitch, 2002). But although there are some commonalities between different communicative systems, speakers of different languages cannot understand each other. Or rather, they cannot understand either other’s words and sentences. Other aspects of communicative systems do not rely on common lexical codes and may be shared across linguistic and cultural borders. One candidate of communicative systems for constituting a psychological universal is emotional signals. Humans use a range of signals to communicate emotions, including vocalizations, facial expressions, and postural cues. Auditory signals allows for affective communication when the recipient cannot see the sender, for example, across a distance or at night. In addition, young infants are sensitive to vocal cues from the very beginning of life, when their visual system is still relatively immature (Mehler, Bertoncini & Barrier, Vocal signals of emotions can occur overlaid on speech in the form of affective prosody (Scherer, Banse & Wallbott, 2001). However, humans also make use of a range of non- verbal vocalizations to communicate how they feel, such as screams and laughs. In this study we investigate whether these kinds of non-verbal emotional vocalizations communicate the same affective states regardless of the listener’s culture. Currently, the only available cross-cultural data comes from studies of emotional prosody in speech (e.g., Scherer et al., 2001). This work has indicated that listeners can infer some affective states from emotionally inflected speech across cultural boundaries. However, emotional information overlaid on speech (or nonsense-speech) is restricted by the segmental and supra-segmental structure of speech. In contrast, non-",2009.0,25.0,10.0,"{'volume': '31', 'pages': '2251-2255', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Sauter2009UniversalVS,\n author = {D. Sauter and Frank Eisner and P. Ekman and S.

The quality of the resulting motions heavily depends on this component, which has significantly improved in the past few years. Recent advances have been in particular due to the introduction of a short-horizon motion prediction strategy that enables anticipated motion adaptation during local interactions among agents. However, the simplicity of prediction techniques of existing models somewhat limits their domain of validity. In this paper, our key objective is to significantly improve the quality of simulations by expanding the applicable range of motion predictions. To this end, we present a novel local interaction algorithm with a new context-aware, probabilistic motion prediction model. By context-aware, we mean that this approach allows crowd simulators to account for many factors, such as the influence of environment layouts or in-progress interactions among agents, and has the ability to simultaneously maintain several possible alternate scenarios for future motions and to cope with uncertainties on sensing and other agent's motions. Technically, this model introduces ""collision probability fields"" between agents, efficiently computed through the cumulative application of Warp Operators on a source Intrinsic Field. We demonstrate how this model significantly improves the quality of simulated motions in challenging scenarios, such as dense crowds and complex environments.",2016.0,38.0,45.0,"{'volume': '35', 'pages': '164:1-164:11', 'name': 'ACM Trans.

ForumMiner uses a text mining system to extract graphs from texts that are given to students as a basis for their discussion. These graphs contain the most relevant terms found in the texts, as well as the relationships between them. By comparing these graphs with the students’ writings, and using other information such as number and structure of posts, the tool is able to assess the relevance of each student’s contributions. A group of 18 teachers was consulted about the most important aspects to be considered in the analysis of posts, and the tool has been built according to these aspects. Results of an experiment involving the analysis of 682 posts showed that the average of the ratings given to these posts by teachers was very close to those provided by the automated tool. Such results demonstrate the tool’s potential to assist teachers in evaluating student participation in asynchronous discussions.",2014.0,30.0,9.0,"{'volume': '10', 'pages': '107-121', 'name': 'Interdisciplinary Journal of e-Skills and Lifelong Learning'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Azevedo2014AnalysisOT,\n author = {B.

These input channels can be further classified as subserving a sensory function of spatial and temporal localization, discrimination, and provision of essential information for controlling and guiding exploratory tactile behaviours, and an affective function that is widely recognized as providing the afferent neural input driving the subjective experience of pain, but not so widely recognized as also providing the subjective experience of affiliative or emotional somatic pleasure of touch. The discriminative properties of tactile sensation are mediated by a class of fast-conducting myelinated peripheral nerve fibres--A-beta fibres--whereas the rewarding, emotional properties of touch are hypothesized to be mediated by a class of unmyelinated peripheral nerve fibres--CT afferents (C tactile)--that have biophysical, electrophysiological, neurobiological, and anatomical properties that drive the temporally delayed emotional somatic system. CT afferents have not been found in the glabrous skin of the hand in spite of numerous electrophysiological explorations of this area. Hence, it seems reasonable to conclude that they are lacking in the glabrous skin. A full understanding of the behavioural and affective consequences of the differential innervation of CT afferents awaits a fuller understanding of their function.",2007.0,79.0,249.0,"{'volume': '61 3', 'pages': '\n          173-83\n        ', 'name': 'Canadian journal of experimental psychology = Revue canadienne de psychologie experimentale'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{McGlone2007DiscriminativeTA,\n author = {F.

There are two main competing theories concerning SR’s function. According to social-cognitive information-seeking accounts, infants look at social interaction partners to gain information about the ambiguous situation. According to co-regulation accounts, infants look at social interaction partners to receive emotional support. This review provides an overview of the central developments in SR literature in the past years. We focus on the role of situational aspects such as familiarity of SR partners and situational threat, not only for SR (looking), but also for subsequent behavioral regulation (exploration, affect). As the competing accounts make different predictions concerning both contextual factors, this approach may reveal novel insights into the function of SR. Findings showed that a higher familiarity of SR partners consistently resulted in decreased looking (cf. social-cognitive accounts) and that higher threat remains largely understudied, but seemed to increase looking in the first few studies (cf. co-regulation accounts). Concerning behavioral regulation (exploration, affect) findings are mixed. We point out that moving toward a more complex situatedness may help to disentangle the heterogeneous results by considering the interaction between familiarity and threat rather than investigating the factors in isolation. From a general perspective, this review underlines the importance of situational factors and their interaction in eliciting a phenomenon, such as SR, but also in determining the nature of the phenomenon itself.",2020.0,52.0,6.0,"{'volume': '11', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ehli2020DeterminingTF,\n author = {Samantha Ehli and Julia Wolf and A.

We tested whether the sight of a distressed conspecific elicited fear in zebrafish, and whether this was modulated by familiarity. Groups of six zebrafish were housed together in the same tanks for 7 days to create familiar conditions. The behaviour of individual fish was then recorded in paired tanks within sight of either a familiar or an unfamiliar individual, before and after distilled water or an alarm substance was added to the demonstrator, but not to the observer. As expected, addition of distilled water did not elicit any behavioural change in either the demonstrator or the observer. However, addition of an alarm cue triggered anti-predatory behaviours in the demonstrator which caused the expression of anti-predatory behaviours in the observer, suggesting the existence of fear contagion. Furthermore, the extent of fear contagion was affected by familiarity, and observers were more active, swam closer to the bottom and further away from the demonstrator when they watched a distressed familiar neighbour than when they watched an unfamiliar fish. Our results have implications for fish welfare because they show that fish can become stressed by simply watching others become stressed. They also have implications for experimental design because fish housed in separate tanks cannot be assumed to be statistically independent if they can eavesdrop on their neighbours.",2019.0,57.0,30.0,"{'volume': '153', 'pages': '95-103', 'name': 'Animal Behaviour'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Silva2019FearCI,\n author = {P.

Methods We extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Results The median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female. The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died. Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife. Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city. The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%). Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%). The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%). No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease. Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission. Conclusions During the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness. Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.

2835,e227372d80f0d1853894d5eb452c74c8f78a95c2,Relationship between color and emotion: A study of college students.,"Ninety-eight college students were asked to indicate their emotional responses to five principle hues (i.e., red, yellow, green, blue, purple), five intermediate hues (i.e., yellow-red, green-yellow, blue-green, purple-blue, and red-purple), and three achromatic colors (white, gray, and black) and the reasons for their choices. The color stimuli were referenced from the Munsell Color System. The results revealed that the principle hues comprised the highest number of positive emotional responses, followed by the intermediate hues and the achromatic colors. The color green evoked mainly positive emotions such as relaxation and comfort because it reminded most of the respondents of nature. The color green-yellow had the lowest number of positive responses because it was associated with vomit and elicited the feelings of sickness and disgust. For the achromatic colors, white attained a large number of positive responses, followed by the colors black and gray. The reasons for the color-emotion associations are discussed and future research areas are suggested. Introduction Color is an inseparable part of our everyday lives and its presence is evident in everything that we perceive. It is widely recognized that colors have also a strong impact on our emotions and feelings (Hemphill, 1996; Lang, 1993; Mahnke, 1996). For instance, the color red has been associated with excitement, orange has been perceived as distressing and upsetting, purple as dignified and stately, yellow as cheerful, and blue has been associated with comfort and security (Ballast, 2002; Wexner, 1982). Moreover, some colors may be associated with several different emotions and some emotions are associated with more than one color (Linton, 1999, Saito, 1996). Red, symbolically known as a dominant and dynamic color, has an exciting and stimulating hue effect. It has both positive and negative impressions such as active, strong, passionate, warm, but on the other hand aggressive, bloody, raging and intense. Green has been found to have a retiring and relaxing effect. It too has both positive and negative impressions such as refreshment, quietness, naturalness, and conversely tiredness and guilt (Davey, 1998, Mahnke, 1996, Saito, 1996). The relationship between color and emotion is closely tied to color preferences. In particular, color preferences are associated with whether a color elicits positive or negative feelings. While particular colors have been found to be highly preferred regardless of age, racial group, or culture (Adams & Osgood, 1973, Eysenck, 1941), there is some evidence that color preference may be culturally-based. For example, Choungourian (1968) found that the colors red and blue were the most preferred colors among American subjects, but were less preferred in other cultures. In a comparision of Japanese and Korean subjects, Saito (1996) found unique color preference tendencies between the two countries, and also with respect to age, gender, and geographical region within the individual country. In an investigation of children's emotional associations with colors, Boyatzis and Varghese (1994) found that light colors (e.g., yellow, blue) are associated with positive emotions (e.g., happy, strong) and dark colors (e.g., black, gray) with negative emotions (e.g., sad, angry). In a study examining color-emotion associations among college students in Australia, Hemphill (1996) also found that bright colors elicited mainly positive emotional associations, while dark colors elicited negative emotional associations, confirming the results obtained by Boyatzis and Varghese (1994). However, Saito (1996) found that the color black elicited both negative and positive responses among Japanese subjects, and that black was often a preferred color among young people. Colors can also be described in temperature terms, such as ""warm"" or ""cool""as related to the dominant wavelength of the color.

Twenty-six fourth-year medical students practiced performing a prostate exam on a prostate exam simulator. Participants in the experimental condition examined a simulator augmented with a virtual human. Other participants examined a standard unaugmented simulator. Participants reactions were assessed using self-reported, behavioral, and physiological metrics. Participants who examined the virtual human experienced significantly more stress, measured via skin conductance. Participants stress was correlated with previous experience performing real prostate exams; participants who had performed more real prostate exams were more likely to experience stress while examining the virtual human. Participants who examined the virtual human showed signs of greater engagement; non-stressed participants performed better prostate exams while stressed participants treated the virtual human more realistically. Results indicated that stress evoked by virtual humans is linked to similar previous real-world stressful experiences, implying that learners real-world experience must be taken into account when using virtual humans to prepare them for stressful interpersonal experiences.",2013.0,29.0,25.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '662-670', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Robb2013LeveragingVH,\n author = {Andrew C.

In particular, we describe the Empathic Companion, an animated interface agent that accompanies the user in the setting of a virtual job interview. This interface application takes physiological data (skin conductance and electromyography) of a user in realtime, interprets them as emotions, and addresses the user's affective states in the form of empathic feedback. The Empathic Companion is conceived as an educational agent that supports job seekers preparing for a job interview. We also present results from an exploratory study that aims to evaluate the impact of the Empathic Companion by measuring users' skin conductance and heart rate. While an overall positive effect of the Empathic Companion could not be shown, the outcome of the experiment suggests that empathic feedback has a positive effect on the interviewee's stress level while hearing the interviewer question.",2005.0,30.0,306.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '267 - 285', 'name': 'Applied Artificial Intelligence'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Prendinger2005THEEC,\n author = {H.

Prior studies have reported the importance of implementing empathy in virtual agents regarding maximizing the quality of human–agent interactions. As studies in human–human interactions demonstrate, nonverbal behaviors play a significant role in the transfer of meanings and intentions between the interlocutors. Therefore, the aim of this dissertation was to examine how individual variables influence the perception of the nonverbal behaviors of an agent. The nonverbal behaviors were specifically created to express the empathizing intention of the virtual agent. In this regard, three empirical studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of users’ age (Study 1), users’ cultural background (Study 2), and users’ cultural stereotypes toward the agent (Study 3) on the perception of an empathic agent. 
The results of Study 1 provide important insights into the understanding of how users of varying ages perceive an agent’s emotional nonverbal responses. Older users observed to be more sensible to nonverbal behaviors of the agent since they perceived the agent as more empathic compared with younger adults. The higher perception of the older users was based on the agent’s displayed nonverbal behaviors, indicating the importance of implementing emotional nonverbal behaviors specifically for this target group. Moreover, there were differences between older and younger adults with respect to perceiving specific nonverbal behaviors as empathic. 
The culture of the users in Study 2 was also found to have an influence on users’ perception of an agent. Comparing Iranian and German users (as the examples of relatively collectivistic and individualistic cultures) showed differences regarding users’ perception of the agent’s nonverbal behaviors. While Iranian participants rated a wide array of nonverbal behaviors as empathic, their German peers perceived one specific nonverbal behavior only as the most empathic one. This is where the factor of culture becomes a matter of concern. In order for a virtual agent to look more emphatic, users’ culture should be considered while implementing nonverbal behaviors. 
And finally, in Study 3, it was observed that users do not show stereotypical attitudes toward the agent when they are aware that the agent is designed and produced in a different country. Users who were primed about the country of the agent did not show different ratings of empathic behaviors of the agent in the presence of emotional nonverbal behaviors. The findings of this study make valuable contributions to the research in the domain of bias toward the agent. It can be stated that as long as there are no cues in the appearance of the agent representing a different culture, users do not get biased toward its emotional responses. 
Taken together, this dissertation provides insight into understanding that user variables indeed matter and they can influence accurately perceiving the emotional nonverbal behaviors of virtual agents. Since the purpose of designing an empathic agent is to enhance users’ experiences and satisfaction, the factors that have the potential to impact their perception of an empathic agent should be considered when designing a virtual agent.",2020.0,0.0,1.0,"{'name': '', 'volume': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Ghasabeh2020InvestigatingTE,\n author = {Adineh Hosseinpanah Ghasabeh},\n title = {Investigating the Effect of User Variables on Perceiving the Emotional Nonverbal Behaviors of an Empathic Virtual Agent},\n year = {2020}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2135335482', 'name': 'Adineh Hosseinpanah Ghasabeh'}]"

We examine whether conversational agents' response styles under varying abuse types influence those emotions found to mitigate peoples' aggressive behaviors, involving three verbal abuse types (Insult, Threat, Swearing) and three response styles (Avoidance, Empathy, Counterattacking). Ninety-eight participants were assigned to one of the abuse type conditions, interacted with the three spoken (voice-based) CAs in turn, and reported their feelings about guiltiness, anger, and shame after each session. The results show that the agent's response style has a significant effect on user emotions. Participants were less angry and more guilty with the empathy agent than the other two agents. Furthermore, we investigated the current status of commercial CAs' responses to verbal abuse.

Its goal is to extract the important information from the table, to represent it as a set of new orthogonal variables called principal components, and to display the pattern of similarity of the observations and of the variables as points in maps. The quality of the PCA model can be evaluated using cross‐validation techniques such as the bootstrap and the jackknife. PCA can be generalized as correspondence analysis (CA) in order to handle qualitative variables and as multiple factor analysis (MFA) in order to handle heterogeneous sets of variables. Mathematically, PCA depends upon the eigen‐decomposition of positive semi‐definite matrices and upon the singular value decomposition (SVD) of rectangular matrices.

The analysis derives from a detailed account of a violent confrontation between students and police during a demonstration held in November 1988 - the so-called 'Battle of Westminster'. It focuses on how students came to be involved in the conflict, how the conflict spread and upon the psychological consequences of involvement. This analysis is used to develop general hypotheses concerning the initiation and development of collective conflict. It is concluded that, while the social identity model is of use in understanding these phenomena, it is necessary to recognize how social categories are constructed and reconstructed in the dynamics of intergroup interaction.",1996.0,16.0,371.0,"{'volume': '26', 'pages': '115-134', 'name': 'European Journal of Social Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Reicher1996TheBO,\n author = {S.

While behavioural responses to the spread of a disease have often been reported anecdotally, there has been relatively little systematic investigation into how behavioural changes can affect disease dynamics. Mathematical models for the spread of infectious diseases are an important tool for investigating and quantifying such effects, not least because the spread of a disease among humans is not amenable to direct experimental study. Here, we review recent efforts to incorporate human behaviour into disease models, and propose that such models can be broadly classified according to the type and source of information which individuals are assumed to base their behaviour on, and according to the assumed effects of such behaviour. We highlight recent advances as well as gaps in our understanding of the interplay between infectious disease dynamics and human behaviour, and suggest what kind of data taking efforts would be helpful in filling these gaps.",2010.0,93.0,1008.0,"{'volume': '7', 'pages': '1247 - 1256', 'name': 'Journal of The Royal Society Interface'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Funk2010ModellingTI,\n author = {S.

Also, most studies with SAD participants fail to evaluate social presence, although it may be a more appropriate indicator for virtual social stress scenarios than physical presence. Hence, for the first time, this study sets out to examine the link between social presence, physical presence, and emotional responses to phobogenic virtual social stimuli. A group of n = 12 participants with SAD and n = 12 healthy controls were exposed to three social tasks in an interactive virtual environment (VE). Self-report measures of physical and social presence as well as state anxiety were used alongside heart rate measures to evaluate the virtual experience. Results show significantly higher anxiety levels-both self-report and physiological-in SAD participants than in controls. Also, socially anxious subjects reported to experience more copresence and mutual attention as well as a higher sense of being in the VE than their healthy peers. In sum, social presence experiences may be more predicative of the anxiety response in SAD individuals than physical presence.

For return-benefits to play a motivational role, however, they need to be experienced by the organism. Motivational analyses should restrict themselves, therefore, to the altruistic impulse and its knowable consequences. Empathy is an ideal candidate mechanism to underlie so-called directed altruism, i.e., altruism in response to anothers's pain, need, or distress. Evidence is accumulating that this mechanism is phylogenetically ancient, probably as old as mammals and birds. Perception of the emotional state of another automatically activates shared representations causing a matching emotional state in the observer. With increasing cognition, state-matching evolved into more complex forms, including concern for the other and perspective-taking. Empathy-induced altruism derives its strength from the emotional stake it offers the self in the other's welfare. The dynamics of the empathy mechanism agree with predictions from kin selection and reciprocal altruism theory.",2008.0,159.0,1302.0,"{'volume': '59', 'pages': '279-300', 'name': 'Annual Review of Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Waal2008PuttingTA,\n author = {F.

If the SPI personality traits are representative of the domain of non-Big Five personality traits, then the major source of the variance in the SPI traits would be expected to correlate strongly with the sixth factor of personality, Honesty-Humility. We tested this hypothesis using self-report measures (N = 200) of the SPI traits, of the Big Five, and of the new six-dimensional (""HEXACO"") structure. Results indicated that the first unrotated factor underlying the 10 SPI traits was heavily saturated with variance from Honesty-Humility (r = .65).

Implicit learning was considered as a mechanism for conformity in social perception. We carried out 2 experiments using a hidden covariation detection paradigm. In a learning phase, participants memorized a set of female photographs presented together with their attractiveness ratings. The ratings correlated with the hairstyle of the photographed women. The participants who did not consciously detect this correlation demonstrated a systematic bias toward the correlation when evaluating the new stimulus persons. Information about the source of the ratings in the learning phase (other people's opinions or nonsocial sources) did not modulate learning. Learning was not observed when participants critically evaluated the ratings during the memorization phase. The study shows that (a) conformity may be based not only on reinforcement learning mechanism (as was previously suggested) but also on unsupervised implicit learning; (b) implicit learning occurs automatically irrespective of the context (social or not); and (c) a critical attitude toward learned material may prevent implicit learning from being manifested in a test phase. We conclude that indirect social influence may be affected by people's opinion toward the provided information. The study contributes to both implicit learning and social perception research.

Unlike previous methods based on phoneme level unit selection or hidden Markov model (HMM), etc., the hybrid concatenation method uses a frame level-based unit selection method combined with a fused HMM, and is able to generate more expressive and stable facial animations. The fused HMM can be used to explicitly model the loose synchronization of tightly coupled streams, with much better results than a normal HMM for audiovisual mapping. After fused HMM is created, facial animation is generated via the unit selection method at the frame level by using the fused HMM output probabilities. To accelerate the computing efficiency of the unit selection on a large corpus, this paper also proposes a two-layer Viterbi search method in which only the subsets that have been selected in the first layer are further checked in the second layer. Using this idea, the system has been successfully integrated into real-time applications. Furthermore, the paper also proposes a mapping method to generate emotional facial expressions from neutral facial expressions based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). Final experiments prove that the method described can output synthesized facial parameters with high quality. Compared with other audiovisual mapping methods, our method has better performance with respect to expressiveness, stability, and system running speed.",2009.0,34.0,24.0,"{'volume': '17', 'pages': '469-477', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tao2009RealisticVS,\n author = {J.

Due to the complexity of rumor spreading and the radical emotion infecting processes, the results of the group emotion evolution analysis often lose effectiveness, which will affect the control and strategy establishment in emergency management. In this paper, we study the group emotion evolution process with the agent based simulation method.

The simulation experiments of correlation events and events-chain model of a real public incident are performed based on the constructed framework.

2879,e65bc86ac118443a849f526e2142c20bfc9ce933,Age-related differences in emotion recognition ability: a cross-sectional study.,"Experimental studies indicate that recognition of emotions, particularly negative emotions, decreases with age. However, there is no consensus at which age the decrease in emotion recognition begins, how selective this is to negative emotions, and whether this applies to both facial and vocal expression. In the current cross-sectional study, 607 participants ranging in age from 18 to 84 years (mean age = 32.6 +/- 14.9 years) were asked to recognize emotions expressed either facially or vocally. In general, older participants were found to be less accurate at recognizing emotions, with the most distinctive age difference pertaining to a certain group of negative emotions. Both modalities revealed an age-related decline in the recognition of sadness and -- to a lesser degree -- anger, starting at about 30 years of age. Although age-related differences in the recognition of expression of emotion were not mediated by personality traits, 2 of the Big 5 traits, openness and conscientiousness, made an independent contribution to emotion-recognition performance. Implications of age-related differences in facial and vocal emotion expression and early onset of the selective decrease in emotion recognition are discussed in terms of previous findings and relevant theoretical models.",2009.0,83.0,207.0,"{'volume': '9 5', 'pages': '\n          619-30\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mill2009AgerelatedDI,\n author = {Aire Mill and J.

The aim of this research is to explore the benefits of VR technology in education that can engage the learning process using Virtual Reality (VR) in the classroom. Thus, the research objectives are to seek for student design and development of application, convenient, facileness and gratification of VR application in learning process. Using quantitative method, data from questionnaires and evaluations of existing Virtual Reality applications were analyzed in descriptive way to assess the viability of mobile Virtual Reality as a medium for improving learning. The developing process of an VR mobile based application is defined explicitly, and the final graphical student interface of the application is demonstrated to show overall look of the final product that is developed for this project. This includes three types of testing in this project which are performance testing, user acceptance testing and usability testing. Based on the 40 respondents results, it can be concluded that virtual reality application is a good application that can enhance and also engage students learning process in science subject as the mean value for perceived of convenient items was 3.67, followed by 3.66 for perceived of facileness items and finally mean value for perceived of gratification items was 3.61.

The timing of the upper and lower face regions within and between expressions such as happiness, sadness, and anger was explored by the animators, who sought to determine which configurations were the most and least effective in practice. The results showed that the student animators shared a degree of consensus when they discussed which configurations they found most authentic, and which configurations were the most clear. Configuration selection was dependent on the emotion or emotional transition being animated. These findings demonstrate that engagement with hand-key animators and practice-based research can generate results which would be of interest to the broader HCI community, in particular as regards the animation of interactive humanoid agents which exhibit believable changes in emotion.",2011.0,27.0,2.0,{'pages': '177-186'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Sloan2011APS,\n author = {R.

A mapping is learned from input geometric, contextual, and shading features of the 3D object to these hatching properties, using classification, regression, and clustering techniques. Then, a new illustration can be generated in the artist's style, as follows.

Much of this is due to virtual reality's ability to accurately represent body language, since participants can share a 3D space with a character. However, creating virtual characters capable of body language is a challenging task. It is a tacit, embodied skill that cannot be well represented in code. This paper surveys a series of experiments performed by Mel Slater and colleagues that show the power of Virtual Characters in VR and summarizes details of the technical infrastructure used, and Slater's theories of why virtual characters are effective.

Specifically, they found that emotions characterized by other-person control (anger and gratitude) and weak control appraisals (happiness) influence trust significantly more than emotions characterized by personal control (pride and guilt) or situational control (sadness). These findings suggest that emotions are more likely to be misattributed when the appraisals of the emotion are consistent with the judgment task than when the appraisals of the emotion are inconsistent with the judgment task.

Multiple sources of data were collected from 51 high school students in three different classes (named A, B and C) where the same teacher gave them the same lesson content throughout a full year. A quantitative analysis of multiple questionnaire responses revealed that patterns of motivational change and change in perception of pair and group work were markedly different in the three classrooms. A qualitative data analysis of interviews and observations of pair and group activities showed that different classroom modes of regulation are likely to emerge even among homogenous classes consisting of students with the same L1 and similar proficiency levels under the same curriculum. The findings imply that socially-shared regulation among students is one of the keys to creating a positive classroom environment in which students influence and motivate each other.",2020.0,35.0,13.0,"{'volume': '16', 'pages': '14 - 28', 'name': 'Innovation in Language Learning and Teaching'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Nakata2020UnderstandingMA,\n author = {Yoshiyuki Nakata and R.

Estimating these costs and identifying their predictors is important for appropriate service planning. We aimed to measure use of health services in an adult population who had experienced war in the former-Yugoslavia on average 8 years previously, and to identify characteristics associated with the use and costs of healthcare. Method War-affected community samples in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, FYR Macedonia, and Serbia were recruited through a random walk technique. Refugees in Germany, Italy and the UK were contacted through registers, organisations and networking. Current service use was measured for the previous three months and combined with unit costs for each country for the year 2006/7. A two-part approach was used, to identify predictors of service use with a multiple logistic regression model and predictors of cost with a generalised linear regression model. Results 3,313 participants were interviewed in Balkan countries and 854 refugees in Western European countries. In the Balkan countries, traumatic events and mental health status were related to greater service use while in Western countries these associations were not found. Participants in Balkan countries with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) had costs that were 63% higher (p = 0.005) than those without PTSD. Distress experienced during the most traumatic war event was associated with higher costs (p = 0.013). In Western European countries costs were 76% higher if non-PTSD anxiety disorders were present (0.027) and 63% higher for mood disorders (p = 0.006). Conclusions War experiences and their effects on mental health are associated with increased health care costs even many years later, especially for those who stayed in the area of conflict. Focussing on the mental health impact of war is important for many reasons including those of an economic nature.",2012.0,31.0,41.0,"{'volume': '7', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sabés-Figuera2012LongTermIO,\n author = {R.

VR-based testing and training scenarios that would be difficult, if not impossible, to deliver using conventional neuropsychological methods are now being developed that take advantage of the assets available with VR technology. If empirical studies continue to demonstrate effectiveness, virtual environment applications could provide new options for targeting cognitive and functional impairments due to traumatic brain injury, neurological disorders, and learning disabilities. This article focuses on specifying the assets that are available with VR for neuropsychological applications along with discussion of current VR-based research that serves to illustrate each asset. VR allows for the precise presentation and control of dynamic multi-sensory 3D stimulus environments, as well as providing advanced methods for recording behavioural responses. This serves as the basis for a diverse set of VR assets for neuropsychological approaches that are detailed in this article. We take the position that when combining these assets within the context of functionally relevant, ecologically valid virtual environments, fundamental advancements can emerge in how human cognition and functional behaviour is assessed and rehabilitated.",2004.0,83.0,429.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '207 - 239', 'name': 'Neuropsychological Rehabilitation'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rizzo2004AnalysisOA,\n author = {A.

Collectiveness, which indicates the degree of individuals acting as a union in collective motion, is a fundamental and universal measurement for various crowd systems. By integrating path similarities among crowds on collective manifold, this paper proposes a descriptor of collectiveness and an efficient computation for the crowd and its constituent individuals. The algorithm of the Collective Merging is then proposed to detect collective motions from random motions. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed collectiveness descriptor on the system of self-driven particles. We then compare the collectiveness descriptor to human perception for collective motion and show high consistency. Our experiments regarding the detection of collective motions and the measurement of collectiveness in videos of pedestrian crowds and bacteria colony demonstrate a wide range of applications of the collectiveness descriptor.",2013.0,27.0,216.0,"{'pages': '3049-3056', 'name': '2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zhou2013MeasuringCC,\n author = {Bolei Zhou and Xiaoou Tang and Hepeng Zhang and Xiaogang Wang},\n journal = {2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition},\n pages = {3049-3056},\n title = {Measuring Crowd Collectiveness},\n year = {2013}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '145291669', 'name': 'Bolei Zhou'}, {'authorId': '50295995', 'name': 'Xiaoou Tang'}, {'authorId': '49723572', 'name': 'Hepeng Zhang'}, {'authorId': '31843833', 'name': 'Xiaogang Wang'}]"

The aim of this study was to assess how the individual differences in self-reported emotion regulation strategy use relate to levels of both positive and negative psychological well-being. In total, 56 individuals with ASD aged 14–24 years (Mage = 18.15; SDage = 2.30) completed Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 Generalized Anxiety Disorder Dimensional Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale and Autism-Spectrum Quotient – Short. Individuals were grouped into four clusters based on their Emotion Regulation Questionnaire subscale scores. Individuals in the high suppression and low reappraisal group expressed higher depressive symptoms and lower positive well-being when compared with the low suppression and high reappraisal group. Interestingly, individuals who self-reported using both high suppression and reappraisal expressed relatively high positive well-being and low depression symptoms. We suggest that the maladaptive effect of habitual suppression usage may be buffered by the habitual use of reappraisal, and this interaction between adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation strategy use has clinical implications.",2019.0,84.0,37.0,"{'volume': '23', 'pages': '737 - 749', 'name': 'Autism'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cai2019EmotionRI,\n author = {R.

We also explore whether these judgements are affected by personality. Participants recruited from Mechanical Turk rated an emotional support message for Suitability, provided qualitative feedback about their rating and then completed a personality measure. We found that the support message was rated worst when it came from the Computer, Distant-sister and Close-friend. While these were rated worse, they were not rated poorly, implying that support from a computer is valuable. There were three effects for personality which did not vary with the support giver’s Identity: agreeableness and emotional stability had a positive correlation with 3 sub-scales of supportiveness.

This requires robots to be socially interactive and intelligent, including the ability to display appropriate social behaviour. Progress has been made in emotion modelling. However, research into behaviour style is less thorough; no comprehensive, validated model exists of non-verbal behaviours to express style in human-robot interactions. Based on a literature survey, we created a model of non-verbal behaviour to express high/low warmth and competence — two dimensions that contribute to teaching style. In a perception study, we evaluated this model applied to a NAO robot giving a lecture at primary schools and a diabetes camp in the Netherlands. For this, we developed, based on expert ratings, an instrument measuring perceived warmth, competence, dominance and affiliation. We show that even subtle manipulations of robot behaviour influence children's perceptions of the robot's level of warmth and competence.",2017.0,36.0,25.0,"{'pages': '449-455', 'name': '2017 26th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Peters2017RobotsEI,\n author = {Rifca Peters and J.

However, which measures were most effective is uncertain. Tian et al. performed a quantitative analysis of the impact of control measures between 31 December 2019 and 19 February 2020, which encompasses the Lunar New Year period when millions of people traveled across China for family visits. Travel restrictions in and out of Wuhan were too late to prevent the spread of the virus to 262 cities within 28 days. However, the epidemic peaked in Hubei province on 4 February 2020, indicating that measures such as closing citywide public transport and entertainment venues and banning public gatherings combined to avert hundreds of thousands of cases of infection. It is unlikely that this decline happened because the supply of susceptible people was exhausted, so relaxing control measures could lead to a resurgence. Science, this issue p. 638 Travel restrictions and the national emergency response delayed the growth and limited the size of the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Responding to an outbreak of a novel coronavirus [agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] in December 2019, China banned travel to and from Wuhan city on 23 January 2020 and implemented a national emergency response. We investigated the spread and control of COVID-19 using a data set that included case reports, human movement, and public health interventions. The Wuhan shutdown was associated with the delayed arrival of COVID-19 in other cities by 2.91 days. Cities that implemented control measures preemptively reported fewer cases on average (13.0) in the first week of their outbreaks compared with cities that started control later (20.6). Suspending intracity public transport, closing entertainment venues, and banning public gatherings were associated with reductions in case incidence. The national emergency response appears to have delayed the growth and limited the size of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, averting hundreds of thousands of cases by 19 February (day 50).",2020.0,31.0,1555.0,"{'volume': '368', 'pages': '638 - 642', 'name': 'Science (New York, N.y.)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tian2020AnIO,\n author = {H.

Understanding zebrafish behavioral phenotypes provides important insights into neural pathways, physiological biomarkers, and genetic underpinnings of normal and pathological brain function. Novel zebrafish paradigms continue to appear with an encouraging pace, thus necessitating a consistent terminology and improved understanding of the behavioral repertoire. What can zebrafish 'do', and how does their altered brain function translate into behavioral actions? To help address these questions, we have developed a detailed catalog of zebrafish behaviors (Zebrafish Behavior Catalog, ZBC) that covers both larval and adult models. Representing a beginning of creating a more comprehensive ethogram of zebrafish behavior, this effort will improve interpretation of published findings, foster cross-species behavioral modeling, and encourage new groups to apply zebrafish neurobehavioral paradigms in their research. In addition, this glossary creates a framework for developing a zebrafish neurobehavioral ontology, ultimately to become part of a unified animal neurobehavioral ontology, which collectively will contribute to better integration of biological data within and across species.",2013.0,187.0,767.0,"{'volume': '10 1', 'pages': '\n          70-86\n        ', 'name': 'Zebrafish'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kalueff2013TowardsAC,\n author = {A.

The first section offers an assessment of the state of the practice and of the need to integrate valid human performance moderator functions (PMFs) from traditionally separated subfields of the behavioral literature. The second section pursues this goal by postulating a unifying architecture and principles for integrating existing PMF theories and models. It also illustrates a PMF testbed called PMFserv created for implementating and studying how PMFs may contribute to such an architecture. To date it interconnects versions of PMFs on physiology and stress; personality, cultural and emotive processes (Cognitive Appraisal-OCC, value systems); perception (Gibsonian affordance); social processes (relations, identity, trust, nested intentionality); and cognition (affect- and stress-augmented decision theory, bounded rationality). The third section summarizes several usage case studies (asymmetric warfare, civil unrest, and political leaders) and concludes with lessons learned. Implementing and interoperating this broad collection of PMFs helps to open the agenda for research on syntheses that can help the field reach a greater level of maturity.

Design: Diagnostic accuracy study. Setting: Two tertiary care hospitals in Delhi, India. Patients: Children aged 6 months to 15 years with newly diagnosed intrathoracic tuberculosis. Methods: GL and IS were performed in children on 2 consecutive days on ambulatory basis. Samples were examined by Ziehl-Neelsen staining and cultured on an automated BACTEC-MGIT 960TM system. Outcome Measure: Mycobacterial yields (smear and culture) for the 2 sample types (IS and GL) were compared. Results: Four hundred three children (56.6% girls), median age 111 months (interquartile range: 68, 144) were enrolled. Overall yield for acid-fast bacilli and/or Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) by either IS and/or GL was 152 (37.7%). Acid-fast bacilli positivity from IS and GL were 5.7% (23) and 10.4% (42), respectively. Confirmed MTB on culture from IS and GL were 17.9% (72) and 32.5% (127), respectively (P < 0.001). IS and GL identified 17 (4.2%) and 73 (18.1%) additional cases respectively when the other method failed to identify MTB. The combined yields (acid-fast bacilli positivity/MTB) with GL and IS on day 1 (115, 28.5%) were less than that obtained from 2 consecutive GL (135, 33.5%), but better than 2 consecutive IS samples (79, 19.6%; P < 0.001).

Recently, films such as Tron: Legacy and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button have produced highly realistic characters. In the real-time domain, there is also a need to deliver realistic virtual characters, with the increase in popularity of interactive drama video games (such as L.A. Noire™ or Heavy Rain™). There have been mixed reactions from audiences to lifelike characters used in movies and games, with some saying that the increased realism highlights subtle imperfections, which can be disturbing. Some developers opt for a stylized rendering (such as cartoon-shading) to avoid a negative reaction [Thompson 2004]. In this paper, we investigate some of the consequences of choosing realistic or stylized rendering in order to provide guidelines for developers for creating appealing virtual characters. We conducted a series of psychophysical experiments to determine whether render style affects how virtual humans are perceived.

A paradigm that examines whether someone can perceive and benefit from regulatory efforts by another person, represented here by a virtual agent, would be highly relevant for experimental studies investigating social emotion regulation, as well as for interventions in the clinical and sub-clinical context. Virtual reality (VR) provides perhaps the ideal opportunity to test social interactions and difficulties with them, as it counters typical methodological problems of behavioral experiments, such as the trade-off between ecological validity and experimental control, as well as the difficulty of replicating social situations. The goal of the present methods paper is twofold: to provide a detailed description of the development of a novel paradigm consisting of two scenarios in VR designed to test the efficacy of social emotion regulation, and to present the anticipated results for the target populations of typically developing and autistic youth. Participants are presented with a virtual school environment and take part in two activities with a class of students and a teacher, all of whom are virtual agents. In both scenarios, participants experience a potentially stressful situation and are subsequently offered emotional support by a friendly student. Throughout the experiment, self-reports in the form of virtual smiley scales and psychophysiological measurements are collected as markers of the participants’ emotional states. Pilot results will be discussed in line with anticipated outcomes, to indicate that the experiment will be able to show the efficacy of social support by a virtual agent and provide insight into social emotion regulation for different populations. The school environment and the character of the friendly student also have the potential to be adapted for follow-up experiments on additional aspects of social emotion regulation for a variety of contexts.",2022.0,53.0,0.0,{'volume': '3'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Stallmann2022SociallySB,\n author = {Lina Stallmann and Daniel Dukes and Michel Tran and Valentin Durand de Gevigney and D.

Whether and when should we show data in 3D is an on-going debate in communities conducting visualization research. A strong opposition exists in the information visualization (Infovis) community, and seemingly unnecessary/unwarranted use of 3D, e.g., in plots, bar or pie charts, is heavily criticized. The scientific visualization (Scivis) community, on the other hand, is more supportive of the use of 3D as it allows ‘seeing’ invisible phenomena, or designing and printing things that are used in e.g., surgeries, educational settings etc. Geographic visualization (Geovis) stands between the Infovis and Scivis communities. In geographic information science, most visuo-spatial analyses have been sufficiently conducted in 2D or 2.5D, including analyses related to terrain and much of the urban phenomena. On the other hand, there has always been a strong interest in 3D, with similar motivations as in Scivis community. Among many types of 3D visualizations, a popular one that is exploited both for visual analysis and visualization is the highly realistic (geo)virtual environments. Such environments may be engaging and memorable for the viewers because they offer highly immersive experiences. However, it is not yet well-established if we should opt to show the data in 3D; and if yes, a) what type of 3D we should use, b) for what task types, and c) for whom. In this paper, we identify some of the central arguments for and against the use of 3D visualizations around these three considerations in a concise interdisciplinary literature review.",2016.0,62.0,48.0,"{'volume': '', 'pages': '387-392', 'name': 'ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Çöltekin2016ONTU,\n author = {A.

Measures of interpersonal behaviour, however, often rely on subjective evaluations, invasive measurement techniques or gross measures of motion. Here, we constructed an unobtrusive motion tracking system that enables detailed analysis of behaviour at the individual and interpersonal levels, which we validated using wearable sensors. We evaluate dyadic measures of joint orienting and distancing, synchrony and gaze behaviours to summarize data collected during natural conversation and joint action tasks. Our results demonstrate that patterns of proxemic behaviours, rather than more widely used measures of interpersonal synchrony, best predicted the subjective quality of the interactions. Increased distance between participants predicted lower enjoyment, while increased joint orienting towards each other during cooperation correlated with increased effort reported by the participants. Importantly, the interpersonal distance was most informative of the quality of interaction when task demands and experimental control were minimal. These results suggest that interpersonal measures of behaviour gathered during minimally constrained social interactions are particularly sensitive for the subjective quality of social interactions and may be useful for interaction-based phenotyping for further studies.",2020.0,56.0,32.0,"{'volume': '7', 'name': 'Royal Society Open Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lahnakoski2020UnobtrusiveTO,\n author = {J.

2938,eaa28a169132d2c25bdb7b0c99ab2e6df45ce1cb,Proxemics [and Comments and Replies],"Virtually everything that man is and does is associated with space. Man's sense of space is a synthesis of many sensory inputs: visual, auditory, kinesthetic, olfactory, and thermal. Not only does each of these constitute a complex system (as for example, the dozen or more different ways of experiencing depth visually), but each is molded and patterned by culture. Hence people reared in different cultures live in different sensory worlds. What is more, they are generally unaware of the degree to which the worlds may differ. From the study of culture we learn that the patterning of perceptual worlds is a function not only of the specific culture but of the relationship, activity, and emotions present in a given situation. Therefore, when two people of different cultures interact, each uses different criteria to interpret the other's behavior, and each may easily misinterpret the relationship, the activity, or the emotions involved. The study of culture in the proxemic sense is the study of peoples' use of their perceptual apparatus in different emotional states during different activities, in different relationships, settings, and contexts. No single research technique is sufficient in scope to investigate this complex, multi-dimensional subject. The research technique is, therefore, a function of the particular facet under examination at the time and many call for the involvement of many disciplines. Like all basic studies of the communicative process, proxemics, as I think of it, is more concerned with how than why, and more concerned with structure than content. The work is admittedly detailed and is apt to be routine. It addresses itself to basic human situations in an area of culture that is ordinarily hidden from conscious awareness. For this reason, proxemics frequently leads to new insights about specific cultures, as well as to insights into the generalized concept of culture itself. In formulating my thinking concerning proxemics, I have maintained that culture is an extension of basic biological processes. While man's extensions as they evolve may mask the underlying relationships which maintain the equilibrium of biological systems, the relationships and systems are no less real by virtue of being hidden. In the words of Ian McHarg (1963): ...no species can exist without an environment, no species can exist in an environment of its exclusive creation, no species can survive, save as a nondisruptive member of an ecological community. Every member must adjust to other members of the community and to the environment in order to survive. Man is not excluded from this test.",1968.0,104.0,495.0,"{'volume': '9', 'pages': '83 - 108', 'name': 'Current Anthropology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hall1968ProxemicsC,\n author = {E. Hall and R.

How long does it take to disinfect a network given particular values of infection rate and virus death rate? What is the single best node to immunize? Answering these questions is essential for devising network-wide strategies to counter viruses. In addition, viral propagation is very similar in principle to the spread of rumors, information and "" fads "" , implying that the solutions for viral propagation would offer insights into these other problem settings too. We answer these questions by developing a Non-Linear Dynamical System (NLDS) that accurately models viral propagation in any arbitrary network, including real and synthesized network graphs. We propose a general epidemic threshold condition for the NLDS system: we prove that the epidemic threshold for a network is exactly the inverse of the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. Finally, we show that below the epidemic threshold, infections die out at an exponential rate. Our epidemic threshold model subsumes many known thresholds for special-case graphs (e.g., Erdös-Rényi, BA power-law, homogeneous). we demonstrate the predictive power of our model with extensive experiments on real and synthesized graphs, and show that our threshold condition holds for arbitrary graphs. Finally, we show how to utilize our threshold condition for practical uses: It can dictate which nodes to immunize; it can assess the effects of a throttling policy; it can help us design network topologies so that they are more resistant to viruses.",2007.0,35.0,605.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Chakrabarti2007IeeeTO,\n author = {Deepayan Chakrabarti and Yang Wang and Chenxi Wang and J.

Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short- and long-term positive outcomes. Objective This study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression. Methods In the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations. Results The average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre- and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging. Conclusions The real-world data evaluation findings on the effectiveness and engagement levels of Wysa app on users with self-reported symptoms of depression show promise. However, further work is required to validate these initial findings in much larger samples and across longer periods.",2018.0,55.0,340.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'JMIR mHealth and uHealth'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Inkster2018AnEC,\n author = {B.

However, it has been assumed that such processing takes place solely on a global valence-based level, allowing individuals to disentangle positive from negative emotions but not the specific emotion. In three studies, we investigated the specificity of emotion processing under conditions of limited awareness using a modified variant of an affective priming task. Faces with happy, angry, sad, fearful, and neutral expressions were presented as masked primes for 33 ms (Study 1) or 14 ms (Studies 2 and 3) followed by emotional target faces (Studies 1 and 2) or emotional adjectives (Study 3). Participants’ task was to categorise the target emotion. In all three studies, discrimination of targets was significantly affected by the emotional primes beyond a simple positive versus negative distinction. Results indicate that specific aspects of emotions might be automatically disentangled in addition to valence, even under conditions of subjective unawareness.",2012.0,59.0,47.0,"{'volume': '26', 'pages': '224 - 244', 'name': 'Cognition and Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rohr2012MaskedEP,\n author = {M.

Good emotional support (e.g. provided by an Intelligent Virtual Agent) could help relieve this stress. This study investigates whether adaptation to personality affects the amount and type of emotional support a carer is given and possible interaction effects with the stress experienced. We investigated the personality trait of Emotional Stability (ES) as it is interlinked with low tolerance for stress. Participants were presented with 7 stressful scenarios experienced by a fictitious carer and a description of their personality and asked to rank 6 emotional support messages. We predicted that people with low ES would be given more emotional support messages overall and that ES would affect the type of emotional support messages given in each scenario.

This increases the probability that consecutive recorded instants of expressions represent the same affective content. In this paper, we exploit such a relationship to improve the recognition performance of continuous naturalistic affective expressions. Using datasets of naturalistic affective expressions (AVEC 2011 audio and video dataset, PAINFUL video dataset) continuously labeled over time and over different dimensions, we analyze the transitions between levels of those dimensions (e.g., transitions in pain intensity level). We use an information theory approach to show that the transitions occur very slowly and hence suggest modeling them as first-order Markov models. The dimension levels are considered to be the hidden states in the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework. Their discrete transition and emission matrices are trained by using the labels provided with the training set. The recognition problem is converted into a best path-finding problem to obtain the best hidden states sequence in HMMs. This is a key difference from previous use of HMMs as classifiers. Modeling of the transitions between dimension levels is integrated in a multistage approach, where the first level performs a mapping between the affective expression features and a soft decision value (e.g., an affective dimension level), and further classification stages are modeled as HMMs that refine that mapping by taking into account the temporal relationships between the output decision labels. The experimental results for each of the unimodal datasets show overall performance to be significantly above that of a standard classification system that does not take into account temporal relationships. In particular, the results on the AVEC 2011 audio dataset outperform all other systems presented at the international competition.",2014.0,74.0,77.0,"{'volume': '44', 'pages': '315-328', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Meng2014AffectiveSL,\n author = {H.

 Psychological theories suggest that emotion represents the state of mind and instinctive responses of one’s cognitive system (Cannon 1927). Emotions are a complex state of feeling that results in physical and psychological changes that influence our behavior. In this paper, we study an interesting problem of emotion contagion in social networks. In particular, by employing an image social network (Flickr) as the basis of our study, we try to unveil how users’ emotional statuses influence each other and how users’ positions in the social network affect their influential strength on emotion. We develop a probabilistic framework to formalize the problem into a role-aware contagion model. The model is able to predict users’ emotional statuses based on their historical emotional statuses and social structures. Experiments on a large Flickr dataset show that the proposed model significantly outperforms (+31% in terms of F1-score) several alternative methods in predicting users’ emotional status. We also discover several intriguing phenomena. For example, the probability that a user feels happy is roughly linear to the number of friends who are also happy; but taking a closer look, the happiness probability is superlinear to the number of happy friends who act as opinion leaders (Page et al. 1999) in the network and sublinear in the number of happy friends who span structural holes (Burt 2001). This offers a new opportunity to understand the underlying mechanism of emotional contagion in online social networks.

2958,ed893684bc9a517ecb1b39521b833bb2f0149d83,Virtual Reality Applications for Stress Management Training in the Military.,"INTRODUCTION
Stress Management Training programs are increasingly being adopted in the military field for resilience empowerment and primary stress prevention. In the last several years, advanced technologies (virtual reality in particular) have been integrated in order to develop more innovative and effective stress training programs for military personnel, including soldiers, pilots, and other aircrew professionals. This systematic review describes experimental studies that have been conducted in recent years to test the effectiveness of virtual reality-based Stress Management Training programs developed for military personnel. This promising state-of-the-art technology has the potential to be a successful new approach in empowering soldiers and increasing their resilience to stress.


METHODS
To provide an overview from 2001 to 2016 of the application of virtual reality for Stress Management Training programs developed for the military, a computer-based search for relevant publications was performed in several databases. Databases used in the search were PsycINFO, Web of Science (Web of Knowledge), PubMed, and Medline. The search string was: (""Virtual Reality"") AND (""Military"") AND [""Stress Training"" OR (""Stress Management"")].


RESULTS
There were 14 studies that met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review.


DISCUSSION
The main observation to be drawn from this review is that virtual reality can provide interactive Stress Management Training to decrease levels of perceived stress and negative affect in military personnel. This technology appears to be a promising tool for assessing individuals' resilience to stress and for identifying the impact that stress can have on physiological reactivity and performance.Pallavicini F, Argenton L, Toniazzi N, Aceti L, Mantovani F.

If the virtual audience seems attentive, well-behaved, and interested, if they show positive facial expressions with complimentary actions such as clapping and nodding, does the speaker infer correspondingly positive evaluations of performance and show fewer signs of anxiety? On the other hand, if the audience seems hostile, disinterested, and visibly bored, if they have negative facial expressions and exhibit reactions such as head-shaking, loud yawning, turning away, falling asleep, and walking out, does the speaker infer correspondingly negative evaluations of performance and show more signs of anxiety? We set out to study this question during the summer of 1998. We designed a virtual public speaking scenario, followed by an experimental study. We wanted mainly to explore the effectiveness of virtual environments (VEs) in psychotherapy for social phobias. Rather than plunge straight in and design a virtual reality therapy tool, we first tackled the question of whether real people's emotional responses are appropriate to the behavior of the virtual people with whom they may interact. The project used DIVE (Distributive Interactive Virtual Environment) as the basis for constructing a working prototype of a virtual public speaking simulation.

In our proposal, when the description of the current situation reveals that a moral value is 'at stake', the moral goal of re-establishing the threatened value is included among the active goals. The compliance with values generates positive emotions like pride and admiration, while the opposite brings to shame and self-reproach. 
 
During the deliberation phase, the agent appraises her plans in terms of the emotional reward they are expected to yield, given the trade off between moral and individual goals. In this phase, the emotional reward affects the agent's choices about her behavior. After the execution phase, one's and others' actions are appraised again in terms of the agent's values, giving rise to moral emotions.

These large conversational models provide little control over the generated responses, and this control is further limited in the absence of annotated conversational datasets for attribute specific generation that can be used for fine-tuning the model. In this paper, we first propose and evaluate plug-and-play methods for controllable response generation, which does not require dialogue specific datasets and does not rely on fine-tuning a large model. While effective, the decoding procedure induces considerable computational overhead, rendering the conversational model unsuitable for interactive usage. To overcome this, we introduce an approach that does not require further computation at decoding time, while also does not require any fine-tuning of a large language model. We demonstrate, through extensive automatic and human evaluation, a high degree of control over the generated conversational responses with regard to multiple desired attributes, while being fluent.",2020.0,66.0,46.0,"{'volume': 'abs/2010.04344', 'name': 'ArXiv'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Madotto2020PlugandPlayCM,\n author = {Andrea Madotto and Etsuko Ishii and Zhaojiang Lin and Sumanth Dathathri and Pascale Fung},\n journal = {ArXiv},\n title = {Plug-and-Play Conversational Models},\n volume = {abs/2010.04344},\n year = {2020}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '3064807', 'name': 'Andrea Madotto'}, {'authorId': '38524906', 'name': 'Etsuko Ishii'}, {'authorId': '100466830', 'name': 'Zhaojiang Lin'}, {'authorId': '3491117', 'name': 'Sumanth Dathathri'}, {'authorId': '40539650', 'name': 'Pascale Fung'}]"

It is increasingly being used to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions ranging from clinical therapy to national public health legislation. Whereas the design shares many properties of regression-based approaches in other epidemiological studies, there are a range of unique features of time series data that require additional methodological considerations. In this tutorial we use a worked example to demonstrate a robust approach to ITS analysis using segmented regression. We begin by describing the design and considering when ITS is an appropriate design choice. We then discuss the essential, yet often omitted, step of proposing the impact model a priori. Subsequently, we demonstrate the approach to statistical analysis including the main segmented regression model. Finally we describe the main methodological issues associated with ITS analysis: over-dispersion of time series data, autocorrelation, adjusting for seasonal trends and controlling for time-varying confounders, and we also outline some of the more complex design adaptations that can be used to strengthen the basic ITS design.",2016.0,30.0,1927.0,"{'volume': '46', 'pages': '348 - 355', 'name': 'International Journal of Epidemiology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bernal2016InterruptedTS,\n author = {J.

Given the real world social difficulties experienced by children on the spectrum, this technology has therefore been argued to offer distinct advantages and benefits for social and life skills training compared to other approaches. Whilst there has been some progress in testing the relevance and applicability of VR for children on the autism spectrum in educational contexts, there remains a significant challenge in developing robust and usable technologies that can really make a difference in real world classrooms.

In order to predict unique lifting motion trajectories, a motion simulation model based on fuzzy-logic control is presented. The human body was represented by a 2-D five-segment model, and the neural controller was specified by fuzzy logic. Fuzzy rules were defined with their antecedent part describing the fuzzy variables of scaled positional error and velocity, and with their consequent part describing scaled angular velocity. These rules were generated according to certain trends in the fuzzy variable trajectories observed from actual lifting motions. An optimization procedure was performed to specify the parameters of the membership functions by minimizing the differences between the simulated and actual final postures. Simulations were obtained for 14 novel lifting motions from seven participants. Overall, results indicated that the presented model simulated lifting motions with an accuracy that was at least comparable to some previous human motion simulation models. The accuracy of the simulations differed between joints and was highest near the beginning and end of the motions. Strengths and limitations of the modeling approach are discussed. The use of fuzzy-logic control appears to be a fruitful basis for future simulations of lifting and other human tasks.",2009.0,34.0,25.0,"{'volume': '39', 'pages': '109-118', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Qu2009SimulatingHL,\n author = {Xingda Qu and M.

The combination of these cues in the analysis of social communication, however, has been a virtually neglected area of inquiry. Two studies were conducted to test the prediction that direct gaze would facilitate the processing of facially communicated approach-oriented emotions (e.g., anger and joy), whereas averted gaze would facilitate the processing of facially communicated avoidance-oriented emotions (e.g., fear and sadness).

Two experiments were conducted to assess the reliability and validity of facial EMG as a measure of specific facial actions. In Experiment 1, two recording sites in the brow region were compared for their ability to differentiate facial actions hypothesized to be due to the activation of the corrugator supercilii from facial actions presumed to be due to the activation of proximate muscles (e.g. depressor supercilii, procerus, frontalis, levator labii superioris alaeque nasi, orbicularis oculi), and four sites in the infraorbital triangle were compared for their ability to differentiate facial actions hypothesized to be due to the activation of the zygomaticus major from facial actions presumed to be due the activation of proximate muscles (e.g. zygomaticus minor, risorius, buccinator, orbicularis oculi, orbicularis oris). Fifteen subjects were instructed to pose a series of facial actions while EMG activity was sampled simultaneously at all sites. In Experiment 2, 5 subjects returned to the laboratory for a more extensive investigation of surface EMG activity over the zygomaticus major muscle region. The results of this experiment confirmed the findings of Experiment 1. Overall, the results demonstrate that certain recording sites located over specific facial muscle regions are more sensitive and valid indices of particular facial actions than other nearby sites.",1989.0,48.0,140.0,"{'volume': '26 1', 'pages': '\n          1-16\n        ', 'name': 'Psychophysiology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tassinary1989APS,\n author = {L.

A. Kenny & L. Albright, 1987). Eighty women in unacquainted groups of 4 completed round robin trait ratings and predictions about extraversion-related behaviors. Each S then had a 5-min videotaped 1-on-l interaction with each of the other group members. Behaviors corresponding to those predicted were coded from the videotapes. Significant consensus was obtained for ratings of Extraversion and for behavioral predictions. Cross-partner consistency emerged for all coded behaviors. Although predictions of behavior were not accurate at the dyadic level, significant generalized accuracy did emerge. Thus, if a person was consensually predicted to be talkative, for example, that person tended to be talkative across partners. Results are discussed in relation to the accuracy of interpersonal perception and Swann's (1984) theory of pragmatic accuracy. As social psychologists, we have long been amazed by how quickly human perceivers form judgments based on very limited information. We have taken advantage of this proclivity by giving subjects limited stimulus information and then examining the effect of that information on human judgment. This research often demonstrates the inadequacies of snap judgments. Some (e.g., Funder, 1987) have criticized this type of research because of its limited generalizability. Particularly relevant to the issue of generalizability is the accuracy of snap judgments. Many social psychologists believe that snap judgments are based on stereotypes and heuristics and are, therefore, not likely to be very accurate. Although common sense would seem to point to the view that perceptions based on limited information are likely to be quite erroneous, people not only make snap judgments but also use them as a primary basis for guiding future interaction. For example, individuals often base their decisions about who to get to know better and who to avoid in the future on snap judgments. Given that interpersonal perceptions based on minimal information can have dramatic effects on social outcomes, the accuracy of those initial perceptions is a critical question for research in interpersonal perception. Specifically, do initial perceptions provide a reasonable basis for inferring future behavior? The accuracy of snap judgments is the major focus of this article.",1993.0,39.0,153.0,"{'volume': '65', 'pages': '1178-1187', 'name': 'Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Levesque1993AccuracyOB,\n author = {Maurice J.

Responding to facial expressions is assumed to follow this matching principle: People smile to smiles and frown to frowns. We demonstrate here that social power fundamentally changes spontaneous facial mimicry of emotional expressions, thereby challenging the direct-matching principle. Participants induced into a high-power (HP), low-power (LP), or neutral state watched dynamic happy and angry expressions from HP and LP targets while we measured facial electromyography (fEMG) over the zygomaticus major (""smiling muscle"") and corrugator supercilii (""frowning muscle""). For smiling, LP participants smiled to all targets, regardless of their expression. In contrast, HP participants exhibited standard smile mimicry toward LP targets but did not mimic the smiles of HP targets. Instead, HP participants smiled more when those HP targets expressed anger. For frowning, all participants showed a more intense mimicry pattern to HP targets. These results demonstrate that spontaneous facial responding-detected by sensitive, physiological measures of muscle activation-dynamically adapts to contextual cues of social hierarchy.",2014.0,50.0,79.0,"{'volume': '143 3', 'pages': '\n          997-1003\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of experimental psychology.

Its core idea is to transform crowd formation shapes with a least effort pair assignment using the Kuhn–Munkres algorithm, discover clusters of agent subgroups using affinity propagation and Delaunay triangulation algorithms and apply subgroup‐based social force model (SFM) to the agent subgroups to achieve alignment, cohesion and collision avoidance. Meanwhile, mutual information of the dynamic crowd is used to guide agents' movement at runtime. This approach combines both macroscopic (involving least effort position assignment and clustering) and microscopic (involving SFM) controls of the crowd transformation to maximally maintain subgroups' local stability and dynamic collective behaviour, while minimizing the overall effort (i.e. travelling distance) of the agents during the transformation. Through simulation experiments and comparisons, we demonstrate that this approach is efficient and effective to generate visually pleasing and smooth transformations and outperform several existing crowd simulation approaches including reciprocal velocity avoidances, optimal reciprocal collision avoidance and OpenSteer.",2015.0,44.0,48.0,"{'volume': '34', 'name': 'Computer Graphics Forum'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Xu2015CollectiveCF,\n author = {Mingliang Xu and Yunpeng Wu and Yangdong Ye and I.

Two methods are propagated and compared throughout the paper. Within the first method a global statistics framework of an utterance is classified by Gaussian mixture models using derived features of the raw pitch and energy contour of the speech signal. A second method introduces increased temporal complexity applying continuous hidden Markov models considering several states using low-level instantaneous features instead of global statistics. The paper addresses the design of working recognition engines and results achieved with respect to the alluded alternatives. A speech corpus consisting of acted and spontaneous emotion samples in German and English language is described in detail. Both engines have been tested and trained using this equivalent speech corpus. Results in recognition of seven discrete emotions exceeded 86% recognition rate. As a basis of comparison the similar judgment of human deciders classifying the same corpus at 79.8% recognition rate was analyzed.,2003.0,6.0,611.0,"{'volume': '1', 'pages': 'I-401', 'name': ""2003 International Conference on Multimedia and Expo.

Affect is measured through a series of self-reports from learners at strategic time posts during the period of study. Behavior is characterized in terms of a learners' engagement, interactivity, impatience and reflectivity, which constitute a set of novel high-level features derived from the clickstream of learner interactions. Cognition is evaluated from the performance of learners on assessments that are part of the course. We discover that learners in the MOOC experience multiple as well as mixed emotions as they go through the course, which we handle using the psychological dimensions of arousal and valence. This results in a set of emotional quadrants, whose co-occurrence analysis reveals a strong association with cognition and specific behavioral characteristics demonstrated by the learner. These results advance our understanding of the experience of MOOC learners to a more holistic level across the key dimensions of affect, behavior and cognition. They also have important implications for the design of the next generation MOOCs that can potentially leverage affect and behavior-aware interventions to drive greater personalization and eventually, improved learning outcomes.",2017.0,14.0,5.0,"{'pages': '279-284', 'name': '2017 Seventh International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Afzal2017TheAO,\n author = {S.

2999,f12897c2e3c50642666b917f8c8ad7542bb93594,Neuroanatomical correlates of externally and internally generated human emotion.,"OBJECTIVE
Positron emission tomography was used to investigate the neural substrates of normal human emotional and their dependence on the types of emotional stimulus.


METHOD
Twelve healthy female subjects underwent 12 measurements of regional brain activity following the intravenous bolus administration of [15O]H2O as they alternated between emotion-generating and control film and recall tasks. Automated image analysis techniques were used to characterize and compare the increases in regional brain activity associated with the emotional response to complex visual (film) and cognitive (recall) stimuli.


RESULTS
Film- and recall-generated emotion were each associated with significantly increased activity in the vicinity of the medial prefrontal cortex and thalamus, suggesting that these regions participate in aspects of emotion that do not depend on the nature of the emotional stimulus. Film-generated emotion was associated with significantly greater increases in activity bilaterally in the occipitotemporparietal cortex, lateral cerebellum, hypothalamus, and a region that includes the anterior temporal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampal formation, suggesting that these regions participate in the emotional response to certain exteroceptive sensory stimuli. Recall-generated sadness was associated with significantly greater increases in activity in the vicinity of the anterior insular cortex, suggesting that this region participates in the emotional response to potentially distressing cognitive or interoceptive sensory stimuli.

While this study should be considered preliminary, it identified brain regions that participate in externally and internally generated human emotion.",1997.0,35.0,738.0,"{'volume': '154 7', 'pages': '\n          918-25\n        ', 'name': 'The American journal of psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Reiman1997NeuroanatomicalCO,\n author = {E.

These ``forces'' are not directly exerted by the pedestrians' personal environment, but they are a measure for the internal motivations of the individuals to perform certain actions (movements). The corresponding force concept is discussed in more detail and can also be applied to the description of other behaviors. In the presented model of pedestrian behavior several force terms are essential: first, a term describing the acceleration towards the desired velocity of motion; second, terms reflecting that a pedestrian keeps a certain distance from other pedestrians and borders; and third, a term modeling attractive effects. The resulting equations of motion of nonlinearly coupled Langevin equations.

As a Latin proverb states: ‘The face is the portrait of the mind; the eyes, its informers’. This presents a significant challenge for Computer Graphics researchers who generate artificial entities that aim to replicate the movement and appearance of the human eye, which is so important in human–human interactions. This review article provides an overview of the efforts made on tackling this demanding task. As with many topics in computer graphics, a cross‐disciplinary approach is required to fully understand the workings of the eye in the transmission of information to the user. We begin with a discussion of the movement of the eyeballs, eyelids and the head from a physiological perspective and how these movements can be modelled, rendered and animated in computer graphics applications. Furthermore, we present recent research from psychology and sociology that seeks to understand higher level behaviours, such as attention and eye gaze, during the expression of emotion or during conversation. We discuss how these findings are synthesized in computer graphics and can be utilized in the domains of Human–Robot Interaction and Human–Computer Interaction for allowing humans to interact with virtual agents and other artificial entities. We conclude with a summary of guidelines for animating the eye and head from the perspective of a character animator.",2015.0,273.0,166.0,"{'volume': '34', 'name': 'Computer Graphics Forum'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ruhland2015ARO,\n author = {K.

3011,f21a0a4f47b26681e0a8713d6115f0d04481d62d,Mechanisms of social cognition.,"Social animals including humans share a range of social mechanisms that are automatic and implicit and enable learning by observation. Learning from others includes imitation of actions and mirroring of emotions. Learning about others, such as their group membership and reputation, is crucial for social interactions that depend on trust. For accurate prediction of others' changeable dispositions, mentalizing is required, i.e., tracking of intentions, desires, and beliefs. Implicit mentalizing is present in infants less than one year old as well as in some nonhuman species. Explicit mentalizing is a meta-cognitive process and enhances the ability to learn about the world through self-monitoring and reflection, and may be uniquely human. Meta-cognitive processes can also exert control over automatic behavior, for instance, when short-term gains oppose long-term aims or when selfish and prosocial interests collide. We suggest that they also underlie the ability to explicitly share experiences with other agents, as in reflective discussion and teaching. These are key in increasing the accuracy of the models of the world that we construct.",2012.0,158.0,682.0,"{'volume': '63', 'pages': '\n          287-313\n        ', 'name': 'Annual review of psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Frith2012MechanismsOS,\n author = {C.

This is consistently used as perspective to see massive social conflict. We propose analysis of the emerging conflict on its micro-causations by using computer simulations. We construct a dynamical model based on some propositions on massive conflict based upon the individual’s degree of membership to collective identity she has whether to mobilize or not. The simulations result the possibilities to see the linkage of the macro-micro properties in the case of massive conflict and suggestions on how to cope with massive conflict or even to resolve it. The paper is an endeavor to a more comprehensive methodology on how to cope with conflict on research and theory development.,2004.0,32.0,12.0,{'name': 'Microeconomic Theory eJournal'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Situngkir2004OnMC,\n author = {Hokky Situngkir},\n journal = {Microeconomic Theory eJournal},\n title = {On Massive Conflict: Macro-Micro Link},\n year = {2004}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2969489', 'name': 'Hokky Situngkir'}]"
3013,f22a8ab1dd90eea10f797d4e9f4fd46f5d6f4876,BEHAVIORAL STUDY OF OBEDIENCE.,"This article describes a procedure for the study of destructive obedience in the laboratory. It consists of ordering a naive S to administer increasingly more severe punishment to a victim in the context of a learning experiment. Punishment is administered by means of a shock generator with 30 graded switches ranging from Slight Shock to Danger: Severe Shock. The victim is a confederate of the E. The primary dependent variable is the maximum shock the S is willing to administer before he refuses to continue further. 26 Ss obeyed the experimental commands fully, and administered the highest shock on the generator. 14 Ss broke off the experiment at some point after the victim protested and refused to provide further answers. The procedure created extreme levels of nervous tension in some Ss. Profuse sweating, trembling, and stuttering were typical expressions of this emotional disturbance. One unexpected sign of tension — yet to be explained — was the regular occurrence of nervous laughter, which in some Ss developed into uncontrollable seizures. The variety of interesting behavioral dynamics observed in the experiment, the reality of the situation for the S, and the possibility of parametric variation within the framework of the procedure, point to the fruitfulness of further study.1 OBEDIENCE is as basic an element in the structure of social life as one can point to. Some system of authority is a requirement of all communal living, and it is only the man dwelling in isolation who is not forced to respond, through defiance or submission, to the commands of others. Obedience, as a determinant of behavior, is of particular relevance to our time. It has been reliably established that from 1933–45 millions of innocent persons were systematically slaughtered on command. Gas chambers were built, death camps were guarded; daily quotas of corpses were produced with the same efficiency as the manufacture of appliances. These inhumane policies may have originated in the mind of a single person, but they could only be carried out on a massive scale if a very large number of persons obeyed orders. Obedience is the psychological mechanism that links individual action to political purpose. It is the dispositional cement that binds men to systems of authority. Facts of recent history and observation in daily life suggest that for many persons obedience may be a deeply ingrained behavior tendency, indeed a prepotent impulse overriding training in ethics, sympathy, and moral conduct. C. P. Snow (1961) points to its importance when he writes: When you think of the long and gloomy history of man, you will find more hideous crimes have been committed in the name of obedience than have ever been committed in the name of rebellion. If you doubt that, read William Shirer’s Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. The German Officer Corps were brought up in the most rigorous code of obedience . . . in the name of obedience they were party to, and assisted in, the most wicked large scale actions in the history of the world [p. 24].",1963.0,17.0,3809.0,"{'volume': '67', 'pages': '\n          371-8\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of abnormal psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Milgram1963BEHAVIORALSO,\n author = {S.

In particular, we have developed a model of multimodal behaviours that includes dynamism and complex facial expressions. The first feature refers to the qualitative execution of behaviours. Our model is based on perceptual studies and encompasses several parameters that modulate multimodal behaviours. The second feature, the model of complex expressions, follows a componential approach where a new expression is obtained by combining facial areas of other expressions. Lately we have been working on adding temporal dynamism to expressions. So far they have been designed statically, typically at their apex. Only full-blown expressions could be modelled. To overcome this limitation, we have defined a representation scheme that describes the temporal evolution of the expression of an emotion. It is no longer represented by a static definition but by a temporally ordered sequence of multimodal signals.",2009.0,77.0,132.0,"{'volume': '364', 'pages': '3539 - 3548', 'name': 'Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Pelachaud2009ModellingME,\n author = {Catherine Pelachaud},\n journal = {Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences},\n pages = {3539 - 3548},\n title = {Modelling multimodal expression of emotion in a virtual agent},\n volume = {364},\n year = {2009}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2250548269', 'name': 'Catherine Pelachaud'}]"

Because of this limitation, we developed the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN). Aims To establish psychometric validation of the SPIN. Method Subjects from three clinical trials and two control groups were given the 17-item, self-rated SPIN. Validity was assessed against several established measures of social anxiety, global assessments of severity and improvement, and scales assessing physical health and disability. Results Good test – retest reliability, internal consistency, convergent and divergent validity were obtained. A SPIN score of 19 distinguished between social phobia subjects and controls. The SPIN was responsive to change in symptoms over time and reflected different responses to active drugs v. placebo. Factorial analysis identified five factors.

This paper describes the results of principal-components analyses of Presence Questionnaire (PQ) data from 325 participants following exposure to immersive virtual environments. The analyses suggest that a 4-factor model provides the best fit to our data. The factors are Involvement, Adaptation/Immersion, Sensory Fidelity, and Interface Quality. Except for the Adaptation/Immersion factor, these factors corresponded to those identified in a cluster analysis of data from an earlier version of the questionnaire. The existence of an Adaptation/Immersion factor leads us to postulate that immersion is greater for those individuals who rapidly and easily adapt to the virtual environment. The magnitudes of the correlations among the factors indicate moderately strong relationships among the 4 factors. Within these relationships, Sensory Fidelity items seem to be more closely related to Involvement, whereas Interface Quality items appear to be more closely related to Adaptation/Immersion, even though there is a moderately strong relationship between the Involvement and Adaptation/Immersion factors.",2005.0,32.0,565.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '298-312', 'name': 'Presence: Teleoperators & Virtual Environments'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Witmer2005TheFS,\n author = {B.

We conducted a single-session observational lab study with 22 five-to-ten-year-old children as a step toward understanding whether and how children might transfer a linguistic routine they learned from a CA to a conversation with another person. We found that 68% of children spontaneously used this routine in a conversation with their parent in the lab, and 55% continued to use it at home. When addressing parents, children infused the routine with warmth and playfulness that they did not use when addressing the CA, adapting it to suit their relationship with their parent. However, only 18% of children used it in conversation with an unfamiliar researcher, where they instead were more likely to follow conventional conversational norms. These findings suggest children are quick to learn linguistic routines from CAs but use social differentiation when they apply them. Children’s willingness to expand on and share the routine with their parent is consistent with the principles of the Joint Media Engagement (JME) framework and suggests CAs may be a productive medium for creating JME experiences.",2021.0,69.0,10.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 20th Annual ACM Interaction Design and Children Conference'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Hiniker2021CanCA,\n author = {Alexis Hiniker and Amelia Wang and Jonathan A.

As collaborative virtual environments become utilized more effectively, it is only natural that interactants will have the ability to touch one another. In the work presented here, we used relatively basic devices to begin to explore the expression of emotion through VIT. In Experiment 1, participants utilized a 2 DOF force-feedback joystick to express seven emotions. We examined various dimensions of the forces generated and subjective ratings of the difficulty of expressing those emotions. In Experiment 2, a separate group of participants attempted to recognize the recordings of emotions generated in Experiment 1. In Experiment 3, pairs of participants attempted to communicate the seven emotions using physical handshakes. Results indicated that humans were above chance when recognizing emotions via VIT but not as accurate as people expressing emotions through nonmediated handshakes. We discuss a theoretical framework for understanding emotions expressed through touch as well as the implications of the current findings for the utilization of VIT in human-computer interaction.",2007.0,69.0,223.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '325 - 353', 'name': 'Human–Computer Interaction'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bailenson2007VirtualIT,\n author = {J.

As a result, level of empathic response can be used to infer how much one values the welfare of a person in need. Four experiments were conducted to test these ideas. Experiments 1 and 2 revealed that a similarity manipulation led to increased valuing of a similar person's welfare and, in turn, to increased empathy when this person was in need. Experiments 3 and 4 revealed that direct manipulations of empathy (perspective-taking instructions, or false physiological arousal feedback) led to increased empathy and, in turn, to increased valuing of the welfare of the person in need.

Our solution has focused on implementing a platform for reasoning about emotions that supports the testing of such theories. 
In the platform we model a multi-agent world and give simple affective life to agents in the form of rudimentary emotions and emotion-induced actions. In addition the agents are able to reason about emotion episodes that take place in one another's lives. The implementation includes representations for twenty-four emotion types (based on the work Ortony et al., 1988) and 1400 emotion-induced actions. Agents have rudimentary personalities, including an interpretive component which causes them to construe the world in idiosyncratic ways leading to emotional states, and an expressive component which give agents a unique profile for manifesting their emotions. Agents keep internal models of the concerns of other agents which allow them to explain the emotional episodes of other agents by classifying them as instances in which one or more of the twenty-four emotion types arise. 
The implementation is simulation-based. It has been run with up to forty agents at a time. Situations arise in the modeled world, agents respond to some of these in their own unique, emotional, ways. Emotion-induced actions are generated which may be placed back in the simulation queue and further perturb the system. Other agents observe and explain the situations using both strong-theory reasoning based on a set of emotion rules, and weak-theory reasoning using a case-based heuristic classification system.",1992.0,0.0,602.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Elliott1992TheAR,\n author = {C.

The result of this shift in paradigm is now known as mobile VR (mVR). Although mVR offers numerous advantages over conventional immersive VR methods, one of the biggest limitations is related with the interaction pathways available for the mVR experiences. Using physiological computing principles, we created the PhysioVR framework, an Open-Source software tool developed to facilitate the integration of physiological signals measured through wearable devices in mVR applications. PhysioVR includes heart rate (HR) signals from Android wearables, electroencephalography (EEG) signals from a low-cost brain computer interface and electromyography (EMG) signals from a wireless armband. The physiological sensors are connected with a smartphone via Bluetooth and the PhysioVR facilitates the streaming of the data using UDP communication protocol, thus allowing a multicast transmission for a third party application such as the Unity3D game engine. Furthermore, the framework provides a bidirectional communication with the VR content allowing an external event triggering using a real-time control as well as data recording options. We developed a demo game project called EmoCat Rescue which encourage players to modulate HR levels in order to successfully complete the in-game mission. EmoCat Rescue is included in the PhysioVR project which can be freely downloaded. This framework simplifies the acquisition, streaming and recording of multiple physiological signals and parameters from wearable consumer devices providing a single and efficient interface to create novel physiologically-responsive mVR applications.",2016.0,37.0,32.0,"{'pages': '1-6', 'name': '2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Applications and Services (Healthcom)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cardona2016PhysioVRAN,\n author = {John Edison Muñoz Cardona and T.

In this project, we develop a CA reading partner that incorporates components of effective conversational guidance (i.e., questions to stimulate thinking, specific feedback, and adaptive scaffolding) and examine children's interactions with this CA. We identify patterns in children's language production, flow maintenance, and affect when responding to the CA. We then lay out a set of affordances and challenges for developing CAs as conversation partners. We propose that, rather than attempting to develop CAs as an exact replicate of human conversational partners, we should treat child-agent interaction as a new genre of conversation and calibrate CAs based on children's actual communicative practices and needs.",2020.0,73.0,39.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the Interaction Design and Children Conference'},"{'bibtex': ""@Article{Xu2020ExploringYC,\n author = {Ying Xu and M.

3071,f5e61ef588ad90ec1d6349d23c8af8d00eaf457a,Integrating Empathy and Interpersonal Emotion Regulation.,"When individuals experience empathy, they often seek to bolster others' well-being. But what do empathizers want others to feel? Though psychologists have studied empathy and prosociality for decades, this question has yet to be clearly addressed. This is because virtually all existing research focuses on a model under which improving others' well-being also comprises heightening their positive affect or decreasing their negative affect and helping them reach their own emotional goals. In this review, I argue that real-life empathic goals encompass a broader range-including sometimes worsening targets' affect or contravening their wishes in order to improve their well-being-that can be productively integrated into the framework of interpersonal emotion regulation (IER). I review the empathic IER spectrum in a number of contexts, including close relationships, professional caregiving, and group-based emotions. Integrating empathy and IER provides a synthetic and generative way to ask new questions about how social emotions produce prosocial actions. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Psychology, Volume 71 is January 4, 2020.

Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is considered an efficacious treatment for anxiety in children with ASD. Additional research is needed to examine the efficacy of a transdiagnostic treatment approach, whereby the same treatment can be applied to multiple emotional problems, beyond solely anxiety. The purpose of the present study was to examine the efficacy of a manualized and individually delivered 10‐session, transdiagnostic CBT intervention, aimed at improving emotion regulation and mental health difficulties in children with ASD. Methods Sixty‐eight children (M age = 9.75, SD = 1.27) and their parents participated in the study, randomly allocated to either a treatment immediate (n = 35) or waitlist control condition (n = 33) (ISRCTN #67079741). Parent‐, child‐, and clinician‐reported measures of emotion regulation and mental health were administered at baseline, postintervention/postwaitlist, and at 10‐week follow‐up. Results Children in the treatment immediate condition demonstrated significant improvements on measures of emotion regulation (i.e., emotionality, emotion regulation abilities with social skills) and aspects of psychopathology (i.e., a composite measure of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, adaptive behaviors) compared to those in the waitlist control condition. Treatment gains were maintained at follow‐up. Conclusions This study is the first transdiagnostic CBT efficacy trial for children with ASD. Additional investigations are needed to further establish its relative efficacy compared to more traditional models of CBT for children with ASD and other neurodevelopmental conditions.",2018.0,80.0,96.0,"{'volume': '59', 'pages': '1180 - 1191', 'name': 'Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Weiss2018ARW,\n author = {J.

There are two main ways, verbal and non-verbal methods, which play an important role for one in perceiving personality of others. Extensive research was conducted in relating personality with verbal, paralinguistic and gestures cues. However, there are not much research, to our knowledge, that relates the appearance and perceived personality of robots. The main objective of this research is to relate individual design features with big five perceived personality of the robots. We used the results of rated perceptions across 100 pictorial images of robots and relate the results with the 40 individual design features using General Linear Model (GLM). The initial results of the GLM analysis showed that participants' rating of personality of robot fell along the dimension of perceived friendliness which is a common rotation of extroversion and agreeableness. Some relationships were found between humanlike design features and perceived friendliness of robots. Since participants are more familiar with humans, participants perceived robots with humanlike features friendlier than the others. Some other findings such as color and surface material were found related with participants' perceived friendliness as well. In the future, we will work on the analysis of the main and interaction effects of individual features on user's perceived friendliness.",2012.0,31.0,17.0,"{'volume': '41 Suppl 1', 'pages': '\n          272-6\n        ', 'name': 'Work'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chee2012PersonalityOS,\n author = {Benedict Tay Tiong Chee and Park Taezoon and Qianli Xu and Jamie Ng and O.

This chapter from the Negotiator's Fieldbook explains why among multiple models of fairness, people tend to believe that the one that applies here is the one that happens to favor them. This often creates a bitter element in negotiation, as each party proceeds from the unexamined assumption that its standpoint is the truly fair one. For a negotiation to end well, it is imperative for both parties to assess the fairness of their own proposals from multiple points of view, not just their instinctive one – and to consider the fairness of their negotiation procedures as well as of their substantive proposals. Though the fairness of negotiation procedure appears to exercise greater influence upon some negotiators than others, perceptions of procedural fairness generally result in increased perceptions of substantive fairness, increased compliance with negotiated results, improved relations between the negotiators and perhaps even a reduced need to engage in the sort of face saving that can result in choices that are not in negotiators' economic self-interest.",2004.0,6.0,39.0,{'name': 'Negotiation & Dispute Resolution eJournal'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Welsh2004PerceptionsOF,\n author = {N.

Without guidance on how in-game assessment affects player perceptions and experiences, designers and researchers are in danger of making decisions that harm data quantity and quality, and perceptions of privacy. We conducted a user study to understand self-report collection from NPC dialogues and traditional in-game overlay questionnaires. Data quality and player experience measures autonomy, curiosity, immersion, and mastery did not differ significantly, although NPC dialogues enhanced meaning. NPC dialogues supported an increase in data quantity through voluntary 5-point scales but not via open responses; however, they also increased the perceived intimacy of shared information despite comparable objective intimacy.

3091,f731b6745d829241941307c3ebf163e90e200318,Active Shape Models-Their Training and Application,"!, Model-based vision is firmly established as a robust approach to recognizing and locating known rigid objects in the presence of noise, clutter, and occlusion. It is more problematic to apply modelbased methods to images of objects whose appearance can vary, though a number of approaches based on the use of flexible templates have been proposed. The problem with existing methods is that they sacrifice model specificity in order to accommodate variability, thereby compromising robustness during image interpretation. We argue that a model should only be able to deform in ways characteristic of the class of objects it represents. We describe a method for building models by learning patterns of variability from a training set of correctly annotated images.

Some experience emotions in a highly differentiated manner, clearly distinguishing among a variety of negative and positive discrete emotions. Others experience emotions in a relatively undifferentiated manner, treating a range of like-valence terms as interchangeable. Drawing on self-regulation theory, we hypothesised that individuals with highly differentiated emotion experience should be better able to regulate emotions than individuals with poorly differentiated emotion experience. In particular, we hypothesised that emotion differentiation and emotion regulation would be positively related in the context of intense negative emotions, where the press for emotion regulation is generally greatest. To test this hypothesis, participants' negative and positive emotion differentiation was assessed using a 14-day diary protocol. Participants' regulation of negative and positive emotions was assessed using laboratory measures. As predicted, negative emotion differentiation was positively related to the frequency of negative emotion regulation, particularly at higher levels of emotional intensity.",2001.0,32.0,857.0,"{'volume': '15', 'pages': '713 - 724', 'name': 'Cognition and Emotion'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Barrett2001KnowingWY,\n author = {L.

It projects a positive and realistic approach to issues confronting disabled people and their families. The lives and aspirations of the disabled are discussed in an easily readable style, which includes such topics as: labeling, accessibility, institutionalization, relationships with the medical field, and representation in the media and technology. Special People is not written for the professional who requires extensive information on a specific topic or exceptionality. Rather, it is a short book (172 pages) that brings together knowledge and thought from several disciplines to deal with the everyday problems of coping. Doctors, clergymen, parents, older students, relatives, and the general reader will find Special People useful and informative. One of the strongest aspects of this book is the author's ability to relate her personal experiences and feelings. She is sensitive to the adjustment problems of the nonhandicapped and helps them to understand their own reactions by sharing hers. For example, after realizing that a particular child had Downs' Syndrome, Ms. Cohen relates, ""The shock stayed with me all afternoon. Even though I had known that this was a program for retarded infants, I hadn't been prepared. I was still plagued by my stereotypes"" (p. 117). There are pertinent references throughout the text to professional articles, books for adults, and some for children that expound upon the topics discussed. Regular classroom teachers may be interested in reading, ""Don't Feel Sorry for Paul,"" which describes the life of a physically handicapped child. Parents may chose to read, ""About Handicaps,"" to children who are afraid of ""catching handicap germs."" There are also several accounts of innovative programs, such as Sweden's consideration of blind, physically, and mentally handicapped persons when traffic patterns were changed. This was done because ""they are passengers ... they are pedestrians ... they are part of the world around the driver .... "" There are several excerpts from autobiographies of disabled people, transcripts of conversations with parents, and reactions of children. Helen Jones describes inconsistencies in the airlines' willingness to accept disabled passengers: her statement is especially piognant for those who organize service companies for the public. The parent of a physically handicapped child expresses appreciation for a sequence on the ""Mr. Rogers"" television show, which included disabled children. Shirley Cohen does not leave her reader uninvolved. One chapter, entitled ""And Now You,"" presents situations for selfinquiry as well as for discussion. While the general reader and the disabled themselves are asked to think about their own behaviors and feelings, the professional team member can re-examine his own beliefs regarding the equality and worthiness of the people he serves. This chapter is quite short and could be expanded. One possible criticism is Ms. Cohen's introduction as it later relates to her text on public education.

Although research into presence is still at an early stage of development, there is a consensus that presence has multiple determinants. To identify and test which parameters affect presence, a reliable, robust and valid means of measuring presence is required. In this paper, we describe the categories of factors thought to have an impact on presence. Furthermore, we present an overview of various approaches taken to measuring presence, which can be divided into two general categories: subjective measures and objective corroborative measures. Since presence is a subjective experience, the most direct way of assessment is through users' subjective report. This approach has serious limitations however, and should be used judiciously. Objective measures, such as postural, physiological or social responses to media, can be used to corroborate subjective measures, thereby overcoming some of their limitations. At present, the most promising direction for presence measurement is to develop and use an aggregate measure of presence that is comprised of both subjective and objective components, tailored to the specific medium under study.",2000.0,58.0,607.0,{'volume': '3959'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Ijsselsteijn2000PresenceCD,\n author = {W.

3110,f8a78b016bc6c45a0c1cecab2fe459c226bde467,Submissive behaviour and psychopathology.,"OBJECTIVES
A variety of behaviours have been identified as submissive (Buss & Craik, 1986). These are believed to be associated with vulnerability to psychopathology. This paper explores the construct and measurement of submissive behaviours and their association with psychopathology.


DESIGN
Two self-report scales were designed to measure the frequencies of (a) typical submissive behaviours (SBS) and (b) passive/withdrawal and affiliative strategies focused on conflict de-escalation (CDS). The association of these scales with psychopathology was explored in a series of questionnaire studies.


METHODS
Study 1 assessed the SBS using a student sample (N = 332) and a mixed clinical group (N = 136). Of these, 177 students and 66 patients also completed the SCL-90-R. In Studies 2 and 3, the CDS and its association with depressive symptoms were assessed using a student sample (N = 154) and a depressed patient group (N = 60).


RESULTS
The SBS and CDS appeared reliable. There was a positive relationship between the SBS and the SCL-90-R, including interpersonal sensitivity and unexpressed hostility. The passive/withdrawal subscale of the CDS was associated with depressive symptoms. Evidence was obtained for sex differences with the affiliative subscale.


CONCLUSIONS
Some forms of submissive behaviour, especially those associated with passive/withdrawal and inhibition, are associated with a wide range of psychological problems.",1997.0,0.0,273.0,"{'volume': '36 ( Pt 4)', 'pages': '\n          467-88\n        ', 'name': 'The British journal of clinical psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Allan1997SubmissiveBA,\n author = {S.

Past research provided inconclusive answers: several experiments confirmed this possibility, but several others disagreed. On the other hand, previous studies have shown the important role of VR characteristics, such as realism or co-presence, in evoking other psychological phenomena. However, no study has investigated the interplay between the presence of computer-generated agents and perceived social realism in evoking social facilitation in virtual reality. To this end, the present randomized control study was conducted. The sample consisted of professional firefighters (N = 48), divided into an experimental group with virtual bystanders and a control group without them. Subjects were instructed to perform a rescue procedure in a virtual reality headset. The performance of participants was logged and they completed questionnaires regarding sense of presence in the virtual environment, perceived realism of the environment and perceived co-presence of virtual agents. The obtained results confirmed the role of social realism as a moderator of the occurrence of social facilitation in the presence of computer-generated agents. At the same time, the main effect of facilitation was not confirmed. These results support predictions that the subjective feeling of being in a realistic company of others may be more important in evoking social facilitation than objective facts. Furthermore, the results contribute to the debate regarding the mechanism of social facilitation, suggesting that simple augmentation of the environment with social distractors is not always enough, thus questioning the attentional explanation of the effect. Taken together, our results extend previous findings on social facilitation and open up new possibilities for designing effective virtual environments.",2020.0,54.0,14.0,"{'volume': '11', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Strojny2020ModeratorsOS,\n author = {P.

In this paper, we address the question whether robot mood displayed during an imitation game can (a) be recognized by participants and (b) produce contagion effects. Robot mood was displayed by applying a generic framework for mood expression using body language. By modulating the set of available behavior parameters in this framework for controlling pose and motion dynamics, the gestures performed by the humanoid robot NAO were adjusted to display either a positive or negative mood. In the study performed, we varied both mood as well as task difficulty. Our results show that participants are able to differentiate between positive and negative robot mood. Moreover, self-reported mood matches the mood of the robot in the easy task condition. Additional evidence for mood contagion is provided by the fact that we were able to replicate an expected effect of negative mood on task performance: in the negative mood condition participants performed better on difficult tasks than in the positive mood condition, even though participants' self-reported mood did not match that of the robot.",2014.0,41.0,48.0,{'pages': '973-980'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Xu2014RobotMI,\n author = {Junchao Xu and J.

ParticipantsNineteen participants with ABI (minimum 1 year postinjury) from Western New York and Southern Ontario, Canada. Interventions(1) Emotion processing from faces (“facial affect recognition” or FAR) and (2) emotion processing from written context by using “stories of emotional inference” (SEI). Ten randomly assigned participants received the FAR intervention, and 9 received the SEI protocol. Both interventions were administered 1 hour per day, 3 times per week, and completed in 6 to 9 sessions, and both incorporated participants' personal emotional experiences into training. Outcome Measures(1) Facial affect, (2) vocal affect, (3) affect from videos, (4) emotional inference from context, and (5) emotional behavior. There were 2 pretests, a posttest, and a 2-week follow-up. ResultsFAR participants showed significantly improved emotion recognition from faces, ability to infer emotions from context, and socioemotional behavior, while the SEI group members exhibited significantly improved ability to infer how they would feel in a given context.

Yet, a shortage of qualified faculty and difficulty with aligning learners’ schedules often prevent sustainable and scalable IPE. A virtual IPE intervention was developed to circumvent these barriers and compared to a blended-learning IPE intervention. We used a pre-test and post-test design with two comparison interventions to test the effects of these IPE interventions on changes in teamwork knowledge, skills, and attitudes. The interventions were delivered to pre-licensure learners at a large, metropolitan medical and a nursing school. We used one-sample and independent-sample t-tests to analyze data from 220 learners who received the blended-learning intervention in 2011 and 540 learners who received the virtual learning intervention in 2012. The students in the blended-learning intervention did not significantly (p < 0.05) outperform the students in the virtual learning intervention for any of the measured outcomes, except for medical students’ attitudes around team value. Virtual IPE learning is an effective, scalable, and sustainable solution for imparting foundational teamwork knowledge in health profession students.",2015.0,26.0,50.0,"{'volume': '29', 'pages': '476 - 482', 'name': 'Journal of Interprofessional Care'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Djukic2015ELearningWV,\n author = {M.

Under the Mixed condition, the VHs were divided into three groups equally and each group was uniquely assigned one of the three emotions (i.e., positive, negative, and neutral). Users collected ten items from a virtual reality market. To complete the tasks, they interacted using natural speech with the emotional VHs. Three language conditions were investigated: one condition in USA and another two conditions in Taiwan. The group of participants in USA interacted with the VHs in English; and the two groups of participants in Taiwan interacted with the VHs using a foreign (English) language and a native (Mandarin) language respectively. We discovered that the medium of communication or language familiarity had a strong influence on participants' emotional reactions. When participants interacted in a foreign language with VHs with a positive emotional disposition, we found their positive emotional reactions were subdued and negative reactions were elevated. However, this was not the case when participants interacted with VHs in their native language, as their emotional reactions were contingent on the emotional disposition of the VHs.",2021.0,75.0,3.0,"{'name': '2021 IEEE Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (VR)', 'pages': '188-197'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Volonte2021EffectsOL,\n author = {Matias Volonte and Chang-Chun Wang and Elham Ebrahimi and Yu-Chun Hsu and Kuan-Yu Liu and Sai-Keung Wong and Sabarish V.

Our model integrates the influence of individual personalities and interpersonal relationships. Through the interaction between the agents and the external environment parameters, the emotional contagion model based on well-known theories in psychology is used to complete the agents’ behavior planning and path planning function. We combine the epidemiological SIR model with the cellular automaton model to capture various emotional modelling for multi-agent simulations. The overall formulation involves different emotional parameters, such as patience, urgency, and friendliness, closely related to crowd queuing. In addition, to manage the order of the queue, governing agents are added to prevent the emotional outbreak. We perform qualitative and quantitative comparisons between our simulation results and real-world observations on various scenarios. Numerous experiments show that reasonably increasing the queue channel and adding governing agents can effectively improve the quality of queues.",2022.0,67.0,0.0,"{'name': 'ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation', 'pages': '1 - 23', 'volume': '33'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Xue2022APM,\n author = {Junxiao Xue and Mingchuan Zhang and Hui Yin},\n booktitle = {ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation},\n journal = {ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation},\n pages = {1 - 23},\n title = {A Personality-based Model of Emotional Contagion and Control in Crowd Queuing Simulations},\n volume = {33},\n year = {2022}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2512487', 'name': 'Junxiao Xue'}, {'authorId': '1680884', 'name': 'Mingchuan Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2113971622', 'name': 'Hui Yin'}]"

In this study we show that fundamental group-level properties, such as intra-group stability and inter-group conflict, can be systematically quantified by visual descriptors. This is made possible through learning a novel Collective Transition prior, which leads to a robust approach for group segregation in public spaces. From the prior, we further devise a rich set of group property visual descriptors.

However, the mechanisms underlying this emotional contagion, for example, whether different feelings spread in unlikely ways or how the spread of emotions relates to the social network, is rarely investigated. Indeed, because of high costs and spatio-temporal limitations, explorations of this topic are challenging using conventional questionnaires or controlled experiments. Because they are collection points for natural affective responses of massive individuals, online social media sites offer an ideal proxy for tackling this issue from the perspective of computational social science. In this paper, based on the analysis of millions of tweets in Weibo, surprisingly, we find that anger is more contagious than joy, indicating that it can spark more angry follow-up tweets. Moreover, regarding dissemination in social networks, anger travels easily along weaker ties than joy, meaning that it can infiltrate different communities and break free of local traps because strangers share such content more often. Through a simple diffusion model, we reveal that greater contagion and weaker ties function cooperatively to speed up anger's spread. The diffusion of real-world events with different dominant emotions provides further testimony to the findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that quantitative long-term evidence has been presented that reveals a difference in the mechanism by which joy and anger are disseminated. Our findings shed light on both personal anger management in human communications and on controlling collective outrage in cyberspace.",2016.0,50.0,9.0,"{'volume': 'abs/1608.03656', 'name': 'ArXiv'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fan2016EasierCA,\n author = {Rui Fan and Ke Xu and Jichang Zhao},\n journal = {ArXiv},\n title = {Easier contagion and weaker ties make anger spread faster than joy in social media},\n volume = {abs/1608.03656},\n year = {2016}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2089733995', 'name': 'Rui Fan'}, {'authorId': '145389711', 'name': 'Ke Xu'}, {'authorId': '1886666', 'name': 'Jichang Zhao'}]"

Using methods designed to study epistemic trust in human informants (e.g., Koenig, Clement, & Harris, 2004), the current study investigates children’s and adults’ selective trust in a technological and human informant. Children (ages 4 and 5) and adults were presented with queries designed to probe their willingness to seek out and accept information from human versus technological informants.

These symbols are widely known and commonly recognized among computer-mediated communication (CMC) users, and they are described by most observers as substituting for the nonverbal cues that are missing from CMC in comparison to face-to-face communication. Their empirical impacts, however, are undocumented. An experiment sought to determine the effects of three common emoticons on message interpretations. Hypotheses drawn from literature on nonverbal communication reflect several plausible relationships between emoticons and verbal messages. The results indicate that emoticons’ contributions were outweighed by verbal content, but a negativity effect appeared such that any negative message aspect—verbal or graphic—shifts message interpretation in the direction of the negative element.",2001.0,72.0,788.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '324 - 347', 'name': 'Social Science Computer Review'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Walther2001TheIO,\n author = {J.

In the course of a computer-mediated negotiation, participants received information about the emotional state (anger, happiness, or none) of their opponent. Consistent with a strategic-choice perspective, Experiment 1 showed that participants conceded more to an angry opponent than to a happy one. Experiment 2 showed that this effect was caused by tracking--participants used the emotion information to infer the other's limit, and they adjusted their demands accordingly. However, this effect was absent when the other made large concessions. Experiment 3 examined the interplay between experienced and communicated emotion and showed that angry communications (unlike happy ones) induced fear and thereby mitigated the effect of the opponent's experienced emotion. These results suggest that negotiators are especially influenced by their opponent's emotions when they are motivated and able to consider them.",2004.0,112.0,750.0,"{'volume': '86 1', 'pages': '\n          57-76\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kleef2004TheIE,\n author = {Gerben A. van Kleef and C.

Cognitive behavioral therapy is an effective tool for helping people overcome social anxieties disorders, including public speaking anxiety. However, most people do not engage in this therapy for public speaking anxiety, due to time constraints and other barriers. We present a virtual coach that uses cognitive behavioral therapy techniques to help presenters restructure irrational thoughts associated with public speaking anxiety. The design of the virtual coach was informed by an analysis of a corpus of cognitive restructuring examples generated by a clinical psychologist.

Grounding our arguments in psychological literature on the effects of mood on information processing, motivation, and decision heuristics, we develop hypotheses about how mood can significantly affect individuals' use of structured decision protocols. In support of our hypotheses, results from an experimental study of complex decision-making suggest that, in situations where a structured decision protocol is the usual method of decision-making, individuals in moderately negative moods are significantly more likely than those in moderately positive moods to: (1) carefully execute all the steps of a structured decision protocol, (2) execute the steps of a structured decision protocol in the correct order, and (3) rely on the outcome of the structured decision protocol as the primary basis for the decision. We discuss these findings in terms of their implications for both organizational decision models and psychological models of mood and decision-making. In general, our findings help establish mood as an important variable in models of organizational decision-making and help shed light on often conflicting findings about the benefits of positive vs. negative mood for individual decision-making.",1999.0,81.0,149.0,"{'volume': '10', 'pages': '181-198', 'name': 'Organization Science'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Elsbach1999TheEO,\n author = {Kimberly D.

It is timely to consolidate the evidence base and establish the prevalence and variance of anxiety in HF samples. Methods:A systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression were conducted to identify the prevalence, variance, and measurement of anxiety in patients with HF. Results:A total of 14,367 citations were identified, with 73 studies meeting inclusion criteria. A random effects pooled prevalence of 13.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.25%–16.86%) for anxiety disorders, 28.79% (95% CI, 23.30%–34.29) for probable clinically significant anxiety, and 55.5% (95% CI, 48.08%–62.83%) for elevated symptoms of anxiety was identified. Rates of anxiety were highest when measured using the Brief Symptom Scale-Anxiety scale (72.3%) and lowest when measured using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (6.3%). Conclusion:Many patients with HF would benefit if screened for anxiety and treated. The conceptualization and measurement of anxiety accounted for most variance in prevalence rates. The Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 or the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale appear to be the most appropriate instruments for this clinical population, with evidence to suggest they can discriminate between depression and anxiety, omit somatic items that may contaminate identification of anxiety in a population with physical comorbidities, and provide thresholds with which to differentiate patients and target treatments. Although there are limitations with the collation of diverse measurement methods, the current review provides researchers and clinicians with a more granular knowledge of prevalence estimates of anxiety in a population of HF patients.",2016.0,80.0,112.0,"{'volume': '31', 'pages': '367 - 379', 'name': 'The Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Easton2016PrevalenceAM,\n author = {K.

A study of video interactions between human participants demonstrated that people display more head tilts and pauses when they revealed highly intimate information about themselves; they presented more head nods and eye gazes during less intimate sharing.

With innovations ranging from ‘virtual psychotherapists’ to social robots in dementia care and autism disorder, to robots for sexual disorders, artificially intelligent virtual and robotic agents are increasingly taking on high-level therapeutic interventions that used to be offered exclusively by highly trained, skilled health professionals. In order to enable responsible clinical implementation, ethical and social implications of the increasing use of embodied AI in mental health need to be identified and addressed. Objective This paper assesses the ethical and social implications of translating embodied AI applications into mental health care across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology and Psychotherapy. Building on this analysis, it develops a set of preliminary recommendations on how to address ethical and social challenges in current and future applications of embodied AI. Methods Based on a thematic literature search and established principles of medical ethics, an analysis of the ethical and social aspects of currently embodied AI applications was conducted across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, the analysis was structured around the following three steps: assessment of potential benefits; analysis of overarching ethical issues and concerns; discussion of specific ethical and social issues of the interventions. Results From an ethical perspective, important benefits of embodied AI applications in mental health include new modes of treatment, opportunities to engage hard-to-reach populations, better patient response, and freeing up time for physicians. Overarching ethical issues and concerns include: harm prevention and various questions of data ethics; a lack of guidance on development of AI applications, their clinical integration and training of health professionals; ‘gaps’ in ethical and regulatory frameworks; the potential for misuse including using the technologies to replace established services, thereby potentially exacerbating existing health inequalities. Specific challenges identified and discussed in the application of embodied AI include: matters of risk-assessment, referrals, and supervision; the need to respect and protect patient autonomy; the role of non-human therapy; transparency in the use of algorithms; and specific concerns regarding long-term effects of these applications on understandings of illness and the human condition. Conclusions We argue that embodied AI is a promising approach across the field of mental health; however, further research is needed to address the broader ethical and societal concerns of these technologies to negotiate best research and medical practices in innovative mental health care. We conclude by indicating areas of future research and developing recommendations for high-priority areas in need of concrete ethical guidance.",2018.0,102.0,220.0,"{'volume': '21', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fiske2018YourRT,\n author = {A.

Lett. 111, 128701 (2013).] presented an analysis of the interrelation between two processes accounting for the spreading of an epidemic, and the spreading of information awareness to prevent infection, on top of multiplex networks. The results in the case in which awareness implies total immunization to the disease revealed the existence of a metacritical point at which the critical onset of the epidemics starts, depending on completion of the awareness process. Here we present a full analysis of these critical properties in the more general scenario where the awareness spreading does not imply total immunization, and where infection does not imply immediate awareness of it. We find the critical relation between the two competing processes for a wide spectrum of parameters representing the interaction between them. We also analyze the consequences of a massive broadcast of awareness (mass media) on the final outcome of the epidemic incidence. Importantly enough, the mass media make the metacritical point disappear. The results reveal that the main finding, i.e., existence of a metacritical point, is rooted in the competition principle and holds for a large set of scenarios.",2014.0,12.0,263.0,"{'volume': '90 1', 'pages': '\n          012808\n        ', 'name': 'Physical review.

In sync with their apparent ""chronic"" (cross-situational) relevance, faces have been argued to be processed independently of the task one is currently performing. Many of these demonstrations have involved ""capture of attention"" or increased interference by faces functioning as distractors. Here we ask whether multiple repetitions of task irrelevant faces leave a trace in the system. Specifically, we tested whether repeating structures instantiated by task irrelevant faces are unintentionally or implicitly learned. Our findings indicate that although faces are indeed unique in that they are the only stimulus found to lead to implicit learning of complex rules when irrelevant, such learning is small in magnitude.

(Presence is defined as the subjective experience of being in one place or environment, even when one is physically situated in another.) We believe that presence is a normal awareness phenomenon that requires directed attention and is based in the interaction between sensory stimulation, environmental factors that encourage involvement and enable immersion, and internal tendencies to become involved. Factors believed to underlie presence were described in the premier issue of Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments. We used these factors and others as the basis for a presence questionnaire (PQ) to measure presence in VEs. In addition we developed an immersive tendencies questionnaire (ITQ) to measure differences in the tendencies of individuals to experience presence. These questionnaires are being used to evaluate relationships among reported presence and other research variables. Combined results from four experiments lead to the following conclusions: the PQ and ITQ are internally consistent measures with high reliability; there is a weak but consistent positive relation between presence and task performance in VEs; individual tendencies as measured by the ITQ predict presence as measured by the PQ; and individuals who report more simulator sickness symptoms in VE report less presence than those who report fewer symptoms.",1998.0,40.0,5146.0,"{'volume': '7', 'pages': '225-240', 'name': 'Presence'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Witmer1998MeasuringPI,\n author = {B.

To cater to this point, we propose an agent model of emotion development. The agent model is based on the OCC model and operant conditioning theory. We define a set of functions based on OCC model to search the emotional state-space graph. At the same time, we give the algorithm of operant conditions procedure.

 Machine learning algorithms have been applied to predict agent behaviors in real-world dynamic systems, such as advertiser behaviors in sponsored search and worker behaviors in crowdsourcing. Behavior data in these systems are generated by live agents: once systems change due to adoption of prediction models learnt from behavior data, agents will observe and respond to these changes by changing their own behaviors accordingly. Therefore, the evolving behavior data will not be identically and independently distributed, posing great challenges to theoretical analysis. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose to use Markov Chain in Random Environments (MCRE) to describe the behavior data, and perform generalization analysis of machine learning algorithms on its basis. We propose a novel technique that transforms the original time-variant MCRE into a higher-dimensional time-homogeneous Markov chain, which is easier to deal with. We prove the convergence of the new Markov chain when time approaches infinity. Then we obtain a generalization bound for the machine learning algorithms on the behavior data generated by the new Markov chain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that performs the generalization analysis on data generated by complex processes in real-world dynamic systems.

A smaller proportion of these has specifically examined how individuals cope with trauma. Due to differences between researchers in how trauma is defined, a definitive number is difficult to determine. However, a search for the key words trauma and coping yielded 1,000 articles. Given the magnitude of this literature, we will not attempt to provide a full review.

Finally, we will provide whether a brief review of the relationship between coping and health outcomes, and focus on whether coping strategies can affect both the psychological and physical outcomes of trauma. THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO COPING There are four basic theoretical and methodological approaches to coping. Psychoanalytic approaches focus on the use of defense mechanisms, while personality approaches focus on coping styles. Both of these assume that adaptation is primarily a function of personal characteristics. In contrast, the coping process approach draws upon cognitive behavioral models, and is more likely to emphasize environmental demands and influences on coping. Coping process approaches tie the coping strategies to a particular stressful episode. Finally, COPING AND HEALTH 3 daily coping processes use experience sampling techniques to examine how individuals cope throughout the course of the day with a wide variety of problems. Psychoanalytic Approaches Research on how individuals adapt grew out of early psychoanalytic studies of defense mechanisms, which are considered to be unconscious ways of warding off anxiety. DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) currently identifies seven major types of defense mechanisms, and orders them hierarchically from more to less severe. The most severe is adaptive or ""mature@ defense mechanisms include altruism, humor, and sublimation, as well as suppression. Cramer (2000) compared the similarities and differences between defense mechanisms and coping processes. Defense mechanisms are unconscious, nonintentional, dispositional, hierarchical, and associated with pathology, while coping processes are conscious, used intentionally, situationally determined, nonhierarchical, and associated with normality. In other words, defense mechanisms are designated a priori as being more or less adaptive, and are not COPING AND HEALTH 4 consciously chosen.

These deficits have been previously linked to problems with social cognition. However, we reasoned that AS/HFA individuals' Theory of Mind deficits also might lead to problems with emotion regulation. To assess emotional functioning in AS/HFA, 27 AS/HFA adults (16 women) and 27 age-, gender-, and education-matched typically developing (TD) participants completed a battery of measures of emotion experience, labeling, and regulation. With respect to emotion experience, individuals with AS/HFA reported higher levels of negative emotions, but similar levels of positive emotions, compared with TD individuals. With respect to emotion labeling, individuals with AS/HFA had greater difficulties identifying and describing their emotions, with approximately two-thirds exceeding the cutoff for alexithymia. With respect to emotion regulation, individuals with AS/HFA used reappraisal less frequently than TD individuals and reported lower levels of reappraisal self-efficacy. Although AS/HFA individuals used suppression more frequently than TD individuals, no difference in suppression self-efficacy was found.

In examining the way people experience empathy in their every-day lives, in the context of real, meaningful, present relationships, it seems that both cognitive and affective aspects of this experience play a significant role and may appear either together or separately. While it is rare for empathy to exist without any cognitive understanding, we also found that the experiences of empathy that contain emotional components reflect a fuller and more meaningful relational experience.

We tested what personality virtual agents conveyed through gesture alone when the agents were programmed to display introversion versus extraversion (Experiment 1) and high versus low emotional stability (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, both measures indicated participants perceived the extraverted agent as extraverted, but the open-question technique highlighted the perception of both agents as highly agreeable whereas the inventory indicated that the extraverted agents were also perceived as more open to new experiences. In Experiment 2, participants perceived agents expressing high versus low emotional stability differently depending on assessment style. With inventory questions, the agents differed on both emotional stability and agreeableness. With the open-ended question, participants perceived the high stability agent as extraverted and the low stability agent as disagreeable.

For social organisms travelling in groups, like the fish in a school or the birds in a flock, sharing information can further improve their situational awareness and reaction times. Data on the benefits and costs of social coordination, however, have largely allowed our understanding of why collective behaviours have evolved to outpace our mechanistic knowledge of how they arise. Recent studies have begun to correct this imbalance through fine-scale analyses of group movement data. One approach that has received renewed attention is the use of information theoretic (IT) tools like mutual information, transfer entropy and causation entropy, which can help identify causal interactions in the type of complex, dynamical patterns often on display when organisms act collectively. Yet, there is a communications gap between studies focused on the ecological constraints and solutions of collective action with those demonstrating the promise of IT tools in this arena. We attempt to bridge this divide through a series of ecologically motivated examples designed to illustrate the benefits and challenges of using IT tools to extract deeper insights into the interaction patterns governing group-level dynamics. We summarize some of the approaches taken thus far to circumvent existing challenges in this area and we conclude with an optimistic, yet cautionary perspective.",2020.0,118.0,28.0,"{'volume': '17', 'name': 'Journal of the Royal Society Interface'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Pilkiewicz2020DecodingCC,\n author = {K.

The proposed emotion model can reflect the dynamic process of individual in group on three factors: individual emotion, perilous field, and crowd emotion. Specifically, we first convert the evacuation scene to Delaunay triangulation representations. Then, we use the optimization-driven geodesic approach to calculate the best evacuation path with user-specified geometric constraints, such as crowd density, obstacle information, and perilous field. Finally, the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics method is used for local avoidance of collisions with nearby agents in real-time simulation.

This technology, with its unique ability to simulate complex, real situations and contexts, offers researchers unprecedented opportunities to investigate human behavior in well controlled designs in the laboratory. One important application of VR is the investigation of pathological processes in mental disorders, especially anxiety disorders. Research on the processes underlying threat perception, fear, and exposure therapy has shed light on more general aspects of the relation between perception and emotion. Being by its nature virtual, i.e., simulation of reality, VR strongly relies on the adequate selection of specific perceptual cues to activate emotions. Emotional experiences in turn are related to presence, another important concept in VR, which describes the user’s sense of being in a VR environment. This paper summarizes current research into perception of fear cues, emotion, and presence, aiming at the identification of the most relevant aspects of emotional experience in VR and their mutual relations. A special focus lies on a series of recent experiments designed to test the relative contribution of perception and conceptual information on fear in VR. This strand of research capitalizes on the dissociation between perception (bottom–up input) and conceptual information (top-down input) that is possible in VR. Further, we review the factors that have so far been recognized to influence presence, with emotions (e.g., fear) being the most relevant in the context of clinical psychology. Recent research has highlighted the mutual influence of presence and fear in VR, but has also traced the limits of our current understanding of this relationship. In this paper, the crucial role of perception on eliciting emotional reactions is highlighted, and the role of arousal as a basic dimension of emotional experience is discussed. An interoceptive attribution model of presence is suggested as a first step toward an integrative framework for emotion research in VR.

The precise components of each expression were verified using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). The UCDSEE is the first FACS-verified set to include the three "" self-conscious "" emotions known to have recognizable expressions (embarrassment, pride, and shame), as well as the 6 previously established "" basic "" emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise), all posed by the same 4 expressers (African and White males and females). This new set has numerous potential applications in future research on emotion and related topics. In the late 1960s, researchers discovered that a small set of emotions have distinct, cross-culturally recognized, nonverbal ex-One of the most important and generative advances was the development of non-verbal coding systems for assessing distinct emotion expressions, including Izard's (1979) maximally discriminative facial movement coding system (MAX) and Ekman and Friesen's (1978) more widely used Facial Action Coding System (FACS). FACS is an anatomically based system that delineates every facial muscle movement, or action unit (AU), relevant to the expression of anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. Over 20 years of research has demonstrated that certain AUs are reliably associated with each distinct emotion (see Ekman, 2003, for a review). On the basis of these findings, researchers have developed guidelines showing which AUs are associated with which emotions (e.g., Ekman & Friesen, 1978); these guidelines can be used to create standardized posed emotion expressions that accurately and reliably convey each emotion. Resultant expressions do not suffer from many of the problems associated with emotion expression stimuli developed without a standardized system (e.g., by asking expressers to pose according to their own intuitions or those of the researcher about the appearance of particular expressions). Expressions posed without a standardized system (e. 1999) may suffer from problems of validity—not accurately reflecting the intended emotion—and reliability—lacking consistency across perceivers or across different expressions presumed to reflect the same emotion. a valid and reliable set of posed emotion expressions that generate high recognition rates across cultures. The POFA has been used in a wide range of studies, including developmental, cross-cultural, neuroimaging, and behavioral research (see Matsumoto et al., 2008). By utilizing these FACS-verified expressions, researchers ensure that observed effects can be attributed to the targeted emotions. …",2009.0,26.0,141.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Tracy2009DevelopmentOA,\n author = {J.

Despite the controversy around its definition, most researchers would agree that empathy is a multidimensional phenomenon which involves a vicarious experience of another person’s affective state and an understanding of another person’s affective experience. Self-report measures of empathy constitute an important tool for both research and clinical practice. The main goal of this study was to adapt and study the psychometric properties of the Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy (QCAE), a worldwide used measure of empathy, in a Portuguese community sample (N = 562). Confirmatory factor analyses supported the factor structure of the original QCAE. Results show that the Portuguese version of the QCAE has sound psychometric properties, with good structural validity and internal consistency for both scales (i.e., affective and cognitive) and respective subscales of the instrument (i.e., Emotion Contagion, Proximal Responsivity, Peripheral Responsivity, Perspective Taking and Online Simulation). We tested both a five correlated factor structure (Model 1) and a second-order model that postulates the affective and cognitive dimensions (Model 2). Our results show that while both models present acceptable goodness of fit indices, Model 1 performs slightly better. In conclusion, the Portuguese version of the QCAE may prove a useful tool for future cross-cultural assessments of empathy in both research and clinical practice.",2018.0,71.0,25.0,"{'volume': '13', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Queirós2018PsychometricPO,\n author = {Andreia Queirós and Eugénia Fernandes and R.
