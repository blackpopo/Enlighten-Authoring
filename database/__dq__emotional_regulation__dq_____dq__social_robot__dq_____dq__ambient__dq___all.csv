02311988230fb47089e6577c6e35d6d44754d8ff,"Background A common challenge with existing psycho-social prevention interventions for children is the lack of effective, engaging, and scalable delivery mechanisms, especially beyond in-person therapeutic or school-based contexts. Although digital technology has the potential to address these issues, existing research on technology-enabled interventions for families remains limited. This paper focuses on emotion regulation (ER) as an example of a core protective factor that is commonly targeted by prevention interventions. Objective The aim of this pilot study was to provide an initial validation of the logic model and feasibility of in situ deployment for a new technology-enabled intervention, designed to support children’s in-the-moment ER efforts. The novelty of the proposed approach relies on delivering the intervention through an interactive object (a smart toy) sent home with the child, without any prior training necessary for either the child or their carer. This study examined (1) engagement and acceptability of the toy in the homes during 1-week deployments, and (2) qualitative indicators of ER effects, as reported by parents and children. In total, 10 families (altogether 11 children aged 6-10 years) were recruited from 3 predominantly underprivileged communities in the United Kingdom, as low SES populations have been shown to be particularly at risk for less developed ER competencies. Children were given the prototype, a discovery book, and a simple digital camera to keep at home for 7 to 8 days. Data were gathered through a number of channels: (1) semistructured interviews with parents and children prior to and right after the deployment, (2) photos children took during the deployment, and (3) touch interactions automatically logged by the prototype throughout the deployment. Results Across all families, parents and children reported that the smart toy was incorporated into the children’s ER practices and engaged with naturally in moments the children wanted to relax or calm down. Data suggested that the children interacted with the toy throughout the deployment, found the experience enjoyable, and all requested to keep the toy longer. Children’s emotional connection to the toy appears to have driven this strong engagement. Parents reported satisfaction with and acceptability of the toy. Conclusions This is the first known study on the use of technology-enabled intervention delivery to support ER in situ. The strong engagement, incorporation into children’s ER practices, and qualitative indications of effects are promising. Further efficacy research is needed to extend these indicative data by examining the psychological efficacy of the proposed intervention. More broadly, our findings argue for the potential of a technology-enabled shift in how future prevention interventions are designed and delivered: empowering children and parents through child-led, situated interventions, where participants learn through actionable support directly within family life, as opposed to didactic in-person workshops and a subsequent skills application.","[{'authorId': '113152411', 'name': 'Nikki Theofanopoulou'}, {'authorId': '1740889', 'name': 'K.

This paper examines the influence of conducting play sessions with Kaspar on the social and communication skills of children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) and suggests possible ways for using the robot as a (therapeutic) tool in a Greek school for children with special needs. Over a period of 10 weeks 7 children took part in a total of 111 individual play sessions with the Kaspar robot. Each child participated in between 12 and 18 sessions with the robot. The results from this study indicate that the play sessions with Kaspar appear to have positively influenced the behaviours of some of the children in specific domains such as communication and interaction, prompted speech, unprompted imitation and focus/attention. Furthermore, the children’s teachers expressed positive views regarding the impact of the play sessions on the children and offered interesting suggestions about the ways in which the robot could potentially be used in everyday teaching tasks and were eager to obtain a Kaspar for their classroom activities.","[{'authorId': '113758752', 'name': 'Efstathia Karakosta'}, {'authorId': '1724361', 'name': 'K.

0358659c9e6f2962997517820e1b42932a51bf9a,"This work introduces a new socially assistive robot termed MARIA T21 (meaning “Mobile Autonomous Robot for Interaction with Autistics”, with the addition of the acronym T21, meaning “Trisomy 21”, which is used to designate individuals with Down syndrome). This new robot is used in psychomotor therapies for children with Down syndrome (contributing to improve their proprioception, postural balance, and gait) as well as in psychosocial and cognitive therapies for children with autism spectrum disorder. The robot uses, as a novelty, an embedded mini-video projector able to project Serious Games on the floor or tables to make already-established therapies funnier to these children, thus creating a motivating and facilitating effect for both children and therapists. The Serious Games were developed in Python through the library Pygame, considering theoretical bases of behavioral psychology for these children, which are integrated into the robot through the robot operating system (ROS). Encouraging results from the child–robot interaction are shown, according to outcomes obtained from the application of the Goal Attainment Scale. Regarding the Serious Games, they were considered suitable based on both the “Guidelines for Game Design of Serious Games for Children” and the “Evaluation of the Psychological Bases” used during the games’ development. Thus, this pilot study seeks to demonstrate that the use of a robot as a therapeutic tool together with the concept of Serious Games is an innovative and promising tool to help health professionals in conducting therapies with children with autistic spectrum disorder and Down syndrome. Due to health issues imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the sample of children was limited to eight children (one child with typical development, one with Trisomy 21, both female, and six children with ASD, one girl and five boys), from 4 to 9 years of age. For the non-typically developing children, the inclusion criterion was the existence of a conclusive diagnosis and fulfillment of at least 1 year of therapy. The protocol was carried out in an infant psychotherapy room with three video cameras, supervised by a group of researchers and a therapist. The experiments were separated into four steps: The first stage was composed of a robot introduction followed by an approximation between robot and child to establish eye contact and assess proxemics and interaction between child/robot. In the second stage, the robot projected Serious Games on the floor, and emitted verbal commands, seeking to evaluate the child’s susceptibility to perform the proposed tasks. In the third stage, the games were performed for a certain time, with the robot sending messages of positive reinforcement to encourage the child to accomplish the game. Finally, in the fourth stage, the robot finished the games and said goodbye to the child, using messages aiming to build a closer relationship with the child.","[{'authorId': '2146121492', 'name': 'João Antonio Campos Panceri'}, {'authorId': '2146124489', 'name': 'É.

From those 404 documents, we systematically analyzed and discussed 102 documents, including peer-reviewed papers and grey literature. Our review classifies studies in three categories: Public Connectors, Blockchain of Blockchains, and Hybrid Connectors. Each category is further divided into sub-categories based on defined criteria. We classify 67 existing solutions in one sub-category using the Blockchain Interoperability Framework, providing a holistic overview of blockchain interoperability.

The AMRM was formulated by adapting two popular conventional approaches, namely, model-rival method and label-training procedure. In our validation trials, we used a semi-autonomous parrot-inspired robot, called KiliRo, to simulate a set of autonomous behaviors. A proposed robot-assisted therapy using AMRM was pilot tested with nine children with autism spectrum disorder for five consecutive days in a clinical setting. We analyzed the facial expressions of children when they interacted with KiliRo using an automated emotion recognition and classification system, Oxford emotion API (Application Programming Interface). Results provided some indication that the children with autism spectrum disorder appeared attracted and happy to interact with the parrot-inspired robot. Short qualitative interviews with the children’s parents, the pediatrician, and the child psychologist who participated in this pilot study, also acknowledged that the proposed parrot-inspired robot and the AMRM may have some merit in aiding in improving learning and social interaction abilities of children with autism spectrum disorder.","[{'authorId': '3419480', 'name': 'Jaishankar Bharatharaj'}, {'authorId': '98206491', 'name': 'Loulin Huang'}, {'authorId': '1779417', 'name': 'R.

Previous meta-analyses indicate that computerized cognitive training (CCT) is a safe and efficacious intervention for cognition in older adults. However, efficacy varies across populations and cognitive domains, and little is known about the efficacy of CCT in people with mild cognitive impairment or dementia.


METHOD
The authors searched Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL, and CENTRAL through July 1, 2016, for randomized controlled trials of CCT in older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Overall cognition, individual cognitive domains, psychosocial function, and activities of daily living were pooled separately for mild cognitive impairment and dementia trials.


RESULTS
The overall effect on cognition in mild cognitive impairment across 17 trials was moderate (Hedges' g=0.35, 95% CI=0.20-0.51). There was no evidence of publication bias or difference between active- and passive-controlled trials. Small to moderate effects were found for global cognition, attention, working memory, learning, and memory, with the exception of nonverbal memory, and for psychosocial functioning, including depressive symptoms. In dementia, statistically significant effects were found on overall cognition (k=11, g=0.26, 95% CI=0.01-0.52) and visuospatial skills, but these were driven by three trials of virtual reality or Nintendo Wii.


CONCLUSIONS
CCT is efficacious on global cognition, select cognitive domains, and psychosocial functioning in people with mild cognitive impairment.

Methods: We examined patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of neurocognitive function, psychological symptoms, and QOL in association with the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) and neighborhood ambient air quality in 5,131 survivors (52.1% female, mean [SD] age 29.9 [7.1], mean [SD] age at diagnosis 7.9 [6.2], 81.5% White, and 42.3% leukemia) from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. The ADI, which reflects neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation, was coded using survivors’ residential 9-digit ZIP codes; neighborhood ambient air quality was coded by the NASA Satellite-based pollution measures PM2.5 and NO2 by ZIP codes. Impairment on PROs was identified from scores on the Neurocognitive Questionnaire (≤10th%ile), the Brief Symptoms Inventory (BSI; ≥90th%ile), the pain survey (yes vs. no), and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 ( < 16th%ile). Multivariable logistic regression assessed associations between social determinants and PROs with odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusting for demographic and treatment (chemotherapy and radiation) factors. Results: Among survivors, impaired neurocognitive function was reported in 26.5% for task efficiency, 25.4% memory, 15.4% emotional regulation, and 11.6% organization. For the BSI and pain survey, 56.7%, 11.3%, 8.3%, and 7.3% reported total pain, depression, somatization, and anxiety, respectively. Poor physical and mental domains of QOL were reported by 10.9% and 17.0% of survivors, respectively. Survivors with an ADI in the top deprived 20% neighborhoods (compared to the bottom 80% neighborhoods) reported worse neurocognitive function (task efficiency, OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.45-2.46; emotional regulation, OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.30-2.34; and memory, OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.29-2.17), more severe symptoms (pain, OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.05-1.70; somatization, OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.05-2.28; and depression, OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.19-2.44), and poorer QOL (physical, OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.28-2.38; mental, OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.35-2.36), controlling for treatment factors. Survivors from the 20% most deprived neighborhoods showed worse task efficiency (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.03-2.17), adjusting for all confounders. PM2.5 and NO2 levels were not associated with impairment on PROs, adjusting for all confounders. Conclusions: Social determinants, particularly living in the top deprived neighborhoods, are adversely associated with neurocognitive, psychological, and QOL outcomes in adult childhood cancer survivors. These findings indicate the critical need of evaluating childhood cancer survivors’ area-level deprivation and tailoring support and interventions for survivors based on their social and structural contexts.","[{'authorId': '7238339', 'name': 'J.

We investigated the frequency of participants’ interactions among each other and assessed any changes in interaction using social network analysis. Interactions were assessed through manual observation before and after exposure to the robot. Urinary and salivary tests were performed to obtain protein and α-amylase levels, respectively, to report the physiological changes in participating children with autism spectrum disorder before and after interacting with the robot. This is a pioneering human–robot interaction study to investigate changes in stress levels using salivary samples. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and arterial oxygen saturation level in blood were also monitored to investigate the physiological changes in participating children before, during, and after interacting with our parrot-inspired robot, KiliRo. The results show that the robot can help increase social interaction among children with autism spectrum disorder and assist in learning tasks. Furthermore, the clinical biochemistry test report using urinary and salivary samples indicates that the stress levels of children with autism reduced notably after interacting with the robot. Nevertheless, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen levels in blood did not show positive change in all participants.","[{'authorId': '3419480', 'name': 'Jaishankar Bharatharaj'}, {'authorId': '98206491', 'name': 'Loulin Huang'}, {'authorId': '1398416516', 'name': 'A.

In a recent volume of this journal, Sanvodal-Norton and Shkedy (2019) published a criticism of behavior analysis including the professionals and entire field as a discipline—of demonstrating unethical behavior, creating prompt dependency in the learners, destroying internal motivation, and refusing to collaborate with new and other treatment philosophies. The current paper is a response to the these claims by providing several examples of peer-reviewed studies that contradicts the authors’ arguments, and summarizing the information of the included study’s findings by and other objective. The primary purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that, contrary to the perspectives of Sanvodal-Norton and Shkedy (2019), ABA is scientific approach that identifies environmental variables that influence socially significant behaviors and develop strategies to cause behavior change that is practical and applicable, improve educational outcomes, and provide real-life support for parents and families who are seeking treatment for their loved one with ASD. In doing so, this paper will demonstrate that ABA is an efficacious approach that is supported by numerous scientific studies in the peer-reviewed literature","[{'authorId': '2003212255', 'name': 'Kathryn A.

It considers both teachers’ and children’s reflections regarding the use of this ‘novel’ technology. Observations in 30 classrooms with interactive whiteboards (IWB) and interviews with teachers and children from these classroom settings are analysed to develop an understanding of current practice regarding the use of IWBs and the thinking behind this. Findings reveal that the teachers value and promote ‘playful’ and ‘interactive’ experiences as vehicles for learning. Evidence of the use of the IWB technology to support learning experiences which were either ‘playful’ or ‘interactive’ were however limited. This study suggests that IWB are routinely being used to support a more instructionist form of pedagogy than would be supported by the socio‐cultural principles held by the majority of teachers interviewed or of the new foundation phase currently being implemented in Wales. Affordances, identified by practitioners, of IWB technology to support a ‘pedagogy of play’ are discussed.

0d7fdb1481e3867b0ac7baf2cfe8984b4c7b92ee,"Background Robot-mediated interventions show promise in supporting the development of children on the autism spectrum. Objectives In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we summarize key features of available evidence on robot-interventions for children and young people on the autism spectrum aged up to 18 years old, as well as consider their efficacy for specific domains of learning. Data sources PubMed, Scopus, EBSCOhost, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore. Grey literature was also searched using PsycExtra, OpenGrey, British Library EThOS, and the British Library Catalogue. Databases were searched from inception until April (6th) 2021. Synthesis methods Searches undertaken across seven databases yielded 2145 articles. Forty studies met our review inclusion criteria of which 17 were randomized control trials. The methodological quality of studies was conducted with the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. A narrative synthesis summarised the findings. A meta-analysis was conducted with 12 RCTs. Results Most interventions used humanoid (67%) robotic platforms, were predominantly based in clinics (37%) followed home, schools and laboratory (17% respectively) environments and targeted at improving social and communication skills (77%). Focusing on the most common outcomes, a random effects meta-analysis of RCTs showed that robot-mediated interventions significantly improved social functioning (g = 0.35 [95%CI 0.09 to 0.61; k = 7). By contrast, robots did not improve emotional (g = 0.63 [95%CI -1.43 to 2.69]; k = 2) or motor outcomes (g = -0.10 [95%CI -1.08 to 0.89]; k = 3), but the numbers of trials were very small. Meta-regression revealed that age accounted for almost one-third of the variance in effect sizes, with greater benefits being found in younger children. Conclusions Overall, our findings support the use of robot-mediated interventions for autistic children and youth, and we propose several recommendations for future research to aid learning and enhance implementation in everyday settings.

Participants (N= 144; ranging from 3 to 11 years) were given hypothesis-testing tasks and asked to explain their answers. Participants were presented with information that was either consistent or inconsistent with their own beliefs. Each task consisted of scenarios in which the outcome was either good or bad oral health. When the information was belief consistent and the outcome was good, or when the information was belief inconsistent and the outcome was bad, children were more likely to choose scientifically appropriate tests of the stated hypothesis (i.e. manipulate only one variable). Evidence-based explanations were associated with scientifically appropriate choices in the good-outcome, belief-inconsistent scenario and the belief-consistent, bad-outcome scenario. Participants' performance on these tasks is explained by considering the plausibility of causal variables. A control of variables strategy was used to test hypotheses in cases in which the evidence was consistent with participants' beliefs and knowledge of causal mechanisms. In contrast, when the evidence was inconsistent with participants' beliefs, children chose to manipulate behaviours likely to lead to a positive health outcome. These findings demonstrate that context and prior knowledge interact to play an important role in children's scientific reasoning.","[{'authorId': '2193215', 'name': 'S.

We examined this topic in a 3-week study of an online platform providing training and practice in the social regulation of emotion. We found that participants who engaged more by helping others (vs. sharing and receiving support for their own problems) showed greater decreases in depression, mediated by increased use of reappraisal in daily life. Moreover, social regulation messages with more other-focused language (i.e., second-person pronouns) were (a) more likely to elicit expressions of gratitude from recipients and (b) predictive of increased use of reappraisal over time for message composers, suggesting perspective-taking enhances the benefits of practicing social regulation.

The integration of social robots to support learners has already shown promise to benefit the learning process in this area. In this paper, we focus on the applicability of an adaptive robotic tutor in a university setting. To this end, we conducted a long-term field study implementing an adaptive robotic tutor to support students with exam preparation over three sessions during one semester. In a mixed design, we compared the effect of an adaptive tutor to a control condition across all learning sessions. With the aim to benefit not only motivation but also academic success and the learning experience in general, we draw from research in adaptive tutoring, social robots in education, as well as our own prior work in this field. Our results show that opting in for the robotic tutoring is beneficial for students. We found significant subjective knowledge gain and increases in intrinsic motivation regarding the content of the course in general. Finally, participation resulted in a significantly better exam grade compared to students not participating. However, the extended adaptivity of the robotic tutor in the experimental condition did not seem to enhance learning, as we found no significant differences compared to a non-adaptive version of the robot.","[{'authorId': '151110885', 'name': 'Melissa Donnermann'}, {'authorId': '11715171', 'name': 'Philipp Schaper'}, {'authorId': '2117313647', 'name': 'Birgit Lugrin'}]",7.0,,37.0,Social Robots in Applied Settings: A Long-Term Study on Adaptive Robotic Tutors in Higher Education,2022.0

Although there has been a considerable amount of research on automatic emotion recognition in adults, emotion recognition in children has been understudied. This problem is more challenging as children tend to fidget and move around more than adults, leading to more self-occlusions and non-frontal head poses. Also, the lack of publicly available datasets for children with annotated emotion labels leads most researchers to focus on adults. In this paper, we introduce a newly collected multimodal emotion dataset of children between the ages of four and fourteen years old. The dataset contains 1102 audio-visual clips annotated for 17 different emotional states: six basic emotions, neutral, valence and nine complex emotions including curiosity, uncertainty and frustration.

Parallel to this, children’s creative levels show a decline related to different factors, including the standardized teaching and learning dynamics present in traditional school systems. This work aims to investigate if the activities with robots already present in schools affect children’s creativity levels. To study this, we compared creative levels of children across three study conditions: (1) Experimental condition 1: Children performed STEM activities in school by learning how to program robots; (2) Experimental condition 2: Children performed STEAM activities by learning how to design robots; (3) Control condition: Children engaged in a music class. We applied the Test for Creative Thinking-Drawing Production (TCT-DP), a validated test that measures creative potential, before and after the intervention. Our results showed that the creativity levels of children increased from pre- to post-testing, revealing the effect of all intervention groups in potentiating creativity. Additionally, results showed that creative levels were significantly higher in the control condition. This result was expected since this condition consisted of an artistic musical intervention where creativity is foreseen to be stimulated. When analyzing the effects of the interventions on the two dimensions of TCT-DP (i.e., adaptiveness and innovativeness), results showed that both the control and the programming condition stimulated innovativeness. This result seems to show that STEM activities can stimulate non-conventional ways of thinking, similarly to creative activities such as a music class. While much has been studied about how STEM activities influence the knowledge of children, little is known if STEM also contributes to the stimulation of their creativity. This study promotes investigation in this topic and shows the potential of using robots to unlock creative potentials in children.","[{'authorId': '1401670338', 'name': 'Patrícia Alves-Oliveira'}, {'authorId': '39176756', 'name': 'Patrícia Arriaga'}, {'authorId': '115401246', 'name': 'Sara Ibérico Nogueira'}, {'authorId': '115420343', 'name': 'A.

A number of recent critical reflections are reviewed and the 'disciplinary anxieties', which this approach to HCI has aroused, are discussed. Drawing on Feyerabend's philosophical scepticism over methods and contributions to the Sociology of Science, it is suggested that design research might build its own 'limited rationality' rather than be brought in line with supposed norms for good research or criteria for rigour and relevance of unfamiliar provenance. To this end, a concept of 'annotated portfolio' is advanced, and detailed, as a means for capturing the family resemblances that exist in a collection of artefacts, simultaneously respecting the particularity of specific designs and engaging with broader concerns. The concept is demonstrated through annotating nine well-known pieces created by the Goldsmiths Interaction Research Studio. Treating this collection as an annotated portfolio highlights, formulates and collates interaction design issues in this work in a novel manner. On this basis, annotated portfolios are proposed as a viable means for communicating design thinking in HCI in a descriptive yet generative and inspirational fashion, without having recourse to standards of 'theory' which fit design practice uncomfortably.","[{'authorId': '118892592', 'name': 'Jo A.

Technologies that assist the elderly in independent living are essential for enhancing care in a cost-effective and reliable manner. Elderly care applications often demand real-time observation of the environment and the resident’s activities using an event-driven system. As an emerging area of research and development, it is necessary to explore the approaches of the elderly care system in the literature to identify current practices for future research directions. Therefore, this work is aimed at a comprehensive survey of non-wearable (i.e., ambient) sensors for various elderly care systems. This research work is an effort to obtain insight into different types of ambient-sensor-based elderly monitoring technologies in the home. With the aim of adopting these technologies, research works, and their outcomes are reported. Publications have been included in this survey if they reported mostly ambient sensor-based monitoring technologies that detect elderly events (e.g., activities of daily living and falls) with the aim of facilitating independent living. Mostly, different types of non-contact sensor technologies were identified, such as motion, pressure, video, object contact, and sound sensors. Besides, multicomponent technologies (i.e., combinations of ambient sensors with wearable sensors) and smart technologies were identified. In addition to room-mounted ambient sensors, sensors in robot-based elderly care works are also reported. Research that is related to the use of elderly behavior monitoring technologies is widespread, but it is still in its infancy and consists mostly of limited-scale studies. Elderly behavior monitoring technology is a promising field, especially for long-term elderly care.

The present research aims to assess the feasibility of conducting an RCT evaluating the effectiveness of a social skills intervention using Kinesics and Synchronisation in Personal Assistant Robotics (Kaspar) with children with ASD. Methods and analysis Forty children will be recruited. Inclusion criteria are the following: aged 5–10 years, confirmed ASD diagnosis, IQ over 70, English-language comprehension, a carer who can complete questionnaires in English and no current participation in a private social communication intervention. Children will be randomised to receive an intervention with a therapist and Kaspar, or with the therapist only. They will receive two familiarisation sessions and six treatment sessions for 8 weeks. They will be assessed at baseline, and at 10 and 22 weeks after baseline. The primary outcome of this study is to evaluate whether the predetermined feasibility criteria for a full-scale trial are met. The potential primary outcome measures for a full-scale trial are the Social Communication Questionnaire and the Social Skills Improvement System. We will conduct a preliminary economic analysis. After the study has ended, a sample of 20 participants and their families will be invited to participate in semistructured interviews to explore the feasibility and acceptability of the study’s methods and intervention. Ethics and dissemination Parents/carers will provide informed consent, and children will give assent, where appropriate. Care will be taken to avoid pressure or coercion to participate. Aftercare is available from the recruiting NHS Trust, and a phased withdrawal protocol will be followed if children become excessively attached to the robot.

This skill is particularly crucial because it involves exposure to potentially dangerous situations and is an important step in the development of independence. Virtual reality (VR) facilitates learning in a safe environment enabling a gradual increase in the complexity of tasks approaching the conditions of real life. The purpose of this study was to examine whether children with ASD are capable of learning the skills needed to cross a street safely via a desktop street-crossing virtual environment (VE), and to determine whether these skills are transferred to real life. The experimental group included six children with ASD. The control group included six grade and gender-matched typically developed children. Performance while street crossing within the VE was scored. A pedestrian safety checklist scored from taped video clips assessed the children's street crossing skills within a protected real sidewalk before and after VR intervention. The results demonstrated that children with ASD were capable of learning to use the VE. Significant differences were found between the performance of the experimental and control groups within the VE. Moreover, the experimental group showed substantial improvement in their ability to cross the virtual street safely after intervention. Finally, half of the experimental subjects made considerable improvement in their pedestrian behavior within the protected real-street setting following the VR intervention. The results indicate that VR may be used for teaching street-crossing skills due the likelihood to real life situations.","[{'authorId': '1974650', 'name': 'N.

Although risperidone is effective for the treatment of lethargy and inadequate speech, concerns about the association between weight gain, waist circumference and risperidone require a need for evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio in its use. There was a significant association between weight gain, waist circumference and risperidone. In conclusion, it was possible to suggest the efficacy of risperidone for the treatment of lethargy and inadequate speech. Finally, we emphasize that the risk-benefit in its use should be evaluated (Protocol number CRD42019122316).","[{'authorId': '1729431216', 'name': 'B.

ToM is a complex skill requiring the ability to form mental concepts, to represent complex constructs verbally, to inhibit some mental states in favour of others, and to consider and compare multiple perspectives. It is critical to consider cognitive influences on the ability to develop and convey ToM skills to ensure that deficits in other cognitive domains do not falsely present as ToM deficits. This consideration is particularly vital in ASD populations with known difficulties not only in ToM, but also in intellectual functioning, language, and executive functioning. This article reviews the influence of intellectual ability, language, working memory, and inhibition skills on the presentation of ToM; with particular focus on ToM in ASD. We discuss practical suggestions based on clinical experience in neuropsychological practice and research in South Africa for the successful assessment of ToM ability.","[{'authorId': '46609050', 'name': 'Katie Hamilton'}, {'authorId': '4000033', 'name': 'M.

1d861f0672e9ed68edd0bcdf1df1491648a88088,"Abstract Background The relationship marketing research has been carried out in the field of marketing research for 30 years. In the past, the research perspective has always been to explore the interest relationship between enterprises or service providers, but it is rarely studied from the perspective of consumers or customers. In addition, previous studies focused on the dimensions of service quality and customer loyalty, rather than the way and type of service contact, the content of customer relationship interest or the voluntary performance of customers. In the tourism industry, which mainly provides services through interpersonal communication, the development of intelligent technology reduces the cultivation of interpersonal emotion. Will it also reduce the perceived relationship benefits of consumers or customers, thereby reducing customer loyalty and voluntary performance? The main research problem of this study is to verify the relationship between service encounter, relationship benefit and customer voluntary performance from the perspective of labor emotion, and take Taiwan and Chinese restaurant consumers as the survey object to verify whether there is homogeneity and stability between multi group models. Research Objects and Methods Firstly, this study reviews the dimensions of service contact, relationship benefit and customer voluntary performance, and establishes a measurement scale. 100 questionnaires from Taiwan and Chinese Mainland were pre- tested and analyzed. After revising the questionnaire, 400 formal questionnaires were distributed in the two places, and 547 valid questionnaires were recovered. The effective questionnaire recovery rate was 68%. The follow-up study process used Spss20.0, Amos20.0 software for item analysis, relationship validation, multi-group modeling, and mediating effect validation. Results A two-tier structural equation model of service encounter, relationship benefit and customer voluntary performance was constructed; The service encounter dimension includes the ease of use of technical services, the economy of technical services, the economy of interpersonal services and the initiative of interpersonal services; The dimension of relationship benefit includes six sub dimensions: trust interests, social interests, special treatment interests, honor interests, knowledge interests and identity interests; Customer voluntary performance means loyalty, cooperation and participation. In the verification of the relationship part, the hypothesis is valid, the relationship interest plays an intermediary role in service encounter and customer voluntary performance, and the multi cluster model is also homogeneous and stable. The simple slope test of the posterior path showed that the expression inhibition in the high and low regulation difficulty groups could significantly and positively predict the explicit positive emotion. When the level of regulation difficulty is low, expression inhibition predicts the predictive coefficient of explicit positive emotion ( β = 0. 54, t = 10. 18, p ＜ 0. 001) ; When the adjustment difficulty level is high, the prediction coefficient ( β = 0. 90, t = 7. 11, p ＜ 0. 001). The analysis of direct effect and mediating effect shows that the mediating effect of expression inhibition in the relationship between interpersonal emotion regulation and explicit positive emotion also increases at the three levels of emotion regulation difficulty, that is, with the increase of the level of emotion regulation difficulty, Interpersonal emotion regulation is easier to increase explicit positive emotion by enhancing individual expression inhibition. Conclusion This study verifies the models of service encounter, relationship interest and customer spontaneous behavior from the perspective of Chinese society, and verifies the homogeneity and stability of the models between Taiwan and Chinese restaurant consumer groups. Relationship benefits play an intermediary role in the dimensions of service encounter and customer voluntary performance, and the verification results of multiple groups of models are also homogeneous and stable. From the above results, we can see that Chinese society is influenced by Confucianism and differential sequence model. The concept of relational interest pays more attention to emotional exchange and hierarchy than the western society with social exchange theory as the core, which leads to the differences between Chinese and Western societies. In addition, in the research of service encounter, the provision of technical services is gradually trusted and accepted by consumers, which improves consumers' voluntary performance, which indicates that technology is gradually developing in the direction of personification. In the people-oriented tourism industry, technological progress leads to the change of catering industry mode, the change of consumers' dining behavior, and how to effectively combine the interaction between people and technology to improve service and experience. Therefore, this study suggests establishing a catering process suitable for human-computer interaction and technological interaction based on the characteristics of the company's core products, such as using an artificially intelligent machine for service, which in turn improves consumer trust, a trust that is sufficient for the AI one-to-one system to function as a psychological intervention. We need to fully recognize the importance of AI robots in emotional factors and actively improve their role psychological capabilities, paying special attention to their impact on life attitudes and healthy behaviors, and being a healthy self-manager, coordinator and collaborator. According to the psychological characteristics of these groups, we should actively and flexibly organize colorful activities, strive to create a relaxed and harmonious living atmosphere, create friendly and mutually beneficial AI emotional relationships, encourage and guide these groups, adjust their psychology to the best state, and promote their good cognition and healthy development of life.","[{'authorId': '114459957', 'name': 'Chia‐Wei Chao'}, {'authorId': '11957135', 'name': 'Mao-Chou Hsu'}]",0.0,"{'name': 'International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology', 'pages': 'A96 - A97', 'volume': '25'}",0.0,"RESEARCH ON CATERING SERVICE ENCOUNTER, RELATIONSHIP BENEFIT AND CUSTOMER VOLUNTARY PERFORMANCE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF EMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR CHANGE -- A CASE STUDY OF CATERING CONSUMERS IN TAIWAN AND MAINLAND CHINA",2022.0

Connecting many stand-alone IoT systems through the Internet introduces many challenges, with security being front-and-center since much of the collected information will be exposed to a wide and often unknown audience. Unfortunately, due to the intrinsic capability limits of low-end IoT devices, which account for a majority of the IoT end hosts, many traditional security methods cannot be applied to secure IoT systems, which open a door for attacks and exploits directed both against IoT services and the broader Internet. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a unified IoT framework based on the MobilityFirst future Internet architecture that explicitly focuses on supporting security for the IoT. Our design integrates local IoT systems into the global Internet without losing usability, interoperability and security protection. Specifically, we introduced an IoT middleware layer that connects heterogeneous hardware in local IoT systems to the global MobilityFirst network. We propose an IoT name resolution service (IoT-NRS) as a core component of the middleware layer, and develop a lightweight keying protocol that establishes trust between an IoT device and the IoT-NRS.","[{'authorId': '2591839', 'name': 'Xiruo Liu'}, {'authorId': '1679125', 'name': 'Meiyuan Zhao'}, {'authorId': '2571133', 'name': 'Sugang Li'}, {'authorId': '2115710036', 'name': 'Feixiong Zhang'}, {'authorId': '1702051', 'name': 'W.

In this contribution we address the topic of healthcare robots and privacy. We use actor network theory (ANT) to shed light on the privacy implications of healthcare robots from a specific theoretical point of view. ANT is a descriptive, constructivist approach that takes into account the agency of objects, concepts and ideas as well as the relationality of technology and the social. It has been applied to complex technological innovations, such as ehealth systems. We use some of the main concepts of ANT—actants, translations, tokens/quasiobjects, punctualization, obligatory passage point—to “map” the privacy ecosystem in robotic healthcare technology, thereby analyzing the complex interplay of robots and humans in that context. Altogether, our contribution shows that ANT is a fruitful lens through which to study the interaction between humans and (social) robots because of its richness of useful concepts, its balanced perspective which evades both technology-determinism and social-determinism, and its openness towards new connected technology.","[{'authorId': '6889723', 'name': 'C.

To discover the true nature of approach-avoidance motivation, psychologists need to move beyond this hedonic principle to the principles that underlie the different ways that it operates. One such principle is regulatory focus, which distinguishes self-regulation with a promotion focus (accomplishments and aspirations) from self-regulation with a prevention focus (safety and responsibilities). This principle is used to reconsider the fundamental nature of approach-avoidance, expectancy-value relations, and emotional and evaluative sensitivities. Both types of regulatory focus are applied to phenomena that have been treated in terms of either promotion (e.g., well-being) or prevention (e.g., cognitive dissonance). Then, regulatory focus is distinguished from regulatory anticipation and regulatory reference, 2 other principles underlying the different ways that people approach pleasure and avoid pain.","[{'authorId': '2259978159', 'name': 'E.

Assessment exclusively based on behavioral observation sessions requires a lot of time for the diagnosis. In recent years, there is a growing need to make assessment processes more motivating and capable to provide objective measures of the disorder. New evidence showed that motor abnormalities may underpin the disorder and provide a computational marker to enhance assessment and diagnostic processes. Thus, a measure of motor patterns could provide a means to assess young children with autism and a new starting point for rehabilitation treatments. In this study, we propose to use a software tool that through a smart tablet device and touch screen sensor technologies could be able to capture detailed information about children’s motor patterns. We compared movement trajectories of autistic children and typically developing children, with the aim to identify autism motor signatures analyzing their coordinates of movements. We used a smart tablet device to record coordinates of dragging movements carried out by 60 children (30 autistic children and 30 typically developing children) during a cognitive task. Machine learning analysis of children’s motor patterns identified autism with 93% accuracy, demonstrating that autism can be computationally identified. The analysis of the features that most affect the prediction reveals and describes the differences between the groups, confirming that motor abnormalities are a core feature of autism.","[{'authorId': '117771125', 'name': 'Roberta Simeoli'}, {'authorId': '32302973', 'name': 'Nicola Milano'}, {'authorId': '34838813', 'name': 'Angelo Rega'}, {'authorId': '1716365', 'name': 'D.

Children learn creative expressions and behaviors through social interactions with others during playful and collaborative tasks, and socially emulate their peers’ and teachers’ creativity. Social robots have a unique ability to engage in social and emotional interactions with children that can be leveraged to foster creative expression. We focus on two types of social interactions: creativity demonstration, where the robot exhibits creative behaviors, and creativity scaffolding, where the robot poses challenges, suggests ideas, provides positive reinforcement, and asks questions to scaffold children’s creativity. We situate our research in three playful and collaborative tasks - the Droodle Creativity game (that affords verbal creativity), the MagicDraw game (that affords figural creativity), and the WeDo construction task (that affords constructional creativity), that children play with Jibo, a social robot. To evaluate the efficacy of the robot’s social behaviors in enhancing creative behavior and expression in children, we ran three randomized controlled trials with 169 children in the 5–10 yr old age group. In the first two tasks, the robot exhibited creativity demonstration behaviors. We found that children who interacted with the robot exhibiting high verbal creativity in the Droodle game and high figural creativity in the MagicDraw game also exhibited significantly higher creativity than a control group of participants who interacted with a robot that did not express creativity (p < 0.05*). In the WeDo construction task, children who interacted with the robot that expressed creative scaffolding behaviors (asking reflective questions, generating ideas and challenges, and providing positive reinforcement) demonstrated higher creativity than participants in the control group by expressing a greater number of ideas, more original ideas, and more varied use of available materials (p < 0.05*). We found that both creativity demonstration and creativity scaffolding can be leveraged as social mechanisms for eliciting creativity in children using a social robot.

Technology-based interventions for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have proliferated, but few have been evaluated within the context of a randomised controlled trial (RCT). This RCT evaluated the efficacy of one technology-based early intervention programme (Therapy Outcomes By You; TOBY) in young children with ASD.


METHODS
TOBY is an app-based learning curriculum designed for children and parents as a complement to early behavioural intervention. Eighty children (16 female) were recruited to this RCT within 12 months of receiving a diagnosis of ASD (M age = 3.38; SD = 0.69) and randomised to receive either treatment-as-usual (community-based intervention, n = 39) or the TOBY therapy (at least 20 min/day) plus treatment-as-usual (n = 41) for a period of 6 months. Outcomes were assessed at 3 and 6 months postbaseline. (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12614000738628; www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=365463).


RESULTS
Children in the TOBY intervention group averaged 19 min/day engaging with the app in the first 3 months, but only 2 min/day during the second 3 months. There was no group difference in scores on the primary outcome, the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist, at either the 3- or 6-month follow-up. However, significant improvements at the 6-month follow-up were observed in the TOBY intervention group relative to the treatment-as-usual group on three secondary outcomes: the Fine Motor and Visual Reception subscales of the Mullen Scale of Early Learning and the Total Words Understood scale of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Index. Statistical trends towards improvement in the TOBY intervention group were observed on measures of adaptive function, although these decreased in magnitude from the 3- to 6-month follow-up.


CONCLUSIONS
This study provides evidence that technology-based interventions may provide a relatively low-cost addition to existing therapist-delivered interventions for children with ASD. However, sustained use of the app over the full 6-month period was a challenge for most families.","[{'authorId': '143739133', 'name': 'A. Whitehouse'}, {'authorId': '5314665', 'name': 'J.

The objective of this study was to systematically review the evidence of motor skill intervention programs on typically developing children's fine motor development aged birth to 6 years.


METHODS
Six electronic databases were searched with no date restrictions. Inclusion criteria were any school-, community-, or home-based intervention targeting the development of fine motor skills of children aged birth to 6 years; randomized controlled trials using quasiexperimental, experimental, or single group prepost designs with a minimum sample size of 15 participants per group; and statistical analyses of fine motor skill development at both preintervention and postintervention or addressing the intervention effects on fine motor skill development. Data were extracted on design, participants, intervention components, methodological quality, and efficacy.


RESULTS
Twenty-five of the total 31 studies reported positive intervention effects on fine motor skills. The meta-analyses included 19 studies and revealed moderate effect sizes of motor skill programs on fine motor, visual motor, and manual dexterity outcomes. There were substantial differences between intervention settings, facilitators, length, and content with most studies implemented in school settings and facilitated by teachers.


CONCLUSION
Fine motor skill development in the early years is an extensive upcoming field of interest for many international researchers. This review study presents evidence on the positive effects of intervention programs that aim to enhance fine motor skills for young children. The findings are promising but need to be interpreted with caution because of the high risk of bias in many of the studies.","[{'authorId': '119272256', 'name': 'Karel F B Strooband'}, {'authorId': '8210224', 'name': 'M.

One way to understand different executive function components is to study abilities at their emergence, that is, early in development, and use advanced statistical methods to understand the interrelations among executive processes. However, to fully determine the constructs of interest, these methods often require complete data on a large battery of tasks, which are difficult to obtain with young children. Path analysis is an alternative statistical technique that requires only a single measure of each construct, yet still allows researchers to investigate complex relations among measures, to compare nested models, and to compare model fit across groups. Therefore, 117 preschool children (ages 2 years 8 months to 6 years 0 months) completed several executive function tasks. Path analysis was used to determine the relations between complex problem solving and working memory, inhibition, and set shifting processes. The best-fitting model included paths from working memory and inhibition to problem solving, and a correlation between working memory and inhibition. Interestingly, in younger children, inhibition was the strongest predictor of problem solving, whereas working memory contributed more strongly in older children. Suggestions for useful statistical methods to investigate the relations among executive functions in children are discussed.","[{'authorId': '5535432', 'name': 'T.

In the short term, SEL programs can enhance children's confidence in themselves; increase their engagement in school, along with their test scores and grades; and reduce conduct problems while promoting desirable behaviors. In the long term, children with greater social-emotional competence are more likely to be ready for college, succeed in their careers, have positive relationships and better mental health, and become engaged citizens.Those benefits make SEL programs an ideal foundation for a public health approach to education—that is, an approach that seeks to improve the general population's wellbeing. In this article, Mark Greenberg, Celene Domitrovich, Roger Weissberg, and Joseph Durlak argue that SEL can support a public health approach to education for three reasons. First, schools are ideal sites for interventions with children. Second, school-based SEL programs can improve students' competence, enhance their academic achievement, and make them less likely to experience future behavioral and emotional problems. Third, evidence-based SEL interventions in all schools—that is, universal interventions—could substantially affect public health.The authors begin by defining social and emotional learning and summarizing research that shows why SEL is important for positive outcomes, both while students are in school and as they grow into adults. Then they describe what a public health approach to education would involve. In doing so, they present the prevention paradox—""a large number of people exposed to a small risk may generate many more cases [of an undesirable outcome] than a small number exposed to a high risk""—to explain why universal approaches that target an entire population are essential. Finally, they outline an effective, school-based public health approach to SEL that would maximize positive outcomes for our nation's children.","[{'authorId': '2106077514', 'name': 'M.

The loss of this narrative self progressively becomes catastrophic for aging subjects with degenerative disease of the memory system. A prosthetic device for narrative memory can provide an at least temporary solution to this problem. We identify requirements for a narrative memory capability that can allow individuals with diminished memory to continue to interact socially with partners with whom they have shared experiences. A memory prosthetic should provide access to past memories of the subject, and should accompany the subject in the formation, organization and retrieval of new memories. Based on these requirements, we have implemented the V1.0 narrative memory companion on the Pepper humanoid robot using the native Choregraph and NAOqi system capabilities. We exploit principals developed in our research in autobiographical memory and the organization of experience in cooperative humanoid robots, and the mapping of narrative structure onto this experience. In the narrative companion, past memories are first collected from the subject or members of their entourage via a template-based interview, and a small number of photographs that illustrate important people and events in the subject's past. New memories constructed via interaction with Pepper, and by simple narratives told by the human partner, are stored in the Autobiographical Memory (ABM) implemented in the ALKnolwedge base of the NAOqi system. Memories are then recalled and shared by narrative.

As the shape is deformed as a result of a squeeze gesture, the resistance patterns between electrode pairs change. A machine learning algorithm allows to differentiate between the different shape deformations. In addition, user-friendly open source software allows defining and recording squeeze gestures. Consequently, Skweezees enable rich gestural squeeze interaction for the DIY community.

This is accompanied by a new form of interconnection between the physical and digital worlds, commonly known as the Internet of Things (IoT). This is a paradigm shift, where anything and everything can be interconnected via a communication medium. In such systems, security is a prime concern and protecting the resources (e.g., applications and services) from unauthorized access needs appropriately designed security and privacy solutions. Building secure systems for the IoT can only be achieved through a thorough understanding of the particular needs of such systems. The state of the art is lacking a systematic analysis of the security requirements for the IoT. Motivated by this, in this paper, we present a systematic approach to understand the security requirements for the IoT, which will help designing secure IoT systems for the future. In developing these requirements, we provide different scenarios and outline potential threats and attacks within the IoT. Based on the characteristics of the IoT, we group the possible threats and attacks into five areas, namely communications, device/services, users, mobility and integration of resources. We then examine the existing security requirements for IoT presented in the literature and detail our approach for security requirements for the IoT.

Following up our research on smart vehicles, within the framework of unobtrusive health monitoring in private spaces, this work attempts to provide a guide to current sensor technology for unobtrusive in-home monitoring by a literature review of the state of the art and to answer, in particular, the questions: (1) What types of sensors can be used for unobtrusive in-home health data acquisition? (2) Where should the sensors be placed? (3) What data can be monitored in a smart home? (4) How can the obtained data support the monitoring functions? We conducted a retrospective literature review and summarized the state-of-the-art research on leveraging sensor technology for unobtrusive in-home health monitoring. For structured analysis, we developed a four-category terminology (location, unobtrusive sensor, data, and monitoring functions). We acquired 912 unique articles from four relevant databases (ACM Digital Lib, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and Scopus) and screened them for relevance, resulting in n=55 papers analyzed in a structured manner using the terminology. The results delivered 25 types of sensors (motion sensor, contact sensor, pressure sensor, electrical current sensor, etc.) that can be deployed within rooms, static facilities, or electric appliances in an ambient way. While behavioral data (e.g., presence (n=38), time spent on activities (n=18)) can be acquired effortlessly, physiological parameters (e.g., heart rate, respiratory rate) are measurable on a limited scale (n=5). Behavioral data contribute to functional monitoring. Emergency monitoring can be built up on behavioral and environmental data. Acquired physiological parameters allow reasonable monitoring of physiological functions to a limited extent. Environmental data and behavioral data also detect safety and security abnormalities. Social interaction monitoring relies mainly on direct monitoring of tools of communication (smartphone; computer).

306e63235260e5e1a90ab412dafe33ce2daa89bc,"At present, the question of how national pension or retirement payment systems should be organised is being hotly debated in various countries, and opinions vary widely as to what should be regarded as the optimal design for such systems. It appears to the authors of the present paper that in this entire discussion one aspect is largely overlooked: What relationships exist between the pension system and the financial system in a given country? As such relationships might prove to be important, the present paper investigates the following questions: (1) Are there differences between the national pension systems of three major European countries – Germany, France and the U.K. – and between the financial systems of these countries? (2) And if the existence of such differences can be demonstrated, is there a correspondence between the differences with respect to the various national pension systems and the differences as regards the countries’ financial systems? (3) And if such a correspondence exists, is there any kind of interrelationship between the national financial and pension systems of the individual countries which goes beyond a mere correspondence? Looking mainly at two aspects – namely, risk allocation and the incentives to create human capital – the authors of this paper argue (1) that there are indeed considerable differences between the financial and pension systems of the three countries; (2) that in both Germany and the U.K. there are also systematic correspondences between the respective pension systems and financial systems and their economic characteristics, but that such a correspondence cannot be identified in the case of France; and (3) that these parallels are, in the final analysis, based on complementarities and are therefore likely to contribute to the efficiency of the German and the British systems. The paper concludes with a brief look at policy implications which the existence of, or the lack of, consistency between national pension systems and national financial systems might have.","[{'authorId': '39663682', 'name': 'R.

The main objectives of the study were to collect information about access to and use of apps in the home, establish the most popular apps and identify the features of those apps that are successful in promoting play and creativity. A mixed-method approach was used to collect data, including video filming of children using the most popular apps. In identifying play types that emerged in the analysis of data, the team utilised an established taxonomy, which outlines sixteen play types. This taxonomy was reviewed and adapted to analyse data from the project relating to digital play. Through this process, an additional type of play, transgressive play, was identified and added to the taxonomy. The paper outlines the implications of the revised taxonomy for future studies of play.","[{'authorId': '145907274', 'name': 'J. Marsh'}, {'authorId': '2256600', 'name': 'L.

This debate started about 20 years ago, and has been marked by numerous reports, books, and contributions that have not been followed by any significant political decisions. Only one reform, the Balladur reform (named after the Conservative Prime Minister in place at that time, Edouard Balladur) was enacted in 1993. Surprisingly, the Balladur reform was inspired by the White Book issued in 1991 and ordered by Michel Rocard when he was the Prime Minister of a Socialist government. The first pillar of the pension system, i.e. the pay–as–you–go (PAYG) basic scheme, was the only concern of the Balladur reform. The other pillars, i.e. complementary PAYG or funded schemes, were not affected. In March 1997, Parliament enacted the Thomas Act (named after the Conservative deputy who wrote the proposal) that introduced retirement savings plan (Plans d’epargne retraite), but the law was never enforced because of the political change in June 1997 and was formally abrogated in 2002. Today there is still no consensus on pension funds in France. The only issue that seems not to be debatable is the willingness to maintain a PAYG public scheme for basic and complementary pension schemes. The debate concerns the introduction of pension funds as a third pillar. This paper shows that, even if pension funds hardly exist in France, they have close, but imperfect, substitutes such as life insurance and employee–saving schemes. The difficulty is that these saving instruments are not specifically designed for retirement purposes. There is thus a risk of insufficient savings for old age. We advocate the introduction of pension–oriented schemes, but not as designed by the Thomas Act, since this offers insufficient protection against financial risks for wage–earners. The first section of this paper is devoted to an institutional overview of the French pension system and presents some basic statistics. The second section gives some details on supplementary occupational–funded schemes. In section 3, we argue that funding does exist in France, through personal savings. In section 4 we show that the last reforms did not pave the way to pension funds. Section 5 concludes.","[{'authorId': '144034603', 'name': 'Anne Lavigne'}]",4.0,,20.0,Pension Funds in France: Still a Dead End?,2003.0

Therefore, Fog Computing has been proposed to be an edge component for the IoT networks as a remedy to this problem. In recent times, cyber-attacks are on the rise, especially towards infrastructure-less networks, such as IoT. Many botnet attack variants (Mirai, Torii, etc.) have shown that the tiny microdevices at the lower spectrum of the network are becoming a valued participant of a botnet, for further executing more sophisticated attacks against infrastructural networks. As such, the fog devices also need to be secured against cyber-attacks, not only software-wise, but also from hardware alterations and manipulations. Hence, this article first highlights the importance and benefits of fog computing for IoT networks, then investigates the means of providing hardware security to these devices with an enriched literature review, including but not limited to Hardware Security Module, Physically Unclonable Function, System on a Chip, and Tamper Resistant Memory.","[{'authorId': '2855033', 'name': 'I.

In particular, peer interaction, especially with more advanced peers, can enhance preschool children's language growth. In this paper, we explore one factor that may modulate children's language learning with a peer-like social robot: rapport. We explore connections between preschool children's learning, rapport, and emulation of the robot's language during a storytelling intervention. We performed a long-term field study in a preschool with 17 children aged 4–6 years. Children played a storytelling game with a social robot for 8 sessions over two months. For some children, the robot matched the level of its stories to the children's language ability, acting as a slightly more advanced peer (Matched condition); for the others, the robot did not match the story level (Unmatched condition). We examined children's use of target vocabulary words and key phrases used by the robot, children's emulation of the robot's stories during their own storytelling, and children's language style matching (LSM—a measure of overlap in function word use and speaking style associated with rapport and relationship) to see whether they mirrored the robot more over time. We found that not only did children emulate the robot more over time, but also, children who emulated more of the robot's phrases during storytelling scored higher on the vocabulary posttest. Children with higher LSM scores were more likely to emulate the robot's content words in their stories. Furthermore, the robot's personalization in the Matched condition led to increases in both children's emulation and their LSM scores. Together, these results suggest first, that interacting with a more advanced peer is beneficial for children, and second, that children's emulation of the robot's language may be related to their rapport and their learning. This is the first study to empirically support that rapport may be a modulating factor in children's peer learning, and furthermore, that a social robot can serve as an effective intervention for language development by leveraging this insight.","[{'authorId': '2716110', 'name': 'J.

These children made significantly more learning gains than children whose gestures and speech matched. Children's gestures were an indicator, at pretest, of readiness to learn and of cognitive gains.

Artificial intelligence, robotics, and big data offer essential complements to fill in for long-haul attention and productivity deficits that may occur in waves. Long Haulers have already found themselves in online self-help groups – such as Survivor Corps – for quick and unbureaucratic information exchange about an emerging group phenomenon. Social online media platforms served as an easy remedy during a time when a surge of severe COVID cases precluded COVID hospitalization. Nowadays, COVID long-haul patients have become – more than ever before – citizen scientists that bundle decentralized information on their health status and potential remedies in order to inform the medical profession about newly emerging trends. The rise in medical self-help and mutual support will have profound implications for the regulation of the medical profession and will likely stretch the medical remedy spectrum and boost alternative medicine. In the online exchange of sensitive information about one’s health status, citizen scientists are also particularly vulnerable in terms of their privacy, potentially even more susceptible to online marketing campaigns under medically impaired conditions, but also because of their sensitive information having been publicly disclosed online over time. (3) As historical precedents show, Generation COVID Long-Haul partially being recognized as a disability may result in increased pressures to reform social, healthcare, and retirement systems. Given waves of debilitation, the analysis of macroeconomic aggregates will have to change in order to reflect a more diversified and temporal view of social preferences. Future economic policy research may take inspiration from the legal concept of disparate impact. Behavioral insights on how to navigate the world with attention deficits and uncertainty may focus on developing an idea of the economic benefits of rest by incorporating preferences for minimalism in a turbulent world longing for recovery.","[{'authorId': '90323749', 'name': 'Julia M.

I draw on the work of earlier historians to highlight the role of Ole Ivar Lovaas, the most influential practitioner of ABA. I argue that reception of his initial work was mainly positive, despite concerns regarding its efficacy and use of physical aversives. Lovaas’ work, however, was only cautiously accepted by medical practitioners until he published results in 1987. Many accepted the results as validation of Lovaas’ research, though both his methods and broader understanding of autism had shifted considerably since his early work in the 1960s. The article analyses the controversies surrounding ABA since the early 1990s, considering in particular criticisms made by autistic people in the ‘neurodiversity movement’. As with earlier critics, some condemn the use of painful aversives, exemplified in the campaign against the use of shock therapy at the Judge Rotenberg Center. Unlike earlier, non-autistic critics, however, many in this movement reject the ideological goals of ABA, considering autism a harmless neurological difference rather than a pathology. They argue that eliminating benign autistic behaviour through ABA is impermissible, owing to the individual psychological harm and the wider societal impact. Finally, I compare the claims made by the neurodiversity movement with those made by similar 20th- and 21st-century social movements.","[{'authorId': '48772444', 'name': 'P.

This will generate interactions between humans and robots that may have positive or negative effects on the users. In order to minimize the negative effects and increase robot persuasiveness, robots should behave in an appropriate manner by adapting to their users. How to achieve this adaptation remains a challenge. We propose the usage of the Regulatory Focus Theory, user physiological state, and game-performance information in order to detect user stress and adapt the behavior of the robot. We present a longitudinal experiment conducted with 35 participants in a game-like scenario. The robot was trained for adapting to the regulatory focus of the users and decreasing their stress while they were playing the game. For this reason, we trained the robot with 12 participants with Chronic Promotion State and with 12 participants with Chronic Prevention State. We used a Q-Learning algorithm based on the Regulatory Focus of the participants, user stress, and task performance. The model obtained was tested with 2 groups (6 and 5 participants, respectively) according to their Chronic Regulatory Focus. Results show that our system was able to generate a robot behavior capable of increasing robot persuasiveness and reducing user stress, which is of great importance for social robots.","[{'authorId': '1405177298', 'name': 'Arturo Cruz-Maya'}, {'authorId': '1738469', 'name': 'A.

Cross-sectional study with 78 children, aged 24–42 months: group 1 with previous frequent tablet-use exposure (n = 26), group 2 without previous tablet-use exposure (n = 52). Fine motor skills were evaluated with the Bayley-III. Socioeconomic data and home environment quality were similar in both groups. Fine motor skills of group 1 were better than those of group 2 (p = 0.013). Most participating children carried out passive and active tablet activities, usually accompanied by parents, not exceeding time recommendations for young age. We observed a difference in fine motor skills in young children slightly favoring those with tablet-use experience.","[{'authorId': '103607557', 'name': 'Pablo Hidelbrando S Souto'}, {'authorId': '119867388', 'name': 'J.

For this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, 16 married women were subjected to the threat of electric shock while holding their husband's hand, the hand of an anonymous male experimenter, or no hand at all. Results indicated a pervasive attenuation of activation in the neural systems supporting emotional and behavioral threat responses when the women held their husband's hand. A more limited attenuation of activation in these systems occurred when they held the hand of a stranger. Most strikingly, the effects of spousal hand-holding on neural threat responses varied as a function of marital quality, with higher marital quality predicting less threat-related neural activation in the right anterior insula, superior frontal gyrus, and hypothalamus during spousal, but not stranger, hand-holding.","[{'authorId': '2461693', 'name': 'J.

38ad6079803832ec00ccd79c5704672a05fb775b,"Robots interacting with humans in public spaces often need to collect users’ private information in order to provide the required services. Current privacy legislation in major jurisdictions requires organisations to disclose information about their data collection process and obtain user’s consent prior to collecting privacy sensitive information. In this study, we consider a privacy-sensitive design of a data collection system for face identification. We deployed a face enrolment system on a humanoid robot with human-like gesturing and speech. We compared it with an equivalent system, in terms of capability and interactive process, on a screen-based interactive kiosk. In our previous contribution, we investigated the effects that embodiment has on users’ privacy considerations. We found that an embodied humanoid robot is capable of collecting more private information from users in comparison to a disembodied interactive kiosk. However, this effect was statistically significant only when the two compared systems were using a transparent interface, i.e. an interface communicating to users the privacy policies for data processing and storage. Thus, in this work, we aim to further investigate the effects of transparency on users’ privacy considerations and their experience with robot applications. We found that when comparing a non-transparent vs. transparent interface within the same system (i.e. on an embodied robot or on a disembodied kiosk) transparency does not lead to significant effects on users’ privacy considerations. However, we found that transparency leads to a significantly better user experience for both systems. Therefore, our overall analyses suggest that both the interactive robot and the interactive kiosk are capable of enhancing the user experience by providing transparent information to users, which is required by privacy legislation. However, an interactive kiosk providing transparent information elicits significantly more privacy concerns in users as compared to the robot supplying the very same transparent information. This exploratory study provides conclusions that provide valuable insights for designing robot applications dealing with users privacy and it discusses the related legal implications, concluding with recommendations for privacy policymakers.","[{'authorId': '50407019', 'name': 'Jonathan Vitale'}, {'authorId': '28950433', 'name': 'Meg Tonkin'}, {'authorId': '36177753', 'name': 'S.

We illustrate this with examples from contemporary arts and design practice, and distinguish three broad classes of ambiguity according to where uncertainty is located in the interpretative relationship linking person and artefact. Ambiguity of information finds its source in the artefact itself, ambiguity of context in the sociocultural discourses that are used to interpret it, and ambiguity of relationship in the interpretative and evaluative stance of the individual. For each of these categories, we describe tactics for emphasising ambiguity that may help designers and other practitioners understand and craft its use.","[{'authorId': '2487205', 'name': 'William W.

We therefore aimed to determine the patterns of comorbidity, longitudinal risks, and shared familial risks between these disorders. Methods In a prospective study design we explored the effect of a prior diagnosis of OCD in patients and parents on the susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders and vice versa. Analyses were adjusted for sex, age, calendar year, parental age and place at residence at time of birth. As measures of relative risk incidence rate ratios (IRR) and accompanying 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were employed. Results The risk of a comorbid diagnosis of OCD in individuals with autism spectrum disorder and aggregation of autism spectrum disorders in offspring of parents with OCD were increased. Individuals first diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders had a 2-fold higher risk of a later diagnosis of OCD (IRR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.91–2.48), whereas individuals diagnosed with OCD displayed a nearly 4-fold higher risk to be diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (IRR = 3.91, 95% CI = 3.46–4.40) later in life. The observed associations were somewhat stronger for less severe types of autism spectrum disorders without a comorbid diagnosis of mental disabilities. Conclusions The high comorbidity, sequential risk, and shared familial risks between OCD and autism spectrum disorders are suggestive of partially shared etiological mechanisms. The results have implications for current gene-searching efforts and for clinical practice.","[{'authorId': '49250893', 'name': 'S. Meier'}, {'authorId': '145669624', 'name': 'L.

3cedc034b84c957c9afffef573560ce02a5374cb,"In this meta-analytic and narrative review, we examine several overarching issues related to the study of coping, emotion regulation, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms of psychopathology in childhood and adolescence, including the conceptualization and measurement of these constructs. We report a quantitative meta-analysis of 212 studies (N = 80,850 participants) that measured the associations between coping and emotion regulation with symptoms of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Within the meta-analysis we address the association of broad domains of coping and emotion regulation (e.g., total coping, emotion regulation), intermediate factors of coping and emotion regulation (e.g., primary control coping, secondary control coping), and specific coping and emotion regulation strategies (e.g., emotional expression, cognitive reappraisal) with internalizing and externalizing symptoms. For cross-sectional studies, which made up the majority of studies included, we examine 3 potential moderators: age, measure quality, and single versus multiple informants. Finally, we separately consider findings from longitudinal studies as these provide stronger tests of the effects. After accounting for publication bias, findings indicate that the broad domain of emotion regulation and adaptive coping and the factors of primary control coping and secondary control coping are related to lower levels of symptoms of psychopathology. Further, the domain of maladaptive coping, the factor of disengagement coping, and the strategies of emotional suppression, avoidance, and denial are related to higher levels of symptoms of psychopathology. Finally, we offer a critique of the current state of the field and outline an agenda for future research.","[{'authorId': '6442334', 'name': 'B. Compas'}, {'authorId': '5286318', 'name': 'S.

In an educational context, complex problem solving (CPS) is generally considered an important transversal skill that includes knowledge acquisition and its application in new and interactive situations. The dynamic and interactive nature of CPS requires a computer-based administration of CPS tests such that the assessment of CPS might be partially confounded with information and communication technology (ICT) literacy. To establish CPS as a distinct construct that involves complex cognitive processes not covered by other general cognitive abilities and not related to ICT literacy, it is necessary to investigate the influence of ICT literacy on CPS and on the power of CPS to predict external educational criteria. We did so in 3 different samples of either high school or university students using a variety of instruments to measure ICT literacy and general cognitive ability. Convergent results based on structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analyses across the studies showed that ICT literacy was weakly or moderately related to CPS, and these associations were similar to those between ICT and other general cognitive abilities. Furthermore, the power of CPS to predict external educational criteria over and above general cognitive ability remained even if the influence of ICT literacy on CPS was controlled for. We conclude that CPS is a distinct construct that captures complex cognitive processes not generally found in other assessments of general cognitive ability or of ICT literacy.","[{'authorId': '1909728', 'name': 'Samuel Greiff'}, {'authorId': '1921391', 'name': 'A.

I begin with my “story” of how the focus on interventions started as I worked in various settings (rehabilitation facilities, schools, hospitals, and outpatient clinical services) and with children, adolescents, and adults. The main stream of treatment research and findings with antisocial child behavior is highlighted along with tributaries that led naturally from the outcome research. Our trials are complemented by tribulations that apply to evidence-based psychosocial interventions more broadly. Most individuals in need of psychological services in the United States and worldwide receive no treatment. Much can be done right now with novel models of treatment delivery that draw on multiple disciplines (e.g., public health, business, entertainment, economics, robotics and artificial intelligence, and law and social policy). More research on interventions that do not or cannot reach most people in need is quite limited in value to me. Finally (and belatedly) my attention has turned to ways of exerting impact, and for that, evidence-based interventions are necessary but hardly sufficient.","[{'authorId': '152319200', 'name': 'A.

However, the emotional bonds between humans and SR can raise an SR accessing/inferring profoundly private information, e.g., emotional states. Therefore, in what concerns privacy, SR may be a liability. Clarifying the ownership of data collected by robots is an issue of concern in the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires ’privacy-by-design’. The paper presents BlockRobot – a Blockchain (BC)-based software design model for developing privacy-by-design application in Human-Robot Interactions (HRI). Based on this design model, users can access the private data generated in their HRI. This paper’s contributions are the design and validation of a model to develop privacy-by-design applications for HRI. This model integrates BC technology with robots to audit robotic events such as Red, Green, Blue, Depth (RGB-D) images, and RFID tags. Smart contracts and crypto-wallets accomplish identity management. To demonstrate the utility of the initial implementation of a Decentralized Application (dApp), we implement a prototype, based on the private permissioned Evolution of Scalability (EOS) Blockchain integrated with the social robot moving in a non-laboratory environment.","[{'authorId': '2034348519', 'name': 'V.

However, service delivery depends on maintaining and troubleshooting device connectivity to smartphones, where user engagement and technology proficiency represent a possible barrier that prevents a wider adoption, especially in the elderly and disabled population. Low-cost and low-power wearable and IoT devices face challenges when operating out of range of known home networks or pared devices. We propose an architecture and methods to provide seamless connectivity (Se-Co) between devices and wireless networks while maintaining low-power, low-cost and standards compatibility. Through Se-Co, the devices connect without user interaction both in home and in unknown roaming networks while maintaining anonymity, privacy and security. Roaming networks approve data limited connectivity to unknown devices that are able to provide a valid anonymized certificate of compliance and no harm through a home provider. Se-Co enables shifting data processing, such as pattern processing using artificial intelligence, from a wearable device or smartphone towards the cloud. The proposed Se-Co architecture could provide solutions to increase usability of wearable devices and improve their wider adoption, while keeping low the costs of devices, development and services.","[{'authorId': '52098470', 'name': 'L.

Robot assisted therapy can be beneficial for children with ASD in various ways, but relevant research focusing specifically on robot enhanced interventions (REIs) for RSBs in children with ASD has been limited. A scoping review was conducted to explore the role of REIs on RSBs of children with ASD and to investigate the components of REIs focusing on RSBs of younger and older children with ASD. A literature search was made in the databases of Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar, using keywords pertaining to robots, ASD, RSBs, and children. Of the 89 studies identified, 10 met the inclusion criteria. They involved 99 participants aged 3-14 years (mean 7.27 years) from six countries on three different continents. These studies varied with respect to sample size, the research design, the robot used, the length of intervention, the training and the type of measurement. Following the application of most REIs, the participants showed reduction in RSBs. Only one study reported that REI led to some increase in stereotyped behaviors in children with ASD and one detected no training-related changes in repetitive behaviors. The review findings indicate the potential of REIs for reducing RSBs in children with ASD, but the relevant studies were diverse, and controlled studies with larger samples of children and rigorous design are needed to clarify their impact.","[{'authorId': '1403392965', 'name': 'Christine K.

4173786965b222b3172989f98479dd7e216b1fd2,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming a backbone of sensing infrastructure to several mission-critical applications such as smart health, disaster management, and smart cities. Due to resource-constrained sensing devices, IoT infrastructures use Edge datacenters (EDCs) for real-time data processing. EDCs can be either static or mobile in nature, and this article considers both of these scenarios. Generally, EDCs communicate with IoT devices in emergency scenarios to evaluate data in real-time. Protecting data communications from malicious activity becomes a key factor, as all the communication flows through insecure channels. In such infrastructures, it is a challenging task for EDCs to ensure the trustworthiness of the data for emergency evaluations. The current communication security pattern of “communication before authentication” leaves a “black hole” for intruders to become part of communication processes without authentication. To overcome this issue and to develop security infrastructures for IoT and distributed Edge datacenters, this article proposes a user-centric security solution. The proposed security solution shifts from a network-centric approach to a user-centric security approach by authenticating users and devices before communication is established. A trusted controller is initialized to authenticate and establishes the secure channel between the devices before they start communication between themselves. The centralized controller draws a perimeter for secure communications within the boundary. Theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation of the proposed security model show that it not only secures the communication infrastructure but also improves the overall network performance.","[{'authorId': '1901571', 'name': 'Deepak Puthal'}, {'authorId': '1690341', 'name': 'L.

This cause differs from uncertainty in the prediction of performance characteristics or its need for improvement with growing certainty in the field. Drawing from theory and research on learning and problem solving, I introduce the concept of learning by using as the acquisition of a new language, wherein language is defined as the entire concept from latent logic to manifestations of this understanding, such as spoken words, actions or products. My empirical field evidence shows that the manufacturer and users speak fundamentally different languages, lacking adjustment to the logic of the other side. This refers especially to the cumulative utilization problems that exist beyond solving a product’s teething problems. Data suggest that utilization experience is dominated by solution search in a non-linear process, eventually leading to recognition of manifestations of the different languages used and problem-solving, but lacks an adjustment to the different logical concepts. This leads to dissatisfaction in utilization and could be solved by trying to understand the root cause of the diverging manifestation so as to grasp the intention of the other side and be able to adapt their own logic to them. I discuss implications for theory and practice and provide suggestions for future research.","[{'authorId': '2109760988', 'name': 'Siegfried Sharma'}]",1.0,,32.0,Learning by Using: the Learning of a New “Language”,2020.0

Here, we review the evidence from 69 original studies on human-animal interactions (HAI) which met our inclusion criteria with regard to sample size, peer-review, and standard scientific research design. Among the well-documented effects of HAI in humans of different ages, with and without special medical, or mental health conditions are benefits for: social attention, social behavior, interpersonal interactions, and mood; stress-related parameters such as cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure; self-reported fear and anxiety; and mental and physical health, especially cardiovascular diseases. Limited evidence exists for positive effects of HAI on: reduction of stress-related parameters such as epinephrine and norepinephrine; improvement of immune system functioning and pain management; increased trustworthiness of and trust toward other persons; reduced aggression; enhanced empathy and improved learning. We propose that the activation of the oxytocin system plays a key role in the majority of these reported psychological and psychophysiological effects of HAI. Oxytocin and HAI effects largely overlap, as documented by research in both, humans and animals, and first studies found that HAI affects the oxytocin system. As a common underlying mechanism, the activation of the oxytocin system does not only provide an explanation, but also allows an integrative view of the different effects of HAI.","[{'authorId': '37806877', 'name': 'A.

4a191bb8c04538cae794379502ce552a0b7adf15,"Introduction Everyone experiences stress at one time or another – from major events such as the death of a loved one, to more minor stressors such as financial difficulties. Not surprisingly, exposure to stress is generally associated with a wide range of negative outcomes, including decreased well-being, increased incidence of disease, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder (Dohrenwend & Dohrenwend, 1974; Kendler et al., 1999; Monat et al., 2007). However, not all individuals who are exposed to even high levels of stress develop such negative outcomes. In fact, recent evidence suggests that a considerable number of individuals exhibit resilience, which is commonly defined as maintained or improved mental health in the face of stress, after short disruptions (if any) to normal functioning (Freitas & Downey, 1998; Rutter, 1999; Luthar et al., 2000; Bonanno, 2005). Note that this definition, which we adapt here, conceptualizes resilience as a potential outcome after exposure to stress rather than a psychological trait that leads to positive outcomes (c.f. Norris et al., 2008). It, therefore, appears that, in the face of comparable stressors, some individuals exhibit significantly impaired functioning while others show impressive resilience. Understanding the factors that govern the great individual variance in outcomes after stress is important for understanding mental health and for developing interventions and prevention programs that foster resilience. What factors, then, might predict resilience? One key to this question might lie in the fact that stressful events are inherently highly emotional (Sarason et al., 1978; Lazarus, 1999). For this reason, people’s ability to regulate emotions may be a critically important factor in determining resilience (Figure 2.1). The present chapter will review relevant literatures and suggest that there is indeed evidence to support this thesis. More specifically, we will propose that a specific type of emotion regulation, cognitive emotion regulation, holds particular promise for contributing to resilience.","[{'authorId': '4041983', 'name': 'Allison S.

4a2f5ad8b238ff33cb2cce499e08bb7d47fd2d72,"Assistive social robots, a particular type of assistive robotics designed for social interaction with humans, could play an important role with respect to the health and psychological well-being of the elderly. Objectives Assistive social robots are believed to be useful in eldercare for two reasons, a functional one and an affective one. Such robots are developed to function as an interface for the elderly with digital technology, and to help increase the quality of life of the elderly by providing companionship, respectively. There is a growing attention for these devices in the literature. However, no comprehensive review has yet been performed to investigate the effectiveness of such robots in the care of the elderly. Therefore, we systematically reviewed and analyzed existing literature on the effects of assistive social robots in health care for the elderly. We focused in particular on the companion function. Data Sources A systematic search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library databases, IEEE, ACM libraries and finally Google Scholar was performed for records through December 2007 to identify articles of all studies with actual subjects aimed to assess the effects of assistive social robots on the elderly. This search was completed with information derived from personal expertise, contacts and reports. Study Selection and Data Extraction Since no randomized controlled trials (RCT)’s have been found within this field of research, all studies reporting effects of assistive robotics in elderly populations were included. Information on study design, interventions, controls, and findings were extracted for each article. In medical journals only a few articles were found, whereas about 50 publications were found in literature on ICT and robotics. Data Synthesis The identified studies were all published after 2000 indicating the novelty of this area of research. Most of these publications contain the results of studies that report positive effects of assistive social robots on health and psychological well-being of elders. Solid evidence indicating that these effects can indeed be attributed to the actual assistive social robot, its behavior and its functionality is scarce. Conclusions There is some qualitative evidence as well as limited quantitative evidence of the positive effects of assistive social robots with respect to the elderly. The research designs, however, are not robust enough to establish this. Confounding variables often cannot be excluded. This is partly due to the chosen research designs, but also because it is unclear what research methodology is adequate to investigate such effects. Therefore, more work on methods is needed as well as robust, large-scale studies to establish the effects of these devices.","[{'authorId': '1735303', 'name': 'J.

The purpose of this paper is to review the growing empirical support for the efficacy of technology-based interventions with children with autism and to recommend future directions for research. This review will focus on five examples of technology introduced as a temporary instructional aid to be removed once the goal of behavior change has been met: (a) tactile and auditory prompting devices, (b) video-based instruction and feedback, (c) computer-aided instruction, (d) virtual reality, and (e) robotics. Future directions for research and practice with each technology are discussed. Keywords: autism; technology-based interventions; computer-aided instruction; virtual reality; robotics. ********** A growing number of studies have investigated diverse applications of technology-based interventions with children with autism. The popularity of technology in the field of psychology is evidenced by the development of new journals in the area (e.g., the Journal of Special Education Technology, the Journal of Educational Multimedia and Hypermedia, the Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, etc.). In addition, clinical psychology journals are recognizing the importance of technology in service delivery and devoting special issues to the topic (e.g., Newman, 2004). Parents and clinicians regularly report that children with autism are drawn to technological devices and researchers have noted the importance of devising treatments that take advantage of this fascination (Colby, 1973). The purpose of this paper is to review the growing empirical support for the efficacy of technology-based interventions with children with autism and to recommend future directions for research. A review of technology-based interventions must first clarify the use of the word technology. The term is broadly defined as ""the practical application of knowledge"" or ""the specialized aspects of a particular field of endeavor"" (Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 1994, p. 1210). This broad definition encompasses virtually any information or object that has been used in application to a field of study. For example, the application of stimulus control is technology to a behavioral clinician. A more specific use of the term refers to use of mechanical or electromechanical processes that often increase productivity and reduce or eliminate manual operations or operations done by older technologies. In the twenty-first century, technology commonly denotes a variety of popular electromechanical devices such as cell phones, video recording equipment, and hand-held, desktop, and laptop personal computers. It is the use of these tools with children with autism that will be the subject of this review paper. Some technology-based interventions are designed for indefinite use as an assistive tool (e.g., voice-output augmentative communication devices, microswitches, etc.) while others are introduced as a temporary instructional aid to be removed once the goal of behavior change has been met. This review will focus on five examples of the second category: tactile and auditory prompting devices, video-based instruction and feedback, computer-aided instruction, virtual reality, and robotics. Research support for the use of each technological advancement with children with autism will be reviewed, and directions for future research and practical application will be discussed. Mechanical Prompts Individuals with autism often need external stimulus prompts to initiate, maintain, or terminate a behavior. Commonly used prompts include vocal, gestural, physical, written/pictorial, and signed prompts, and each modality has been demonstrated effective for multiple purposes (MacDuff, Krantz, & McClannahan, 2001). Technological advancements in the last decade have created cost-effective automated prompting devices with the ability to deliver the same level of prompting with less human interaction and obtrusiveness and often less human effort in managing prompt delivery (e. …","[{'authorId': '4426500', 'name': 'T.

In the wake of an already burgeoning digitalization revolution, the COVID-19 pandemic perpetuated digitalization. As affinity to information and communication technologies nowadays determines economic potential, technology-based inequality increases. Taxing digital analytics-driven economic growth could raise funds to offset technology disruption fallouts on a national level. On a global scale, equal access to internet connectivity around the world would help spread the benefits of digitalization equally and aid countries in catching up in international development endeavors. 
 
More than ever before in the history of modern workforce do employers and employees alike nowadays care about the overall well-being and physical interaction in a hygienic environment. The COVID-19 pandemic steered individuals to adopt technology to self-monitor healthy lifestyles, but also governments and employers to electronically track individuals for health safety purposes. With the overall immune system resiliency determining the severity of a COVID-19 infection, preventive healthcare implementation can be leveraged into a competitive advantage. Corporate Social Responsibility and corporate governance should incentivize preventive self-care as an innovative precautionary mean for lowering pandemic outbreak risks and boosting performance. Like in the Austrian Sozialpartnerschafts-model, stakeholder integration into corporate decision making could aid in reaching collective goals of a healthy workforce in an overall precautionary environment. Online healthcare technology offers most novel corporate governance and employer-employee interaction opportunities. Endogenous growth theory should include the workforce health status as a productive labor capital driver. Precaution should be factored in as a positive collective learning-by-preventing process, which includes group dynamics around hygiene but also monitoring of one’s own and other’s health status and care via health apps that also allow tracking human contact touchpoints for preventing COVID.","[{'authorId': '90323749', 'name': 'Julia M.

A Joint DL and IoT platform are known as Deep-IoMT that extracts the accurate cardiac image data from noisy conventional devices and tools. Besides, smart and dynamic technological trends have caught the attention of every corner such as, healthcare, which is possible through portable and lightweight sensor-enabled devices. Tiny size and resource-constrained nature restrict them to perform several tasks at a time. Thus, energy drain, limited battery lifetime, and high packet loss ratio (PLR) are the keys challenges to be tackled carefully for ubiquitous medical care. Sustainability (i.e., longer battery lifetime), energy efficiency, and reliability are the vital ingredients for wearable devices to empower a cost-effective and pervasive healthcare environment. Thus, the key contribution of this paper is the sixth fold. First, a novel self-adaptive power control-based enhanced efficient-aware approach (EEA) is proposed to reduce energy consumption and enhance the battery lifetime and reliability. The proposed EEA and conventional constant TPC are evaluated by adopting real-time data traces of static (i.e., sitting) and dynamic (i.e., cycling) activities and cardiac images. Second, a novel joint DL-IoMT framework is proposed for the cardiac image processing of remote elderly patients. Third, DL driven layered architecture for IoMT is proposed. Forth, the battery model for IoMT is proposed by adopting the features of a wireless channel and body postures. Fifth, network performance is optimized by introducing sustainability, energy drain, and PLR and average threshold RSSI indicators. Sixth, a Use-case for cardiac image-enabled elderly patient’s monitoring is proposed. Finally, it is revealed through experimental results in MATLAB that the proposed EEA scheme performs better than the constant TPC by enhancing energy efficiency, sustainability, and reliability during data transmission for elderly healthcare.","[{'authorId': '1718545', 'name': 'Tianle Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2163344', 'name': 'Ali Hassan Sodhro'}, {'authorId': '39689177', 'name': 'Zongwei Luo'}, {'authorId': '2285637', 'name': 'Noman Zahid'}, {'authorId': '35340845', 'name': 'M.

Experiment 1 showed that 3-year-olds interpret objects activating a machine differently from a novel agent liking each object; children are more likely to treat the latter as indicating the objects with the causal property possessed an internal property. Experiment 2 suggested that 3-year-olds potentially use this mechanistic knowledge to reason about ambiguous data in terms of base rate information. Experiments 3, 4a, and 4b showed that these inferences are not the result of children being more interested in an agent's desires. Instead, children integrate domain-specific knowledge (i.e., reasoning about an agent vs. a machine) with the nature of that inference within that domain (i.e., reasoning about desires vs. other mental states). The authors suggest that a particular computational approach, based on Bayesian inference, best describes these inferences.

Design, Setting, and Participants
This randomized clinical trial began recruitment in April 2014 at 3 universities in US cities. A volunteer sample of children (7-13 years) with ASD and maladaptive and interfering anxiety was randomized to standard-of-practice CBT, CBT adapted for ASD, or TAU. Independent evaluators were blinded to groupings. Data were collected through January 2017 and analyzed from December 2018 to February 2019.


Interventions
The main features of standard-of-practice CBT were affect recognition, reappraisal, modeling/rehearsal, in vivo exposure tasks, and reinforcement. The CBT intervention adapted for ASD was similar but also addressed social communication and self-regulation challenges with perspective-taking training and behavior-analytic techniques.


Main Outcomes and Measures
The primary outcome measure per a priori hypotheses was the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes included treatment response on the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale and checklist measures.


Results
Of 214 children initially enrolled, 167 were randomized, 145 completed treatment, and 22 discontinued participation. Those who were not randomized failed to meet eligibility criteria (eg, confirmed ASD). There was no significant difference in discontinuation rates across conditions. Randomized children had a mean (SD) age of 9.9 (1.8) years; 34 were female (20.5%). The CBT program adapted for ASD outperformed standard-of-practice CBT (mean [SD] Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale score, 2.13 [0.91] [95% CI, 1.91-2.36] vs 2.43 [0.70] [95% CI, 2.25-2.62]; P = .04) and TAU (2.93 [0.59] [95% CI, 2.63-3.22]; P < .001). The CBT adapted for ASD also outperformed standard-of-practice CBT and TAU on parent-reported scales of internalizing symptoms (estimated group mean differences: adapted vs standard-of-practice CBT, -0.097 [95% CI, -0.172 to -0.023], P = .01; adapted CBT vs TAU, -0.126 [95% CI, -0.243 to -0.010]; P = .04), ASD-associated social-communication symptoms (estimated group mean difference: adapted vs standard-of-practice CBT, -0.115 [95% CI, -0223 to -0.007]; P = .04; adapted CBT vs TAU: -0.235 [95% CI,-0.406 to -0.065]; P = .01); and anxiety-associated social functioning (estimated group mean difference: adapted vs standard-of-practice CBT, -0.160 [95% CI, -0.307 to -0.013]; P = .04; adapted CBT vs TAU: -0.284 [95% CI, -0.515 to -0.053]; P = .02). Both CBT conditions achieved higher rates of positive treatment response than TAU (BIACA, 61 of 66 [92.4%]; Coping Cat, 47 of 58 [81.0%]; TAU, 2 of 18 [11.1%]; P < .001 for each comparison).


Conclusions and Relevance
In this study, CBT was efficacious for children with ASD and interfering anxiety, and an adapted CBT approach showed additional advantages. It is recommended that clinicians providing psychological treatments to school-aged children with ASD consider developing CBT expertise.

Moving to the cloud introduces several confidentiality, integrity, and availability concerns. One of the key issues that affect availability is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). In such attacks, a cloud can be the source or the victim. DDoS attacks on a cloud can be much more harmful than its impact on a single physical server. One of the most recognized DDoS types is DNS reflection amplification attack. In this paper, we introduce a new technique to limit the sources of DNS reflection amplification attacks. In particular, we make use of the role of cloud hypervisors in managing all the virtualization environment traffic. The proposed technique can prevent scenarios ISP edge router ingress filtering will fail to prevent and is easier to implement.","[{'authorId': '2140609969', 'name': 'A.

We validate our models by creating a real-time vision system which accomplishes the tasks of face detection, gender classification and emotion classification simultaneously in one blended step using our proposed CNN architecture. After presenting the details of the training procedure setup we proceed to evaluate on standard benchmark sets. We report accuracies of 96% in the IMDB gender dataset and 66% in the FER-2013 emotion dataset. Along with this we also introduced the very recent real-time enabled guided back-propagation visualization technique. Guided back-propagation uncovers the dynamics of the weight changes and evaluates the learned features. We argue that the careful implementation of modern CNN architectures, the use of the current regularization methods and the visualization of previously hidden features are necessary in order to reduce the gap between slow performances and real-time architectures.

Our aim in this paper was to manipulate the Regulatory Focus Theory to assess its impact on the induction of regulatory focus related emotions in children in a pretend play scenario with a social robot. The Regulatory Focus Theory suggests that people follow one of two paradigms while attempting to achieve a goal; by seeking gains (promotion focus - associated with feelings of happiness) or by avoiding losses (prevention focus - associated with feelings of fear). We conducted a study with 69 school children in two different conditions (promotion vs. prevention). We succeeded in inducing happiness emotions in the promotion condition and found a resulting positive effect of the induction on children’s social engagement with the robot.

We proposed and tested the hypothesis that whether prevention-focused states boost creativity depends on regulatory closure (whether a goal is fulfilled or not). We predicted that prevention-focused states that activate the individual (unfulfilled prevention goals, fear) would lead to similar levels of creativity as promotion-focused states but that prevention-focused states that deactivate (closed prevention goals, relief) would lead to lower levels of creativity. Moreover, we predicted that this effect would be mediated by feelings of activation. Predictions were tested in 3 studies on creative insights and 1 on original ideation.

However, understanding how social and emotional skills are learned, and how this process can be supported by technology, is an important but underresearched area in HCI so far. To address this gap, we review existing approaches to social and emotions skills learning (SEL) in other fields, with a specific focus on SEL in education, in which a large number of evidence-based programs is widely deployed. In doing so, the primary aim of this article is to provide a foundation and set an agenda for future research on the design of technology that would support, and help teach, social and emotional skills. We identify the key challenges to successful learning shared by SEL programs in education—such as embedding skills learned in class also into everyday situations, promoting reflection, and providing additional opportunities for practice—and outline how these could be addressed by digital technology. Overall, our key argument is that much existing HCI work could be used in support of social and emotional skills learning in education, and possibly other domains, but that the topic has not been explored so far. We also highlight how the focus on supporting SEL would bring novel opportunities and challenges for HCI, as well as provide a basis for a strong HCI research agenda in this space.","[{'authorId': '2971246', 'name': 'P.

There is general agreement that the critical factors determining the trend rate of growth are to be sought in the savings propensities of the community (which determine the rate of capital accumulation), the flow of invention or innovation (which determines the rate of growth of productivity) and the growth of population. Until recently, these factors were regarded as the parameters of a growth model-i.e., as noneconomic variables which are invariant with respect to changes in the other variables-and theoretical inquiry was confined to the more modest task of showing the particular relationships that must prevail between the values of these different parameters in order that they should be consistent with a steady rate of growth for the economy as a whole. But more recently, there has been an increasing awareness of the fact that neither the proportion of income saved nor the rate of growth of productivity per man (nor, of course, the rate of increase in population) are independent variables with respect to the rate of increase in production; and that the actual rate of progress of a capitalist economy is the outcome of the mutual interaction of forces which can adequately be represented only in the form of simple functional relationships (like supply or demand curves) rather than by constants. The purpose of this paper is to present a simple model of economic growth based on a minimum number of such relationships.2 A satisfactory model concerning the nature of the growth process in a capitalist economy must also account for the remarkable historical constancies revealed by recent empirical investigations.

However, the human involvement in MCS results in a high possibility for unintentionally contributing corrupted and falsified data or intentionally spreading disinformation for malevolent purposes, consequently undermining IoT services. Therefore, recruiting trustworthy contributors plays a crucial role in collecting high-quality data and providing a better quality of services while minimizing the vulnerabilities and risks to MCS systems. In this paper, a novel trust model called experience–reputation (E-R) is proposed for evaluating trust relationships between any two mobile device users in an MCS platform. To enable the E-R model, virtual interactions among the users are manipulated by considering an assessment of the quality of contributed data from such users. Based on these interactions, two indicators of trust called experience and reputation are calculated accordingly. By incorporating the experience and reputation trust indicators (TIs), trust relationships between the users are established, evaluated, and maintained. Based on these trust relationships, a novel trust-based recruitment scheme is carried out for selecting the most trustworthy MCS users to contribute to data sensing tasks. In order to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed trust-based mechanism as well as the E-R trust model, we deploy several recruitment schemes in an MCS testbed, which consists of both normal and malicious users. The results highlight the strength of the trust-based scheme as it delivers a better quality for MCS services while being able to detect malicious users. We believe that the trust-based user recruitment offers an effective capability for selecting trustworthy users for various MCS systems and, importantly, the proposed mechanism is practical to deploy in the real world.","[{'authorId': '10421619', 'name': 'N.

This ambitious program touches theoretical abstract computer science (CS) concepts such as graph connectivity and graph isomorphism. While a methodological study on the effectiveness of this program is yet to be conducted, Gibson’s impressions indicate that even at this early age, children are capable of working with abstractions and use computational reasoning. This project continues a series of projects introducing formal computing methods [3] and programming (in Java) [4] to children of various ages, though in previous projects the youngest children were seven years old. The rationale and motivation behind the development of such programs is clear. It is well known that enrollment to undergraduate CS studies does not meet the requirements of the job market, and that among other reasons affecting students’ decision not to major in CS are students’ misconceptions regarding the nature of CS and of the work in CS and their negative attitudes towards CS. Therefore, the recommendation is to expose students to CS before they form these misconceptions and attitudes, and before decisions affecting enrollment are taken. Many argue that high school is too late for such an exposure and indeed many attempts are reported, which start at junior high school and even primary school.","[{'authorId': '1782253', 'name': 'M.

However, the use of these umbrella-concepts in educational contexts has caused issues when used in conjunction with concepts such as affordances and integration. In this paper, eight Chinese preservice early childhood teachers’ perceptions of ICT and its affordances are explored through online interviews. The participants conceptualised ‘ICT’ as screen-based technologies such as interactive whiteboards and computers. These technologies were perceived to afford efficiency and assistance, particularly for teacher-centred practice, but to constrain children’s tactile and direct hands-on experience. The results highlight the importance of sociocultural contexts (e.g. practicum places and educational traditions) in shaping preservice teachers’ perceptions of technology and technology use. Implications for future technology integration research and teacher education are discussed.

Using a software interface, children were asked to collaboratively create a story with the robot. We conducted a study with 38 children in two conditions. In one condition, the children interacted with a robot exhibiting creative behavior while in the other condition, they interacted with a robot exhibiting non creative behavior. The robot's creativity was defined as verbal and performance creativity. The robot's creative and non creative behaviors were extracted from a previously collected data set and were validated in an online survey with 100 participants. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, children's creativity measures were not higher in the creative condition than in the non creative condition. Our results suggest that merely the robot's creative behavior is insufficient to stimulate creativity in children in a child robot interaction.

Research has found that adolescents with ASD display various impairments in social behavior such as theory of mind (ToM), emotion recognition, and social synchrony. However, not much is known about the relationships among these dimensions of social behavior. Adolescents with and without ASD participated in the study. ToM ability was measured by viewing social animations of geometric shapes, recognition of facial emotions was measured by viewing pictures of faces, and synchrony ability was measured with a spontaneously arising interpersonal movement task completed with a caregiver and an intentional interpersonal task. Attention and social responsiveness were measured using parent reports. We then examined the relationship between ToM, emotion recognition, clinical measures of attention and social responsiveness, and social synchronization that arises either spontaneously or intentionally. Results indicate that spontaneous synchrony was related to ToM and intentional synchrony was related to clinical measures of attention and social responsiveness. Facial emotion recognition was not related to either ToM or social synchrony. Our findings highlight the importance of biological motion perception and production and attention for more fully understanding the social behavior characteristic of ASD. The findings suggest that the processes underlying difficulties in spontaneous synchrony in ASD are different than the processes underlying difficulties in intentional synchronization.","[{'authorId': '35772137', 'name': 'P.

However, the existing methods cannot rely on the common smart bracelets or watches for emotion monitoring in daily life. To address this issue, our study proposes a method for emotional recognition using heart rate data from a wearable smart bracelet. A ‘neutral + target’ pair emotion stimulation experimental paradigm was presented, and a dataset of heart rate from 25 subjects was established, where neutral plus target emotion (neutral, happy, and sad) stimulation video pairs from China’s standard Emotional Video Stimuli materials (CEVS) were applied to the recruited subjects. Normalized features from the data of target emotions normalized by the baseline data of neutral mood were adopted. Emotion recognition experiment results approved the effectiveness of ‘neutral + target’ video pair simulation experimental paradigm, the baseline setting using neutral mood data, and the normalized features, as well as the classifiers of Adaboost and GBDT on this dataset. This method will promote the development of wearable consumer electronic devices for monitoring human emotional moods.","[{'authorId': '144308894', 'name': 'Lin Shu'}, {'authorId': '2107621785', 'name': 'Y.

This course differs from most introductory courses in computer science in that it does not include programming using a computer programming language. Students focus on algorithms and the principle of computational thinking, and use a flowchart simulator to experiment with various short algorithms and build simple computer games without dealing with programming language syntax. Steadily increasing enrollments and interest from various departments on campus indicate that this course has become a successful addition to our introductory CS offerings.","[{'authorId': '1698406', 'name': 'Jeannette M.

However, little is known about what designers use as sources for inspiration, and how they process such information to generate ideas and solve design problems. Whilst previous investigations have shown both the positive and negative effects of using particular visual sources for inspiration, there is a lack of information on other types of stimuli designers might use during idea generation. This paper presents the results of a questionnaire on novice and expert designers’ preference regarding inspirational sources. Additionally, this study also encompasses both groups’ selection of ideation methods for the generation of creative design solutions. Results show that whilst there are similarities between novices’ and experts’ responses, there are also clear differences in how they make use of available resources during idea generation. These findings unveil possible repercussions for design education on how designers search for inspiration.","[{'authorId': '30731221', 'name': 'M.

According to the research, one of the main psychological factors supposed to underlie in these difficulties is the lack or low levels of joint attention with the interaction partners. The use of robots in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) interventions has received a lot of attention in the last years. Robots can achieve high levels of effectiveness in interacting with children with autism. This paper presents robots that play several important roles and benefits in the interaction of children with autism. In the absence of dialogue corpus, we collected and integrated conversation data for children with autism. We present to use a neural network to build a robot dialogue system that generates answers freely without restrictions, and design robot movements to attract attention from children with autism. Most importantly, the robot will interact smoothly with autistic children without human intervention.","[{'authorId': '153326943', 'name': 'Tianhao She'}, {'authorId': '144018134', 'name': 'Xin Kang'}, {'authorId': '1792084', 'name': 'S.

We specifically investigated whether children’s task engagement and robot engagement were influenced by three different feedback types by the robot: adult-like feedback, peer-like feedback and no feedback. Additionally, we investigated the relation between children’s eye gaze fixations and their task engagement and robot engagement. Fifty-eight Dutch children participated in an English counting task with a social robot and physical blocks. We found that, overall, children in the three conditions showed similar task engagement and robot engagement; however, within each condition, they showed large individual differences. Additionally, regression analyses revealed that there is a relation between children’s eye-gaze direction and engagement. Our findings showed that although eye gaze plays a significant role in measuring engagement and can be used to model children’s task engagement and robot engagement, it does not account for the full concept and engagement still comprises more than just eye gaze.","[{'authorId': '3470556', 'name': 'M.

65f0afef6e6e5caba5ba4118917930904a87bbf0,"Previous research suggests that preschoolers struggle with understanding abstract relations and with reasoning by analogy. Four experiments find, in contrast, that 3- and 4-year-olds (N = 168) are surprisingly adept at relational and analogical reasoning within a causal context. In earlier studies preschoolers routinely favored images that share thematic or perceptual commonalities with a target image (object matches) over choices that match the target along abstract relations (relational matches). The present studies embed such choice tasks within a cause-and-effect framework. Without causal framing, preschoolers strongly favor object matches, replicating the results of previous studies. But with causal framing, preschoolers succeed at analogical transfer (i.e., choose relational matches). These findings suggest that causal framing facilitates early analogical reasoning.","[{'authorId': '4644789', 'name': 'M. Goddu'}, {'authorId': '2464187', 'name': 'T.

66ccfc489a01d7875c145babd9f3cbbf0f5d6cdb,"Children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) frequently present symptoms of various mental disorders along with the features that define ASD. Problems with anxiety, depression, emotion regulation, cognitive problems, such as deficits in theory of mind, and associated behavioral problems, occur in children with autism of all ages [5]. In recent years, the application of robots in therapeutic interventions for children with neurodevelopment disorders and more specifically in children with ASD, has aroused the interest of the robotic community and experts in the field of autism [3]. Socially Assistive Robots are promising in their potential to promote and support mental health in children with ASD. There is a growing number of studies investigating the feasibility and effectiveness of robot interventions in supporting children’s mental wellbeing, such as helping in anxiety, depression and socio-emotional problems [3, 4]. Several authors have also suggested Cognitive and Behavior Therapy (CBT) as a very useful intervention therapy, which can apply in combination with a social assistive robot [5, 6, 8]. CBT has specific strategies that can be very supportive and particularly useful for individual’s problems. Many applications of this combination have shown substantial improvements in stress management, contextualized emotion recognition and theory of mind. With a coordinated effort, robot, cbt techniques and collaboration with mental health consultants, children with ASD can improve their social, emotional and behavioral competence [5].","[{'authorId': '2132189205', 'name': 'Areti-Eirini Filiou'}]",0.0,{'name': 'SHS Web of Conferences'},10.0,"Robotics and cbt and entertainment in the enhancement of children with asd, mental disorders, dysfunctional emotions and irrational beliefs",2022.0

A large body of research has shown that alterations in ER are related to psychological disorders across different diagnostic categories. Because of the apparent ubiquity of ER difficulties in psychopathology, several authors have proposed that ER should be regarded as a transdiagnostic process. This article critically examines evidence regarding alterations in the use of cognitive ER strategies as a transdiagnostic process. Cognitive ER strategies are examined as 1 example of several possible ER-related processes that could be involved in psychopathology. There is consistent evidence showing that a reduced use of cognitive reappraisal and an increased use of negative rumination are present across a number of disorders, whereas increased levels of positive rumination appear to be confined to bipolar disorder. However, there is only preliminary evidence from prospective and/or experimental studies on the causal nature of altered ER strategy use in the development or maintenance of psychopathology. The article concludes by discussing future directions, including methodological and design issues, as well as implications for assessment and treatment when studying alterations in ER from a transdiagnostic perspective.

The research is based on a 3 step framework: 1) Human-Human Interaction, Stage-1 (HHI-S1), 2) Human-Robot Interaction, Stage-2 (HRI-S2), and 3) Human-Human Interaction, Stage-3 (HHI-S3). All three stages of the therapy consist of two command sets: 1) Controls commands and 2) Evaluation commands (auditory commands, visual commands, and combination of both). The concept of multiple robots is introduced to help multi-human communication and discourage isolation in ASD children. The joint attention of an ASD child is improved by the robotic therapy in stage 2 considering it as a key parameter for a multi-human communication scenario. The improvement in joint attention results in better command following in a triad multi-human communication scenario in stage 3 as compared to stage 1. The proposed intervention has been tested on 8 ASD subjects with 10 sessions over a period of two and a half months (10 weeks). Each session of human-human interaction (stage 1 and 3) consisted of 14 cues whereas 18 cues were presented by each robot for human-robot interaction (stage 2). The results indicate an overall 86% improvement in the social communication skills of ASD children in case of a multi-human scenario.

6d40e37460a8d8325ecfd91c43c6313ed4bce51c,"Background: It is critical that the interventions children on the autism spectrum receive are evidence-based. Given the breadth of available non-pharmacological interventions, a synthesis of research evidence on interventions for children on the autism spectrum is needed.Methods: We completed an umbrella review of systematic reviews, published between 2010-2020, focusing on interventions for children aged 0-12 years. Only systematic reviews that included at least one primary study with a controlled group design were included. Interventions were classified as Behavioural, Developmental, Naturalistic Developmental Behavioural Interventions (NDBIs), Sensory-based, Technology-based, Animal-assisted, Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), Treatment and Education of Autistic and related Communication-handicapped Children (TEACCH), and ‘other’ (i.e., interventions that didn’t correspond to the other categories). Results: Evidence from 58 systematic reviews indicated positive therapeutic effects for Behavioural interventions, Developmental interventions, NDBIs, Technology-based interventions, and CBT on a range of child and family outcomes. Positive effects for Sensory-based interventions were reported for certain practices only and were limited to select child and family outcomes. A mix of inconsistent and null intervention effects on child and family outcomes were reported for TEACCH and Animal-assisted interventions. There were no consistent findings of the possible effects of intervention delivery (e.g., amount, agent, delivery format, delivery mode) or child characteristics (e.g., age, cognitive skills) on outcomes. Few studies measured outcomes beyond children’s characteristics and skills, to consider broader participation, quality of life, or family outcomes. Adverse effects were rarely reported, and findings were based predominantly on lower quality reviews and/or reviews with a mixture of study designs.Conclusions: There is evidence for the positive effects of a range of interventions, but not for a single best intervention for all children, nor an intervention conferring positive effects across all outcomes examined.

Therefore, it is important that children acquire ICT skills as part of 21st century skills education to prepare them for later life. Drawing on the literature, seven 21st century skills can profit from the addition of ICT skills, i.e., technical, information, communication, collaboration, critical thinking, creative, and problem-solving skills. While many efforts have been made to integrate ICT skills as part of 21st century skills education into primary and secondary school curricula, the implementation of these skills in early childhood education and care remains a challenge due to developmental concerns. This paper aims to uncover developmental antecedents for ICT 21st century skills in early childhood, mainly addressing children’s cognitive development, and propose ways to implement these skills in child-friendly ways. Drawing on the literature on developmental psychology, seven cognitive developmental antecedents were identified: inductive, deductive, abductive, causal, and scientific reasoning, executive functions, and computational thinking. Moreover, five additional developmental antecedents were identified: fine motor skills, language development, self-regulation, social-emotional development, and creativity. On the backdrop of these antecedents, ways of implementing ICT skills as part of 21st century skills education in early childhood classrooms are proposed that include digital games and learning apps, collaborative play or problem-solving activities with toy robots.","[{'authorId': '39169042', 'name': 'A.

Our main focus in this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a robot-enhanced intervention on turn-taking abilities. We aim to identify to what degree social robots can improve turn-taking skills and whether this type of intervention provides similar or better gains than standard intervention. This study presents a series of 5 single-subject experiments with children with autism spectrum disorder aged between 3 and 5 years. Each child receives 20 intervention sessions (8 robot-enhanced sessions—robot-enhanced treatment (RET), 8 standard human sessions—standard human treatment, and 4 sessions with the intervention that was more efficient). Our findings show that most children reach similar levels of performance on turn-taking skills across standard human treatment and RET, meaning that children benefit to a similar extent from both interventions. However, in the RET condition, children seemed to see their robotic partner as being more interesting than their human partner, due to the fact that they looked more at the robotic partner compared with the human partner.","[{'authorId': '48356644', 'name': 'Daniel O.

 Skeleton based action recognition distinguishes human actions using the trajectories of skeleton joints, which provide a very good representation for describing actions. Considering that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) can learn feature representations and model long-term temporal dependencies automatically, we propose an end-to-end fully connected deep LSTM network for skeleton based action recognition. Inspired by the observation that the co-occurrences of the joints intrinsically characterize human actions, we take the skeleton as the input at each time slot and introduce a novel regularization scheme to learn the co-occurrence features of skeleton joints. To train the deep LSTM network effectively, we propose a new dropout algorithm which simultaneously operates on the gates, cells, and output responses of the LSTM neurons. Experimental results on three human action recognition datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

Robot-enhanced therapy has been used in psychosocial and educational interventions for children with ASD with promising results. Whenever CBT-based techniques were incorporated in robot-based interventions, they were mainly performed in group sessions. Objectives: The study’s main objective was the implementation and evaluation of the effectiveness of a relaxation training intervention for children with ASD, delivered by the social robot NAO. Methods: 20 children (aged 7–12 years) were randomly assigned to 16 sessions of relaxation training implemented twice a week. Two groups were formed: the NAO group (children participated in individual sessions with the support of NAO) and the control group (children participated in individual sessions with the support of the therapist only). Participants received three different relaxation scenarios of increasing difficulty (a breathing scenario, a progressive muscle relaxation scenario and a body scan medication scenario), as well as related homework sheets for practicing. Pre- and post-intervention assessments were conducted using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for parents (SDQ-P). Participants were also asked to complete an open-ended questionnaire to evaluate the effectiveness of the training. Parents’ satisfaction was evaluated via a questionnaire and children satisfaction was assessed by a thermometer scale. Results: The study supports the use of relaxation training with the NAO robot as instructor for children with ASD. Parents of enrolled children reported high levels of satisfaction and provided positive ratings of the training acceptability. Children in the NAO group presented greater motivation to complete homework and adopt the learned techniques at home. Conclusions: Relaxation training could be effectively integrated in robot-assisted protocols to help children with ASD regulate emotions and develop","[{'authorId': '113613965', 'name': 'V.

The work considers key points that have contributed to increase the success of the innovative solutions grounding them on known technology acceptance models. The analysis is presented with a threefold perspective: A Technological vision illustrates the characteristics of the support systems to operate in a real environment with continuity, robustness, and safety; a Socio-Health perspective highlights the role of experts in the socio-assistance domain to provide contextualized and personalized help based on actual people’s needs; finally, a Human dimension takes into account the personal aspects that influence the interaction with technology in the long term experience. The article promotes the crucial role of AI and robotics in ensuring intelligent and situated assistive behaviours.

Each child heard 2 stories in which 2 candidate causes co-occurred with an effect. Evidence was presented in the form: AB?E; CA?E; AD?E; and so forth. In 1 story, all variables came from the same domain; in the other, the recurring candidate cause, A, came from a different domain (A was a psychological cause of a biological effect). After receiving this statistical evidence, children were asked to identify the cause of the effect on a new trial. Consistent with the predictions of a Bayesian model, all children were more likely to identify A as the cause within domains than across domains. Whereas 3.5-year-olds learned only from the within-domain evidence, 4- and 5-year-olds learned from the cross-domain evidence and were able to transfer their new expectations about psychosomatic causality to a novel task.","[{'authorId': '144877155', 'name': 'L.

Key theoretical constructs of the information-processing perspective include “searching” a “problem space” by using “heuristics” that produce “incremental” changes such as reaching a “subgoal” to solve a puzzle. Key theoretical constructs of the dynamical-systems perspective include “positive attractors”, “negative attractors”, and “latent attractors” that can cause large “nonincremental” changes in the possibility of a solution through the “emergence” of new ideas and beliefs that can resolve a conflict. The proposed alignment maps dynamical-system constructs to information-processing constructs: state space to problem space, negative attractor to impasse, positive attractor to productive subgoal, latent attractor to implicit cognition, and nonincremental change to insight. The purpose of the mapping is to explore similarities and differences between these constructs. Research from cognitive and social psychology illustrates how using constructs from both perspectives is helpful. The concluding section on Future Directions recommends an agenda based on three objectives: (1) create ontologies to organise current knowledge, (2) conduct research to obtain new knowledge, and (3) provide education to inform students about this knowledge.","[{'authorId': '2100081', 'name': 'Stephen K.

Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 1973, 38 (5, Serial No. 152). This Monograph reports three studies of the 4-year-old's ability to adjust to a listener. In the first study (Study A) 16 Ss were pretested on modified versions of standard tests of ""egocentrism."" Following these, the children were asked first to tell an adult about a toy and then tell a 2-year-old about that toy. The eight Ss who had 2-year-old siblings were run on the toy task twice: once in an adult-sibling session, and once in an adult-nonsibling session. Finally, tapes were made of spontaneous conversations between the Ss and their mothers. As expected, the Ss performed poorly on the tests of ""egocentrism."" In contrast, Ss adjusted their speech production to their different listeners. Speech to 2-year-olds contained more short, simple utterances and more attentional utterances. The younger the 2-year-old, the greater was the observed speech adjustment. All children adjusted their speech whether or not they had younger siblings. In Study B tapes of uncontrolled conversations of five 4-year-olds each talking to a 2-year-old and an adult were obtained. Analyses of speech adjustments revealed a pattern of results like those of Study A. In Study C tapes of eight 4-year-olds talking to peers were collected and compared with the taped conversations with their mothers obtained in the first study. Analyses of the peer-directed versus adult-directed speech showed that, with respect to utterance length, the use of various constructions, and attentional utterances, peers were treated like adults. These results, combined with those of Study A, indicate that the 4-year-old adjusts his speech with regard to the changing capacities of different-aged listeners. The results of these studies are discussed with regard to previous work on the preschooler's communication skills and the variety of listener-produced cues that may influence the 4-year-old's tendency to ""talk down."" The implications of speaker-listener interaction for the process of language acquisition are considered.

The purpose of this review is to configure primarily qualitative and mixed methods findings from studies meeting our selection and quality criterion to answer the review question: How do robotic construction kits function as computational manipulatives in P–12 STEM education? Our synthesis of the literature has resulted in four key insights that are new to the field. First, RCKs have a unique double application: They may be used for direct instruction in robotics (first-order uses) or as analogical tools for learning in other domains (second-order uses). Second, RCKs make possible additional routes to learning through the provision of immediate feedback and the dual modes of representation unique to RCKs. Third, RCKs support a computational thinking learning progression beginning with a lower anchor of sequencing and finishing with a high anchor of systems thinking. And fourth, RCKs support evolving problem-solving abilities along a continuum, ranging from trial and error to heuristic methods associated with robotics study. Furthermore, our synthesis provides insight into the second-order (analogical) uses of RCKs as computational manipulatives in the disciplines of physics and biology. Implications for practice and directions for future research are discussed.

Within this field, dialogue systems and interaction by voice play an important role. When speaking about human–robot natural dialogue we assume that the robot has the capability to accurately recognize what the human wants to transmit verbally and even its semantic meaning, but this is not always achieved. In this article we describe the steps and requirements that we went through in order to endow the personal social robot Maggie, developed at the University Carlos III of Madrid, with the capability of understanding the natural language spoken by any human. We have analyzed the different possibilities offered by current software/hardware alternatives by testing them in real environments. We have obtained accurate data related to the speech recognition capabilities in different environments, using the most modern audio acquisition systems and analyzing not so typical parameters such as user age, gender, intonation, volume, and language. Finally, we propose a new model to classify recognition results as accepted or rejected, based on a second automatic speech recognition (ASR) opinion. This new approach takes into account the precalculated success rate in noise intervals for each recognition framework, decreasing the rate of false positives and false negatives. 1HRI can be defined as the study of humans, robots, and the ways in which they influence each other.","[{'authorId': '1401846718', 'name': 'F.

To describe the psychometric properties of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a brief measure of the prosocial behavior and psychopathology of 3-16-year-olds that can be completed by parents, teachers, or youths.


METHOD
A nationwide epidemiological sample of 10,438 British 5-15-year-olds obtained SDQs from 96% of parents, 70% of teachers, and 91% of 11-15-year-olds. Blind to the SDQ findings, all subjects were also assigned DSM-IVdiagnoses based on a clinical review of detailed interview measures.


RESULTS
The predicted five-factor structure (emotional, conduct, hyperactivity-inattention, peer, prosocial) was confirmed. Internalizing and externalizing scales were relatively ""uncontaminated"" by one another. Reliability was generally satisfactory, whether judged by internal consistency (mean Cronbach a: .73), cross-informant correlation (mean: 0.34), or retest stability after 4 to 6 months (mean: 0.62). SDQ scores above the 90th percentile predicted a substantially raised probability of independently diagnosed psychiatric disorders (mean odds ratio: 15.7 for parent scales, 15.2 for teacher scales, 6.2 for youth scales).


CONCLUSION
The reliability and validity of the SDQ make it a useful brief measure of the adjustment and psychopathology of children and adolescents.","[{'authorId': '2144914', 'name': 'R. Goodman'}]",5726.0,,18.0,Psychometric properties of the strengths and difficulties questionnaire.,2001.0

However, efforts to explain behavior in terms of EF have been hampered by an inadequate characterization of EF itself. What is the function that is accomplished by EF? The present analysis attempts to ground the construct of EF in an account of problem solving and thereby to integrate temporally and functionally distinct aspects of EF within a coherent framework. According to this problem-solving framework, EF is a macroconstruct that spans 4 phases of problem solving (representation, planning, execution, and evaluation). When analyzed into subfunctions, macroconstructs such as EF permit the integration of findings from disparate content domains, which are often studied in isolation from the broader context of reasoning and action.

Children with autism have difficulties with social interaction and several studies indicate that they show preference toward interaction with objects, such as computers and robots, rather than with humans. In 1991, Carol Gray developed Social Stories, an intervention tool aimed to increase children’s social skills. Social stories are short scenarios written or tailored for autistic individuals to help them understand and behave appropriately in social situations. This study shows that, in specific situations, the social performance of autistic children improves when using the robot Probo, as a medium for social story telling, than when a human reader tells the stories. The robot tells Social Stories to teach ASD children how to react in situations like saying “hello”, saying “thank you” and “sharing toys”. The robot has the capability of expressing emotions and attention via its facial expressions and its gaze.

Existing systems are mainly based on simplified protocols which qualitatively evaluate subject performance. We propose a robotic coaching platform for training social, motor and cognitive capabilities, with two main contributions: (i) using triadic interactions(adult, robot and child), with robotic mirroring, and (ii) providing quantitative performance indicators. The key system features were accurately designed, including type of protocols, feedback systems and evaluation metrics, contemplating the requirements for applications with ASD children. We implemented two protocols, Robot-Master and Adult-Master, where children performed different gestures guided by the robot or the adult respectively, eventually receiving feedback about movement execution. In both, the robot mirrors the subject during the movement. To assess system functionalities, with a homogeneous group of subjects, tests were carried out with 28 healthy subjects; one preliminary acquisition was done with an ASD child. Data analysis was customized to design protocol-specific parameters for movement characterization. Our tests show that robotic mirroring execution depends on the complexity and standardization of movements, as well as on the robot technical features. The feedback system evaluated movement phases and successfully estimated the completion of the exercises. Future work includes improving platform flexibility and adaptability, and clinical trials with ASD children to test the impact of the robotic coach on reducing symptoms. We trust that the proposed quantitative performance indicators extend the current state-of-the-art towards clinical usage of robotic-based coaching systems.","[{'authorId': '118399629', 'name': 'Laura Santos'}, {'authorId': '26602958', 'name': 'A.

Persona differences were signaled to users by a combination of humanoid (speech, intonation), and indirect cues (colors and movement). We use Big Five personality theory to evaluate perceived differences between personas in an exploratory Wizard of Oz study. Participants were largely able to recognize underlying personality traits expressed through these cue combinations in ways that were consistent with our design goals. The proactive Buddy persona was judged as more Extravert than the more passive Sidekick persona, and the Butler persona was perceived as more Conscientious and less Neurotic than either Buddy or Butler personas. Users also had clear preferences between different personas; they wanted robots that mimicked but accentuated their own personality.

However, there is no clarity on the impact of the interaction quality between a child with ASD and a robot on the effectiveness of the therapy. Previous research showed that the use of a robot in Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) could be an effective treatment component in diminishing ASD-related symptoms. Further analyzing the data from a randomized controlled trial of PRT treatment, we looked at the long-term effects of child–robot game interactions to see whether the interaction quality changes over time. The attention and the engagement of six children were measured through the observation of non-verbal behavior at three different stages in the treatment that took 20 sessions per child. The gaze and arm/hand behavior of the participants towards the robot, the game, and other present humans were observed. The analysis showed no significant decrease in the attention and the engagement of the children towards the robot and the game. However, the attention and engagement toward the parents of the children increased. We conclude that the main result of sustained attention and engagement with the robot is due to the personalization of the games to meet the specific needs of this user group. These specific needs are met through inclusion of variability to the level of development and personal choice of each participating child. We see the additional finding of increased attention towards the parents as especially positive since the children are expected to improve in human–human interaction as a result of this treatment.","[{'authorId': '2003378087', 'name': 'M.

Our findings suggest the potential of technology to enable a shift in how prevention interventions are designed and delivered: empowering children and parents through a new model of 'child-led, situated interventions', where participants learn through actionable support directly within family life, as opposed to didactic in-person workshops and a subsequent 'skills application'.

Delays and deficits in joint attention and symbolic play constitute two important developmental problems in young children with autism. These areas of deficit have been well studied in autism but have rarely been the focus of treatment efforts (see Kasari, Freeman, & Paparella, 2001). In this study, we examine the efficacy of targeted interventions of joint attention and symbolic play.


METHODS
Participants were 58 children with autism aged 3 and 4 years (46 boys). Children were randomized to a joint attention intervention, a symbolic play intervention, or control group. Interventions were conducted 30 minutes daily for 5-6 weeks. Both structured assessments of joint attention and play skills and mother-child interactions were collected pre and post intervention by independent assessors.


RESULTS
Results indicate that both intervention groups improved significantly over the control group on certain behaviors. Children in the joint attention intervention initiated significantly more showing and responsiveness to joint attention on the structured joint attention assessment and more child-initiated joint attention in the mother-child interaction. The children in the play group showed more diverse types of symbolic play in interaction with their mothers and higher play levels on both the play assessment and in interaction with their mothers.


CONCLUSIONS
This randomized controlled trial provides promising data on the specificity and generalizability of joint attention and play interventions for young children with autism. Future studies need to examine the long-term effects of these early interventions on children's development.","[{'authorId': '2592071', 'name': 'C. Kasari'}, {'authorId': '7775381', 'name': 'S.

However, the factors related to developing computational thinking in preschool education are still under study. Furthermore, not too many empirical investigations provide evidence about the development of computational thinking in young children. The present study examined the effects of scaffolding and gender in developing young children’s sequencing and decomposition skills - two of the five skills that constitute computational thinking. The results indicated statistically significant effects about the type of scaffolding on children’s computational thinking in favor of the children assigned to the experimental groups. Lastly, boys outperformed girls on all occasions, indicating that gender effects exist. The authors conclude that researchers need to design teaching interventions in such a way so they have mathemagenic outcomes for all learners irrespective of gender. Finally, the authors conclude with implications and future research directions.","[{'authorId': '39394532', 'name': 'C.

This paper presents an exploratory study that, for the first time, uses the Regulatory Focus Theory (RFT) to assess children's creativity skills in an educational context with a social robot. We investigated whether two key emotional regulation techniques, promotion (approach) and prevention (avoidance), stimulate creativity during a story-telling activity between a child and a robot. We conducted a between-subjects field study with 69 children between the ages of 7 and 9 years old, divided between two study conditions: (1) promotion, where a social robot primes children for action by eliciting positive emotional states, and (2) prevention, where a social robot primes children for avoidance by evoking a states related to security and safety associated with blockage-oriented behaviors. To assess changes in creativity as a response to the priming interaction, children were asked to tell stories to the robot before (pre-test) and after (post-test) the priming interaction. We measured creativity levels by analyzing the verbal content of the stories. We coded verbal expressions related to creativity variables, including fluency, flexibility, elaboration, and originality. Our results show that children in the promotion condition generated significantly more ideas, and their ideas were on average more original in the stories they created in the post-test rather than in the pre-test. We also modeled the process of creativity that emerges during storytelling in response to the robot's verbal behavior. This paper enriches the scientific understanding of creativity emergence in child-robot collaborative interactions.","[{'authorId': '28908289', 'name': 'Maha Elgarf'}, {'authorId': '2052028871', 'name': 'Natalia Calvo-Barajas'}, {'authorId': '1401670338', 'name': 'Patrícia Alves-Oliveira'}, {'authorId': '1556566185', 'name': 'G.

The frameworks were compared on their underlying rationales and goals, their definition of 21st century competences, and the recommended strategies for the implementation and assessment of these skills in educational practice. In addition three international studies were examined to analyse how various countries (EU member states, OECD countries) and schools (SITES studies) deal (or not) with 21st century competences. The findings indicate a large extent of alignment between the frameworks about what 21st century competences are and why they are important (horizontal consistency), but intentions and practice seemed still far apart, indicating lack of vertical consistency.

We varied the probabilistic effectiveness of the block, as well as whether the experimenter or the child was performing the interventions. In Experiment 1, we found that children can use probabilistic evidence to make inferences about causal strength. However, when the results of their own interventions are in conflict with the overall frequencies, preschoolers favor the results of their own interventions. In Experiment 2, children used probabilistic evidence to infer a hidden causal mechanism. Though they again gave preference to their own interventions, they did not do so when their interventions were explicitly confounded by an alternative cause.","[{'authorId': '3693228', 'name': 'T.

Problems arise when comorbid symptomatology reaches extreme levels, leading to functional decline in the patients. We discuss the case of a 13-year-old girl diagnosed with autism disorder who presented with a long history of social, interpersonal, and academic challenges. The patient was hospitalized with the complaint of a persistent, non-painful, and unpleasant sensation in the perineal area that eventually resulted in repetitive and compulsive behaviors. Robot-enhanced relaxation training was introduced to support the patient since she declined to undergo any form of talk therapy. The aim of the intervention was to prevent the irritation from escalating and promote self-regulation skills. The results, based on parent reporting, indicated that the patient acquired relaxation skills, experienced some positive effects on emotional regulation, and showed a decrease in the duration of her disruptive behaviors upon completing the relaxation training.

The monitoring of lifestyles could facilitate remote physicians or caregivers to give insight into symptoms of the disease and provide health improvement advice to residents; Objective: This research work aims to apply lifestyle monitoring in an ambient assisted living (AAL) system by diagnosing conduct and distinguishing variation from the norm with the slightest conceivable fake alert. In pursuing this aim, the main objective is to fill the knowledge gap of two contextual observations (i.e., day and time) in the frequent behavior modeling for an individual in AAL. Each sensing category has its advantages and restrictions. Only a single type of sensing unit may not manage composite states in practice and lose the activity of daily living. To boost the efficiency of the system, we offer an exceptional sensor data fusion technique through different sensing modalities; Methods: As behaviors may also change according to other contextual observations, including seasonal, weather (or temperature), and social interaction, we propose the design of a novel activity learning model by adding behavioral observations, which we name as the Wellness indices analysis model; Results: The ground-truth data are collected from four elderly houses, including daily activities, with a sample size of three hundred days plus sensor activation. The investigation results validate the success of our method. The new feature set from sensor data fusion enhances the system accuracy to (98.17% ± 0.95) from (80.81% ± 0.68).

METHODS: Forty-eight children diagnosed with ASD between 18 and 30 months of age were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: (1) ESDM intervention, which is based on developmental and applied behavioral analytic principles and delivered by trained therapists and parents for 2 years; or (2) referral to community providers for intervention commonly available in the community. RESULTS: Compared with children who received community-intervention, children who received ESDM showed significant improvements in IQ, adaptive behavior, and autism diagnosis. Two years after entering intervention, the ESDM group on average improved 17.6 standard score points (1 SD: 15 points) compared with 7.0 points in the comparison group relative to baseline scores. The ESDM group maintained its rate of growth in adaptive behavior compared with a normative sample of typically developing children. In contrast, over the 2-year span, the comparison group showed greater delays in adaptive behavior. Children who received ESDM also were more likely to experience a change in diagnosis from autism to pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified, than the comparison group. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first randomized, controlled trial to demonstrate the efficacy of a comprehensive developmental behavioral intervention for toddlers with ASD for improving cognitive and adaptive behavior and reducing severity of ASD diagnosis.

8d496abd8901df21983938e2c4d86cba96fd8136,"In educational scenarios involving social robots, understanding the way robot behaviors affect children’s motivation to achieve their learning goals is of vital importance. It is crucial for the formation of a trust relationship between the child and the robot so that the robot can effectively fulfill its role as a learning companion. In this study, we investigate the effect of a regulatory focus design scenario on the way children interact with a social robot. Regulatory focus theory is a type of self-regulation that involves specific strategies in pursuit of goals. It provides insights into how a person achieves a particular goal, either through a strategy focused on “promotion” that aims to achieve positive outcomes or through one focused on “prevention” that aims to avoid negative outcomes. In a user study, 69 children (7–9 years old) played a regulatory focus design goal-oriented collaborative game with the EMYS robot. We assessed children’s perception of likability and competence and their trust in the robot, as well as their willingness to follow the robot’s suggestions when pursuing a goal. Results showed that children perceived the prevention-focused robot as being more likable than the promotion-focused robot. We observed that a regulatory focus design did not directly affect trust. However, the perception of likability and competence was positively correlated with children’s trust but negatively correlated with children’s acceptance of the robot’s suggestions.","[{'authorId': '2052028871', 'name': 'Natalia Calvo-Barajas'}, {'authorId': '28908289', 'name': 'Maha Elgarf'}, {'authorId': '1556566185', 'name': 'G.

 BACKGROUND
 Emotion regulation is a key transdiagnostic risk factor for a range of psychopathologies, making it a prime target for both prevention and treatment interventions in childhood. Existing interventions predominantly rely on workshop or in-person therapy-based approaches, limiting the ability to promote emotion regulation competence for children in everyday settings and at scale. Purrble is a newly developed, inexpensive socially assistive robot—in the form of an interactive plush toy—which uses haptic feedback to support in-the-moment emotion regulation. It is accessible to children as needed in their daily lives, without the requirement for a priori training. While qualitative data from prior studies show high engagement in-situ and anecdotal evidence of the robot being incorporated into children’s emotion regulation routines, there is so far no quantitative evidence of the intervention’s impact on child outcomes.
 
 
 OBJECTIVE
 The aim of this study is to examine, for the first time, the efficacy of a new intervention model for child-led emotion regulation—Purrble—that could be deployed across prevention and treatment contexts.
 
 
 METHODS
 A total of 120 children aged 8-10 will be selected from an `enriched’ non-clinical US population: for inclusion, the cutoff for parent’s rating of child dysregulation will be 10 points or higher on the total difficulties score on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. This cutoff selects for a measurable—but not necessarily clinical—level of the child’s emotion regulatory difficulties. The selected families will be randomly assigned with .5 probability to receive either Purrble or an active control (non-interactive plush toy). The primary outcome will be a daily EMA measure of child emotion regulation capability (as reported by parents) over a period of 4 weeks. Exploratory analyses will investigate the intervention impact on secondary outcomes of child emotion regulation, collected weekly over the same 4 week period, with follow-ups at 1 month and 6 months post-deployment. Quantitative data will be analysed on an intent-to-treat basis. A proportion of families (~30% of the sample) will be interviewed post deployment as part of process analysis.
 
 
 RESULTS
 The study is funded by UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship (MR/T041897/1) and an in-kind contribution from Committee for Children. It received ethical approval from the Pearl IRB (#18-CFC-101). Participant recruitment will start in February 2021, with the 1 month deployment expected in April - May 2021. The results of the analysis will be published in 2021.
 
 
 CONCLUSIONS
 The study will be the first quantitative evaluation of the efficacy of an innovative, proof-of-concept intervention model for an in-situ, child-led emotion regulation intervention. The insights into the trajectory of daily changes, complemented with weekly questionnaire batteries and post-deployment interviews will result in an in-depth understanding of whether, and how the hypothesised intervention logic model works, leading to further intervention optimisation.

However, the effects of SARs on clinically relevant domains are not yet well established. Our goal was therefore to provide a proof-of-concept demonstration of the capacity for SARs to alleviate clinically relevant symptoms in children. Such a demonstration might then serve as the foundation for efforts to establish the role of SARs in mental health care. We examined the influence of interactions with an SAR on mood, anxiety, and arousal in a sample of 87 children between the ages of 6 and 9, following exposure to a stressful task. Participants completed the Trier Social Stress Test for Children before interacting with the SAR, interacting with the SAR turned off, or waiting quietly. Participants completed baseline and posttest measures of state anxiety and mood, and salivary cortisol was collected at 5 time points. Children who interacted with the robot showed greater increases in positive mood than children in either of the two control conditions, but did not differ from control participants in terms of negative mood, anxiety, or arousal. SARs may convey benefits for children’s mental health by augmenting positive mood. Future research should examine the processes through which SARs promote positive emotions and the circumstances under which that effect is most potent. Although preliminary, these findings suggest that SARs may provide a highly efficient way to alleviate clinical symptoms in children by increasing positive mood.","[{'authorId': '8251390', 'name': 'M.

The resulting prototype from integrating these developments undergoes multiple formative cycles and a summative evaluation cycle towards identifying acceptable behaviours and roles for the robot for example role as a butler or a trainer. Furthermore, the evaluation activities will use an evaluation grid in order to assess achievement of the identified user requirements, formulated in form of distinct scenarios. Finally, the project considers ethical concerns and by highlighting principles such as autonomy, independence, enablement, safety and privacy, it embarks on providing a discussion medium where user views on these principles and the existing tension between some of these principles for example tension between privacy and autonomy over safety, can be captured and considered in design cycles and throughout project developments.","[{'authorId': '3029288', 'name': 'F.

These children have delayed gestural development. We used a social robot in two phases to teach them to recognize and produce eight pantomime gestures that expressed feelings and needs. Compared to the children in the wait-list control group (N1⁄4 6), those in the intervention group (N1⁄4 7) were more likely to recognize gestures and to gesture accurately in trained and untrained scenarios. They also generalized the acquired recognition (but not production) skills to human-to-human interaction. The benefits and limitations of robot-based intervention for gestural learning were highlighted. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Compared to typically-developing children, children with autism spectrum disorders have delayed development of gesture comprehension and production. Robot-based intervention program was developed to teach children with autism spectrum disorders recognition (Phase I) and production (Phase II) of eight pantomime gestures that expressed feelings and needs. Children in the intervention group (but not in the wait-list control group) were able to recognize more gestures in both trained and untrained scenarios and generalize the acquired gestural recognition skills to human-to-human interaction. Similar findings were reported for gestural production except that there was no strong evidence showing children in the intervention group could produce gestures accurately in human-to-human interaction.

9263e2f0419aab0b6c5a376d0d576fd98f3415da,"Psychiatric comorbidity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a subject of critical scientific importance, affecting the quality of life, prognosis, and functional outcomes. The prevalence of psychiatric disorders vary considerably according to variables such as index subject characteristics, study setting, sampling frame, diagnostic methods used, as well as country of geographic origin. To date, most studies comprise clinical or treatment referral samples in tertiary care or subjects enrolled in clinical trials and genetic cohort collections. Such samples carry the potential for overestimation of both the frequency and severity of psychiatric comorbidity. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed and Web of Science databases restricted to population-based study publications in the English between May 1, 2015, and May 31, 2020. A comprehensive keyword list was generated to investigate co-occurrence of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents with ASD. A wide range of DSM-5 based disorders such as anxiety, mood, ADHD, intellectual disability/intellectual developmental disorder, eating/feeding, gender dysphoria and sleep-wake disorders were assessed. Initial search revealed a total of 1674 articles after removal of duplicates. Two independent researchers conducted a parallel-blinded screening process to identify the eligible studies based on titles and abstracts; 39 studies were analyzed in the current review. The main findings show prevalence estimates of 22.9% (95% CI: 17.7- 29.2) for intellectual disability; 26.2% (22-31) for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; 11.1% (8.6-14.1) for anxiety disorders; 19.7% (11.9-30.7) for sleep disorders; 7% (5.2- 9.3) for disruptive disorders; 2% (1.3- 3.1) for bipolar disorders; 2.7% (1.8- 4.2) for depression; 1.8% (0.4–8.7) for obsessive-compulsive disorder; and 0.6% (0.3–1.1) for psychosis. Psychiatric comorbidity in population-based studies is lower than in clinical and referred samples. However, our results also indicate that the frequency of psychiatric comorbidity in children and adolescents with ASD in the population context is considerable, without the influence of referral bias implicit in clinical and treatment samples. There is a need for better targeted diagnostic tools to detect psychiatric comorbidity in children and youth in future population-based studies, as an essential component in providing care as well as new insights into the nature and mechanisms of its underlying associations.

We find two key results. First, within large US cities, households, businesses, and real estate demand have moved from dense central business districts (CBDs) towards lower density suburban zip-codes. We label this the “Donut Effect” reflecting the movement of activity out of city centers to the suburban ring. Second, while this observed reallocation occurs within cities, we do not see major reallocation across cities. That is, there is less evidence for large-scale movement of activity from large US cities to smaller regional cities or towns. We rationalize these findings by noting that working patterns post pandemic will frequently be hybrid, with workers commuting to their business premises typically three days per week. This level of commuting is less than pre-pandemic, making suburbs relatively more popular, but too frequent to allow employees to leave the cities containing their employer.","[{'authorId': '47296720', 'name': 'Arjun Ramani'}, {'authorId': '70159523', 'name': 'N.

EF originate from neurocognitive research and are described as an accumulation of cognitive processes that serve the goal-oriented self-regulation (SR) of an individual. EC originates from temperament research and is defined as the efficiency of executive attention, including the ability to inhibit a dominant response, to activate a subdominant response, to proceed in a planned manner and to recognize conflicts or errors. The aim of this article was to examine the association between the constructs of EF and EC at the preschool-age. Eighty-eight children (49 female; M-age = 3.93 years, SD = .78) were tested with a computerized battery designed to assess EF at 3-6 years of age (EF Touch). Children's parents completed questionnaires assessing EF impairments (BRIEF-P) and EC (CBQ). Associations between the constructs and their conceptual overlap were analyzed using correlations and confirmatory factor analyses. We found significant correlations between EF and EC measures. A one-factor confirmatory model fitted the data very well and indicated that EF and EC are indeed overlapping and highly similar constructs. Therefore, our results show that measures of EC and EF have substantial overlap in preschoolers and suggest an integrated model of self-regulation. This article is protected by copyright.

Although cognitive processes are at the center in developing new ideas, they are rarely taken into account in research and development of design support methods and systems. It is conceivable that if one understands how cognitive processes are stimulated to generate design ideas, then more effective methods and tools can be developed to support conceptual design. In this article, a cognitive model of conceptual design is developed to capture the relationships among design entities, design operations, and cognitive processes. A protocol analysis is performed to evaluate the model, and a cognitive experiment carried out to study the creative patterns and stimulating relationships. The results show that designers exhibit patterns of creative design behavior, and that these patterns can be captured and instilled into the design process to promote creativity.","[{'authorId': '117216412', 'name': 'Yan Jin'}, {'authorId': '2098604298', 'name': 'Oren Benami'}]",66.0,,75.0,Creative patterns and stimulation in conceptual design,2010.0

They have been shown to be effective at increasing cognitive and affective outcomes and have achieved outcomes similar to those of human tutoring on restricted tasks. This is largely because of their physical presence, which traditional learning technologies lack. We review the potential of social robots in education, discuss the technical challenges, and consider how the robot’s appearance and behavior affect learning outcomes.","[{'authorId': '2301161', 'name': 'Tony Belpaeme'}, {'authorId': '143953789', 'name': 'James Kennedy'}, {'authorId': '2764097', 'name': 'Aditi Ramachandran'}, {'authorId': '1792053', 'name': 'B.

Preschoolers saw a toy that activated in the presence of certain objects. Children were shown evidence for the toy's activation rule in the form of patterns of probability: The toy was more likely to activate either when objects made contact with its surface (on condition) or when objects were several inches above its surface (over condition). In Experiment 1, 61 three-year-olds saw a deterministic activation rule. In Experiments 2 and 3, 48 four-year-olds saw an activation rule that was probabilistic. In Experiment 4, 30 four-year-olds saw a screening-off pattern of activation. In all 4 experiments, children used new evidence in the form of patterns of probability to make accurate causal inferences, even in the face of conflicting prior beliefs about spatial contiguity. However, children were more likely to make correct inferences when causes were spatially contiguous, particularly when faced with ambiguous evidence.","[{'authorId': '3693228', 'name': 'T.

These characterizations of emotion suggest a number of ways that current treatments may benefit from explicit incorporation of interventions targeting emotions, particularly for resistant forms of adult psychopathology.

9a834483135d9f2cdda47804045a46fab5e3e00c,"Background In the last decades, the relationship between social networking sites (SNSs) and older people’s loneliness is gaining specific relevance. Studies in this field are often based on qualitative methods to study in-depth self-perceived issues, including loneliness and well-being, or quantitative surveys to report the links between information and communication technologies (ICTs) and older people’s well-being or loneliness. However, these nonexperimental methods are unable to deeply analyze the causal relationship. Moreover, the research on older people’s SNS use is still scant, especially regarding its impact on health and well-being. In recent years, the existing review studies have separately focused their attention on loneliness and social isolation of older people or on the use of ICTs and SNSs in elderly populations without addressing the relationship between the former and the latter. This thorough qualitative review provides an analysis of research performed using an experimental or quasi-experimental design that investigates the causal effect of ICT and SNS use on elderly people’s well-being related to loneliness. Objective The aims of this review are to contrast and compare research designs (sampling and recruitment, evaluation tools, interventions) and the findings of these studies and highlight their limitations. Methods Using an approach that integrates the methodological framework for scoping studies and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for systematic reviews, we identified 11 articles that met our inclusion criteria. A thematic and content analysis was performed based on the ex post categorization of the data on the selected studies, and the data were summarized in tables. Results The analysis of the selected articles showed that: (1) ICT use is positively but weakly related to the different measures of older people’s well-being and loneliness, (2) overall, the studies under review lack a sound experimental design, (3) the main limitations of these studies lie in the lack of rigor in the sampling method and in the recruitment strategy. Conclusions The analysis of the reviewed studies confirms the existence of a beneficial effect of ICT use on the well-being of older people in terms of reduced loneliness. However, the causal relationship is often found to be weak. This review highlights the need to study these issues further with adequate methodological rigor.","[{'authorId': '47771612', 'name': 'G.

A discussion of some of the issues with the underlying theory of ABA in its current application is conducted, especially with regard to “lower functioning” and nonverbal autistic individuals; namely, the curtailing of soothing “stimming” behaviors, operant conditioning, behaviorist principles that research has continued to prove it is not apt for usage with autistic individuals, as well as the unintended but damaging consequences, such as prompt dependency, psychological abuse and compliance that tend to pose high costs on former ABA students as they move into adulthood. Serious issues with the application of ABA to autistic students, specifically “lower functioning” and nonverbal ones, are discussed, especially with regard to lack of current and longitudinal scientific testing and research with respect to these individuals. These effects and the trauma that occurs resultantly are categorized as abuse. Finally, drivers of the expanded usage of ABA within the autistic community despite a lack of efficacy are also discussed, such as a potential current market size as large as $17 billion annually and the deficiency of variety in techniques used by the psychologists and behavior technicians who utilize ABA with ASD students, as well as a lack of introspection about the true effectiveness of the technique amongst the whole population on the part of these professionals.","[{'authorId': '1422853707', 'name': 'A.

Besides activity recognition, the information collected from smart homes has great potential for other application domains like lifestyle analysis, security and surveillance, and interaction monitoring. Therefore, discovery of users common behaviors and prediction of future actions from past behaviors become an important step towards allowing an environment to provide personalized service. In this paper, we develop a unified framework for activity recognition-based behavior analysis and action prediction. For this purpose, first we propose kernel fusion method for accurate activity recognition and then identify the significant sequential behaviors of inhabitants from recognized activities of their daily routines. Moreover, behaviors patterns are further utilized to predict the future actions from past activities. To evaluate the proposed framework, we performed experiments on two real datasets. The results show a remarkable improvement of 13.82% in the accuracy on average of recognized activities along with the extraction of significant behavioral patterns and precise activity predictions with 6.76% increase in F-measure.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to verify whether a videomodeling intervention is effective for the acquisition of social and emotional behaviour and skills of children with ASD using tablet PC. METHODS: One 6-year-old child with ASD, who does not use verbal communication, was involved in a multiple baseline across behaviours design: the independent variable was the videomodeling intervention, instead the dependent variable was the participant behaviour. Intervention was preceded by a pre-session of Functional Communication training. An intersubject analysis was used to evaluate participant percentage of response through the sessions. RESULTS: The participant showed a marked improvement in his emotional skills. The intersubjective analysis carried out shows the sharp increase in response in many target behaviours from the baseline to the intervention phase. A limitation of the study was the lack of time: there were only two inversion sessions, no follow-up evaluation, no generalization and no double-blind study.

These conditions are allocated within a “spectrum” of phenotypic variability. Virtual reality (VR) is a useful tool for healthcare intervention and particularly safely advancing social abilities in children with ASD. Methods: In our study two types of intervention for improving social skills were compared: (i) emotional training obtained by the use of virtual reality (Gr1), (ii) traditional emotional training performed individually with a therapist (Gr2). We aimed to identify the intervention with the shortest acquisition time for the proposed social tasks. Results: Our findings show that both types of intervention had the same acquisition time for the recognition of primary emotions. However, for the use of primary and secondary emotions, the group using VR showed shorter acquisition times. Conclusions: These findings together with previous preliminary datasuggest that VR can be a promising, dynamic and effective practice for the support of basic and complex social skills of these individuals.","[{'authorId': '6387371', 'name': 'A.

a389767a2901d51bd8450f9930b398b6f61cab05,"Several studies have found a delay in the development of facial emotion recognition and expression in children with an autism spectrum condition (ASC). Several interventions have been designed to help children to fill this gap. Most of them adopt technological devices (i.e., robots, computers, and avatars) as social mediators and reported evidence of improvement. Few interventions have aimed at promoting emotion recognition and expression abilities and, among these, most have focused on emotion recognition. Moreover, a crucial point is the generalization of the ability acquired during treatment to naturalistic interactions. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of two technological-based interventions focused on the expression of basic emotions comparing a robot-based type of training with a “hybrid” computer-based one. Furthermore, we explored the engagement of the hybrid technological device introduced in the study as an intermediate step to facilitate the generalization of the acquired competencies in naturalistic settings. A two-group pre-post-test design was applied to a sample of 12 children (M = 9.33; ds = 2.19) with autism. The children were included in one of the two groups: group 1 received a robot-based type of training (n = 6); and group 2 received a computer-based type of training (n = 6). Pre- and post-intervention evaluations (i.e., time) of facial expression and production of four basic emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, and anger) were performed. Non-parametric ANOVAs found significant time effects between pre- and post-interventions on the ability to recognize sadness [t(1) = 7.35, p = 0.006; pre: M (ds) = 4.58 (0.51); post: M (ds) = 5], and to express happiness [t(1) = 5.72, p = 0.016; pre: M (ds) = 3.25 (1.81); post: M (ds) = 4.25 (1.76)], and sadness [t(1) = 10.89, p < 0; pre: M (ds) = 1.5 (1.32); post: M (ds) = 3.42 (1.78)]. The group*time interactions were significant for fear [t(1) = 1.019, p = 0.03] and anger expression [t(1) = 1.039, p = 0.03]. However, Mann–Whitney comparisons did not show significant differences between robot-based and computer-based training. Finally, no difference was found in the levels of engagement comparing the two groups in terms of the number of voice prompts given during interventions. Albeit the results are preliminary and should be interpreted with caution, this study suggests that two types of technology-based training, one mediated via a humanoid robot and the other via a pre-settled video of a peer, perform similarly in promoting facial recognition and expression of basic emotions in children with an ASC. The findings represent the first step to generalize the abilities acquired in a laboratory-trained situation to naturalistic interactions.","[{'authorId': '51967089', 'name': 'F.

It has been used to target a variety of behaviors across many areas of functioning including language, social behavior, play, academics and adaptive skills. The methodology appears particularly efficacious for children with autism. In this review of research applications of video modeling, we explore several plausible explanations that contribute to the unique benefits of television/video methodology. We discuss the specific characteristics of autism that may provide a rationale for using visually cued instruction that restricts the field of focus while not imposing too much demand on social attention or interaction. The unique aspects of video presentation are presented within a social learning context (Bandura, 1977, 1986). We also discuss additional explanations pertaining to the features video offers, such a restricted field of focus, repetitive presentation of models and situations, and a context that is typically associated with recreation and is thus viewed with greater receptivity and motivation.","[{'authorId': '3723578', 'name': 'B.

Moreover, many IoT devices may be deployed in the open and in public places, making them vulnerable to physical and cloning attacks. These characteristics dictate that any security protocol designed for IoT devices should not only be efficient but should also provide security even if an IoT device is captured by an adversary. To solve this issue, we present mutual authentication protocols for IoT devices that are not only efficient but also secure against physical and cloning attacks. To provide security to physically unprotected devices, the proposed protocols use physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and avoid storing sensitive information on the device.

b0f94c3cd564840471487fe2fcfa72ad350997ca,"Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is a challenging task because many factors of variation such as pose, illumination, and identity-specific attributes are entangled with the expression information in an expressive face image. Recent works show that the performance of a FER algorithm can be improved by disentangling the expression information from identity features. In this paper, we present Transfer-based Expression Recognition Generative Adversarial Network (TER-G AN) that combines the effectiveness of a novel feature disentanglement technique with the concept of identity-invariant expression representation learning for FER. More specifically, TER-GAN learns a disentangled expression representation by extracting expression features from one image and transferring the expression information to the identity of another image. To improve the feature disentanglement process and to learn an identity-invariant expression representation, we introduce a novel expression consistency loss and an identity consistency loss that exploit expression and identity information from both real and synthetic images. We evaluated the performance of our proposed facial expression recognition technique by employing four public facial expression databases, CK+, Oulu-CASIA, MMI, BU-3DFE. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique.","[{'authorId': '2065737826', 'name': 'Kamran Ali'}, {'authorId': '2056019735', 'name': 'Charles E.

b161742e7419fdbf68a2861500dec70bb3440578,"Since modern ambient assisted living solutions integrate a multitude of assisted-living functionalities, out of which some are safety critical, it is desirable that these systems are analyzed at their design stage to detect possible errors. To achieve this, one needs suitable architectures that support the seamless design of the integrated assisted-living functions, as well as capabilities for the formal modeling and analysis of the architecture. In this paper, we attempt to address this need, by proposing a generic integrated ambient assisted living system architecture, consisting of sensors, data collection, local and cloud processing schemes, and an intelligent decision support system, which can be easily extended to suit specific architecture categories. Our solution is customizable, therefore, we show three instantiations of the generic model, as simple, intermediate, and complex configurations, respectively, and show how to analyze the first and third categories by model checking. Our approach starts by specifying the architecture, using an architecture description language, in our case, the Architecture Analysis and Design Language, which can also account for the probabilistic behavior of such systems, and captures the possibility of component failure. To enable formal analysis, we describe the semantics of the simple and complex architectures within the framework of timed automata. We show that the simple architecture is amenable to exhaustive model checking by employing the UPPAAL tool, whereas for the complex architecture we resort to statistical model checking for scalability reasons. In this case, we apply the statistical extension of UPPAAL, namely UPPAAL SMC. Our work paves the way for the development of formally assured future ambient assisted living solutions.","[{'authorId': '8200981', 'name': 'Ashalatha Kunnappilly'}, {'authorId': '1923991', 'name': 'R.

Nevertheless, the adoption of such technology in real home environments is still far to be reached since it presents several challenges mainly related to its acceptance in the everyday life. In this domain, a high degree of personalization is required usually obtained by a customization of a robotic system with respect to specific assistive tasks. On the contrary, socially assistive robots are usually general-purpose platforms requiring a considerable effort for customization. In this work, to limit static and costly customization of robotic systems, a service-oriented approach is adopted to represent and manage assistive tasks to be performed by a social robotic system, allowing to decouple a given functionality from its concrete implementation that can be provided by different devices and with different execution modalities. The service-oriented approach for robotics applications, known as Robot-as-a-Service, is becoming attractive for decoupling the robot hardware from the functionalities it provides.","[{'authorId': '1954534', 'name': 'C.

Reliable emotion based classification systems can go a long way in helping us parse their meaning. However, research in the field of emotion-based music classification has not yielded optimal results. In this paper, we present an affective cross-platform music player, EMP, which recommends music based on the real-time mood of the user. EMP provides smart mood based music recommendation by incorporating the capabilities of emotion context reasoning within our adaptive music recommendation system. Our music player contains three modules: Emotion Module, Music Classification Module and Recommendation Module. The Emotion Module takes an image of the user's face as an input and makes use of deep learning algorithms to identify their mood with an accuracy of 90.23%. The Music Classification Module makes use of audio features to achieve a remarkable result of 97.69% while classifying songs into 4 different mood classes. The Recommendation Module suggests songs to the user by mapping their emotions to the mood type of the song, taking into consideration the preferences of the user.","[{'authorId': '2096530032', 'name': 'Shlok Gilda'}, {'authorId': '35463223', 'name': 'Husain Zafar'}, {'authorId': '49153611', 'name': 'Chintan Soni'}, {'authorId': '35511736', 'name': 'Kshitija Waghurdekar'}]",58.0,,19.0,Smart music player integrating facial emotion recognition and music mood recommendation,2017.0

b390860e7b9dbccc0dca1f57bf9bf9b8b7866cc0,"This article explores the influence of the pension system on corporate governance, which has so far received little attention in the corporate law literature. While the shareholder-centric view of corporate governance is strong today, this is a relatively recent development. “Managerial capitalism” began to give way to shareholder capitalism over the past three decades. I argue that changes in the pension system, specifically the shift from defined-benefit plans to defined-contribution plans that began in the 1970s, have been a major force pushing the corporate governance system toward shareholder primacy. While in traditional pension plans, workers depended primarily on their employer’s ability to fund pensions, in today’s system retirement benefits strongly depend on capital markets. Shareholder wealth thus became more important for larger segments of society, and pro-shareholder policies became more important relative to pro-labor policies strengthening employees’ position vis-a-vis their employer. Consequently, shareholder primacy became the dominant factor in corporate governance debates. Managers today claim to focus on this objective and are less well positioned to take the interests of their firm’s employees or other groups into account. The political economy of corporate governance underwent a seismic shift. While it is not clear whether shareholders truly benefit from most reforms, these have been largely supported by the center-left given their apparent beneficial effects for shareholders and consequently the middle class. For the same reason, unions have been among the most eager proponents of shareholder activism.","[{'authorId': '73410721', 'name': 'Martin Gelter'}]",25.0,,125.0,The Pension System and the Rise of Shareholder Primacy,2012.0

As increasing anecdotal evidence suggests, robots may offer many unique opportunities for helping individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Individuals with ASD often achieve a higher degree of task engagement through the interaction with robots than through interactions with human trainees. The type and form of robots to be used for individuals with ASD have been meticulously considered. Simple robots and animal robots are acceptable because of their simplicity and the ease of interesting and engaging interactions. Android robots have the benefit of the potential of generalization into daily life to some extent. Considering the affinity between robots and users is important to draw out the potential capabilities of robotic intervention to the fullest extent. In the robotic condition, factors such as the appearance, biological motion, clothes, hairstyle, and disposition are important. Many factors of a user, such as age, sex, and IQ, may also affect the affinity of individuals with ASD toward a robot. The potential end‐users of this technology may be unaware or unconvinced of the potential roles of robots in ASD interventions. If trainers have extensive experience in using robots, they can identify many potential roles of robots based on their experience. To date, only a few studies have been conducted in the field of robotics for providing assistance to individuals with ASD, and future studies are needed to realize an optimal robot for this purpose.","[{'authorId': '6977034', 'name': 'Hirokazu Kumazaki'}, {'authorId': '2052755713', 'name': 'T.

Music is a vital mood controller and helps in improving the mood and state of the person which in turn will act as a catalyst to increase productivity. Continuous music play requires creating and managing personalized song playlist which is a time consuming task. It would be very helpful if the music player itself selects a song according to the current mood of the user. The mood of the user can be detected by a facial expression of the person. A facial expression detection system should address three major problems: detection of face from an image, facial feature extraction and facial expression classification[1].The first stage is of face detection from an image for which various techniques used are model based face tracking which includes real-time face detection using edge orientation matching [2], Robust face detection using Hausdorff distance [3], weak classifier cascade which includes Viola and Jones algorithm [4], and Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptors. The next stage is to extract features from detected face. Two major approaches for feature extraction which use Gabor filters [Dennis Gabor] and Principle Component Analysis [Jolliffe]. The final stage is of image classification for mood detection, where various classifiers like BrownBoost [Freund, 2001], AdaBoost [Freund and Schapire, 1995] and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are available. The proposed system will use classic Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) along with facial landmark detection technique; these detected features then passed through SVM classifier to predict the mood of the user. This predicted mood will stimulate the creation of playlist.

In GCNs, graph topology dominates feature aggregation and therefore is the key to extracting representative features. In this work, we propose a novel Channel-wise Topology Refinement Graph Convolution (CTR-GC) to dynamically learn different topologies and effectively aggregate joint features in different channels for skeleton-based action recognition. The proposed CTR-GC models channel-wise topologies through learning a shared topology as a generic prior for all channels and refining it with channel-specific correlations for each channel. Our refinement method introduces few extra parameters and significantly reduces the difficulty of modeling channel-wise topologies. Furthermore, via reformulating graph convolutions into a unified form, we find that CTR-GC relaxes strict constraints of graph convolutions, leading to stronger representation capability. Combining CTR-GC with temporal modeling modules, we develop a powerful graph convolutional network named CTR-GCN which notably outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets.1","[{'authorId': '2137389378', 'name': 'Yuxin Chen'}, {'authorId': '2144370824', 'name': 'Ziqi Zhang'}, {'authorId': '50199457', 'name': 'Chunfen Yuan'}, {'authorId': '2152691925', 'name': 'Bing Li'}, {'authorId': '2115656688', 'name': 'Ying Deng'}, {'authorId': '40506509', 'name': 'Weiming Hu'}]",209.0,,36.0,Channel-wise Topology Refinement Graph Convolution for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition,2021.0

Thus, the robots were exploited for ASD children in different aspects namely; modelling, teaching, and skills practicing; testing, highlighting and evaluating; providing feedback or encouragement; join Attention; eliciting social behaviours; emotion recognition and expression; imitation; vocalization; turn-taking; and diagnostic. The related literature published recently in journals and conferences is taken into account. In this paper, we review the use of robots that help in the therapy of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The articles on using robots for autistic children rehabilitation and education which reported results of experiments on a number of participants were implicated. After looking in digital libraries under this criteria, and excluding non-related, and duplicated studies, 39 studies have been found. The findings were focused mainly on the social communication skills of autistic children and how the extent of the robots mitigate their stereotyped behaviours. Deeper research is required in this area to cover all applications of robotic on autistic children in order to design feasible and low-cost robots that ensure provide high validity.","[{'authorId': '145384587', 'name': 'M.

The current study, conducted in Flanders, aims to get a clearer picture of ICT use in Flemish preschools. For this purpose, a questionnaire was composed consisting of newly developed and existing scales. Based on the answers of 232 preschool teachers, two types of ICT use are distinguished in early childhood education, ‘ICT use supporting basic ICT skills and attitudes’, and ‘ICT use supporting contents and individual learning needs’. ‘ICT use supporting basic ICT skills and attitudes’ occurs more frequently and is related to the grade of the preschoolers, teachers’ self-perceived ICT competences and the number of years of experience with ICT at school. ‘ICT use supporting contents and individual learning needs’ is strongly related to the grade of the preschoolers, teachers’ self-perceived ICT competences, ICT professional development and teachers’ attitudes towards the possibilities of ICT for teachers in early childhood education. This indicates that professional development is a crucial factor in stimulating ICT use that transcends teaching basic ICT skills and attitudes.","[{'authorId': '2099890926', 'name': 'Stephanie Kerckaert'}, {'authorId': '39877741', 'name': 'R.

IoT systems inherently present different fail-safe capabilities than traditional computing environments while their threat landscapes constantly evolve. Further, IoT devices have limited collective security measures in place. Therefore, there is a need for different approaches in threat assessments to incorporate the interdependencies between different IoT devices. In this paper, we run through the design cycle to provide a security-focused approach to the design of IoT systems using a use case, namely, an intelligent solar-panel project called Daedalus. We utilise STRIDE/DREAD approaches to identify vulnerabilities using a thin secure element that is an embedded, tamper proof microprocessor chip that allows the storage and processing of sensitive data. It benefits from low power demand and small footprint as a crypto processor as well as is compatible with IoT requirements. Subsequently, a key agreement based on an asymmetric cryptographic scheme, namely B-SPEKE was used to validate and authenticate the source. We find that end-to-end and independent stand-alone procedures used for validation and encryption of the source data originating from the solar panel are cost-effective in that the validation is carried out once and not several times in the chain as is often the case. The threat model proved useful not so much as a panacea for all threats but provided the framework for the consideration of known threats, and therefore appropriate mitigation plans to be deployed.","[{'authorId': '35670845', 'name': 'S.

However, the impact of new technologies and media on well-being and positive functioning is still somewhat controversial. In this paper, we contend that the quality of experience should become the guiding principle in the design and development of new technologies, as well as a primary metric for the evaluation of their applications. The emerging discipline of Positive Psychology provides a useful framework to address this challenge. Positive Psychology is the scientific study of optimal human functioning and flourishing. Instead of drawing on a ""disease model"" of human behavior, it focuses on factors that enable individuals and communities to thrive and build the best in life. In this paper, we propose the ""Positive Technology"" approach--the scientific and applied approach to the use of technology for improving the quality of our personal experience through its structuring, augmentation, and/or replacement--as a way of framing a suitable object of study in the field of cyberpsychology and human-computer interaction. Specifically, we suggest that it is possible to use technology to influence three specific features of our experience--affective quality, engagement/actualization, and connectedness--that serve to promote adaptive behaviors and positive functioning. In this framework, positive technologies are classified according to their effects on a specific feature of personal experience.

However, whether this could be demonstrated using more realistic facial emotion recognition stimuli and applied to autistic females was unclear. In all, 83 females diagnosed with autism spectrum condition completed online self-report measures of autism spectrum condition severity and alexithymia, and afacial emotion recognition deficit that assessed their ability to identify multimodal displays of complex emotions. Higher levels of alexithymia, but not autism spectrum condition severity, were associated with less accurate facial emotion recognition. Difficulty identifying one’s own feelings and externally oriented thinking were the components of alexithymia that were specifically related to facial emotion recognition accuracy. However, alexithymia (and autism spectrum condition severity) was not associated with speed of emotion processing. The findings are primarily discussed with the theoretical view that perceiving and experiencing emotions share the same neural networks, thus being able to recognise one’s own emotions may facilitate the ability to recognise others’. This study is in line with previous similar research on autistic males and suggests impairments in facial emotion recognition in autistic females should be attributed to co-occurring alexithymia. Lay abstract Research with autistic males has indicated that difficulties in recognising facial expressions of emotion, commonly associated with autism spectrum conditions, may instead be due to co-occurring alexithymia (a condition involving lack of emotional awareness, difficulty describing feelings and difficulty distinguishing feelings from physical bodily sensations) and not to do with autism. We wanted to explore if this would be true for autistic females, as well as to use more realistic stimuli for emotional expression. In all, 83 females diagnosed with autism spectrum condition completed self-report measures of autism spectrum condition traits and alexithymia and completed a visual test that assessed their ability to identify multimodal displays of complex emotions.

Post encryption, a lightweight hash function SPONGENT has been used to ensure message authentication and data integrity. Then the encrypted message is published along with its hashed output to the concerned subscribers.

Social-scientific theories suggest competing models of human proxemic behavior, but all conclude that individuals' proxemic behavior is shaped by the proxemic behavior of others and the individual's psychological closeness to them. The present study explores whether these models can also explain how people physically and psychologically distance themselves from robots and suggest guidelines for future design of proxemic behaviors for robots. In a controlled laboratory experiment, participants interacted with Wakamaru to perform two tasks that examined physical and psychological distancing of the participants. We manipulated the likeability (likeable/dislikeable) and gaze behavior (mutual gaze/averted gaze) of the robot. Our results on physical distancing showed that participants who disliked the robot compensated for the increase in the robot's gaze by maintaining a greater physical distance from the robot, while participants who liked the robot did not differ in their distancing from the robot across gaze conditions. The results on psychological distancing suggest that those who disliked the robot also disclosed less to the robot.

These deficits mainly affect the performance of some of their daily activities. For that reason, stroke patients need long-term processes for their cognitive rehabilitation. Considering that classical techniques are focused on acting as guides and are dependent on help from therapists, significant efforts are being made to improve current methodologies and to use eHealth and Web-based architectures to implement information and communication technology (ICT) systems that achieve reliable, personalized, and home-based platforms to increase efficiency and level of attractiveness for patients and carers. Objective The goal of this work was to provide an overview of the practices implemented for the assessment of stroke patients and cognitive rehabilitation. This study puts together traditional methods and the most recent personalized platforms based on ICT technologies and Internet of Things. Methods A literature review has been distributed to a multidisciplinary team of researchers from engineering, psychology, and sport science fields. The systematic review has been focused on published scientific research, other European projects, and the most current innovative large-scale initiatives in the area. A total of 3469 results were retrieved from Web of Science, 284 studies from Journal of Medical Internet Research, and 15 European research projects from Community Research and Development Information Service from the last 15 years were reviewed for classification and selection regarding their relevance. Results A total of 7 relevant studies on the screening of stroke patients have been presented with 6 additional methods for the analysis of kinematics and 9 studies on the execution of goal-oriented activities. Meanwhile, the classical methods to provide cognitive rehabilitation have been classified in the 5 main techniques implemented. Finally, the review has been finalized with the selection of 8 different ICT–based approaches found in scientific-technical studies, 9 European projects funded by the European Commission that offer eHealth architectures, and other large-scale activities such as smart houses and the initiative City4Age. Conclusions Stroke is one of the main causes that most negatively affect countries in the socioeconomic aspect. The design of new ICT-based systems should provide 4 main features for an efficient and personalized cognitive rehabilitation: support in the execution of complex daily tasks, automatic error detection, home-based performance, and accessibility. Only 33% of the European projects presented fulfilled those requirements at the same time. For this reason, current and future large-scale initiatives focused on eHealth and smart environments should try to solve this situation by providing more complete and sophisticated platforms.","[{'authorId': '3020930', 'name': 'José M.

The concentration is on the UK, but other countries are also discussed for comparative purposes. The Job Retention Scheme is a successful innovation to keep temporarily stopped workers attached to their employers. However, since economic recovery will be slow, it is not sustainable in its current form. A sustained rise in unemployment is inevitable and alternative policies to mitigate this and the dangers of scarring are discussed. The structure of output will change, as therefore will the composition of jobs. A comprehensive active manpower policy will be needed to efficiently match job seekers to available jobs. The young are likely to suffer disproportionately from the recession and this makes it essential to introduce radical policies to boost work-based training and to enhance the contribution made by further and higher education institutions.","[{'authorId': '71188301', 'name': 'Ken Mayhew'}, {'authorId': '35488355', 'name': 'P.

c7243a36f7f2936260072124b35c6178afb70f15,"It is widely recognized that robot-based interventions for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) hold promise, but the question remains as to whether social humanoid robots could facilitate joint attention performance in children with ASD. In this study, responsive joint attention was measured under two conditions in which different agents, a human and a robot, initiated joint attention via video. The participants were 15 children with ASD (mean age: 4.96 ± 1.10 years) and 15 typically developing (TD) children (mean age: 4.53 ± 0.90 years). In addition to analyses of fixation time and gaze transitions, a longest common subsequence approach (LCS) was employed to compare participants’ eye movements to a predefined logical reference sequence. The fixation of TD toward agent’s face was earlier and longer than children with ASD. Moreover, TD showed a greater number of gaze transitions between agent’s face and target, and higher LCS scores than children with ASD. Both groups showed more interests in the robot’s face, but the robot induced a lower proportion of fixation time on the target. Meanwhile participants showed similar gaze transitions and LCS results in both conditions, suggesting that they could follow the logic of the joint attention task induced by the robot as well as human. We have discussed the implications for the effects and applications of social humanoid robots in joint attention interventions.","[{'authorId': '2075436341', 'name': 'Wei Cao'}, {'authorId': '40896782', 'name': 'Wenxu Song'}, {'authorId': '2188213', 'name': 'Xinge Li'}, {'authorId': '40895011', 'name': 'Sixiao Zheng'}, {'authorId': '2116290409', 'name': 'Ge Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2134150879', 'name': 'Yanting Wu'}, {'authorId': '1491630662', 'name': 'Sailing He'}, {'authorId': '1699577', 'name': 'Huilin Zhu'}, {'authorId': '2108143099', 'name': 'Jiajia Chen'}]",19.0,,28.0,Interaction With Social Robots: Improving Gaze Toward Face but Not Necessarily Joint Attention in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder,2019.0

ca29b36313f9c566023470f1c141083f2a28a5ad,"According to the Cognitive Complexity and Control (CCC) theory, the development of executive function can be understood in terms of age-related increases in the maximum complexity of the rules children can formulate and use when solving problems. This Monograph describes four studies (9 experiments) designed to test hypotheses derived from the CCC theory and from alternative theoretical perspectives on the development of executive function (memory accounts, inhibition accounts, and redescription accounts). Each study employed a version of the Dimensional Change Card Sort (DCCS), in which children are required first to sort cards by one pair of rules (e.g., color rules: ""If red then here, if blue then there""), and then sort the same cards by another, incompatible pair of rules (e.g., shape rules). Study 1 found that although most 3- to 4-year-olds failed the standard version of this task (i.e., they perseverated on the preswitch rules during the postswitch phase), they usually performed well when they were required to use four rules (including bidimensional rules) and those rules were not in conflict (i.e., they did not require children to respond in two different ways to the same test card). These findings indicate that children's perseveration cannot be attributed in a straightforward fashion to limitations in children's memory capacity. Study 2 examined the circumstances in which children can use conflicting rules. Three experiments demonstrated effects of rule dimensionality (uni- vs. bidimensional rules) but no effects of stimulus characteristics (1 vs. 2 test cards; spatially integrated vs. separated stimuli). Taken together, these studies suggest that conflict among rules is a key determinant of difficulty, but that conflict interacts with dimensionality. Study 3 examined what types of conflict pose problems for 3- to 4-year-olds by comparing performance on standard, Partial Change, and Total Change versions of the DCCS. Results revealed effects of conflict at the level of specific rules (e.g., ""If red, then there""), rather than specific stimulus configurations or dimensions per se, indicating that activation of the preswitch rules persists into the postswitch phase. Study 4 examined whether negative priming also contributes to difficulty on the DCCS. Two experiments suggested that the active selection of preswitch rules against a competing alternative results in the lasting suppression of the alternative. Taken together, the results of these studies provide the basis for a revision of the CCC theory (CCC-r) that specifies more clearly the circumstances in which children will have difficulty using rules at various levels of complexity, provides a more detailed account of how to determine the complexity of rules required in a task, takes account of both the activation and inhibition of rules as a function of experience, and highlights the importance of taking intentionality seriously in the study of executive function.","[{'authorId': '2491958', 'name': 'P.

We explore feasibility and acceptability of integrating SR technology into pediatric health care. BrightcoveDefaultPlayer10.1542/6138651198001PEDS-VA_2018-1511 Video Abstract BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Social robots (SRs) are increasingly present in medical and educational contexts, but their use in inpatient pediatric settings has not been demonstrated in studies. In this study, we aimed to (1) describe the introduction of SR technology into the pediatric inpatient setting through an innovative partnership among a pediatric teaching hospital, robotics development, and computational behavioral science laboratories and (2) present feasibility and acceptability data. METHODS: Fifty-four children ages 3 to 10 years were randomly exposed to 1 of 3 interventions: (1) interactive SR teddy bear; (2) tablet-based avatar version of the bear; or (3) plush teddy bear with human presence. We monitored intervention enrollment and completion patterns, obtained qualitative feedback on acceptability of SR use from child life–specialist stakeholders, and assessed children’s positive and negative affect, anxiety, and pain intensity pre- and postintervention. RESULTS: The intervention was well received and appeared feasible, with 93% of those enrolled completing the study (with 80% complete parent data). Children exposed to the SR reported more positive affect relative to those who received a plush animal. SR interactions were characterized by greater levels of joyfulness and agreeableness than comparison interventions. Child life specialist stakeholders reported numerous potential benefits of SR technology in the pediatric setting. CONCLUSIONS: The SR appears to be an engaging tool that may provide new ways to address the emotional needs of hospitalized children, potentially increasing access to emotionally targeted interventions. Rigorous development and validation of SR technology in pediatrics could ultimately lead to scalable and cost-effective tools to improve the patient care experience.","[{'authorId': '2394873', 'name': 'D.

Structured observations of a group of 38 adolescents with ASD drawn from 12 mainstream secondary schools were conducted over a two-day period and data compared with those of school, age, and gender matched comparison groups of 35 adolescents with dyslexia and 38 with no identified special educational needs (the ASD and dyslexia groups were also matched on SEN provision). Frequency and duration of peer interaction behaviours were coded. In terms of duration, multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) indicated that participants with ASD spent more time engaged in solitary behaviours, less time engaged in co-operative interaction with peers, and more time engaging in reactive aggression towards peers than either comparison group. In terms of frequency, similar patterns emerged, but additionally participants with ASD engaged in fewer instances of rough/vigorous play, and were subject to more instances of social initiation and instrumental verbal aggression by peers than either comparison group. The findings of the current study support the authors’ theoretical model of peer group interaction processes for individuals with ASD, and have implications for both social skills training and the development of peer awareness and sensitivity.

To understand this dichotomy, this paper reviews current challenges surrounding user engagement with mental health smartphone apps. While smartphone engagement metrics and reporting remains heterogeneous in the literature, focusing on themes offers a framework to identify underlying trends. These themes suggest that apps are not designed with service users in mind, do not solve problems users care most about, do not respect privacy, are not seen as trustworthy and are unhelpful in emergencies.

d089b83003dc01509f7f2ed79074c40886feceb3,"We designed a robot system that assisted in behavioral intervention programs of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The eight‐session intervention program was based on the discrete trial teaching protocol and focused on two basic social skills: eye contact and facial emotion recognition. The robotic interactions occurred in four modules: training element query, recognition of human activity, coping‐mode selection, and follow‐up action. Children with ASD who were between 4 and 7 years old and who had verbal IQ ≥ 60 were recruited and randomly assigned to the treatment group (TG, n = 8, 5.75 ± 0.89 years) or control group (CG, n = 7; 6.32 ± 1.23 years). The therapeutic robot facilitated the treatment intervention in the TG, and the human assistant facilitated the treatment intervention in the CG. The intervention procedures were identical in both groups. The primary outcome measures included parent‐completed questionnaires, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), and frequency of eye contact, which was measured with the partial interval recording method. After completing treatment, the eye contact percentages were significantly increased in both groups. For facial emotion recognition, the percentages of correct answers were increased in similar patterns in both groups compared to baseline (P > 0.05), with no difference between the TG and CG (P > 0.05). The subjects’ ability to play, general behavioral and emotional symptoms were significantly diminished after treatment (p < 0.05). These results showed that the robot‐facilitated and human‐facilitated behavioral interventions had similar positive effects on eye contact and facial emotion recognition, which suggested that robots are useful mediators of social skills training for children with ASD.

As the devices in the IoT network are constrained in terms of computation, memory and power, implementing traditional security algorithms is inconceivable. Sensitive data moving across the IoT networks such as credit card information, patient body vital parameters etc. need to be safeguarded to avoid hazardous circumstances when exploited to hackers. In this paper, we propose a patient monitoring system that uses a secured Internet of Things architecture to provide security for the data transmitted from the device. We further elaborate on the performance of different encryption algorithms and their applicability to different scenarios. The model presented in this paper will serve as a reference for the novice applications that are built around the cheap and constrained devices and demand security.","[{'authorId': '46188165', 'name': 'Krishna Prasad Satamraju'}, {'authorId': '3109298', 'name': 'B.

d133286462e5adcb1faf165d227790956a2603c9,"Most expert projections indicate that in 2030, there will be over one billion people aged 60 or over. The vast majority of them prefer to spend their last years at home, and almost a third of them live alone. This creates a growing need for technology-based solutions capable of helping older people to live independently in their places. Despite the wealth of solutions proposed for this general problem, there are very few support systems that can be reproduced on a larger scale. In this study, we propose a method to monitor the activity of the elderly living alone and detect deviations from the previous activity patterns based on the idea that the residential living environment can be modeled as a collection of behaviorally significant places located arbitrarily in a generic space. Then we use virtual pheromones—a concept defined in our previous work—to create images of the pheromone distribution maps, which describe the spatiotemporal evolution of the interactions between the user and the environment. We propose a method to detect deviations from the activity routines based on a simple statistical analysis of the resulting images. By applying this method on two public activity recognition datasets, we found that the system is capable of detecting both singular deviations and slow-deviating trends from the previous activity routine of the monitored persons.","[{'authorId': '31436616', 'name': 'I.

d20fd51374bc17aca5994f9e8c1e096eba48c6be,"In this commentary, we describe how language used to communicate about autism within much of autism research can reflect and perpetuate ableist ideologies (i.e., beliefs and practices that discriminate against people with disabilities), whether or not researchers intend to have such effects. Drawing largely from autistic scholarship on this subject, along with research and theory from disability studies and discourse analysis, we define ableism and its realization in linguistic practices, provide a historical overview of ableist language used to describe autism, and review calls from autistic researchers and laypeople to adopt alternative ways of speaking and writing. Finally, we provide several specific avenues to aid autism researchers in reflecting on and adjusting their language choices. Lay summary Why is this topic important? In the past, autism research has mostly been conducted by nonautistic people, and researchers have described autism as something bad that should be fixed. Describing autism in this way has negative effects on how society views and treats autistic people and may even negatively affect how autistic people view themselves. Despite recent positive changes in how researchers write and speak about autism, “ableist” language is still used. Ableist language refers to language that assumes disabled people are inferior to nondisabled people. What is the purpose of this article? We wrote this article to describe how ableism influences the way autism is often described in research. We also give autism researchers strategies for avoiding ableist language in their future work. What is the perspective of the authors? We believe that ableism is a “system of discrimination,” which means that it influences how people talk about and perceive autism whether or not they are aware of it, and regardless of whether or not they actually believe that autistic people are inferior to nonautistic people. We also believe that language choices are part of what perpetuates this system. Because of this, researchers need to take special care to determine whether their language choices reflect ableism and take steps to use language that is not ableist. What is already known about this topic? Autistic adults (including researchers and nonresearchers) have been writing and speaking about ableist language for several decades, but nonautistic autism researchers may not be aware of this work. We have compiled this material and summarized it for autism researchers. What do the authors recommend? We recommend that researchers understand what ableism is, reflect on the language they use in their written and spoken work, and use nonableist language alternatives to describe autism and autistic people. For example, many autistic people find terms such as “special interests” and “special needs” patronizing; these terms could be replaced with “focused interests” and descriptions of autistic people's specific needs. Medicalized/deficit language such as “at risk for autism” should be replaced by more neutral terms such as “increased likelihood of autism.” Finally, ways of speaking about autism that are not restricted to particular terms but still contribute to marginalization, such as discussion about the “economic burden of autism,” should be replaced with discourses that center the impacts of social arrangements on autistic people. How will these recommendations help autistic people now or in the future? Language is a powerful means for shaping how people view autism. If researchers take steps to avoid ableist language, researchers, service providers, and society at large may become more accepting and accommodating of autistic people.","[{'authorId': '1403169986', 'name': 'Kristen Bottema‐Beutel'}, {'authorId': '38961667', 'name': 'Steven K.

d2597fc897ea36740c899da73237e2b69ea71079,"Designing for reflection is becoming an increasingly important part of many HCI systems in a wide range of application domains. However, there is a gap in our understanding of how the process of reflection can be supported through technology. In fact, an implicit assumption in the majority of existing work is that, just by providing access to well-selected data, in-depth reflection can and will occur. To counter this view, we draw on Schön's notion of reflective practicum and apply it as a sensitising concept to identify the complex interplay of factors that support transformative reflection in the context of two social-emotional learning (SEL) studies. The results highlight the need to carefully scaffold the process of reflection, rather than simply assume that the capability to reflect is a broadly available trait to be 'triggered' through data. Building on this analysis, we develop a conceptual framework that extends the concept of the reflective practicum towards identifying appropriate roles of technology to support transformative reflection. While our case is within the context of SEL, we argue that a deeper understanding of these opportunities can also benefit designing for reflection in other areas.","[{'authorId': '2971246', 'name': 'P.

d30069f5f7979571814d308fe63ffb2bb7c52a3d,"Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have become more widely used in the past years to help people with autism spectrum conditions (ASC). Serious games embedded into computers or tablets, as well as social robots, are the most employed ICT-related tools that are appealing to and appropriate for autistic children. The goal of ICT applications is to enhance behavioral abnormalities associated with ASC while also creating an interactive link between one person and one computer. Comparatively, to human-based therapy, ICT tools aid to inspire autistic children by providing predictability and regularity of tasks. Regaining social skills is the primary behavioral goal for which ICT tools have been designed and implemented. In the past several years, many studies have been created to show how effective it is at improving targeted behaviors. However, only a small number of researchers have used an RCT approach to evaluate its effectiveness. In this systematic review, we only included RCT studies where ICT technologies were used to help children with ASC in improving their social skills. Only 14 RCT studies satisfied the criteria and 12 described significant improvements, showing how the use of technology in educational contexts produced better improvement in developing several social skill facets with respect to the traditional face-to-face approach. Some studies used interventions and outcome measures focused on the core ASC symptoms, but many others addressed neurocognitive functions directly, like social cognition or emotional regulation, while other more general functions such as language or adaptive behaviors. We propose a classification based on processes and outcome measures to foster future research in this specific area of research. The behavioral intervention mediated by technological tools such as computer-based, tablet, and social robotics, undoubtedly provides a comfortable environment that promotes constant learning for people with ASC. Evidence provided in this review highlights the translational potential of this field of study in primary care practice and educational settings.","[{'authorId': '35443362', 'name': 'I.

Despite its importance, societies not always are well equipped with contexts for creativity stimulation; as a consequence, a major decline in creative abilities occurs at the age of 7 years old. We investigated the effectiveness of using a robotic system named YOLO as an intervention tool to stimulate creativity in children. During the intervention, children used YOLO as a character for their stories and through the interaction with the robot, creative abilities were stimulated. Our study (n=62) included 3 experimental conditions: i) YOLO displayed behaviors based on creativity techniques; ii) YOLO displayed behaviors based on creativity techniques plus social behaviors; iii) YOLO was turned off, not displaying any behaviors. We measured children’s creative abilities at pre- and post-testing and their creative process through behavior analysis. Results showed that the interaction with YOLO contributed to higher creativity levels in children, specifically contributing to the generation of more original ideas during story creation. This study shows the potential of using social robots as tools to empower intrinsic human abilities, such as the ability to be creative.

d62348f444226d93d4dd672f8b3b9f88cc6ca86c,"Theory Young children have an understanding of basic science concepts such as stability, yet their theoretical assumptions are often not concerned with stability. The literature on theory theory and theory-evidence coordination suggests that children construct intuitive theories about their environment which can be adjusted in the face of counterevidence that cannot be assimilated into the prior theory. With increasing age, children acquire a Center theory when balancing objects and try to balance every object at their middle, succeeding with symmetrical objects. Later, they acquire the basic science concept of stability through learning that the weight distribution of an object is of importance. Thus, they acquire a Mass theory and succeed in balancing asymmetrical objects as well. Fluid and crystallized intelligence might contribute to children’s acquisition of Mass theory. Moreover, their Mass theory might be supported by implementing a playful intervention including (a) material scaffolds and (b) verbal scaffolds. Aims We investigated which theories children have about stability and whether these theories can be adjusted to Mass theory by implementing a playful intervention. Method A total of 183 5- to 6-year-old children took part in the study with a pre-post-follow-up intervention design. Children’s Mass theory was assessed with an interview in which children explained constructions’ stabilities. The children received a playful intervention with two differing degrees of scaffolding (material scaffolds or material + verbal scaffolds) or no scaffolding. Results At first few children used a Mass theory to explain their reasoning. However, after being confronted with counterevidence for the asymmetrical constructions, children changed their explanation and applied a Mass theory. More children in the play group with the highest degree of scaffolding, i.e., material + verbal scaffolds, acquired a Mass theory compared to the other groups. Fluid as well as crystallized intelligence contributed to children’s acquisition of a Mass theory. Discussion Counterevidence can support children in their acquisition of a Mass theory. A playful intervention with scaffolding supports children even more.","[{'authorId': '39169042', 'name': 'A.

The aim of this article is to carry out a systematic literature review of the studies on this topic that were published in the last 10 years. We tried to address the following questions: can social robots be a useful tool in autism therapy? We followed the PRISMA guidelines, and the protocol was registered within PROSPERO database (CRD42015016158). We found many positive implications in the use of social robots in therapy as for example: ASD subjects often performed better with a robot partner rather than a human partner; sometimes, ASD patients had, toward robots, behaviors that TD patients had toward human agents; ASDs had a lot of social behaviors toward robots; during robotic sessions, ASDs showed reduced repetitive and stereotyped behaviors and, social robots manage to improve spontaneous language during therapy sessions. Therefore, robots provide therapists and researchers a means to connect with autistic subjects in an easier way, but studies in this area are still insufficient. It is necessary to clarify whether sex, intelligence quotient, and age of participants affect the outcome of therapy and whether any beneficial effects only occur during the robotic session or if they are still observable outside the clinical/experimental context.

Karmiloff-Smith (1992) in her Representational Redescription (RR) model claims that representations of implicit procedures can be redescribed into further levels, E1, E2 and E3, which gradually afford increasing conscious and linguistic access. This study examines how 25 children's representations about balancing a beam on a fulcrum changed over time, as they attempted a set of tasks each day for five consecutive days. Children's behaviour was classified into seven levels, rather than the four identified by Karmiloff-Smith, and the path through these levels is traced as children progressed over the 5-day period. This provided one form of validation about the developmental sequence of the levels. Additional tasks assessed the flexibility of the children's representations, operationalized either as an ability to predict which beams would balance, or to identify which picture showed a beam that would balance on a fulcrum. The findings from these assessments shed light on the conscious accessibility and transportability of the children's knowledge, independent of their overt behaviour. The data also reveal a complexity in cognitive functioning which could not be identified from observations of performance alone. This research thus provides a theoretical endorsement and extension of Karmiloff-Smith's multi-representational framework of cognitive development and empirical support for a hypothesized path of development through the representational levels.","[{'authorId': '2968772', 'name': 'K.

Data consist of naturalistic texts from 31 preschool teacher students revealing their experiences in attempting to embed computers into practice. Results show ambivalence to computer use. Two lines of arguments emerged: one embracing the new technology, the other rejecting this new technology. The following arguments were made to justify ICT in preschool: the child as a citizen, the competent child and the active child.

The educational-therapeutic interventions were conducted in an eleven-session case study program on three high-functioning and one low-functioning children with autism taking into consideration the children’s, parents’, and therapists’ experience during the program. The results indicated that as a tool and facilitator, the NAO robot does have the ability to teach musical notes/rhythms to the participants with high-functioning autism. It was also observed that the severity of the participants’ autism as well as the stress of the parents decreased somewhat during these sessions. Furthermore, noticeable improvements were seen in social/cognitive skills of all four participants; as well as the positive effect of this program on fine motor imitation skills of two subjects after the interventions.

Human-animal interaction (HAI) is widely used as a method of reducing psychological distress. However, research findings in support of HAI have not kept pace with the widespread prevalence in practice.


OBJECTIVE
I review and synthesize the quantitative evidence for the influence of HAI on psychological distress and outline future directions for research.


RESULTS
The evidence suggests that HAI has a small-to-medium effect on distress but does not clarify whether animals account for the treatment effects. Research also has not determined whether positive effects observed in circumscribed HAI programs extend to companion animal ownership.


CONCLUSION
HAI research needs to address methodological limitations and expand the focus beyond treatment outcome studies. By increasing our understanding of the processes through which HAI reduces distress, the circumstances under which it is most effective at doing so, and the influence HAI has on the animals, we can enhance the impact of HAI.","[{'authorId': '8251390', 'name': 'M.

Robot-assisted Therapy (RAT) can improve the behavior of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in a spontaneous and entertaining way. There are no previous experiences of this type of inter vention in our country.


OBJECTIVE
To describe a clinical experience of using RAT and its impact on the behaviors of a group of children with ASD, in a therapeutic context.


PATIENTS AND METHOD
Quasi experimental clinical experience type study. 4 children with a clinical diagnosis of ASD were selected, supported by the ADOS-2 (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule); aged between 9 and 13 years, and normal IQ according to the WISC-III (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children). This study was approved by the Central Metropolitan Ethics Committee. Patients attended 10 structured robot-as sisted therapy sessions, working collaboratively in pairs. Workshop attendance and parent and child satisfaction were evaluated through surveys, the adaptive behavior with the Vineland scale, and so cial interaction with video coding guidelines.


RESULTS
Patients presented a very good adherence and satisfaction with the activity. There was an improvement in socialization behaviors and social age. Video-coding showed an increase in social interaction and improvement in the behavior of the pa tients after attending workshops.


CONCLUSIONS
We observed that the experience with RAT, adapted to the context of a Chilean public health center, was highly attractive and beneficial for patients with ASD, improving core symptoms such as difficulties in social interaction and behavioral problems.","[{'authorId': '2081550381', 'name': 'C.

However, more recent studies have shown that preschool children already have a basic ability to evaluate evidence and a basic understanding of experimentation. Data providing insights into when exactly in the preschool years significant gains in these abilities occur are scarce. Drawing on a sample of 138 preschool children, this longitudinal study therefore examined how children's ability to evaluate evidence and their understanding of experimentation develop between the ages of four and six. Findings showed that the ability to evaluate evidence was already well developed at age four and increased steadily and significantly over time as long as the pattern of covariation was perfect. In the case of imperfect covariation, the proportion of correct answers was low over the period of observation, but showed a significant increase between the ages of four and five. If the data did not allow relationship between variables to be inferred, the proportion of correct answers was low, with a significant increase between the ages of five and six. The children's understanding of experimentation increased significantly between the ages of five and six. The implications of these findings for age-appropriate science programs in preschool are discussed.","[{'authorId': '2101745772', 'name': 'Jeanette Piekny'}, {'authorId': '49826664', 'name': 'D.

Moreover, the robot can engage these children in ways that demonstrate essential aspects of human interaction, guiding them in therapeutic sessions to practice more complex forms of interaction found in social human-to-human interactions. We review published articles on robot-assisted autism therapy (RAAT) to understand the trends in research on this type of therapy for children with autism and to provide practitioners and researchers with insights and possible future directions in the field. Specifically, we analyze 38 articles, all of which are refereed journal articles, that were indexed on Web of Science from 2009 onward, and discuss the distribution of the articles by publication year, article type, database and journal, research field, robot type, participant age range, and target behaviors. Overall, the results show considerable growth in the number of journal publications on RAAT, reflecting increased interest in the use of robot technology in autism therapy as a salient and legitimate research area.

e67caeb39fe8e6456cf10296d7bac95ad737ab2a,"Background. The Representational Redescription model of cognitive development (Karmiloff-Smith, 1992) identified a level when a child's representation of a task may be incorrect but difficult to access or change. On the balance beam task children at this level have been found to hold a fixed belief that all objects must balance at their geometric centre, even those which have more weight at one end and actually balance off-centre. 
 
 
 
Aims. In this study we sought to determine whether children who hold this ‘centre theory’ about balance can alter their beliefs when exposed to an adult teaching them the correct solution. Since the RR model stresses the top-down, impenetrable nature of this type of representation our aim was to see whether particular interventions might bring about progress in these children. 
 
 
 
Sample. The participants were 42 children, from 4, 11 to 7,4 years, who demonstrated at pre-test that they held a centre theory by being unable to balance any beams which were unevenly weighted. 
 
 
 
Methods. The children were randomly assigned to one of three conditions where they either saw an adult modelling and explaining the correct solution, or an adult worked with them offering guided participation, or the child worked alone. 
 
 
 
Results. Progress was measured by improvement from pre-to post-test in ability to balance unevenly weighted beams. Children who had seen an adult modelling and explaining the task showed greater improvement than those who worked alone, although this difference was not significant at a delayed post-test one week later. 
 
 
 
Conclusion. Although many children with a fixed naive theory about balance were identified this study demonstrates that, with the right type of input, it is possible to facilitate progress.","[{'authorId': '2968772', 'name': 'K.

Consistent with previous findings on children in the preschool period and middle childhood, it was expected that an emotion coaching meta-emotion philosophy would be associated with fewer depressive symptoms, higher levels of adjustment and lower frequencies and less reciprocity of aversive and dysphoric affect during mother–child interaction. Maternal meta-emotion interviews, observations of mother–child interaction and assessments of adolescent adjustment were obtained. Results indicated that mothers of adolescents with high levels of depressive symptoms were less accepting and expressive of their own emotions than were mothers of adolescents with low levels of depressive symptoms. A mother's acceptance of her own emotion was associated with fewer depressive symptoms, higher self-esteem and fewer externalizing problems in young adolescents. A mother's emotion coaching was associated with lower frequency and less likelihood of the reciprocity of aversive and dysphoric affect during mother–child interaction. Discussion highlights the role of maternal meta-emotion philosophy in creating emotional closeness in families with high and low levels of depressive symptomatology.","[{'authorId': '4473402', 'name': 'L.

The aim of this article is to present an overview of robots that are currently used in therapy and educational for children with ASD and to indicate what objectives they address. Focus group sessions (N=9) with ASD professionals (N=53) from nine organisations were conducted which identified potential objectives for children with ASD. A systematic literature study delivered an overview of the state of the art of robots under study. Professionals reported to work on 74 ASD objectives in 9 different domains (based on the International Classification of Functioning - Child and Youth, ICF-CY). The robots (N=14) found in the literature addressed 24 of these objectives in 8 of the 9 domains, indicating the potential contribution of these robots to therapy and education of children with ASD. Domains that are targeted most often by robots currently are ‘social or interpersonal interactions and relations’, ‘play’ and ‘communication’. Results indicate that robot mediated interventions are considered to be a possible valuable tool in the education or therapy for children with autism. In order to unlock the potential of robots, it is advised that technical developers use knowledge from ASD practice so that meaningful applications can be developed.","[{'authorId': '2089865', 'name': 'C.

Assessment must differentiate anxiety disorders from developmentally appropriate fears as well as medical conditions and drugs that can mimic anxiety states. Aetiology of anxiety disorders in this group encompasses complex genetic and environmental influences. Additional insight into causation is provided by neuroimaging and research into temperament. Recommended interventions include both cognitive-behavioural therapy and pharmacology. Although childhood anxiety disorders generally remit, there remains an increased risk for anxiety and depressive disorders to emerge in adulthood, most likely through heterotypical continuity.","[{'authorId': '6034828', 'name': 'A.

Children gesture spontaneously on this task and here their hand gestures are considered in relation to the accompanying speech. By close examination of 21 children's single sessions, and the 163 iconic gestures they produced (a mean of 7.6 gestures per child), it was found that gestures are rarely produced without speech. However, one third of the gestures the children produced conveyed different information to that expressed in their spoken explanations. Furthermore, children were found to convey information uniquely in gesture by expressing ideas in the manual modality that did not appear in their spoken explanations. Finally, in many cases children expressed an idea in gesture before they talked about it.

Innovative technology, such as socially assistive robots, has shown to be a viable method for Autism therapy. This paper presents a novel robot-based music-therapy platform for modeling and improving the social responses and behaviors of children with ASD. Our autonomous social interactive system consists of three modules. Module one provides an autonomous initiative positioning system for the robot, NAO, to properly localize and play the instrument (Xylophone) using the robot’s arms. Module two allows NAO to play customized songs composed by individuals. Module three provides a real-life music therapy experience to the users. We adopted Short-time Fourier Transform and Levenshtein distance to fulfill the design requirements: 1) “music detection” and 2) “smart scoring and feedback”, which allows NAO to understand music and provide additional practice and oral feedback to the users as applicable. We designed and implemented six Human-Robot-Interaction (HRI) sessions including four intervention sessions. Nine children with ASD and seven Typically Developing participated in a total of fifty HRI experimental sessions. Using our platform, we collected and analyzed data on social behavioral changes and emotion recognition using Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signals. The results of our experiments demonstrate most of the participants were able to complete motor control tasks with 70% accuracy. Six out of the nine ASD participants showed stable turn-taking behavior when playing music. The results of automated emotion classification using Support Vector Machines illustrates that emotional arousal in the ASD group can be detected and well recognized via EDA bio-signals. In summary, the results of our data analyses, including emotion classification using EDA signals, indicate that the proposed robot-music based therapy platform is an attractive and promising assistive tool to facilitate the improvement of fine motor control and turn-taking skills in children with ASD.","[{'authorId': '3018638', 'name': 'Huanghao Feng'}, {'authorId': '145531712', 'name': 'M.

Self-explanations have been found to be effective in producing better understanding of science (Chi, de Leeuw, Chiu, & LaVancher, 1994), and explaining another person's reasoning can also bring about cognitive change (Siegler, 1995). This study deals with one domain of physics-balance-and investigates the effects of 2 interventions on children who had either a procedure for balancing but could not explain it or had a naive theory. We pretested 140 children, ages 5 to 9 years, to assess their ability on a balance beam task and their knowledge about the principles of balance. These children were classified according to levels of representation derived from Karmiloff-Smith's (1992) Representational Redescription model. In this sample, 104 children could not explain the principles of balance or possessed a naive theory that all things had to balance in the center. These children were allocated to 1 of 2 intervention conditions. Approximately half of the children watched the experimenter model the correct solution to the balance task; the rest observed the model and were also encouraged to produce verbal explanations of what they saw. At posttest, a significantly higher number of children from the latter condition had improved their understanding of balance. The positive effects of interpersonal explanation are discussed in relation to Karmiloff-Smith's model of children's development, and the implications for teaching are highlighted.","[{'authorId': '2968772', 'name': 'K.

The aim of the present study was to investigate (a) when the ability to evaluate perfect covariation, imperfect covariation, and non-covariation evidence emerges, (b) when experimentation emerges, (c) when hypothesis generation skills emerge, and (d), whether these abilities develop synchronously during childhood. We administered three scientific reasoning tasks referring to the three components to 223 children of five age groups (from age 4.0 to 13.5 years). Our results show that the three cognitive components of domain-general scientific reasoning emerge asynchronously. The development of domain-general scientific reasoning begins with the ability to handle unambiguous data, progresses to the interpretation of ambiguous data, and leads to a flexible adaptation of hypotheses according to the sufficiency of evidence. When children understand the relation between the level of ambiguity of evidence and the level of confidence in hypotheses, the ability to differentiate conclusive from inconclusive experiments accompanies this development. Implications of these results for designing science education concepts for young children are briefly discussed.","[{'authorId': '2101745772', 'name': 'Jeanette Piekny'}, {'authorId': '2077062415', 'name': 'C.

Social robots dedicated to assisting persons with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are rarely used in clinics. In a collaborative effort to bridge the gap between innovation in research and clinical practice, a team of engineers, clinicians and researchers working in the field of psychology developed and tested a robot-assisted educational intervention for children with low-functioning ASD (N = 20) A total of 14 lessons targeting requesting and turn-taking were elaborated, based on the Pivotal Training Method and principles of Applied Analysis of Behavior. Results showed that sensory rewards provided by the robot elicited more positive reactions than verbal praises from humans. The robot was of greatest benefit to children with a low level of disability. The educators were quite enthusiastic about children's progress in learning basic psychosocial skills from interactions with the robot. The robot nonetheless failed to act as a social mediator, as more prosocial behaviors were observed in the control condition, where instead of interacting with the robot children played with a ball. We discuss how to program robots to the distinct needs of individuals with ASD, how to harness robots' likability in order to enhance social skill learning, and how to arrive at a consensus about the standards of excellence that need to be met in interdisciplinary co-creation research. Our intuition is that robotic assistance, obviously judged as to be positive by educators, may contribute to the dissemination of innovative evidence-based practice for individuals with ASD.","[{'authorId': '2607018', 'name': 'V.

Novel interventions are required that target underlying factors of multiple disorders. Aims To evaluate the efficacy of a transdiagnostic trait-focused web-based intervention aimed at reducing symptoms of common mental disorders in university students. Method Students were recruited online (n = 1047, age: M = 21.8, SD = 4.2) and categorised into being at high or low risk for mental disorders based on their personality traits. Participants were allocated to a cognitive-behavioural trait-focused (n = 519) or a control intervention (n = 528) using computerised simple randomisation. Both interventions were fully automated and delivered online (trial registration: ISRCTN14342225). Participants were blinded and outcomes were self-assessed at baseline, at 6 weeks and at 12 weeks after registration. Primary outcomes were current depression and anxiety, assessed on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD7). Secondary outcome measures focused on alcohol use, disordered eating, and other outcomes. Results Students at high risk were successfully identified using personality indicators and reported poorer mental health. A total of 520 students completed the 6-week follow-up and 401 students completed the 12-week follow-up. Attrition was high across intervention groups, but comparable to other web-based interventions. Mixed effects analyses revealed that at 12-week follow up the trait-focused intervention reduced depression scores by 3.58 (p<.001, 95%CI [5.19, 1.98]) and anxiety scores by 2.87 (p = .018, 95%CI [1.31, 4.43]) in students at high risk. In high-risk students, between group effect sizes were 0.58 (depression) and 0.42 (anxiety). In addition, self-esteem was improved. No changes were observed regarding the use of alcohol or disordered eating. Conclusions This study suggests that a transdiagnostic web-based intervention for university students targeting underlying personality risk factors may be a promising way of preventing common mental disorders with a low-intensity intervention.

VR is argued to offer particular benefits for children on the autism spectrum, chiefly because it can offer simulations of authentic real-world situations in a carefully controlled and safe environment. Given the real world social difficulties experienced by children on the spectrum, this technology has therefore been argued to offer distinct advantages and benefits for social and life skills training compared to other approaches. Whilst there has been some progress in testing the relevance and applicability of VR for children on the autism spectrum in educational contexts, there remains a significant challenge in developing robust and usable technologies that can really make a difference in real world classrooms.

We present an in-depth case study of how an HCI research innovation goes through the process of transitioning from a university project to a revenue-generating startup financed by venture capital. The innovation is a novel contextual help system for the Web, and we reflect on the different methods used to evaluate it and how research insights endure attempted dissemination as a commercial product. Although the extent to which any innovation succeeds commercially depends on a number of factors like market forces, we found that our HCI innovation with user-centered origins was in a unique position to gain traction with customers and garner buy-in from investors. However, since end users were not the buyers of our product, a strong user-centered focus obfuscated other critical needs of the startup and pushed out perspectives of non-user-centered stakeholders. To make the research-to-product transition, we had to focus on adoption-centered design, the process of understanding and designing for adopters and stakeholders of the product.

f5fd33af7c5be2af49ca4b8172e25cde136069fc,"The authors present the design and implementation of an exploratory virtual learning environment that assists children with autism (ASD) in learning science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) skills along with improving social-emotional and communication skills. The primary contribution of this exploratory research is how educational research informs technological advances in triggering a virtual AI companion (AIC) for children in need of social-emotional and communication skills development. The AIC adapts to students’ varying levels of needed support. This project began by using puppetry control (human-in-the-loop) of the AIC, assisting students with ASD in learning basic coding, practicing their social skills with the AIC, and attaining emotional recognition and regulation skills for effective communication and learning. The student is given the challenge to program a robot, Dash™, to move in a square. Based on observed behaviors, the puppeteer controls the virtual agent’s actions to support the student in coding the robot. The virtual agent’s actions that inform the development of the AIC include speech, facial expressions, gestures, respiration, and heart color changes coded to indicate emotional state. The paper provides exploratory findings of the first 2 years of this 5-year scaling-up research study. The outcomes discussed align with a common approach of research design used for students with disabilities, called single case study research. This type of design does not involve random control trial research; instead, the student acts as her or his own control subject. Students with ASD have substantial individual differences in their social skill deficits, behaviors, communications, and learning needs, which vary greatly from the norm and from other individuals identified with this disability. Therefore, findings are reported as changes within subjects instead of across subjects. While these exploratory observations serve as a basis for longer term research on a larger population, this paper focuses less on student learning and more on evolving technology in AIC and supporting students with ASD in STEM environments.","[{'authorId': '2056019735', 'name': 'Charles E.

This research focuses on identifying the effect of different social stimuli from robotic agents to assess the attentional behavior of children with ASD. Latencies in shifting attention and the number of attentions paid to a stimulus are defined as indexes of attentional behaviors for children with ASD. Nine children with ASD (seven males and two females, mean: 7.57 ± 2.57 years) that had minimal to no symptoms of autism participated in this study. Two robotic agents presented visual, speech, and motion social stimuli to the participants.

f92212fc2261e992d49e4a11e7ac5c9ed9a63412,"Background It is proposed that some individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can ‘compensate’ for their underlying difficulties (e.g. in theory of mind; ToM), thus demonstrating relatively few behavioural symptoms, despite continued core cognitive deficits. The mechanisms underpinning compensation are largely unexplored, as is its potential impact on mental health. This study aimed to estimate compensation patterns in ASD, by contrasting overt social behaviour with ToM task performance, in order to compare the characteristics of ‘Low’ and ‘High’ Compensators. Methods A total of 136 autistic adolescents, from the ongoing Social Relationships Study, completed a range of cognitive tasks, the Autistic Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and a self‐report anxiety questionnaire. Participants were assigned compensation group status; High Compensators demonstrated good ADOS scores despite poor ToM performance, while Low Compensators demonstrated similarly poor ToM, accompanied by poor ADOS scores. Results High Compensators demonstrated better IQ and executive function (EF), but greater self‐reported anxiety, compared with Low Compensators. Such differences were not found when comparing individuals who had good versus poor ADOS scores, when ToM performance was good. Other core autistic characteristics (weak central coherence, nonsocial symptoms) did not differentiate the High and Low Compensators. Conclusions IQ, EF and anxiety appear to be implicated in the processes by which certain autistic young people can compensate for their underlying ToM difficulties. This tendency to compensate does not appear to reflect the severity of ‘hit’ for ASD per se, suggesting that well‐compensated individuals are not experiencing a milder form of ASD. The construct of compensation in ASD has implications for research and clinical practice.","[{'authorId': '4651535', 'name': 'L. A.

Understanding what the user is doing in the environment is important for adapting the environment's behavior, as well as for identifying situations that could be problematic for the user. Enabling the environment to exploit models of the user's most common behaviors is an important step toward this objective. In particular, models of the daily routines of a user can be exploited not only for predicting his/her needs, but also for comparing the actual situation at a given moment with the expected one, in order to detect anomalies in his/her behavior. While manually setting up process models in business and factory environments may be cost-effective, building models of the processes involved in people's everyday life is infeasible. This fact fully justifies the interest of the Ambient Intelligence community in automatically learning such models from examples of actual behavior. Incremental adaptation of the models and the ability to express/learn complex conditions on the involved tasks are also desirable. This article describes how process mining can be used for learning users’ daily routines from a dataset of annotated sensor data. The solution that we propose relies on a First-Order Logic learning approach. Indeed, First-Order Logic provides a single, comprehensive and powerful framework for supporting all the previously mentioned features. Our experiments, performed both on a proprietary toy dataset and on publicly available real-world ones, indicate that this approach is efficient and effective for learning and modeling daily routines in Smart Home Environments.","[{'authorId': '1739256', 'name': 'B.

faeb207c9bb3d02afb69cb4d832e308067519c07,"In this essay, I explore several facets of research through design in order to contribute to discussions about how the approach should develop. The essay has three parts. In the first, I review two influential theories from the Philosophy of Science to help reflect on the nature of design theory, concluding that research through design is likely to produce theories that are provisional, contingent, and aspirational. In the second part, I discuss three possible interpretations for the diversity of approaches to research through design, and suggest that this variation need not be seen as a sign of inadequate standards or a lack of cumulative progress in the field, but may be natural for a generative endeavour. In the final section, I suggest that, rather than aiming to develop increasingly comprehensive theories of design, practice based research might better view theory as annotation of realised design examples, and particularly portfolios of related pieces. Overall, I suggest that the design research community should be wary of impulses towards convergence and standardisation, and instead take pride in its aptitude for exploring and speculating, particularising and diversifying, and - especially - its ability to manifest the results in the form of new, conceptually rich artefacts.","[{'authorId': '2487205', 'name': 'William W.

A low-cost design with off-the-shelf components has been used in a novel design inspired from a multi-disciplinary viewpoint, including comics design and Japanese Noh theatre. The design rationale of the robot and its technical features are described in detail. Three research studies will be presented that have been using KASPAR extensively. Firstly, we present its application in robot-assisted play and therapy for children with autism. Secondly, we illustrate its use in human--robot interaction studies investigating the role of interaction kinesics and gestures. Lastly, we describe a study in the field of developmental robotics into computational architectures based on interaction histories for robot ontogeny. The three areas differ in the way as to how the robot is being operated and its role in social interaction scenarios. Each will be introduced briefly and examples of the results will be presented. Reflections on the specific design features of KASPAR that were important in these studies and lessons learnt from these studies concerning the design of humanoid robots for social interaction will also be discussed. An assessment of the robot in terms of utility of the design for human--robot interaction experiments concludes the paper.","[{'authorId': '1724361', 'name': 'K.

fd507903ed5fc0b5e03862a1edd4eabf260f8aa4,"Background Emotion regulation is a key transdiagnostic risk factor for a range of psychopathologies, making it a prime target for both prevention and treatment interventions in childhood. Existing interventions predominantly rely on workshops or in-person therapy-based approaches, limiting the ability to promote emotion regulation competence for children in everyday settings and at scale. Purrble is a newly developed, inexpensive, socially assistive robot—in the form of an interactive plush toy—that uses haptic feedback to support in-the-moment emotion regulation. It is accessible to children as needed in their daily lives, without the need for a priori training. Although qualitative data from previous studies show high engagement in situ and anecdotal evidence of the robot being incorporated into children’s emotion regulation routines, there is no quantitative evidence of the intervention’s impact on child outcomes. Objective The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of a new intervention model for child-led emotion regulation—Purrble—that can be deployed across prevention and treatment contexts. Methods Overall, 134 children aged 8 to 10 years will be selected from an enriched nonclinical North American population; for inclusion, the cutoff for the parents’ rating of child dysregulation will be ≥10 points in the total difficulties score on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. This cutoff was selected to obtain a measurable, but not necessarily clinical, level of the child’s emotion regulatory difficulties. The selected families will be randomly assigned with .5 probability to receive either a Purrble or an active control (noninteractive plush toy). The primary outcome will be a daily ecological momentary assessment measure of child emotion regulation capability (as reported by parents) over a period of 4 weeks. Exploratory analyses will investigate the intervention impact on secondary outcomes of child emotion regulation, collected weekly over the same 4-week period, with follow-ups at 1 month and 6 months postdeployment. Quantitative data will be analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. A proportion of families (approximately 30% of the sample) will be interviewed after deployment as part of the process analysis. Results The study is funded by the UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship (MR/T041897/1) and an in-kind contribution from the Committee for Children. This study received ethical approval from the Pearl institutional review board (#18-CFC-101). Participant recruitment started in February 2021, with the 1-month deployment in April-May 2021. The results of this analysis will be published in 2022. Conclusions This study will be the first quantitative evaluation of the efficacy of an innovative, proof-of-concept intervention model for an in situ, child-led emotion regulation intervention. Insights into the trajectory of daily changes, complemented with weekly questionnaire batteries and postdeployment interviews, will result in an in-depth understanding of whether and how the hypothesized intervention logic model works, leading to further intervention optimization.

fdf1c67b0c967be5777220fda42aa8355f03e2f3,"In this paper we specify and validate three interaction design patterns for an interactive storytelling experience with an autonomous social robot. The patterns enable the child to make decisions about the story by talking with the robot, reenact parts of the story together with the robot, and recording self-made sound effects. The design patterns successfully support children’s engagement and agency. A user study $(\mathrm{N}=27$, 8-10 y.o.) showed that children paid more attention to the robot, enjoyed the storytelling experience more, and could recall more about the story, when the design patterns were employed by the robot during storytelling. All three aspects are important features of engagement. Children felt more autonomous during storytelling with the design patterns and highly appreciated that the design patterns allowed them to express themselves more freely. Both aspects are important features of children’s agency. Important lessons we have learned are that reducing points of confusion and giving the children more time to make themselves heard by the robot will improve the patterns efficiency to support engagement and agency. Allowing children to pick and choose from a diverse set of stories and interaction settings would make the storytelling experience more inclusive for a broader range of children.

fdfe996e24772ac8b48fc0f7b72140d0d2f366c1,"It is generally thought that individuals with Asperger's syndrome and high-functioning autism (AS/HFA) have deficits in theory of mind. These deficits have been previously linked to problems with social cognition. However, we reasoned that AS/HFA individuals' Theory of Mind deficits also might lead to problems with emotion regulation. To assess emotional functioning in AS/HFA, 27 AS/HFA adults (16 women) and 27 age-, gender-, and education-matched typically developing (TD) participants completed a battery of measures of emotion experience, labeling, and regulation. With respect to emotion experience, individuals with AS/HFA reported higher levels of negative emotions, but similar levels of positive emotions, compared with TD individuals. With respect to emotion labeling, individuals with AS/HFA had greater difficulties identifying and describing their emotions, with approximately two-thirds exceeding the cutoff for alexithymia. With respect to emotion regulation, individuals with AS/HFA used reappraisal less frequently than TD individuals and reported lower levels of reappraisal self-efficacy. Although AS/HFA individuals used suppression more frequently than TD individuals, no difference in suppression self-efficacy was found. It is important to note that these differences in emotion regulation were evident even when controlling for emotion experience and labeling. Implications of these deficits are discussed, and future research directions are proposed.","[{'authorId': '38707445', 'name': 'Andrea C. Samson'}, {'authorId': '48474585', 'name': 'O.

ff4cf355f3835c4c214c25404dbc8f45c227ea60,"A utism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impaired social communication and social interaction skills, as well as restrictive and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and activities (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Recent estimates suggest that ASD is the fastest growing disability in the United States, affecting an estimated 1 in 88 children (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012). Consequently, public school districts have observed similar growth in the number of students being served with ASD, given that 406,957 cases were classified under autism in 2012, an increase of 7,414% since initial classification in 1992 (U.S. Department of Education, 1995, 2012). Given the rapid increase in the number of students with a special education classification of autism, it is essential that school personnel be knowledgeable of best practices for children with ASD. Teachers must be skilled in providing differentiated instruction to adequately meet the needs of students with ASD who require additional attention and support (Fuchs, Fuchs, & Stecker, 2010). Although implementation of evidence-based practices is required by current legislation (No Child Left Behind Act, 2002), many evidencebased practices for individuals with ASD are not implemented in schools due to limited time and resources (Bellini & McConnell, 2010)—often associated with challenges of balancing targeted intervention for students with ASD and instruction of the larger group of students (e.g., Tilly, 2003). Instead, many of the intervention strategies most regularly implemented by public school personnel for children with ASD lack empirical support (Hess, Morrier, Heflin, & Ivey, 2007), waste the limited resources available to schools (Simpson et al., 2005), and fail to produce improvements in generalized settings (Bellini & Akullian, 2007).","[{'authorId': '40180246', 'name': 'Allison A.
