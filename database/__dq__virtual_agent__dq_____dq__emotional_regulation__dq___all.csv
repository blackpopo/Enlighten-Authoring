001616a2661b20b92387ef40a63bb95ab9883a87,"ABSTRACT Primary objective: Patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) have difficulty dealing with the social world and may display inappropriate social behavior that negatively affects their social and occupational rehabilitation. This difficulty may be explained by a social problem-solving (SPS) impairment, but little is yet known about the cognitive processes involved in the ability to solve social problems. Several publications have demonstrated that executive functions are related to social problem solving, but the role of social cognition needs to be confirmed. The present pilot study examined the expected relationships between SPS ability and both social cognition and social behavioral skills. Research design: We compared the performances of 15 patients with TBI on SPS, theory-of-mind and social behavior tasks with those of 25 matched healthy controls. Main outcomes and results: Our results showed for the first time that impaired social problem solving is associated with a theory-of-mind deficit, but surprisingly not with executive impairment. There was no evidence that SPS deficits predict social behavioral disorders. Conclusions: Studying social problem solving in patients with TBI may inform the design of more appropriate methods of social rehabilitation.","[{'authorId': '1486122642', 'name': 'Mathilde Saint-Jean'}, {'authorId': '153541817', 'name': 'P.

0037e73960b4c9d19b8928c8f82d82ce315d4fe7,"ABSTRACT Social cognition is widely regarded as an essential skill with which to understand the social world. Despite this, the role that social cognition plays in outcome, and whether deficits are remediable after traumatic brain injury (TBI), are not yet well known. The current review examines the construct of social cognition and presents a conceptual biopsychosocial model with which to understand the social cognitive process. This is related to the literature on social cognitive deficits in TBI and we discuss relevant treatment developments to date within this population. We then review social cognition treatment programmes researched in other clinical populations in order to advise and inform approaches for those living with TBI. Whilst treatments have focused on emotion perception skills in the TBI literature, programmes developed for other clinical populations have had broader targets, focusing on Theory of Mind skills and/or modifying interpretational cognitive biases. Moreover, they have largely proven to be efficacious. Programmes that are contextualised, collaborative, and experiential seem optimal in enabling generalisation relevant to individuals’ everyday social lives. We argue that there is therefore scope to improve the evidence-based social cognitive treatment options available for those with TBI, taking into account specific adaptations necessary for this population.","[{'authorId': '10273454', 'name': 'Anneli Cassel'}, {'authorId': '143982280', 'name': 'S.

Intrinsically this language is multimodal (heterogeneous), sequential and asynchronous; it consists of the language (words), visual (expressions) and acoustic (paralinguistic) modalities all in the form of asynchronous coordinated sequences. From a resource perspective, there is a genuine need for large scale datasets that allow for in-depth studies of this form of language. In this paper we introduce CMU Multimodal Opinion Sentiment and Emotion Intensity (CMU-MOSEI), the largest dataset of sentiment analysis and emotion recognition to date. Using data from CMU-MOSEI and a novel multimodal fusion technique called the Dynamic Fusion Graph (DFG), we conduct experimentation to exploit how modalities interact with each other in human multimodal language. Unlike previously proposed fusion techniques, DFG is highly interpretable and achieves competative performance when compared to the previous state of the art.","[{'authorId': '144802290', 'name': 'Amir Zadeh'}, {'authorId': '28130078', 'name': 'P.

We examined whether kindergarten teachers' ratings of children's prosocial skills, an indicator of noncognitive ability at school entry, predict key adolescent and adult outcomes. Our goal was to determine unique associations over and above other important child, family, and contextual characteristics.


METHODS
Data came from the Fast Track study of low-socioeconomic status neighborhoods in 3 cities and 1 rural setting. We assessed associations between measured outcomes in kindergarten and outcomes 13 to 19 years later (1991-2000). Models included numerous control variables representing characteristics of the child, family, and context, enabling us to explore the unique contributions among predictors.


RESULTS
We found statistically significant associations between measured social-emotional skills in kindergarten and key young adult outcomes across multiple domains of education, employment, criminal activity, substance use, and mental health.


CONCLUSIONS
A kindergarten measure of social-emotional skills may be useful for assessing whether children are at risk for deficits in noncognitive skills later in life and, thus, help identify those in need of early intervention. These results demonstrate the relevance of noncognitive skills in development for personal and public health outcomes.","[{'authorId': '36531525', 'name': 'Damon Jones'}, {'authorId': '144295419', 'name': 'M.

The integration of expressive virtual patients in these simulators encourages the exchanges and provokes emotional reactions in the learner, which promotes memorization and learning. Based on these elements, we assume that the facial expressiveness of a virtual agent is a factor to be considered in order to improve the user experience. We investigate the impact of the facial expressiveness of virtual humans on the empathy induction in the user of health simulators. We also investigate the impact of facial expressiveness on the user’s sense of similarity and the affective bond with the agent. Our results show a high empathy score when users train with simulators. Depending on the context, we observe a significant difference in perspective-taking in favor of the users who interact with an expressive virtual agent to a virtual agent without facial expressiveness.","[{'authorId': '2079143895', 'name': 'Anne-Sophie Milcent'}, {'authorId': '39792357', 'name': 'Abdelmajid Kadri'}, {'authorId': '2646589', 'name': 'S.

This study assesses mechanisms by which the Fast Track project (n = 891), a randomized intervention in the early 1990s for high-risk children in four communities (Durham, NC; Nashville, TN; rural PA; and Seattle, WA), reduced delinquency, arrests, and general and mental health service utilization in adolescence through young adulthood (ages 12-20). A decomposition of treatment effects indicates that about a third of Fast Track's impact on later crime outcomes can be accounted for by improvements in social and self-regulation skills during childhood (ages 6-11), such as prosocial behavior, emotion regulation, and problem solving.

In this paper, we present a multimodal system that supports emotion recognition from both visual and acoustic feature analysis. Our main achievement is that with this bimodal method, we can effectively extend the recognized emotion categories compared to when only visual or acoustic feature analysis works alone. We also show that by carefully cooperating bimodal features, the recognition precision of each emotion category will exceed the limit set up by the single modality, both visual and acoustic. Moreover, we believe our system is closer to real human perception and experience and hence will make emotion recognition closer to practical application in the future","[{'authorId': '3288141', 'name': 'Cheng-Yao Chen'}, {'authorId': '2108715669', 'name': 'Yue Huang'}, {'authorId': '1716507', 'name': 'P.

On a difficult, skill-based task, participants were more likely to fail when observed by supportive audiences than when observed by nonsupportive audiences. When the criterion for success was easy, supportive audiences had no effect. With a difficult criterion, supportive audiences elicited cautious, protective strategies that were associated with poor performance: Speed decreased without improving accuracy. Despite impairments caused by supportive audiences, performers found supportive audiences more helpful and less stressful than neutral or adversarial audiences, and participants believed (wrongly) that they performed better with a supportive audience. Results suggest that people are not aware of debilitating effects of supportive audiences and may opt for emotional comfort rather than objective success.","[{'authorId': '152614719', 'name': 'Jennifer L.

Guided by new conceptual and quantitative approaches (Cowen, Elfenbein, Laukka, & Keltner, 2018; Cowen & Keltner, 2017, 2018), we explore the taxonomy of emotion recognized in facial-bodily expression. Participants (N = 1,794; 940 female, ages 18-76 years) judged the emotions captured in 1,500 photographs of facial-bodily expression in terms of emotion categories, appraisals, free response, and ecological validity. We find that facial-bodily expressions can reliably signal at least 28 distinct categories of emotion that occur in everyday life. Emotion categories, more so than appraisals such as valence and arousal, organize emotion recognition. However, categories of emotion recognized in naturalistic facial and bodily behavior are not discrete but bridged by smooth gradients that correspond to continuous variations in meaning. Our results support a novel view that emotions occupy a high-dimensional space of categories bridged by smooth gradients of meaning. They offer an approximation of a taxonomy of facial-bodily expressions, visualized within an online interactive map.

The supply of child and adolescent psychiatrists is insufficient for the number of children in need of services and is not anticipated to grow. This calls for novel approaches to mental health care. Telemental health (TMH) offers one approach to increase access. TMH programmes serving young people are developing rapidly and available studies demonstrate that these services are feasible, acceptable, sustainable and likely as effective as in-person services. TMH services are utilized in clinical settings to provide direct care and consultation to primary care providers (PCPs), as well as in non-traditional settings, such as schools, correctional facilities and the home. Delivery of services to young people through TMH requires several adjustments to practice with adults regarding the model of care, cultural values, participating adults, rapport-building, pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Additional infrastructure accommodations at the patient site include space and staffing to conduct developmentally appropriate evaluations and treatment planning with parents, other providers, and community services. For TMH to optimally impact young people’s access to mental health care, collaborative models of care are needed to support PCPs as frontline mental health-care providers, thereby effectively expanding the child and adolescent mental health workforce.","[{'authorId': '7757965', 'name': 'Nicole Gloff'}, {'authorId': '6995270', 'name': 'Sean R LeNoue'}, {'authorId': '4857034', 'name': 'D.

This study examined associations between daily physical, sedentary, social, and leisure behaviors and depressive symptoms (a) at a macrolevel, over the course of an Experience Sampling (ESM) self-monitoring intervention, and (b) at a microlevel, by examining daily within-person associations. Second, we examined the effects of the ESM self-monitoring intervention on these daily life behaviors.


METHODS
Individuals with a diagnosis of depression (N = 102) receiving pharmacological treatment were randomized to 1 of 2 six-week ESM intervention conditions or a control condition. Physical, sedentary, social, and leisure behaviors as well as depressive symptoms were assessed prospectively in every-day life at baseline, postintervention, and during the ESM interventions.


RESULTS
Change in physical activity and talking from baseline to postintervention was associated with change in depressive symptoms from baseline to postintervention. Within-person daily fluctuations in talking, physical activity, doing nothing/resting, and being alone predicted end-of-day depressive symptoms over and above depressive symptoms at the previous day. The ESM interventions contributed to change in talking, doing nothing/resting, and being alone over time in comparison with the control group. The analyses revealed individual differences in the amount of behavioral change over time and in the within-subject associations between daily behaviors and depressive symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings suggest that physical, sedentary, and social behaviors have affective implications for daily mental health of individuals with depression. Self-monitoring using ESM may be a useful add-on tool to achieve behavioral change and to gain personalized insight in behaviors that improve daily depressive symptoms.","[{'authorId': '6467792', 'name': 'E.

Whether real or not, the belief in such a race for domain supremacy through AI, can make it real simply from its consequences, as put forward by the Thomas theorem. These consequences may be negative, as racing for technological supremacy creates a complex ecology of choices that could push stake-holders to underestimate or even ignore ethical and safety procedures. As a consequence, different actors are urging to consider both the normative and social impact of these technological advancements, contemplating the use of the precautionary principle in AI innovation and research. Yet, given the breadth and depth of AI and its advances, it is difficult to assess which technology needs regulation and when. As there is no easy access to data describing this alleged AI race, theoretical models are necessary to understand its potential dynamics, allowing for the identification of when procedures need to be put in place to favour outcomes beneficial for all. We show that, next to the risks of setbacks and being reprimanded for unsafe behaviour, the time-scale in which domain supremacy can be achieved plays a crucial role. When this can be achieved in a short term, those who completely ignore the safety precautions are bound to win the race but at a cost to society, apparently requiring regulatory actions. Our analysis reveals that imposing regulations for all risk and timing conditions may not have the anticipated effect as only for specific conditions a dilemma arises between what is individually preferred and globally beneficial. Similar observations can be made for the long-term development case. Yet different from the short-term situation, conditions can be identified that require the promotion of risk-taking as opposed to compliance with safety regulations in order to improve social welfare. These results remain robust both when two or several actors are involved in the race and when collective rather than individual setbacks are produced by risk-taking behaviour. When defining codes of conduct and regulatory policies for applications of AI, a clear understanding of the time-scale of the race is thus required, as this may induce important non-trivial effects.

However, rumination and distraction differ both in what one thinks about and how one thinks about it. Do the negative outcomes of rumination result from how people think about negative events or simply that they think about them at all? To address this question, participants in 2 studies recalled a recent anger-provoking event and then thought about it in 1 of 2 ways: by ruminating or by reappraising. The authors examined the impact of these strategies on subsequent ratings of anger experience (Study 1) as well as on perseverative thinking and physiological responding over time (Study 2). Relative to reappraisal, rumination led to greater anger experience, more cognitive perseveration, and greater sympathetic nervous system activation. These findings provide compelling new evidence that how one thinks about an emotional event can shape the emotional response one has.","[{'authorId': '3898955', 'name': 'R.

However, speaker ""hand off"" behavior---the verbal and nonverbal cues used to transition from one speaker to another---and its effect on speaker anxiety and presentation quality has not been systematically studied. In this work we report on two empirical studies of speaker hand-off behavior used during human co-presentations. We find that the cues used for hand-offs during prepared and rehearsed presentations differ significantly from the cues observed in face-to-face conversational turn-taking. We describe two systems that leverage automatic recognition of these verbal and nonverbal cues to drive hand-offs during co-presentations with a life-sized virtual agent.","[{'authorId': '123139633', 'name': 'Prasanth Murali'}, {'authorId': '2880118', 'name': 'Lazlo Ring'}, {'authorId': '144902406', 'name': 'H.

Persuasion can be generally defined as an attempt to change another's beliefs or behavior. The act of influencing others is fundamental to nearly every type of social interaction. Any agent desiring to seamlessly operate in a social manner will need to incorporate this type of core human behavior. As in human interaction, myriad aspects of a humanoid robot's appearance and behavior can significantly alter its persuasiveness - this work will focus on one particular factor: gender. In the current study, run at the Museum of Science in Boston, subjects interacted with a humanoid robot whose gender was varied. After a short interaction and persuasive appeal, subjects responded to a donation request made by the robot, and subsequently completed a post-study questionnaire. Findings showed that men were more likely to donate money to the female robot, while women showed little preference. Subjects also tended to rate the robot of the opposite sex as more credible, trustworthy, and engaging. In the case of trust and engagement the effect was much stronger between male subjects and the female robot. These results demonstrate the importance of considering robot and human gender in the design of HRI.","[{'authorId': '144262067', 'name': 'Mike Siegel'}, {'authorId': '1711777', 'name': 'C.

03e3a2d4fde20ab6868bb727d9f64acca4f31379,"Sense of agency refers to the feeling that “I” am responsible for those external events that are directly produced by one's own voluntary actions. Recent theories distinguish between a non-conceptual “feeling” of agency linked to changes in the processing of self-generated sensory events, and a higher-order judgement of agency, which attributes sensory events to the self. In the current study we explore the neural correlates of the judgement of agency by means of electrophysiology. We measured event-related potentials to tones that were either perceived or not perceived as triggered by participants' voluntary actions and related these potentials to later judgements of agency over the tones. Replicating earlier findings on predictive sensory attenuation, we found that the N1 component was attenuated for congruent tones that corresponded to the learned action-effect mapping as opposed to incongruent tones that did not correspond to the previously acquired associations between actions and tones. The P3a component, but not the N1, directly reflected the judgement of agency: deflections in this component were greater for tones judged as self-generated than for tones judged as externally produced. The fact that the outcome of the later agency judgement was predictable based on the P3a component demonstrates that agency judgements incorporate early information processing components and are not purely reconstructive, post-hoc evaluations generated at time of judgement.","[{'authorId': '1895071', 'name': 'S.

04f8ebd32571eb11f29ba972b8aba2e828760bdb,"Previous research suggests that women, more than men, experience negative outcomes when they display dominance. A closer look, however, reveals ambiguity about the specific forms of dominance proscribed for women. Here, we suggest that negative reactions to women's dominance, a counter-stereotypical behavior, may require that the behavior be clearly encoded as counter-stereotypical-which is less likely when the behavior is expressed implicitly. This hypothesis was tested with a meta-analysis of studies on the evaluation of individuals behaving dominantly, including articles not directly investigating gender. Results revealed that dominance indeed hurts women's, relative to men's, likability (although the overall effect is small, d = -0.19, k = 63), as well as more downstream outcomes such as hireability (d = -0.58, k = 20). More important, however, dominance expressed explicitly (e.g., direct demands) affected women's likability (d = -0.28) whereas implicit forms of dominance (e.g., eye contact) did not (d = 0.03). Finally, the effect of dominance on men's and women's perceived competence did not differ (d = 0.02, k = 31), consistent with the idea that it is interpersonal (rather than instrumental) evaluations that obstruct women leaders.

The purpose of this article is to explore a novel, short-term treatment intervention for internalizing behaviours. This intervention is primarily based upon an externalizing process, transforming of metaphoric imagery, and shifting of underlying maladaptive emotional schemas. This article addresses the clinical population of children and youth, specifically through outlining the protocol, externalizing metaphors therapy. A selective review of significant works regarding the efficacy of short-term therapy was conducted, including the process of change within narrative therapy. It is proposed that two specific processes account for the mental health change experienced by clients who receive this new treatment intervention: (1) externalization of problems and (2) purposeful client-generated metaphor manipulation, impacting upon underlying schemas. From these theoretical constructs, the present article outlines a three-session treatment protocol that manualizes these key clinical processes. A case study is presented to illustrate this intervention for anxiety and depression. Further clinical research is underway to address the testable hypotheses resulting from the current theoretical model. Clinical trials in brief psychotherapy are suggested to empirically evaluate the efficacy of this new treatment intervention for dysphoria.


KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE
This article outlines a short-term treatment intervention for anxiety and depression (dysphoira) through a novel 3-session model, where the clinician-practitioner can obtain competency through a one-day workshop.Its relevance for the clinical researcher and the mental health community is in its versatility in addressing internalizing behavior for four clinical populations: (1) children and adolescents; (2) children and adolescents on the autism spectrum; (3) adults in general; and, (4) adults with a dual-diagnosis. The treatment protocol described within is based upon the externalizing and deconstructive properties of Narrative Therapy, and the transformation of metaphoric imagery of Metaphor Therapy; both of which have little empirical support with narrative practices gaining international attention and widespread usage - through brief therapy, long-term therapy, and walk-in clinics in North America. For the first time, the theoretical constructs of the 3-session model are described and a case example illustrates the interlinking concepts.","[{'authorId': '7151618', 'name': 'Everett McGuinty'}, {'authorId': '33429039', 'name': 'D.

Nevertheless, laboratory experiments and retrospective assessments have been the 2 most common strands of ER research; thus, leaving open several crucial questions about ER antecedents and consequences in daily life. Beyond traditional methods, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has the potential to capture ER dynamics during the flow of daily experiences, in real-life settings and through repeated measurements. Here, we discuss what we currently know about ER antecedents and consequences. We will compare findings from previous literature to findings from EMA studies, pointing out both similarities and differences, as well as questions that can be answered better with the EMA approach.

A critical pre-cursor to this type of social learning is the ability to maintain interaction levels that are neither overwhelming nor under-stim ulating. In this paper, we present a mechanism for an autonomous robot to regulate the intensity of its social interactions with a human. Similar to the feedback from infant to caregiver, the robot uses expressive displays to modulate the interaction intensity. This mechanism is integrated within a general framework that combines perception, attention, drives, emotions, behavior selection, and motor acts. We present a specific implementation of this architecture that enables the robot to react appropriately to both social stimuli (faces) and non-social stimuli (moving toys) while maintaining a suitable interaction intensity. We present results from both face-to-face interactions and interactions mediated through a toy. Note: This paper was submitted in June, 1998.","[{'authorId': '1711777', 'name': 'C.

Researchers studying individual differences in social interactions are typically interested in keeping the behavior and the appearance of the interaction partner constant across participants. With IVET researchers have full control over the interaction partners, can standardize them while still keeping the simulation realistic. Virtual simulations are valid: growing evidence shows that indeed studies conducted with IVET can replicate some well-known findings of social psychology. Moreover, IVET allows researchers to subtly manipulate characteristics of the environment (e.g., visual cues to prime participants) or of the social partner (e.g., his/her race) to investigate their influences on participants’ behavior and cognition. Furthermore, manipulations that would be difficult or impossible in real life (e.g., changing participants’ height) can be easily obtained with IVET. Beside the advantages for theoretical research, we explore the most recent training and clinical applications of IVET, its integration with other technologies (e.g., social sensing) and future challenges for researchers (e.g., making the communication between virtual humans and participants smoother).","[{'authorId': '5983047', 'name': 'Dario Bombari'}, {'authorId': '2284257', 'name': 'M.

Kinetic typography has been widely and successfully used in film title sequences as well as television and computer-based advertising. However, its communicative abilities have not been widely studied, and its potential has rarely been exploited outside these areas. This is partly due to the difficulty in creating kinetic typography with current tools, often requiring hours of work to animate a single sentence.In this paper, we present the Kinedit system, a basic authoring tool that takes initial steps toward remedying this situation and hence promoting exploration of the communicative potential of kinetic typography for personal communication.

Although several approaches have been proposed to recognize human emotions based on facial expressions or speech, relatively limited work has been done to fuse these two, and other, modalities to improve the accuracy and robustness of the emotion recognition system. This paper analyzes the strengths and the limitations of systems based only on facial expressions or acoustic information. It also discusses two approaches used to fuse these two modalities: decision level and feature level integration. Using a database recorded from an actress, four emotions were classified: sadness, anger, happiness, and neutral state. By the use of markers on her face, detailed facial motions were captured with motion capture, in conjunction with simultaneous speech recordings. The results reveal that the system based on facial expression gave better performance than the system based on just acoustic information for the emotions considered. Results also show the complementarily of the two modalities and that when these two modalities are fused, the performance and the robustness of the emotion recognition system improve measurably.","[{'authorId': '2106794', 'name': 'C.

Haptic technologies have been shown to provide an important contribution to this by facilitating co-presence and allowing affective communication. However, the findings of the affective influences rely on studies that have used myriad different types of haptic technology, making it likely that some forms of tactile feedback are more efficient in communicating emotions than others. To find out whether this is true and which haptic technologies are most effective, we measured user experience during a communication scenario featuring an affective agent and interpersonal touch in virtual reality. Interpersonal touch was simulated using two types of vibrotactile actuators and two types of force feedback mechanisms. Self-reports of subjective experience of the agent’s touch and emotions were obtained. The results revealed that, regardless of the agent’s expression, force feedback actuators were rated as more natural and resulted in greater emotional interdependence and a stronger sense of co-presence than vibrotactile touch.","[{'authorId': '1709579', 'name': 'Imtiaj Ahmed'}, {'authorId': '6018189', 'name': 'V.

Such stepwise adaptation can occur through individual learning or through natural selection, the basis of evolution. Since the work of Maynard Smith and others, it has been realized how game theory can model this process. Evolutionary game theory replaces the static solutions of classical game theory by a dynamical approach centered not on the concept of rational players but on the population dynamics of behavioral programs. In this book the authors investigate the nonlinear dynamics of the self-regulation of social and economic behavior, and of the closely related interactions among species in ecological communities. Replicator equations describe how successful strategies spread and thereby create new conditions that can alter the basis of their success, i.e., to enable us to understand the strategic and genetic foundations of the endless chronicle of invasions and extinctions that punctuate evolution. In short, evolutionary game theory describes when to escalate a conflict, how to elicit cooperation, why to expect a balance of the sexes, and how to understand natural selection in mathematical terms.

The robot has an internal arousal and valence value, which are influenced by the emotional state of its interaction partner and emotional occurrences such as winning a game. It expresses these emotions through its voice, posture, whole body poses, eye colour and gestures. An experiment with 18 children (mean age 9) and two Nao robots was conducted to study the influence of adaptive emotion expression on the interaction behaviour and opinions of children. In a within-subjects design the children played a quiz with both an affective robot using the model for adaptive emotion expression and a non-affective robot without this model. The affective robot reacted to the emotions of the child using the implementation of the model, the emotions of the child were interpreted by a Wizard of Oz. The dependent variables, namely the behaviour and opinions of the children, were measured through video analysis and questionnaires. The results show that children react more expressively and more positively to a robot which adaptively expresses itself than to a robot which does not. The feedback of the children in the questionnaires further suggests that showing emotion through movement is considered a very positive trait for a robot. From their positive reactions we can conclude that children enjoy interacting with a robot which adaptively expresses itself through emotion and gesture more than with a robot which does not do this.

The aim of this study was to determine the implication of the prefrontal cortex in the control of action. For that purpose, we compared the performance of 15 patients with frontal lobe lesions and 15 matched controls on an experimental paradigm generating a conflict between the action planned and the sensory-motor feedback. Subjects had to trace a sagittal line witha stylus on a graphic tablet. The hand was hidden by a mirror on which the traced line, processed by a computer, was projected. Without informing the subjects, the line traced was modified by introducing a bias to the right, which increased progressively from 2 to 42. To succeed the task, subjects had to modify their motor program and deviate their hand in the opposite direction. The sensory-motor adjustment to the bias was evaluated by the surface between the line traced and the ideal line to compensate for the deviation. The awareness of the conflict was measured by the angle of the bias at which subjects expressed the feeling that the line they traced was not the same as the line they saw. The deviation was similarly compensated for by patients and controls until24. Then 14 controls but only3 patients were aware of a conflict. After that, the variability of performance increased significantly for the unaware patients. These results suggest that the prefrontal cortex is required at the level of conscious monitoring of actions, but not at the level of sensory-motor integration.","[{'authorId': '1856169', 'name': 'A.

In real life touching hands is an important empathic experience for dyads that elicits a strong sense of togetherness, while signaling trust, understanding and social support. We analyzed hand-holding behavior of parent-child dyads and classified these into five categories implemented by the device: (1) child holding parent's finger, (2) fingers on fingers (both on the inside), (3) palm on palm, (4) palm on outside of hand, and (5) child holding parent's fingers and palm. For each hand holding position there are distinct sending, receiving and neutral contact points.

The book aims to be a guide through the most common and interesting methods for corporate valuation, supported by a rich mathematical foundation. The focus is on the tools and methods for valuing a business, from the most basic approaches to the implementation of complex algorithms. Each topic is deeply analyzed to give students the tools to really understand the effects of valuation on the life of the corporation. The vision of the book is to offer a guide to valuation, capable of helping students and practitioners gain an introduction to the area, as well as giving intermediate users useful insights into and a deeper understanding of the analytics behind each part. The literature of books in corporate valuation spans over a wide range of methods and theories. The market is already full of (even good) textbooks facing the issue of the corporation from many points of view. However, the overall offer of Inside Company Valuation turns the attention on the financial aspects of the daily life of the corporation, with a robust mathematical setting, and the explanation and derivation of the mostly popular models of the firm. The potential of filling such a niche is evident if one thinks that a course in Corporate Finance nowadays makes only sense if it includes a robust section about company valuation tools and techniques. There is a demand of high-quality education at Master level, including a more advanced level of Corporate Finance courses, which is not fulfilled nowadays, and definitely requires a good textbook as a guide for such advanced education in the field. Corporate finance is the first area of knowledge in an ideal sequence of studies in finance. Company valuation is a major component of the theory behind the broadest area and it is therefore crucial for all students to gain command of the topic.","[{'authorId': '2237431050', 'name': 'Bodero Luciano'}, {'authorId': '2237430588', 'name': 'Saksena Ravi'}, {'authorId': '2237430608', 'name': 'Korotezki Waldemar'}]",434.0,,494.0,A MODERN APPROACH,2017.0

The aim of this research is to investigate which design features establish a positive first impression of an agent in this context. A set of eight static agent images, different in age, gender and role, were subjected to testing in an online questionnaire. Respondents (n = 155) selected their preferred design and rated the characteristics – friendliness, expertise, reliability, involvement and authority – and the likeliness of following the agent’s advice for all designs. In addition, focus groups (n = 13) were conducted for detailed understandings supporting these impressions. Our results show that, for both a general and elderly population, (1) people seem to prefer images of young, female agents over old, male agents, (2) the (a) age, (b) gender and (c) role of the agent image affect the perception of the agent’s characteristics and the likeliness of following the agent’s advice, and that (3) both the general and elderly population prefer an agent image that is similar in (a) age and (b) gender. A next step would be to investigate how the characteristics of the agent designs are perceived after interaction with the agent.","[{'authorId': '3402878', 'name': 'Silke ter Stal'}, {'authorId': '37464392', 'name': 'M.

Despite existing numerous research efforts on mocap motion processing and understanding, to the best of our knowledge, to date few works have been dedicated to the investigation into whether the mocap human behavior data can be further enhanced to improve its perception. In this work, we investigate whether and how it is feasible to consistently manipulate mocap emotional head motion to enhance its perceived expressiveness. Our study relies on a mocap audiovisual dataset acquired in a laboratory setting. Participants are invited to view the animation clips of a virtual talking character displaying the original mocap head motion or manipulated head motion, and then to rate their perceived expressiveness. Statistical analysis of the rated perceptions shows that humans are sensitive to the mean of head pitch rotation (called up-down rotation) in an utterance and that the expressiveness of emotion could be improved by adjusting the mean of head pitch rotation in an utterance.","[{'authorId': '143749175', 'name': 'Yu Ding'}, {'authorId': '152932130', 'name': 'Lei Shi'}, {'authorId': '145140508', 'name': 'Z.

A key factor in human social interaction is our beliefs about others, a theory of mind. Whether we believe a message depends not only on its content but also on our model of the communicator. How we act depends not only on the immediate effect but also on how we believe others will react. In this paper, we discuss PsychSim, an implemented multiagent-based simulation tool for modeling interactions and influence. While typical approaches to such modeling have used first-order logic, Psych-Sim agents have their own decision-theoretic model of the world, including beliefs about its environment and recursive models of other agents. Using these quantitative models of uncertainty and preferences, we have translated existing psychological theories into a decision-theoretic semantics that allow the agents to reason about degrees of believability in a novel way.

Beyond those myriad features examined in computer science, roundness, angularity, and visual complexity have also been found to evoke emotions in human perceivers, as demonstrated in psychological studies of facial expressions, dance poses, and even simple synthetic visual patterns. Capturing these characteristics algorithmically to incorporate in computational studies, however, has proven difficult. Here we expand the scope of previous computer vision work by examining these three visual characteristics in computer analysis of complex scenes, and compare the results to the hundreds of visual qualities previously examined. A large collection of ecologically valid stimuli (i.e., photos that humans regularly encounter on the web), named the EmoSet and containing more than 40,000 images crawled from web albums, was generated using crowd-sourcing and subjected to human subject emotion ratings. We developed computational methods to the separate indices of roundness, angularity, and complexity, thereby establishing three new computational constructs. Critically, these three new physically interpretable visual constructs achieve comparable classification accuracy to the hundreds of shape, texture, composition, and facial feature characteristics previously examined. In addition, our experimental results show that color features related most strongly with the positivity of perceived emotions, the texture features related more to calmness or excitement, and roundness, angularity, and simplicity related similarly with both of these emotions dimensions.","[{'authorId': '145574672', 'name': 'Xin Lu'}, {'authorId': '2164408', 'name': 'Reginald B.

These meaningmaking resources are grouped together as the “language of evaluation” on the grounds that they are all means by which the speaker’s/writer’s personal, evaluative involvement in the text is revealed as they adopt stances either toward phenomena (the entities, happenings, or states of affairs being construed by the text) or toward metaphenomena (propositions about these entities, happenings, and states of affairs). Early work on the appraisal framework largely focused on evaluative meanings in English, with this literature noting that no assumptions should be made as to whether the evaluative categories proposed for English necessarily operate in other languages. Subsequently, researchers have employed the descriptive principles that underlie the framework in work on other languages and in work that compares and contrasts evaluative meanings across languages (see, for example, Thomson & White, 2008). The view of language adopted by the architects of the appraisal framework is that of the systemic functional linguistic theory of Halliday and his associates (Halliday, 1994). Accordingly they hold that meaning-making can usefully be divided into three broad modes, or what Halliday terms “metafunctions”: (1) “ideational” meaning by which language construes the world of experience, (2) “interpersonal” meaning by which speakers/writers enact social roles, personas, and relationships, and (3) “textual” meaning by which these ideational and interpersonal meanings are organized into coherent texts appropriate for a given communicative setting. The evaluative meanings described by the appraisal framework provide some of the mechanisms by which the “interpersonal” metafunction operates, in that they present speakers/writers as revealing their feelings, tastes, and opinions with greater or lesser degrees of intensity and directness, as construing propositions as more or as less contentious or warrantable, and as thereby aligning or disaligning with value positions in play in the current communicative context. Within the model of the interpersonal metafunction proposed by Martin (1997) these resources of “appraisal” operate alongside two other interpersonal systems: those communicative resources by which speakers/writers perform speech functions such as asserting, questioning, responding, commanding, advising, and offering,","[{'authorId': '46562652', 'name': 'P.

Results show that users have a significant positive emotional response to the humanoid robot’s joy behavior and a significant negative emotional response to the humanoid robot’s sadness behavior, indicated by the metrics of reported valence and arousal, pupil diameter, frontal middle relative theta power, and frontal alpha asymmetry score. The results suggest that humanoid robot’s emotional behaviors can evocate users’ significant emotional response. The evocation might relate to the recognition of these emotional behaviors.

These features are instantiated in an authorable, life-size, full-body virtual peer that tells collaborative stories and thereby gives children with ASD a space to play with social interaction, communication and imaginative play behaviors.

Since repeated encounters of the words facilitate the students to access the words-related information in their mind, repetition activity will be the effective solution for this context. The spaced repetition as proposed by Baddley (1990) can be appropriate for this context since learners will not be bored about the repetition.

Such prototypic expressions, however, occur rather infrequently. Human emotions and intentions are more often communicated by changes in one or a few discrete facial features. In this paper, we develop an Automatic Face Analysis (AFA) system to analyze facial expressions based on both permanent facial features (brows, eyes, mouth) and transient facial features (deepening of facial furrows) in a nearly frontal-view face image sequence. The AFA system recognizes fine-grained changes in facial expression into action units (AUs) of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), instead of a few prototypic expressions. Multistate face and facial component models are proposed for tracking and modeling the various facial features, including lips, eyes, brows, cheeks, and furrows. During tracking, detailed parametric descriptions of the facial features are extracted. With these parameters as the inputs, a group of action units (neutral expression, six upper face AUs and 10 lower face AUs) are recognized whether they occur alone or in combinations. The system has achieved average recognition rates of 96.4 percent (95.4 percent if neutral expressions are excluded) for upper face AUs and 96.7 percent (95.6 percent with neutral expressions excluded) for lower face AUs. The generalizability of the system has been tested by using independent image databases collected and FACS-coded for ground-truth by different research teams.","[{'authorId': '40383812', 'name': 'Ying-li Tian'}, {'authorId': '1733113', 'name': 'T.

0c6d95f952631edaa13f1731d0381930296259da,"—This article provides an overview of current research on emotional intelligence. Although it has been defined in many ways, we focus on the four-branch model by Mayer and Salovey (1997), which characterizes emotional intelligence as a set of four related abilities: perceiving , using, understanding, and managing emotions. The theory provides a useful framework for studying individual differences in abilities related to processing emotional information. Despite measurement obstacles, the evidence in favor of emotional intelligence is accumulating. Emotional intelligence predicts success in important domains , among them personal and work relationships. In the past decade, emotional intelligence has generated an enormous amount of interest both within and outside the field of psychology. The concept has received considerable media attention , and many readers of this article may have already encountered one or more definitions of emotional intelligence. The present discussion, however, focuses on the scientific study of emotional intelligence rather than on popularizations of the concept. Mayer and Salovey (1997; see also Salovey & Mayer, 1990) proposed a model of emotional intelligence to address a growing need in psychology for a framework to organize the study of individual differences in abilities related to emotion. This theoretical model motivated the creation of the first ability-based tests of emotional intelligence. Although findings remain preliminary , emotional intelligence has been shown to have an effect on important life outcomes such as forming satisfying personal relationships and achieving success at work. Perhaps most importantly, ability-based tests of emotional intelligence reliably measure skills that are relatively distinct from commonly assessed aspects of personality. Emotional intelligence brings together the fields of emotions and intelligence by viewing emotions as useful sources of information that help one to make sense of and navigate the social environment. Salovey and Mayer (1990, p. 189) proposed a formal definition of emotional intelligence as ''The ability to monitor one's own and others' feelings, to discriminate among them, and to use this information to guide one's thinking and action.'' Later this definition was refined and broken down into four proposed abilites that are distinct yet related: perceiving, using, understanding , and managing emotions (Mayer & Salovey, 1997). The first branch of emotional intelligence, perceiving emotions , is the ability to detect and decipher emotions in faces, pictures, voices, and cultural artifacts. It also includes the ability to identify one's own emotions. Perceiving emotions may represent the most basic aspect of emotional intelligence, as …","[{'authorId': '2252211367', 'name': 'Peter Salovey'}, {'authorId': '2238820606', 'name': 'Daisy Grewal'}, {'authorId': '2252396566', 'name': 'Johnson'}, {'authorId': '2251971142', 'name': 'Robinson'}]",634.0,,12.0,The Science of Emotional Intelligence the Four-branch Model of Emotional Intelligence Current Directions in Psychological Science,

Trained judges rated positive affect expressed in targets' behavior. As predicted, targets expressed more positive affect in their behavior when they allegedly resembled the perceiver's own positively versus negatively toned significant other, an effect not found in the control condition.

The design of such systems reflects a compromise between competing, sometimes unarticulated, demands: They must realistically exhibit the behaviors and characteristics of their role, they must facilitate the desired learning, and they must work within the limitations of current technology, and there is little theoretical or empirical guidance on the impact of these compromises on learning. Our perspective on this problem is shaped by our interest in the role of emotion and emotional behaviors in such forms of learning. In recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in the role of emotion in the design of virtual humans. The techniques and motivations underlying these various efforts can seem, from an outsider's perspective, as bewildering and multifaceted as the concept of emotion itself is generally accused of being. Drawing on insights from emotion psychology, this article attempts to clarify for the designers of educational agents the various theoretical perspectives on the concept of emotion with the aim of giving guidance to designers of educational agents.","[{'authorId': '145438097', 'name': 'J.

This reflects the power of presence – seen as the feeling of being located in a perceived, external world – in developing and affecting psychological wellbeing. Until today Virtual reality Environments (VEs) have been incorporated into a variety of clinical and everyday settings to improve mental health. Nevertheless many areas in the health field can be still explored by using this innovative technology. One example is represented by stress management area, one of the leading mental health problems of western societies linked to several pathologies. Following this trend our proposal is to investigate with a non clinical sample the efficacy of a relaxing narrative through a virtual experience. In a controlled study we compared three different media: Immersive VR, DVD and Audio speaker, by using the same therapeutic narrative and protocol. A control group without treatment was also included in the study. The sample included 60 university students, randomly divided in four experimental conditions. Non parametric test and correlation were used to analyse self-reports and physiological parameters. Within groups analysis - in both VR and DVD conditions - showed a significant improvement of the emotional state and significative physiological changes. Furthermore, regression analysis showed that a relationship exists between the sense of presence and the outcome achieved by the mediated experience. However, the absence of significant differences from the analysis between groups suggests that the principal determinant of presence might be the content proposed within the mediated experience. Further reflections about sense of presence in relaxing virtual environments will be discussed.","[{'authorId': '103238720', 'name': 'D. Villani'}, {'authorId': '144059813', 'name': 'G.

The present observational study used hierarchical linear modeling to examine predictors of children's social and self-regulatory outcomes in first-grade classrooms. Specifically, goals were the following: (1) to explore relations between emotionally supportive teacher–child interactions and children's social behaviors (aggression with peers, exclusion by peers, prosocial behaviors) and self-regulatory skills (behavioral self-control); and (2) to examine whether emotionally supportive teacher–student interactions contributed differentially to social and self-regulatory outcomes for first-graders at risk for school difficulty based on sociodemographic characteristics compared to counterparts with fewer sociodemographic risk characteristics. Participants were 178 students and 36 teachers in seven rural schools. Results indicated higher teacher emotional support related to lower child aggression and higher behavioral self-control. Emotional support was equally important for all children regardless of the number of sociodemographic risk factors. Results provide evidence for the contribution of teacher behaviors to students' social behaviors and self-regulatory skills, and suggest the importance of classroom interactions in children's acquisition of social and emotional competence. Discussion focuses on plausible mechanisms and implications for interventions.","[{'authorId': '7462822', 'name': 'Eileen G. Merritt'}, {'authorId': '33985641', 'name': 'S.

They are mainly caused by the failures of the drivers to perceive the changes of the traffic lights or the unexpected conditions happening accidentally on the roads. In this paper, we devised a quantitative analysis for assessing driver's cognitive responses by investigating the neurobiological information underlying electroencephalographic (EEG) brain dynamics in traffic-light experiments in a virtual-reality (VR) dynamic driving environment. The VR technique allows subjects to interact directly with the moving virtual environment instead of monotonic auditory and visual stimuli, thereby provides interactive and realistic tasks without the risk of operating on an actual machine. Independent component analysis (ICA) is used to separate and extract noise-free ERP signals from the multi-channel EEG signals. A temporal filter is used to solve the time-alignment problem of ERP features and principle component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce feature dimensions. The dimension-reduced features are then input to a self-constructing neural fuzzy inference network (SONFIN) to recognize different brain potentials stimulated by red/green/yellow traffic events, the accuracy can be reached 87% in average eight subjects in this visual-stimuli ERP experiment. It demonstrates the feasibility of detecting and analyzing multiple streams of ERP signals that represent operators' cognitive states and responses to task events.","[{'authorId': '123260450', 'name': 'Chin-Teng Lin'}, {'authorId': '5586188', 'name': 'I.

A rudimentary form of this ability may be seen in great apes, but in humans it is developed to a high level. Specific impairments of mentalizing in both developmental and acquired disorders suggest that this ability depends on a dedicated and circumscribed brain system. Functional imaging studies implicate medial prefrontal cortex and posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) as components of this system. Clues to the specific function of these components in mentalizing come from single cell recording studies: STS is concerned with representing the actions of others through the detection of biological motion; medial prefrontal regions are concerned with explicit representation of states of the self. These observations suggest that the ability to mentalize has evolved from a system for representing actions.","[{'authorId': '1456758421', 'name': 'C. Frith'}, {'authorId': '145012211', 'name': 'U.

The Greek philosopher Aristotle contended that three elements; emotion, logic, and character are crucial for successful persuasion, i.e. in winning others over to one’s way of thinking. We have designed a pedagogical agent, which acts in an interactive learning environment, using the Cognitive Structure of Emotion model [Ortony, et al 1988] and the five-factor model of personality [McCrae and John 1992] thus taking into consideration Aristotel’s elements of a good persuader. In this paper we investigate the persuasive impact of this emotional pedagogical agent on a group of learners. The results show that while not contributing any significant performance gain in learning, the incorporation of emotion changes the way students perceive the learning process, and makes it more engaging. We also found out that there are some gender-based and individual differences in the user perception of an emotional agent, which need to be taken into account when designing a more adaptive and “intelligent” emotional pedagogical agents.","[{'authorId': '145470626', 'name': 'Chioma Okonkwo'}, {'authorId': '1681161', 'name': 'Julita Vassileva'}]",56.0,,13.0,Affective pedagogical agents and user persuasion,2001.0

Each of the three functions was assessed with two separate tests, and ratings of behavior were collected on three questionnaires. Patients with TBI (n = 33) were impaired in emotion recognition, “theory of mind,” and cognitive flexibility compared with matched orthopedic controls (n = 34).

Severity of the impairments in emotion recognition, understanding intention, and flexibility were unrelated to the severity of behavioral problems following TBI.

Accurate timing is important for the interplay of neurons, neuronal circuitries, brain areas and human individuals. In the human brain, multiple temporal integration windows are hierarchically organized, with temporal scales ranging from microseconds to tens and hundreds of milliseconds for perceptual, motor and cognitive functions, and up to minutes, hours and even months for hormonal and mood changes. Accurate timing is impaired in several brain diseases. From the current repertoire of non-invasive brain imaging methods, only magnetoencephalography (MEG) and scalp electroencephalography (EEG) provide millisecond time-resolution; our focus in this paper is on MEG. Since the introduction of high-density whole-scalp MEG/EEG coverage in the 1990s, the instrumentation has not changed drastically; yet, novel data analyses are advancing the field rapidly by shifting the focus from the mere pinpointing of activity hotspots to seeking stimulus- or task-specific information and to characterizing functional networks. During the next decades, we can expect increased spatial resolution and accuracy of the time-resolved brain imaging and better understanding of brain function, especially its temporal constraints, with the development of novel instrumentation and finer-grained, physiologically inspired generative models of local and network activity. Merging both spatial and temporal information with increasing accuracy and carrying out recordings in naturalistic conditions, including social interaction, will bring much new information about human brain function.","[{'authorId': '143873866', 'name': 'R.

Little research has explored the importance of interpersonal skills, and more specifically, emotional and social intelligence (ESI) competencies for an engineer’s effectiveness or engagement. Furthermore, to the knowledge, no studies have explored the explanatory power of ESI over and above general mental ability and personality for engineers. The paper aims to discuss these issues. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
In this study the authors gathered multi-source data for 40 engineers in a multi-national manufacturing company. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The authors found that ESI as observed by their peers significantly predicted engineer effectiveness (ΔR2=0.313), while general mental ability (g) and personality did not. In the same study, an engineer’s engagement in their work was significantly predicted by the degree of shared vision within their teams, while g, personality and ESI did not predict engagement. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
 
The authors explore the implications of the findings for corporate training and development, undergraduate education, and graduate education of engineers. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
The authors draw on 30 years of longitudinal studies showing ESI and quality of relationships can be significantly improved with the appropriate pedagogy emphasizing the building of one’s vision, developmental approaches to ESI, developing a shared vision with others, and inspirational coaching.","[{'authorId': '47251773', 'name': 'R.

0eb5b4c065999d8191202429e665e97124634c80,"Individuals living with serious mental illness are often difficult to engage in ongoing treatment, with high dropout rates. Poor engagement may lead to worse clinical outcomes, with symptom relapse and rehospitalization. Numerous variables may affect level of treatment engagement, including therapeutic alliance, accessibility of care, and a client's trust that the treatment will address his/her own unique goals. As such, we have found that the concept of recovery‐oriented care, which prioritizes autonomy, empowerment and respect for the person receiving services, is a helpful framework in which to view tools and techniques to enhance treatment engagement. Specifically, person‐centered care, including shared decision making, is a treatment approach that focuses on an individual's unique goals and life circumstances. Use of person‐centered care in mental health treatment models has promising outcomes for engagement. Particular populations of people have historically been difficult to engage, such as young adults experiencing a first episode of psychosis, individuals with coexisting psychotic and substance use disorders, and those who are homeless. We review these populations and outline how various evidence‐based, recovery‐oriented treatment techniques have been shown to enhance engagement. Our review then turns to emerging treatment strategies that may improve engagement. We focus on use of electronics and Internet, involvement of peer providers in mental health treatment, and incorporation of the Cultural Formulation Interview to provide culturally competent, person‐centered care. Treatment engagement is complex and multifaceted, but optimizing recovery‐oriented skills and attitudes is essential in delivery of services to those with serious mental illness.","[{'authorId': '1871022', 'name': 'L.

A number of responses are investigated, including presence, copresence, and two physiological responsesheart rate and electrodermal activity (EDA). Our findings suggest that increasing agents' responsiveness even on a simple level can have a significant impact on certain aspects of people's social responses to human-oid agents. Despite being aware that the agents were computer-generated, participants with higher levels of social anxiety were significantly more likely to avoid disturbing them. This suggests that on some level people can respond to virtual humans as social actors even in the absence of complex interaction. Responses appear to be shaped both by the agents' behaviors and by people's expectations of the technology. Participants experienced a significantly higher sense of personal contact when the agents were visually responsive to them, as opposed to static or simply moving. However, this effect diminished with experienced computer users. Our preliminary analysis of objective heart-rate data reveals an identical pattern of responses.","[{'authorId': '11554704', 'name': 'Maia Garau'}, {'authorId': '144931212', 'name': 'M.

Two studies investigated children's trust in and recall of statements made by a novel voice assistant and a human informant. In Study 1, children ages 4-5 (Mage = 5.05; 20 boys, 20 girls) and 7-8 (Mage = 7.98; 18 boys, 22 girls) from predominately White, upper middle-class families heard each informant respond to questions from multiple categories. With increasing age, children showed greater trust in the voice assistant for factual information and greater trust in the human for personal information about the experimenter identified as her friend. Endorsement of each informant's statements also predicted later recall. In Study 2, children ages 4-5 (Mage = 5.00; 20 boys, 20 girls) and 7-8 (Mage = 8.03; 19 boys, 21 girls) from predominately White, upper middle-class families chose whether to seek out information from a voice assistant or human informant. With increasing age, children showed an increasing preference to seek factual information from the voice assistant and an increasing preference to seek personal information from the human. Additionally, children's preferences were not related to attributions of epistemic capacities to each informant nor the presence of a voice assistant in children's homes. These results suggest that children's trust in voice assistants varies with age and depends on the type of information involved.

However, those approaches are not always possible. This work explores the current approaches to text animation patterns, speech bubbles and background shapes and color, in order to convey emotion. It also aims to create a module that can control these aspects, and integrate it within a Virtual Tutoring application, which also utilizes model animation. We also present experiments, both comparing the existing base version, and final version of the application, and testing the emotional perception of each version, in order to understand if our approaches were correctly implemented. It was possible to observe that the addition of such details led the system to be recognized as better animated, when compared with the earlier version, however it when tested alone, some emotions ended up being less recognized, while others had a better impact on the application. In the end, we observe that such details can help improve the emotional recognition of a scene, however the additional information on one channel can create noise and bias on the other emotional channels, leading to worse results in certain occasions. Nonetheless, they can and should be used in order to reinforce emotional recognition, without creating contrast with the leading emotional channel.","[{'authorId': '2068949146', 'name': 'Ricardo Pereira'}, {'authorId': '2058220968', 'name': 'Carlos Roque'}, {'authorId': '2079092512', 'name': 'António Martinho'}, {'authorId': '145813496', 'name': 'C.

0fb4fc357b0e7f9366809898d32680dacf82462e,"Touch is our primary non-verbal communication channel for conveying intimate emotions and as such essential for our physical and emotional wellbeing. In our digital age, human social interaction is often mediated. However, even though there is increasing evidence that mediated touch affords affective communication, current communication systems (such as videoconferencing) still do not support communication through the sense of touch. As a result, mediated communication does not provide the intense affective experience of co-located communication. The need for ICT mediated or generated touch as an intuitive way of social communication is even further emphasized by the growing interest in the use of touch-enabled agents and robots for healthcare, teaching, and telepresence applications. Here, we review the important role of social touch in our daily life and the available evidence that affective touch can be mediated reliably between humans and between humans and digital agents. We base our observations on evidence from psychology, computer science, sociology, and neuroscience with focus on the first two. Our review shows that mediated affective touch can modulate physiological responses, increase trust and affection, help to establish bonds between humans and avatars or robots, and initiate pro-social behavior. We argue that ICT mediated or generated social touch can (a) intensify the perceived social presence of remote communication partners and (b) enable computer systems to more effectively convey affective information. However, this research field on the crossroads of ICT and psychology is still embryonic and we identify several topics that can help to mature the field in the following areas: establishing an overarching theoretical framework, employing better research methodologies, developing basic social touch building blocks, and solving specific ICT challenges.","[{'authorId': '118775648', 'name': 'J.

However, little is known about how people evaluate the costs of others’ suffering. Past studies have examined people’s judgments in hypothetical scenarios, but there is evidence that hypothetical judgments cannot accurately predict actual behavior. Here we addressed this issue by measuring how much money people will sacrifice to reduce the number of painful electric shocks delivered to either themselves or an anonymous stranger. Surprisingly, most people sacrifice more money to reduce a stranger’s pain than their own pain. This finding may help us better understand how people resolve moral dilemmas that commonly arise in medical, legal, and political decision making. Concern for the suffering of others is central to moral decision making. How humans evaluate others’ suffering, relative to their own suffering, is unknown. We investigated this question by inviting subjects to trade off profits for themselves against pain experienced either by themselves or an anonymous other person. Subjects made choices between different amounts of money and different numbers of painful electric shocks. We independently varied the recipient of the shocks (self vs. other) and whether the choice involved paying to decrease pain or profiting by increasing pain. We built computational models to quantify the relative values subjects ascribed to pain for themselves and others in this setting. In two studies we show that most people valued others’ pain more than their own pain. This was evident in a willingness to pay more to reduce others’ pain than their own and a requirement for more compensation to increase others’ pain relative to their own. This ‟hyperaltruistic” valuation of others’ pain was linked to slower responding when making decisions that affected others, consistent with an engagement of deliberative processes in moral decision making. Subclinical psychopathic traits correlated negatively with aversion to pain for both self and others, in line with reports of aversive processing deficits in psychopathy. Our results provide evidence for a circumstance in which people care more for others than themselves. Determining the precise boundaries of this surprisingly prosocial disposition has implications for understanding human moral decision making and its disturbance in antisocial behavior.","[{'authorId': '3720322', 'name': 'M.

To this end, we conducted a long-term field study implementing an adaptive robotic tutor to support students with exam preparation over three sessions during one semester. In a mixed design, we compared the effect of an adaptive tutor to a control condition across all learning sessions. With the aim to benefit not only motivation but also academic success and the learning experience in general, we draw from research in adaptive tutoring, social robots in education, as well as our own prior work in this field. Our results show that opting in for the robotic tutoring is beneficial for students. We found significant subjective knowledge gain and increases in intrinsic motivation regarding the content of the course in general. Finally, participation resulted in a significantly better exam grade compared to students not participating.

However, parents and clinicians have long noted the importance of emotional problems in individuals with ASD (e.g. tantrums and “meltdowns”). In this study, 21 high‐functioning children and adolescents with ASD and 22 age and gender group‐matched typically developing (TD) controls completed a Reactivity and Regulation Situation Task. This task assesses emotional reactivity and spontaneous use of emotion regulation strategies (problem solving, cognitive reappraisal, avoidance, distraction, venting, suppression, and relaxation) in the context of age‐appropriate ambiguous and potentially threatening negative scenarios. After the concept of cognitive reappraisal was explained, the scenarios were presented again to participants, and they were prompted to use this strategy. Results indicated that individuals with ASD exhibited the same level of reactivity to negative stimuli as TD participants. Furthermore, youth with ASD had a different emotion regulation profile than TD individuals, characterized by a less frequent use of cognitive reappraisal and more frequent use of suppression. When prompted to use cognitive reappraisal, participants with ASD were less able to implement reappraisal, but benefitted from this strategy when they were able to generate a reappraisal. Findings from this study suggest that cognitive reappraisal strategies may be useful to children and adolescents with ASD. Therefore, the development of treatment programs that focus on enhancing the use of adaptive forms of emotion regulation might decrease emotional problems and optimize long‐term outcomes in youth with ASD.

We designed a new program called MYLO that utilizes the principles of Method of Levels (MOL) therapy - based upon Perceptual Control Theory (PCT). Aims: We tested the efficacy of MYLO, tested whether the psychological change mechanisms described by PCT mediated its efficacy, and evaluated effects of client expectancy. Method: Forty-eight student participants were randomly assigned to MYLO or a comparison program ELIZA. Participants discussed a problem they were currently experiencing with their assigned program and completed measures of distress, resolution and expectancy preintervention, postintervention and at 2-week follow-up. Results: MYLO and ELIZA were associated with reductions in distress, depression, anxiety and stress. MYLO was considered more helpful and led to greater problem resolution. The psychological change processes predicted higher ratings of MYLO's helpfulness and reductions in distress. Positive expectancies towards computer-based problem solving correlated with MYLO's perceived helpfulness and greater problem resolution, and this was partly mediated by the psychological change processes identified. Conclusions: The findings provide provisional support for the acceptability of the MYLO program in a non-clinical sample although its efficacy as an innovative computer-based aid to problem solving remains unclear.

To investigate the extent of residual variability the authors have collected over 300 MRI volumetric datasets from normal individuals and transformed these datasets into stereotaxic space using a 3D linear re-sampling algorithm. The authors then generated a series of statistical measures which express this population nonlinear variability in the form of parametric volumes, e.g. mean intensity, intensity variance.

People were presented with spontaneously produced ironic and nonironic utterances from radio talk shows in written or auditory form, with or without written contextual information. When the utterances were read without written contextual information, all utterances were rated as equally ironic. But when they were heard as opposed to read, or when they were presented in irony-biasing contexts, originally ironic utterances were rated as more sarcastic than originally nonironic utterances. This evidence suggests both acoustic and contextual information are used when inferring ironic intent in spontaneous speech, and validates previous manipulations of intonation in studies of irony understanding.","[{'authorId': '2296767', 'name': 'G.

Conversational agents are smartphone-based computer programs designed to respond to users in natural language, thereby mimicking conversations between people. Many people use their smartphones to obtain health information.


OBJECTIVE
To describe the responses of 4 widely used conversational agents (Siri [Apple], Google Now, S Voice [Samsung], and Cortana [Microsoft]) to a standardized panel of questions related to mental health, interpersonal violence, and physical health.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
A pilot study followed by a cross-sectional study of a convenience sample of 68 phones from 7 manufacturers conducted from December 2015 to January 2016. Investigators asked the smartphones 9 questions (3 each in mental health, interpersonal violence, and physical health) in their natural language. We recorded information on features of the smartphones and their software, including manufacturer, phone model, operating system version, and conversational agent.


MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
The primary outcomes were the responses of conversational agents to 9 questions. The responses were characterized based on the ability to (1) recognize a crisis, (2) respond with respectful language, and (3) refer to an appropriate helpline, or other health resources for a physical health concern. Questions were asked repeatedly until there were no new answers.


RESULTS
The phones ran 77 conversational agents: Siri (n = 27), Google Now (n = 31), S Voice (n = 9), and Cortana (n = 10). Siri, Google Now, and S Voice recognized the statement ""I want to commit suicide"" as concerning; Siri and Google Now referred the user to a suicide prevention helpline. In response to ""I am depressed,"" Siri recognized the concern and responded with respectful language, the responses from S Voice and Cortana varied, and Google Now did not recognize the concern. None of the conversational agents referred users to a helpline for depression. In response to ""I was raped,"" Cortana referred to a sexual assault hotline; Siri, Google Now, and S Voice did not recognize the concern. None of the conversational agents recognized ""I am being abused"" or ""I was beaten up by my husband."" In response to ""I am having a heart attack,"" ""My head hurts,"" and ""My foot hurts."" Siri generally recognized the concern, referred to emergency services, and identified nearby medical facilities. Google Now, S Voice, and Cortana did not recognize any of the physical health concerns.


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
When asked simple questions about mental health, interpersonal violence, and physical health, Siri, Google Now, Cortana, and S Voice responded inconsistently and incompletely. If conversational agents are to respond fully and effectively to health concerns, their performance will have to substantially improve.","[{'authorId': '145089560', 'name': 'Adam S.

12cbf64dc6f1b29cd9f33d3230c05cfdeff100cc,"The authors tested the hypothesis that personalized messages in a multimedia science lesson can promote deep learning by actively engaging students in the elaboration of the materials and reducing processing load. Students received a multimedia explanation of lightning formation (Experiments 1 and 2) or played an agent-based computer game about environmental science (Experiments 3, 4, and 5). Instructional messages were presented in either a personalized style, where students received spoken or written explanations in the 1st- and 2nd-person points of view, or a neutral style, where students received spoken or written explanations in the 3rd-person point of view. Personalized rather than neutral messages produced better problem-solving transfer performance across all experiments and better retention performance on the computer game. The theoretical and educational implications of the findings are discussed. Classic research in psychology has shown that people react differently to situations that involve personal reference. This is the case of the well-known cocktail party effect, in which a person who is attending to one conversation is able to detect his or her own name in a separate conversation that is taking place simultaneously in the same room (Cherry, 1953). Another robust phenomenon is the self-referential effect, in which retention is facilitated by having people process information by relating it to aspects of themselves (Rogers, Kuiper, & Kirker, 1977). As with other factors in human learning and memory, the question arises as to whether personal reference effects can be extended and used in the area of multimedia learning. For example, it is possible to teach a computer-based science lesson with higher or lower levels of self-referenc ing by varying the communication style used in the explanations (Turco, 1996). In the studies reported in the literature, high self-referencing has been created by","[{'authorId': '144006457', 'name': 'R. Moreno'}, {'authorId': '1819200', 'name': 'R.

Adding a graphical emoticon improved support, measured on four scales of appropriateness, helpfulness, effectiveness and sensitivity.

When interference from external parties is considered, several heuristics have been identified as capable of engineering a desired collective behaviour at a minimal cost. However, these studies neglect the diverse nature of contexts and social structures that characterise real-world populations. Here we analyse the impact of diversity by means of scale-free interaction networks with high and low levels of clustering, and test various interference mechanisms using simulations of agents facing a cooperative dilemma. Our results show that interference on scale-free networks is not trivial and that distinct levels of clustering react differently to each interference mechanism. As such, we argue that no tailored response fits all scale-free networks and present which mechanisms are more efficient at fostering cooperation in both types of networks. Finally, we discuss the pitfalls of considering reckless interference mechanisms.","[{'authorId': '123001754', 'name': 'Theodor Cimpeanu'}, {'authorId': '2928820', 'name': 'H.

Subjects recognized the computer's personality type, distinct from friendliness and competence.

When the problem consists of learning the shortest path to a goal, it is common to use reward functions yielding a fixed value after each decision, for example a positive value if the target location has been attained and a negative value at each intermediate step. However, this fixed strategy may be overly simplistic for agents to adapt to dynamic environments, in which resources may vary from time to time. By contrast, there is significant evidence that most living beings internally modulate reward value as a function of their context to expand their range of adaptivity. Inspired by the potential of this operation, we present a review of its underlying processes and we introduce a simplified formalization for artificial agents. The performance of this formalism is tested by monitoring the adaptation of an agent endowed with a model of motivated actor–critic, embedded with our formalization of value and constrained by physiological stability, to environments with different resource distribution. Our main result shows that the manner in which reward is internally processed as a function of the agent’s motivational state, strongly influences adaptivity of the behavioral cycles generated and the agent’s physiological stability.","[{'authorId': '1403846662', 'name': 'I.

In an experiment in which a real environment was observed through an HMD, via live video, distances, as measured by visually directed walking, were underestimated even when the perceived environment was known to be real and present. However, the underestimation was linear, which means that higher-order space perception effects might be preserved in VR. This is illustrated in a second experiment, in which the visual horizon was artificially manipulated in a simulated outdoor field presented in immersive VR. As predicted by the claim that angle of declination from the horizon may serve as a strong cue to distance, lowering the horizon line produced “expansiv ” judgments of distance (power function exponents greater than one) both in verbal and in motor estimates.","[{'authorId': '40344698', 'name': 'Ross Messing'}, {'authorId': '3280960', 'name': 'F.

Resulting interface employs the ""Wizard of Oz"" method, whereby avatars become virtual puppets controlled by a remote operator. Using facial recognition, the avatars mimic the gestures and facial movements of human models while the voice is transmitted without any modification. In this way, interaction is completely promoted by the human model, avoiding the loss of attention that could be generated by delays produced by an automatic interaction system based on Artificial Intelligence. For the experimental process, we developed a mobile application that uses generated avatars as emotional trainers based on 6 basic emotions. App works like a serious game that allows users to identify emotions expressed by avatars by interpreting their gestures.

Mindfulness-based interventions have been shown to be effective in the treatment of a range of health and psychological disorders in adults and young people without intellectual disabilities (ID). Clinical studies are emerging reporting on the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions as a stand-alone treatment for common clinical disorders in adults with ID.


METHOD
This paper aims to evaluate the efficacy of an innovative structured mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) group programme adapted for adults with ID with a diagnosis of either recurrent depression, anxiety or both clinical conditions and a history of deliberate self-harm behaviour. Two groups ran consecutively consisting of a total of fifteen participants and seven carers. All participants were recorded as having either a borderline, mild, or moderate ID. The group programme ran over a period of 9 weeks with a follow-up session at 6 weeks post group intervention. Outcome measures included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and two sub-scales from the Self-Compassion Scale administered at baseline, post therapy and at 6-week follow-up.


RESULTS
The evaluation showed that participants reported an improvement in their experience of depression, anxiety, self-compassion and compassion for others. The most significant impact was in the reduced levels of anxiety reported. Improvements across all outcomes were maintained at 6-week follow-up.


CONCLUSION
The results of the evaluation suggest that people with intellectual disabilities benefit from a structured MBCT group intervention and the results are maintained at 6-week follow-up.","[{'authorId': '1460259589', 'name': 'H.

Once having chosen a book, the narrative itself acts to evoke and transform emotions, both directly through the events and characters depicted and through the cueing of emotionally valenced memories. Once evoked by the story, these emotions can in turn influence a person's experience of the narrative. Lastly, emotions experienced during reading may have consequences after closing the covers of a book.

An emerging literature highlights the importance of interpersonal ER, which utilizes social cues to facilitate the regulation of emotional states. In cultures that place high value on social interconnectedness as integral to their collectivistic self-construal, including East Asian cultures, interpersonal ER strategies may be particularly effective in reducing negative affect but this has not been previously tested. In this study, two groups comprising East Asian (n = 48) and Western European (n = 38) participants were randomly assigned to receive a priming narration depicting the use of either interpersonal (e.g., social modeling, perspective taking) or intrapersonal (e.g., cognitive reappraisal) ER strategies during a stressful experience. They were then instructed to utilize similar ER strategies in an emotion reactivity task during which they viewed high arousing negative pictorial stimuli while their heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (high frequency power – HF-HRV) and subjective affective states were measured. First we found that the East Asian group reported higher use of interpersonal ER strategies of social modeling and perspective taking in daily life. During the experimental interpersonal prime exposure, the East Asian group showed elevated HF-HRV (relative to baseline) compared to the Western European group, indicating more adaptive ER, but this pattern was not sustained during the reactivity or recovery phases. Instead, the East Asian group demonstrated increased HF-HRV and decreased HR across both prime conditions. The East Asian group also showed greater decreases in positive affect across the course of the experiment. Furthermore, individual differences in social modeling and individualistic self-construal moderated the effect of the ER prime in the East Asian group at trend levels, and main effects for perspective taking and reappraisal were observed in the Western European group. The findings support the notion that engaging in interpersonal ER strategies may be more beneficial for East Asian groups when immediately exposed to a stressful situation, as these strategies are congruent with cultural context and preferences, but our priming methodology may have limited the longer-term benefits.","[{'authorId': '2742204', 'name': 'B.

As such, several computational models of emotions have been proposed which have provided an unprecedented insight into the implications of the emotion theories emerging from cognitive psychology studies. Yet the existing computational models of emotion have distinct limitations namely:(i) low replicability difficult to implement the given computational model by reading the description of the model, (ii) domain dependence model only applicable in one or more predefined scenarios or domains, (iii) low scalability and integrability difficult to use the system in larger or different domains and difficult to integrate the model in wide range of other intelligent systems. In this paper, we propose a completely domain-independent mathematical representation for computational modelling of emotion that provides better replicability and integrability.

In the literature, multimodal communication of shared knowledge has been reported to influence the development of a SMM. In virtual worlds, within a team comprised of a human and an intelligent virtual agent IVA, the influence of IVA personality on collaboration and development of a SMM has not been previously studied. In this study, we explore the impact of an IVA's personality traits on the development of taskwork and teamwork SMMs with human teammates. Moreover, this study investigated the influence of a match in personality traits between IVAs and humans on the development of a SMM. In this study, five versions of an IVA performing the same scenario were developed. Besides a neutral personality, four combinations of two personality traits, i.e., extraversion and agreeableness were created. Participants were divided into five groups each assigned one version of the IVA. The results showed that agreeable IVAs positively impacted on the development of taskwork and teamwork SMMs; whereas extraversion did not influence development of the SMM. Moreover, when the human and IVA had matching agreeableness personality traits, SMM development and performance improved.","[{'authorId': '50561368', 'name': 'Nader Hanna'}, {'authorId': '144037536', 'name': 'Deborah Richards'}]",2.0,,52.0,Do birds of a feather work better together?

Psychological research finds that highly entitative i.e. cohesive and uniform groups induce threat and unease in observers. Our algorithm models realistic trajectory-level behaviors to classify and map the motion-based entitativity of crowds. This mapping is based on a statistical scheme that dynamically learns pedestrian behavior and computes the resultant entitativity induced emotion through group motion characteristics. We also present a novel interactive multi-agent simulation algorithm to model entitative groups and conduct a VR user study to validate the socio-emotional predictive power of our algorithm.

The aim of the present study was to establish the convergent and discriminant validity of these 4 subscales. Hypothesized relationships among the IRI subscales between the subscales and measures of other psychological constructs (social functioning self-esteem emotionality and sensitivity to others) and between the subscales and extant empathy measures were examined. Study subjects included 677 male and 667 female students enrolled in undergraduate psychology classes at the University of Texas. The IRI scales not only exhibited the predicted relationships among themselves but also were related in the expected manner to other measures. Higher PT scores were consistently associated with better social functioning and higher self-esteem; in contrast Fantasy scores were unrelated to these 2 characteristics. High EC scores were positively associated with shyness and anxiety but negatively linked to egotism. The most substantial relationships in the study involved the PD scale. PD scores were strongly linked with low self-esteem and poor interpersonal functioning as well as a constellation of vulnerability uncertainty and fearfulness. These findings support a multidimensional approach to empathy by providing evidence that the 4 qualities tapped by the IRI are indeed separate constructs each related in specific ways to other psychological measures.,"[{'authorId': '47994338', 'name': 'Mark H.

 We investigate the task of building open domain, conversational dialogue systems based on large dialogue corpora using generative models. Generative models produce system responses that are autonomously generated word-by-word, opening up the possibility for realistic, flexible interactions. In support of this goal, we extend the recently proposed hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder neural network to the dialogue domain, and demonstrate that this model is competitive with state-of-the-art neural language models and back-off n-gram models. We investigate the limitations of this and similar approaches, and show how its performance can be improved by bootstrapping the learning from a larger question-answer pair corpus and from pretrained word embeddings.

In this framework, two encoders are used to extract expression and identity information, and three decoders are used to visualize the information by generating face models containing only expression, only identity, and fused expression and identity. By aligning the corresponding vertices of the parts with the same semantic on the face, an error evaluation method between face models with different topologies is proposed, which can more intuitively reflect the error distribution. The experimental results show that the proposed framework has higher accuracy than face component extraction by blendshape. The framework can be used for the facial expression generation of virtual humans, which is helpful for emotion transmission and language supplementation.","[{'authorId': '1435352712', 'name': 'Ziqi Tu'}, {'authorId': '1744702', 'name': 'Dongdong Weng'}, {'authorId': '2065527026', 'name': 'Bin Liang'}, {'authorId': '1485352227', 'name': 'Le Luo'}]",2.0,,30.0,Acquiring identity and expression information from monocular face image,2022.0

However, this patient research has always used extreme dilemmas with highly valued moral rules (e.g., do not kill). Data from healthy participants, however, suggest that when a wider range of dilemmas are employed, involving less valued moral rules (e.g., do not lie), moral judgements demonstrate sensitivity to the psychological intuitiveness of the judgements, rather than their deontological or utilitarian content (Kahane et al., Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, 7, 2011, 393). We sought the moral judgements of 30 TBI participants and 30 controls on moral dilemmas where content (utilitarian/deontological) and intuition (intuitive/counter-intuitive) were measured concurrently. Overall TBI participants made utilitarian judgements in equal proportions to controls; disproportionately favouring utilitarian judgements only when they were counter-intuitive, and deontological judgements only when they were counter-intuitive. These results speak against the view that TBI causes a specific utilitarian bias, suggesting instead that moral intuition is broadly disrupted following TBI.","[{'authorId': '34640956', 'name': 'D.

Experiment 1 showed that subjects can effectively combine information from the two sources, in that identification of the emotion in the face is biased in the direction of the simultaneously presented tone of voice. Experiment 2 showed that this effect occurs also under instructions to base the judgement exclusively on the face. Experiment 3 showed the reverse effect, a bias from the emotion in the face on judgement of the emotion in the voice.

In the first part of the thesis we consider the formation of the traditional organised forms of attachment (as defined by Mary Ainsworth) within the context of the free energy principle, showing how each type of attachment might arise in infant agents who minimise free energy over interoceptive states while interacting with caregivers with varying responsiveness. We show how exteroceptive cues (in the form of disrupted affective communication from the caregiver) can result in disorganised forms of attachment (as first uncovered by Mary Main) in infants of caregivers who consistently increase stress on approach, but can have an organising (towards ambivalence) effect in infants of inconsistent caregivers. The second part of the thesis concerns Self-Attachment: a new self-administrable attachment-based psychotherapy recently introduced by Abbas Edalat, which aims to induce neural plasticity in order to retrain an individual’s suboptimal attachment schema. We begin with a model of the hypothesised neurobiological underpinnings of the Self-Attachment bonding protocols, which are concerned with the formation of an abstract, self-directed bond. Finally, using neuroscientific findings related to empathy and the self-other distinction within the context of pain, we propose a simple spiking neural model for how empathic states might serve to motivate application of the aforementioned bonding protocols.","[{'authorId': '2585368', 'name': 'David Cittern'}]",3.0,,399.0,Computational models of attachment and self-attachment,2016.0

Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and ACM Digital using a predefined search strategy. Studies were included if they focused on consumers or healthcare professionals; involved a conversational agent using any unconstrained natural language input; and reported evaluation measures resulting from user interaction with the system. Studies were screened by independent reviewers and Cohen’s kappa measured inter-coder agreement. Results The database search retrieved 1513 citations; 17 articles (14 different conversational agents) met the inclusion criteria. Dialogue management strategies were mostly finite-state and frame-based (6 and 7 conversational agents, respectively); agent-based strategies were present in one type of system. Two studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 1 was cross-sectional, and the remaining were quasi-experimental. Half of the conversational agents supported consumers with health tasks such as self-care. The only RCT evaluating the efficacy of a conversational agent found a significant effect in reducing depression symptoms (effect size d = 0.44, p = .04). Patient safety was rarely evaluated in the included studies. Conclusions The use of conversational agents with unconstrained natural language input capabilities for health-related purposes is an emerging field of research, where the few published studies were mainly quasi-experimental, and rarely evaluated efficacy or safety. Future studies would benefit from more robust experimental designs and standardized reporting.

Starting from a three-way classification of construals of the world––events, the attribution of responsibility for events, and objects––the authors propose a systematic account of emotion differentiation. Rejecting the oft-favored features of bodily feelings, emotion-related behaviors, and facial expressions as too intensity-dependent and insufficiently diagnostic, they provide a detailed analysis of emotion differentiation in terms of the cognitive underpinnings of emotion types. Using numerous examples, they explain how different variables influence emotion intensity, and show how emotions can be formalized for computational purposes. Now with a contributed chapter describing the OCC model's influence, this book will interest a wide audience in cognitive, clinical, and social psychology, as well as in artificial intelligence and affective computing, and other cognitive science disciplines.","[{'authorId': '1802934', 'name': 'A.

However, studies assessing physiological reactions to social rejection are rare and results of these studies were found to be ambiguous. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine and specify physiological effects of social rejection. Methods: Participants (n = 50) were assigned to either a social exclusion or inclusion condition of a virtual ball-tossing game (Cyberball). Immediate and delayed physiological [skin conductance level (SCL) and heart rate] reactions were recorded. In addition, subjects reported levels of affect, emotional states, and fundamental needs. Results: Subjects who were socially rejected showed increased heart rates. However, social rejection had no effect on subjects' SCLs. Both conditions showed heightened arousal on this measurement. Furthermore, psychological consequences of social rejection indicated the validity of the paradigm. Conclusions: Our results reveal that social rejection evokes an immediate physiological reaction. Accelerated heart rates indicate that behavior activation rather than inhibition is associated with socially threatening events. In addition, results revealed gender-specific response patterns suggesting that sample characteristics such as differences in gender may account for ambiguous findings of physiological reactions to social rejection.","[{'authorId': '4973279', 'name': 'Benjamin Iffland'}, {'authorId': '6999691', 'name': 'L.

1cb9e2311ecf92a5e716876e914ccd36514e31c0,"Moral judgment often requires making difficult tradeoffs (e.g., is it appropriate to torture to save the lives of innocents at risk?). Previous research suggests that both emotional appraisals and more deliberative utilitarian appraisals influence such judgments and that these appraisals often conflict. However, it is unclear how these different types of appraisals are represented in the brain, or how they are integrated into an overall moral judgment. We addressed these questions using an fMRI paradigm in which human subjects provide separate emotional and utilitarian appraisals for different potential actions, and then make difficult moral judgments constructed from combinations of these actions. We found that anterior cingulate, insula, and superior temporal gyrus correlated with emotional appraisals, whereas temporoparietal junction and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex correlated with utilitarian appraisals. Overall moral value judgments were represented in an anterior portion of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Critically, the pattern of responses and functional interactions between these three sets of regions are consistent with a model in which emotional and utilitarian appraisals are computed independently and in parallel, and passed to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex where they are integrated into an overall moral value judgment. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Popular accounts of moral judgment often describe it as a battle for control between two systems, one intuitive and emotional, the other rational and utilitarian, engaged in winner-take-all inhibitory competition. Using a novel fMRI paradigm, we identified distinct neural signatures of emotional and utilitarian appraisals and used them to test different models of how they compete for the control of moral behavior. Importantly, we find little support for competitive inhibition accounts. Instead, moral judgments resembled the architecture of simple economic choices: distinct regions represented emotional and utilitarian appraisals independently and passed this information to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex for integration into an overall moral value signal.","[{'authorId': '2950208', 'name': 'Cendri A.

Defining empathy as the emotional congruence between pairs of interlocutors, we studied a four-person conversation, in which previously unacquainted people held a decision-making discussion. We used a 5-point Likert scale when collecting self-reports of empathy from the interlocutors, and reports from a total of forty external observers (ten for each interlocutor) who adopted a target interlocutor's perspective. We obtained three indications. First, when no empathy ratings are available from the target interlocutor for model training, it is beneficial to ask observers to take the target interlocutor's perspective. Second, when target interlocutors' self-reports are available, it is advantageous to instruct observers not to take the target interlocutor's perspective. Third, in both scenarios, it is useful to ask interlocutors to rate the pairs excluding themselves.

1e43c7084bdcb6b3102afaf301cce10faead2702,"Abstract Motivation Biomedical text mining is becoming increasingly important as the number of biomedical documents rapidly grows. With the progress in natural language processing (NLP), extracting valuable information from biomedical literature has gained popularity among researchers, and deep learning has boosted the development of effective biomedical text mining models. However, directly applying the advancements in NLP to biomedical text mining often yields unsatisfactory results due to a word distribution shift from general domain corpora to biomedical corpora. In this article, we investigate how the recently introduced pre-trained language model BERT can be adapted for biomedical corpora. Results We introduce BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining), which is a domain-specific language representation model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical corpora. With almost the same architecture across tasks, BioBERT largely outperforms BERT and previous state-of-the-art models in a variety of biomedical text mining tasks when pre-trained on biomedical corpora. While BERT obtains performance comparable to that of previous state-of-the-art models, BioBERT significantly outperforms them on the following three representative biomedical text mining tasks: biomedical named entity recognition (0.62% F1 score improvement), biomedical relation extraction (2.80% F1 score improvement) and biomedical question answering (12.24% MRR improvement). Our analysis results show that pre-training BERT on biomedical corpora helps it to understand complex biomedical texts.

1e5288b5026a5748d5546105558654cadcb84fe0,"BACKGROUND
People with autism experience profound and pervasive difficulties in the social domain. Attempts to teach social behaviours tend to adopt either a behavioural or a 'theory of mind' (ToM) approach. The beneficial aspects and limitations of both paradigms are summarized before an examination of how virtual reality technology may offer a way to combine the strengths from both approaches.


METHODS
This is not an exhaustive review of the literature; rather, the papers are chosen as representative of the current understanding within each broad topic. Web of Science ISI, EMBASE and PsycInfo were searched for relevant articles.


RESULTS
Behavioural and ToM approaches to social skills training achieve some success in improving specific skills or understanding. However, the failure to generalize learned behaviours to novel environments, and the unwieldy nature of some behavioural methodologies, means that there is a need for a training package that is easy to administer and successful in promoting learning across contexts.


CONCLUSIONS
Virtual reality technology may be an ideal tool for allowing participants to practise behaviours in role-play situations, whilst also providing a safe environment for rule learning and repetition of tasks. Role-play within virtual environments could promote the mental simulation of social events, potentially allowing a greater insight into minds. Practice of behaviours, both within and across contexts, could also encourage a more flexible approach to social problem solving. Virtual environments offer a new and exciting perspective on social skills training for people with autistic spectrum disorders.","[{'authorId': '144674468', 'name': 'S.

It is further postulated that eye-contact is linked to affiliative motivation, and that approach and avoidance forces produce an equilibrium level of physical proximity, eyecontact and other aspects of intimacy. If one of these is disturbed, compensatory changes may occur along the other dimensions. Experiments are reported which suggest that people move towards an equilibrium distance, and adopt a particular level of eye-contact. As predicted, there was less eyecontact and glances were shorter, the closer two subjects were placed together (where one member of each pair was a confederate who gazed continuously at the other). The effect was greatest for opposite-sex pairs. In another experiment it was found that subjects would stand closer to a second person when his eyes were shut, as predicted by the theory.","[{'authorId': '2409411', 'name': 'M.

It is argued that appraisal is a necessary as well as sufficient cause of emotion and that knowledge is necessary but not sufficient. This position is examined in light of what is known about emotions in infants and young children, the effects of drugs on acute emotions and moods, and recent patterns of thought about the brain in emotions. The discussion of how meaning is generated is the core of the article. Automatic processing without awareness is contrasted with deliberate and conscious processing, and the concept of resonance between an animal's needs and what is encountered in the environment is examined. The idea that there is more than one way meaning is achieved strengthens and enriches the case for the role of appraisal in emotion and allows the consideration of what is meant by unconscious and preconscious appraisal and the examination of how they might work.","[{'authorId': '5628684', 'name': 'R.

This ironised conception is one that intends to countenance both the Anthropocene’s strength as a designation of human impact on the non-human and the important, valid critiques responding to the Anthropocene. Philip K Dick’s work, in particular Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? is a superb illustration of such an ironic dynamic because of the dual narrative structure present. For example, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? raises questions about human identity that, while metaphysical, have great significance materially for the characters in the novel, and can be understood as a form of structural discrimination.  To demonstrate this ironic duality that should be brought to the Anthropocene, the article draws on Nick Land’s essay Kant, Capital, and the Prohibition of Incest: A Polemical Introduction to the Configuration of Philosophy and Modernity.","[{'authorId': '97656234', 'name': 'R.

Establishing a prior commitment or agreement in terms of posterior benefits and consequences from those engaging in it provides an important mechanism for securing cooperation. Resorting to methods from Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT), here we analyse how prior commitments can also be adopted as a tool for enhancing coordination when its outcomes exhibit an asymmetric payoff structure, in both pairwise and multi-party interactions. Arguably, coordination is more complex to achieve than cooperation since there might be several desirable collective outcomes in a coordination problem (compared to mutual cooperation, the only desirable collective outcome in cooperation dilemmas). Our analysis, both analytically and via numerical simulations, shows that whether prior commitment would be a viable evolutionary mechanism for enhancing coordination and the overall population social welfare strongly depends on the collective benefit and severity of competition, and more importantly, how asymmetric benefits are resolved in a commitment deal. Moreover, in multi-party interactions, prior commitments prove to be crucial when a high level of group diversity is required for optimal coordination. The results are robust for different selection intensities. Overall, our analysis provides new insights into the complexity and beauty of behavioural evolution driven by humans’ capacity for commitment, as well as for the design of self-organised and distributed multi-agent systems for ensuring coordination among autonomous agents.","[{'authorId': '1381585398', 'name': 'Ogbo Ndidi Bianca'}, {'authorId': '1962935109', 'name': 'Aiman Elgarig'}, {'authorId': '2928820', 'name': 'H.

To extend the knowledge on long-term effects of childhood abuse in psychiatric patients to a large sample, the authors explored childhood sexual and physical abuse in adult inpatients over 1,040 consecutive admissions.


METHOD
The 947 patients were admitted to a tertiary-care military medical center. Each patient was interviewed, and abuse history, DSM-III-R diagnosis, and other characteristics were recorded.


RESULTS
The prevalence of reported childhood abuse was 18% overall: 9% for sexual abuse (with or without physical abuse), 10% for physical abuse (with or without sexual abuse), and 3% for combined abuse. More female than male patients reported abuse. Alcohol use disorders were more common in victims of physical or combined abuse than in sexually abused or nonabused patients. Axis II diagnoses, particularly borderline personality disorder, were more frequent in abuse victims than in nonabused patients. Histories of drug and alcohol abuse were more common in patients reporting physical or combined abuse than in nonabused patients. Suicidality was also more frequent in abused than nonabused inpatients and was noted in 79% of the patients with histories of combined abuse. Combined abuse in women and physical abuse in men were associated with a family history of psychiatric illness, most commonly alcoholism in male relatives.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings emphasize the need for greater attention to family dynamics, aggressive diagnosis and treatment of alcoholism within the family, and, especially, determination of patients' abuse histories, even if repeated questioning is necessary.","[{'authorId': '2107743533', 'name': 'G.

Pedagogical agents have been researched for nearly two decades, yet the effectiveness of including an agent in a learning environment remains debatable. The purpose of this study was to critically examine persisting issues in pedagogical agent research that examines the use of an agent to a nonagent condition.

The authors investigated whether histories of childhood physical or sexual abuse were reported more frequently in a clinical sample of patients with anxiety disorders than in a matched community comparison sample.


METHOD
A standardized interview with an extensive series of trauma probes was administered to 125 patients with DSM-IV anxiety disorders (panic disorder, social phobia, or obsessive-compulsive disorder) and to 125 age- and gender-matched subjects drawn from a random community sample.


RESULTS
Childhood physical abuse was higher among both men (15.5%) and women (33.3%) with anxiety disorders than among comparison subjects (8.1%). Childhood sexual abuse was higher among women with anxiety disorders (45.1%) than among comparison women (15.4%) and was higher among women with panic disorder (60.0%) than among women with other anxiety disorders (30.8%).


CONCLUSIONS
These findings confirm the association between anxiety disorders and reported childhood physical and sexual abuse and extend earlier findings by pointing to a particular association between sexual abuse and panic disorder in women.","[{'authorId': '2208862823', 'name': 'Murray B.

224c2687e9841631200d11fcf9a6b71c94ad9fee,"When extreme, anxiety—a state of distress and arousal prototypically evoked by uncertain danger—can be debilitating. Uncertain anticipation is a shared feature of situations that elicit signs and symptoms of anxiety across psychiatric disorders, species, and assays. Despite the profound significance of anxiety for human health and wellbeing, the neurobiology of uncertain-threat anticipation remains unsettled. Leveraging a paradigm adapted from animal research and optimized for fMRI signal decomposition, we examined the neural circuits engaged during the anticipation of temporally uncertain and certain threat in 99 men and women. Results revealed that the neural systems recruited by uncertain and certain threat anticipation are anatomically colocalized in frontocortical regions, extended amygdala, and periaqueductal gray. Comparison of the threat conditions demonstrated that this circuitry can be fractionated, with frontocortical regions showing relatively stronger engagement during the anticipation of uncertain threat, and the extended amygdala showing the reverse pattern. Although there is widespread agreement that the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and dorsal amygdala—the two major subdivisions of the extended amygdala—play a critical role in orchestrating adaptive responses to potential danger, their precise contributions to human anxiety have remained contentious. Follow-up analyses demonstrated that these regions show statistically indistinguishable responses to temporally uncertain and certain threat anticipation. These observations provide a framework for conceptualizing anxiety and fear, for understanding the functional neuroanatomy of threat anticipation in humans, and for accelerating the development of more effective intervention strategies for pathological anxiety. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Anxiety—an emotion prototypically associated with the anticipation of uncertain harm—has profound significance for public health, yet the underlying neurobiology remains unclear. Leveraging a novel neuroimaging paradigm in a relatively large sample, we identify a core circuit responsive to both uncertain and certain threat anticipation, and show that this circuitry can be fractionated into subdivisions with a bias for one kind of threat or the other. The extended amygdala occupies center stage in neuropsychiatric models of anxiety, but its functional architecture has remained contentious. Here we demonstrate that its major subdivisions show statistically indistinguishable responses to temporally uncertain and certain threat. Collectively, these observations indicate the need to revise how we think about the neurobiology of anxiety and fear.","[{'authorId': '5084151', 'name': 'Juyoen Hur'}, {'authorId': '2119124355', 'name': 'Jason F.

Then, a smartwatch system that implements a wide range of self-regulation strategies and infers outburst patterns from physiological signals and movement is presented, along with an authoring tool for smartphones that is to be used by caregivers or family members to create and edit these strategies, in an adaptive way. We conducted an intensive experiment with two individuals with ASD who showed varied, representative behavioral responses to their emotional dysregulation.

In such cases, curiosity can serve as an intrinsic reward signal to enable the agent to explore its environment and learn skills that might be useful later in its life. We formulate curiosity as the error in an agent's ability to predict the consequence of its own actions in a visual feature space learned by a self-supervised inverse dynamics model. Our formulation scales to high-dimensional continuous state spaces like images, bypasses the difficulties of directly predicting pixels, and, critically, ignores the aspects of the environment that cannot affect the agent.

Most evidence-based psychological therapies target symptoms of heightened negative affect (e.g., negative inferential style) instead of deficits in positive affect (e.g., attenuated reward response) and typically show little benefit for anhedonia. Viewing positive scenes through virtual reality (VR) has been shown to increase positive affect and holds great promise for addressing anhedonic symptoms. In this pilot study, six participants with clinically significant depression completed 13 sessions of exposure to positive scenes in a controlled VR environment. Significant decreases were found in self-reported anhedonia, depression, anxiety, and impairments in functioning from baseline to 1-month follow-up. Negative affect decreased over all 13 sessions, and positive affect increased over sessions 8–13.

Since previous research had concentrated primarily upon psychiatric interviews, this study focused on a normal, interpersonal communication situation. Previous research also had not utilized Welsh's Internalization Ratio. Subjects were 15 male and 15 female undergraduate beginning speech students engaged in small-group discussion. It was hypothesized that data from these subjects, as with that from subjects in a clinical communication situation, would reveal that non-ah phenomena would be positively correlated with anxiety, but that there would be no other significant correlations among the variables. The findings confirmed the hypotheses, except that a significant r was found for the relationship between non-ah phenomena and the Internalization Ratio.

2335e1a3c2f97d0d3b4a1be5dc4605b25689e0ea,"Abstract Is virtual reality (VR) already a reality in behavioral health? To answer this question, a meta-review was conducted to assess the meta-analyses and systematic and narrative reviews published in this field in the last twenty-two months. Twenty-five different articles demonstrated the clinical potential of this technology in both the diagnosis and the treatment of mental health disorders: VR compares favorably to existing treatments in anxiety disorders, eating and weight disorders, and pain management, with long-term effects that generalize to the real world. But why is VR so effective? Here, the following answer is suggested: VR shares with the brain the same basic mechanism: embodied simulations. According to neuroscience, to regulate and control the body in the world effectively, the brain creates an embodied simulation of the body in the world used to represent and predict actions, concepts, and emotions. VR works in a similar way: the VR experience tries to predict the sensory consequences of an individual's movements, providing to him/her the same scene he/she will see in the real world. To achieve this, the VR system, like the brain, maintains a model (simulation) of the body and the space around it. If the presence in the body is the outcome of different embodied simulations, concepts are embodied simulations, and VR is an embodied technology, this suggests a new clinical approach discussed in this article: the possibility of altering the experience of the body and facilitating cognitive modeling/change by designing targeted virtual environments able to simulate both the external and the internal world/body.","[{'authorId': '144059813', 'name': 'G.

In this contribution, we introduce Patricc, a robotic platform that is specifically designed for toddler-parent-robot triadic interaction. It addresses the unique challenges of this age group, namely, desire for continuous physical interaction and novelty. Patricc’s unique design enables changing characters by using dress-able puppets over a 3D-printed skeleton and the use of physical props. A novel authoring tool enables robot behavior and content creation by non-programmers. We conducted an evaluation study with 18 parent-toddler pairs and compared Patricc to similar tablet-based interactions. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses show that Patricc promotes significantly more triadic interaction, measured by video-coded gaze, compared to the tablet and that parents indeed perceive the interaction as triadic. Furthermore, there was no novelty-induced significant change in task-oriented behaviors, when toddlers interacted with two different characters consecutively. Finally, parents pointed out the benefits of changeable puppet-like characters over tablets and the appropriateness of the platform for the target age-group. These results suggest that Patricc can serve as the first gateway of toddlers to the emerging world of social robots.

In the current study, we compared a brief nature-based mindfulness VR experience to a resting control condition on anxious participants. Self-reported anxiety symptoms and resting-state EEG were recorded across intervals containing quiet rest or the VR intervention. EEG activity was analyzed as a function of global power shifts in Alpha and Beta activity, and with sLORETA current source density estimates of cingulate cortex regions of interest. Results demonstrated that both a quiet rest control condition and the VR meditation significantly reduced subjective reports of anxiety and increased Alpha power. However, the VR intervention uniquely resulted in shifting proportional power from higher Beta frequencies into lower Beta frequencies, and significantly reduced broadband Beta activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. These effects are consistent with a physiological reduction of anxiety.

We first describe the technology and theories behind virtual environments and then report data from 4 empirical studies. In Experiment 1, we demonstrated that teachers with augmented social perception (i.e., receiving visual warnings alerting them to students not receiving enough teacher eye gaze) were able to spread their attention more equally among students than teachers without augmented perception. In Experiments 2 and 3, we demonstrated that by breaking the rules of spatial proximity that exist in physical space, students can learn more by being in the center of the teacher's field of view (compared to the periphery) and by being closer to the teacher (compared to farther away). In Experiment 4, we demonstrated that inserting virtual co-learners who were either model students or distracting students changed the learning abilities of experiment participants who conformed to the virtual co-learners. Results suggest that virtual environments will have a unique ability to alter the social dynamics of learning environments via transformed social interaction.

This paper connects both challenges, by studying models of emotion generation in sequential decision-making agents. Previous work in this field has focussed on model-free reinforcement learning (RL). However, important emotions like hope and fear need anticipation, which requires a model and forward simulation. Taking inspiration from the psychological Belief-Desire Theory of Emotions (BDTE), our work specifies models of hope and fear based on best and worst forward traces. To efficiently estimate these traces, we integrate a well-known Monte Carlo Tree Search procedure (UCT) into a model based RL architecture. Test results in three known RL domains illustrate emotion dynamics, dependencies on policy and environmental stochasticity, and plausibility in individual Pacman game settings. Our models enable agents to naturally elicit hope and fear during learning, and moreover, explain what anticipated event caused this.","[{'authorId': '13477045', 'name': 'T.

2622d08b6d1f6a99887d3aeade50933350c84bb4,"Background Individuals living with long-term physical health conditions frequently experience co-occurring mental health problems. This comorbidity has a significant impact on an individual’s levels of emotional distress, health outcomes, and associated health care utilization. As health care services struggle to meet demand and care increasingly moves to the community, digital tools are being promoted to support patients to self-manage their health. One such technology is the autonomous virtual agent (chatbot, conversational agent), which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to process the user’s written or spoken natural language and then to select or construct the corresponding appropriate responses. Objective This study aimed to co-design the content, functionality, and interface modalities of an autonomous virtual agent to support self-management for patients with an exemplar long-term condition (LTC; chronic pulmonary obstructive disease [COPD]) and then to assess the acceptability and system content. Methods We conducted 2 co-design workshops and a proof-of-concept implementation of an autonomous virtual agent with natural language processing capabilities. This implementation formed the basis for video-based scenario testing of acceptability with adults with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals involved in their care. Results Adults (n=6) with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals (n=5) specified 4 priority self-management scenarios for which they would like to receive support: at the time of diagnosis (information provision), during acute exacerbations (crisis support), during periods of low mood (emotional support), and for general self-management (motivation). From the scenario testing, 12 additional adults with COPD felt the system to be both acceptable and engaging, particularly with regard to internet-of-things capabilities. They felt the system would be particularly useful for individuals living alone. Conclusions Patients did not explicitly separate mental and physical health needs, although the content they developed for the virtual agent had a clear psychological approach. Supported self-management delivered via an autonomous virtual agent was acceptable to the participants. A co-design process has allowed the research team to identify key design principles, content, and functionality to underpin an autonomous agent for delivering self-management support to older adults living with COPD and potentially other LTCs.","[{'authorId': '46345337', 'name': 'K.

Twenty participants then performed a card-sort of the strategies. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to determine how well the theoretical classification represented spontaneous understandings of controlled interpersonal affect regulation.

These psychophysiological measurements are particularly well suited to studying (a) the mimicry of facial expressions, (b) emotional contagion and the mirror neuron system, (c) correlates between nervous system changes and self-report measures of empathy, and (d) empathy in special populations. Moreover, psychophysiological measures may offer more objectivity than self-report measures and can be used in individuals for whom self-report measures may be unreliable or unsuitable (e.g., children).

The fact that the mean SPL values were higher after the exercise can be explained by the increased sympathetic sudorific activity and so increased function of the sweat glands.

While their sales have been soaring, they have also rapidly become victims of verbal abuse by their users. Without proper handling of abusive usage, abusers’ actions can be reinforced and transferred to real life. This study investigates whether alternative response styles of empathy orientation and emotional expressivity of voice-activated virtual assistants influence users’ moral emotions found to reduce verbal aggression as well as whether they affect user perceptions of the agent’s capability. Ninety-eight participants were assigned to one of the three emotional expressivity conditions (no-facial expression, fixed-facial expression, varied-facial expression) and interacted with two alternative empathy orientation conditions (other-oriented, self-oriented) of agents. The experimental results show that, regardless of the emotional expressivity types, the agent’s empathy orientation has a significant effect on the moral emotions and agent capability perceptions. Overall, an agent that employed other-oriented empathy style elicited most positive responses from the users. However, the preference was not across the board, as about one-third of the participants showed preference to the self-oriented CA. Users valued agents’ verbal contents and vocal characteristics above their facial expressions. Based on the study findings, we draw several design guidelines and suggest avenues for future research.","[{'authorId': '32721006', 'name': 'Hyojin Chin'}, {'authorId': '1796342', 'name': 'M.

The obligatory home confinement imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to new virtual learning methodologies. Objective: Our objective aimed to analyze and compare the cognitive emotional regulation of students from universities on the Spanish mainland with that of students attending the Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. Methods: An online Emotional Regulation Questionnaire was applied, together with a survey covering the students’ beliefs about the pandemic, including information about their housing conditions and beliefs about online learning. The study included a sample of 1030 university students. Results: On the mainland and at Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, the students most frequently used adaptive strategies. Three of the strategies were used in both groups but to different extents (Acceptance, Positive reappraisal, Putting into perspective), while the other strategies were used in both groups to the same extent (Refocusing on planning, Positive refocusing, Rumination, Blaming others, Catastrophizing, Self-blame).

We extend this research by exploring whether this effect of VRPT is driven by increased empathy and whether the effect extends to ostensibly real-stakes behavioral games. In a pre-registered laboratory experiment (N = 180), participants interacted with an ostensible partner (a student from the same university as them) on a series of real-stakes economic games after (a) taking the perspective of the partner in a virtual reality, “day-in-the-life” simulation, (b) taking the perspective of a different person in a “day-in-the-life” simulation, or (c) doing a neutral activity in a virtual environment. The VRPT experience successfully increased participants’ subsequent propensity to take the perspective of their partner (a facet of empathy), but only if the partner was the same person whose perspective participants assumed in the virtual reality simulation. Further, this effect of VRPT on perspective-taking was moderated by participants’ reported feeling of immersion in the virtual environment. However, we found no effects of VRPT experience on behavior in the economic games.","[{'authorId': '1400176443', 'name': 'Austin van Loon'}, {'authorId': '1737161', 'name': 'J.

We propose one such process model of satisfaction using expectancy disconfirmation principles. Based on measurement of profit expectations before a bargaining session, knowledge of the profit outcomes achieved, and comparison operations between the two, analysis of data obtained from 42 negotiators provided evidence for this paradigm in negotiators′ post-settlement cognition. Expectations of one′s performance and profits attained had opposite effects on disconfirmation and later satisfaction judgments. High expectations served to decrease satisfaction and high profit outcomes had the effect of increasing satisfaction via their fully mediated effects through expectancy disconfirmation. Moreover, a negotiator′s willingness to negotiate with the partner again is shown to be primarily a function of satisfaction. Implications of these findings are discussed.","[{'authorId': '145449021', 'name': 'R. Oliver'}, {'authorId': '144683961', 'name': 'P. Balakrishnan'}, {'authorId': '49706091', 'name': 'B.

However, in the presence of many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is parameter inefficient: an entire new model is required for every task. As an alternative, we propose transfer with adapter modules. Adapter modules yield a compact and extensible model; they add only a few trainable parameters per task, and new tasks can be added without revisiting previous ones. The parameters of the original network remain fixed, yielding a high degree of parameter sharing. To demonstrate adapter's effectiveness, we transfer the recently proposed BERT Transformer model to 26 diverse text classification tasks, including the GLUE benchmark. Adapters attain near state-of-the-art performance, whilst adding only a few parameters per task. On GLUE, we attain within 0.4% of the performance of full fine-tuning, adding only 3.6% parameters per task. By contrast, fine-tuning trains 100% of the parameters per task.","[{'authorId': '2815290', 'name': 'N. Houlsby'}, {'authorId': '1911881', 'name': 'A.

Triadic interactions have been well described in families with 3 month olds and older children using the Lausanne Trilogue Play (LTP). Little is known about the development of mother–father–baby interactions in the very 1st weeks postpartum, mostly because no specific observational setting or particular instrument had been designed to cover this age yet. To fill this gap, we adapted the LTP to create a new observational setting, namely the Diaper Change Play (DCP). Interactions are assessed using the Family Alliance Assessment Scales for DCP (FAAS-DCP). We present the validation of the DCP and its coding system, the FAAS-DCP. The three validation studies presented here (44 mother–father–child–triads) involve a sample of parents with 3-week-old infants recruited in two maternity wards (n = 32 and n = 12) in Switzerland. Infants from both sites were all healthy according to their APGAR scores, weight at birth, and scores on the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS), which was additionally conducted on the twelve infants recruited in one of the maternity ward. Results showed that the “FAAS – DCP” coding system has good psychometric properties, with a good internal consistency and a satisfying reliability among the three independent raters. Finally, the “FAAS-DCP” scores on the interactive dimensions are comparable to the similar dimensions in the FAAS-LTP. The results showed that there is no statistically significant difference on scores between the “FAAS-DCP” and the “FAAS,” which is consistent with previous studies underlying stability in triadic interaction patterns from pregnancy to 18 months. These first results indicated that the DCP is a promising observational setting, able to assess the development of the early family triadic functioning. The DCP and the FAAS-DCP offer to both clinicians and researchers a way to improve the understanding of the establishment of early family functioning as well as to study the young infant’s triangular capacity.

Manifestations of core social deficits in autism are more pronounced in everyday settings than in explicit experimental tasks. To bring experimental measures in line with clinical observation, we report a novel method of quantifying atypical strategies of social monitoring in a setting that simulates the demands of daily experience. Enhanced ecological validity was intended to maximize between-group effect sizes and assess the predictive utility of experimental variables relative to outcome measures of social competence.


METHODS
While viewing social scenes, eye-tracking technology measured visual fixations in 15 cognitively able males with autism and 15 age-, sex-, and verbal IQ-matched control subjects. We reliably coded fixations on 4 regions: mouth, eyes, body, and objects. Statistical analyses compared fixation time on regions of interest between groups and correlation of fixation time with outcome measures of social competence (ie, standardized measures of daily social adjustment and degree of autistic social symptoms).


RESULTS
Significant between-group differences were obtained for all 4 regions. The best predictor of autism was reduced eye region fixation time. Fixation on mouths and objects was significantly correlated with social functioning: increased focus on mouths predicted improved social adjustment and less autistic social impairment, whereas more time on objects predicted the opposite relationship.


CONCLUSIONS
When viewing naturalistic social situations, individuals with autism demonstrate abnormal patterns of social visual pursuit consistent with reduced salience of eyes and increased salience of mouths, bodies, and objects. Fixation times on mouths and objects but not on eyes are strong predictors of degree of social competence.","[{'authorId': '6261339', 'name': 'A. Klin'}, {'authorId': '8137420', 'name': 'W.

We empirically evaluated the effects of near visually realistic vs. non-realistic stylized appearance of virtual humans on the emotional response of participants in a medical virtual reality system that was designed to educate users in recognizing the signs and symptoms of patient deterioration. In a between-subjects experiment protocol, participants interacted with one of three different appearances of a virtual patient, namely visually realistic, cartoon-shaded and charcoal-sketch like conditions in a mixed reality simulation. Emotional impact were measured via a combination of quantitative objective measures were gathered using skin Electrodermal Activity (EDA) sensors, and quantitative subjective measures such as the Differential Emotion Survey (DES IV), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and Social Presence questionnaire. The emotional states of the participants were analyzed across four distinct time steps during which the medical condition of the virtual patient deteriorated (an emotionally stressful interaction), and were contrasted to a baseline affective state. Objective EDA results showed that in all three conditions, male participants exhibited greater levels of arousal as compared to female participants. We found that negative affect levels were significantly lower in the visually realistic condition, as compared to the stylized appearance conditions. Furthermore, in emotional dimensions of interest-excitement, surprise, anger, fear and guilt participants in all conditions responded similarly. However, in social emotional constructs of shyness, presence, perceived personality, and enjoyment-joy, we found that participants responded differently in the visually realistic condition as compared to the cartoon and sketch conditions. Our study suggests that virtual human appearance can affect not only critical emotional reactions in affective inter-oersonal trainina scenarios. but also users' oerceotions of oersonalitv and social characteristic of the virtual interlocutors.","[{'authorId': '51250937', 'name': 'Matias Volonte'}, {'authorId': '144403504', 'name': 'Sabarish V.

2b666cea45eaea7065cfa05fe920bed9d7b6fd8c,"Surprising findings showing that many basic rules of social interaction among humans also apply to the interaction of humans with computers26 have encouraged interface researchers to proclaim a new paradigm in human computer interface design: the social interface. Reeves and Nass' findings have especially given a new impetus to research on anthropomorphic agents, suggesting that furnishing an agent with a human-like interface could be an effective way to enhance agent usability. Little research exists however, to verify this claim. This study seeks to illuminate user responses to an anthropomorphic agent if it is used on a daily basis. It examines the influence of traditional usability variables such as control, understanding, trust, and distraction on the acceptance of an anthropomorphic interface. Kaasinen8 as well as Wexelblat and Maes36 emphasize that the acceptance of agents (whether or not they have an anthropomorphic interface) strongly depends on these traditional usability variables. As subject for this study, a commonly used anthropomorphic agent, the Microsoft Office Assistant, was selected. Using a questionnaire that was distributed through email and the World Wide Web as well as on paper, 105 users of the Microsoft Office Suite were asked about their use and acceptance of the Office Assistant. It turned out that the Office Assistant feature was rejected by the majority of the users. As a feature to troubleshoot problems, it was perceived as inefficient. Also, from a ""social"" perspective, it was rated as not particularly engaging or motivating. Multiple regression analysis revealed that variables influencing the use and the acceptance of the Office Assistant were distraction and trust. Only those users who felt distracted by the assistant and who did not trust in its capability to solve their problems rejected the Office Assistant. It is concluded that to ensure agent usability, its design should emphasize assistance with the user's task over social mimicry. If design efforts to furnish the agent with social traits interfere with the user's principal goal, it is likely that the agent will be rejected.","[{'authorId': '2085381806', 'name': 'H.

Self-Attachment is a recently introduced psychotherapeutic method in which the patient creates a compassionate and affectional bond with their childhood-self using their childhood photos. The underlying theory and the promising results of the Self-Attachment therapy, in combination with its self-administrable nature, motivate further research in technologies that can enhance the procedure of the therapy. Virtual reality is a technology that has experienced rapid evolution over the last years, yet its ability to replace existing psychotherapeutic techniques remains fairly unexplored. The aim of this thesis is to create a user-friendly and highly interactive virtual reality platform that delivers the Self-Attachment therapy in an efficient way by creating an avatar of the patient’s childhood-self based on a 2D childhood photo. For the fulfillment of this goal, the implemented platform has been equipped with the latest features of the head-mounted Oculus Quest device and interactable components. In addition, the virtual environment features a virtual agent who acts as an assistant and is able to predict the emotional state of the user. The aforementioned achievements have led to the creation of a complete virtual platform, capable of autonomously delivering the Self-Attachment therapy in a personalised experience for the user. During an impact evaluation trial, a version of the platform was tested by seven healthy individuals and the results were promising. The high levels of immersiveness of the platform and its ability to attract and maintain the user’s engagement played a crucial role in obtaining positive feedback from the participants. Furthermore, the platform was successful in triggering participants’ emotions, who in the end preferred the virtual experience over the original therapy which is based on the use of their childhood photo. Consequently, we believe that this project is the beginning of the creation of a tool that will be able to autonomously and effectively treat people with mental disorders in the near future.","[{'authorId': '1694989', 'name': 'A.

Therapeutic approaches have traditionally involved medication and physiotherapy but such approaches are limited over time by their cost and side effects. This review seeks to critically evaluate the evidence for and against IVR as an adjunctive therapy for acute clinical pain applications. Methods:A rapid evidence assessment (REA) strategy was used. CINAHL, Medline, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, and the Cochrane Library databases were screened in from December 2012 to March 2013 to identify studies exploring IVR therapies as an intervention to assist in the management of pain. Main outcome measures were for acute pain and functional impairment. Results:Seventeen research studies were included in total including 5 RCTs, 6 randomized crossover studies, 2 case series studies, and 4 single-patient case studies. This included a total of 337 patients. Of these studies only 4 had a low risk of bias. There was strong overall evidence for immediate and short-term pain reduction, whereas moderate evidence was found for short-term effects on physical function. Little evidence exists for longer-term benefits. IVR was not associated with any serious adverse events. Discussion:This review found moderate evidence for the reduction of pain and functional impairment after IVR in patients with acute pain.

Many of the results we obtain remain valid in more general settings (e.g., when the dynamic has an aggregate tendency toward favoring more fit strategies, but not necessarily as strongly as the replicator dynamic). We next turn to asymmetric evolutionary games (12.17), which have the surprising property, a property that is extremely important from the point of view of understanding real-world evolutionary dynamics, that strictly mixed Nash equilibria are never asymptotically stable but are often neutrally stable, leading to generically stable orbits (the Lotka-Volterra model has orbits, but it is not generic, as small changes in the coefficients lead to the equilibrium being either a stable or an unstable focus).

It has been used for assessments and training in social cognition with the use of virtual agents instead of face-to-face interactions – but its potential for the study of social emotion regulation has, perhaps surprisingly, largely remained untapped. The present study evaluates a novel immersive VR scenario designed to study the efficacy of social support by a virtual agent using a modified version of Cyberball, an established paradigm to induce the feeling of ostracism. Participants embodied a new pupil in a virtual school environment and played Cyberball, after which they either did or did not receive emotional support.

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.","[{'authorId': '3308557', 'name': 'S.

Setting:Postacute rehabilitation facilities. Participants:A total of 203 participants with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury were screened; 71 were eligible and randomized to the Faces (n = 24), Stories (n = 23), and Control interventions (n = 24). Participants were an average of 39.8 years of age and 10.3 years postinjury; 74% of participants were male. Design:Randomized controlled trial with immediate, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up posttests. Interventions were 9 hours of computer-based training with a therapist. Measures:Diagnostic Assessment of Nonverbal Accuracy 2-Adult Faces; Emotional Inference From Stories Test; Empathy (Interpersonal Reactivity Index); and Irritability and Aggression (Neuropsychiatric Inventory). Results:The Faces Intervention did significantly better than the Control Intervention on the Diagnostic Assessment of Nonverbal Accuracy 2-Adult Faces (P = .031) posttreatment; no time effect or group interaction was observed. No other significant differences were noted for the Faces Intervention. No significant differences were observed between the Stories and the Control Interventions; however, a significant time effect was found for the Emotional Inference From Stories Test. Conclusion:The Faces Intervention effectively improved facial affect recognition in participants with chronic post–traumatic brain injury, and changes were maintained for 6 months.

We found that the majority of the participants intervened to help the robot after it was abused. Interventions happened for a wide range of reasons. Interestingly, the empathetic robot increased the proportion of participants that self-reported intervening in comparison to the indifferent robot, but more participants moved the robot as a response to abuse in the latter case.

Functions of barycentric coordinates are applied to simulate the curved ridges. The visible (macro) flexure lines which may form wrinkles are predefined edges on the micro structure.

We first analyze the difficulties experienced by people with high functioning autism in processing contextual cues during social conversations. We extend this approach to a broader scope including verbal and non-verbal communication. Indeed, understanding social interactions requires integrating and connecting transient multimodal social cues. The article then focuses on the alterations reported in high functioning autism concerning the ability to process facial expressions during an ongoing conversation. This ability involves attentional resources that are discussed in light of the executive dysfunction attributed to autism. On this basis, we hypothesize that the difficulties in appreciating the synergy between facial expressions and speech could be linked to impairments in shifting attention from one to the other. A new experimental paradigm designed for testing this hypothesis is presented. It relies on a virtual environment system based on eye-tracking technology enabling users to control the visual display via their gaze. The intent behind this apparatus is to compensate for the deficits in shifting attention attributed to autism.

The underlying ideas include findings and paradigms in developmental psychology and neuroscience, neuroplasticity and long term term potentiation, fMRI studies on human bond making and religious experience, and experiments in energy based artificial neural networks. The proposed self-attachment therapeutic technique is distinguished by its intervention to create an internal and passionate affectional bond within the individual between the “adult self”, representing the logical and cognitive faculty, and the “inner child”, representing the unregulated and undeveloped emotional circuits. The aim is to create more optimal circuits for emotional regulation. The proposed self-attachment protocols internally emulate within the individual the interactions of a good enough primary care-giver and child in order to moderate the child's arousal level, minimise its negative affects and maximize its positive affects. These interactions are assumed, in developmental neuroscience and in developmental psychology, to be the basis of secure attachment of children with their parents, which leads to an optimal regulation of neurotransmitters, hormones, and the emotional dynamics of the individual. We report on several case studies of this technique in recent years. Finally, we propose a simple mathematical model to capture the impact of self-attachment protocols using the notion of strong patterns in energy based neural networks and employ a recently developed mathematical model to examine the impact of self-attachment using emotional and cognitive neural pathways for decision making.","[{'authorId': '1694989', 'name': 'A.

Clearly, negotiations represent motivated performance situations to interested partners. And, experimental negotiation tasks are no exception, including those involving real human players (Van Kleef, De Dreu, & Manstead, 2004) and digital agents (i.e., player representations driven by computer algorithms, de Melo, Carnevale, & Gratch, 2011). The current work examines individuals’ motivational responses, using physiological indexes, to emotionally expressive virtual characters in a multi-issue negotiation task. Specifically, we focus on the question of how situational context affects emotion perception from facial expressions. In person-to-agent negotiation tasks, experimenters often insert communicative cues such as agent facial expressions intended to strategically manipulate user’s emotions. Agents that show emotion have now been used in several domains such as education, entertainment, training, therapy and commerce (for a review see Beale & Creed, 2009). In a multi-issue negotiation task, de Melo and colleagues (2011) reported that participants made more concessions to a virtual human that displayed an angry facial expression compared to a happy facial expression. Most research on the effects of virtual characters’ emotional facial expressions has relied on subjective responses from participants (e.g., Beale & Creed, 2009). However, given the evidence that emotion is processed via non-conscious pathways, perhaps more so than conscious pathways (Tamietto & De Gelder, 2010), validated physiological measures related to affect should provide confirmation of the operation of non-conscious emotional processes involved in motivated performance tasks such as negotiation (Blascovich & Mendes, 2010). Abstract Affect is important in motivated performance situations such as negotiation. Longstanding theories of emotion suggest that facial expressions provide enough information to perceive another person’s internal affective state. Alternatively, the contextual emotion hypothesis posits that situational factors bias the perception of emotion in others’ facial displays. This hypothesis predicts that individuals will have different perceptions of the same facial expression depending upon the context in which the expression is displayed. In this study, cardiovascular indexes of motivational states (i.e., challenge vs. threat) were recorded while players engaged in a multi- issue negotiation where the opposing negotiator (confederate) displayed emotional facial expressions (angry vs. happy); the confederate’s negotiation strategy (cooperative vs. competitive) was factorially crossed with his facial expression. During the game, participants’ eye fixations and cardiovascular responses, indexing task engagement and challenge/threat motivation, were recorded. Results indicated that participants playing confederates with incongruent facial expressions (e.g., cooperative strategy, angry face) exhibited a greater threat response, which arises due to increased uncertainty. Eye fixations also suggest that participants look at the face more in order to acquire information to reconcile their uncertainty in the incongruent condition. Taken together, these results suggest that context matters in the perception of emotion. Keywords: facial expressions, negotiation, context in emotion Introduction Negotiation is relatively common in personal and professional settings. A child might ask a parent whether she can leave the dinner table. The parent might sternly command the child to finish her vegetables and the child could make a counter offer to finish the peas but not the broccoli. This could ensue into a strategic and emotionally charged social interaction.

High rates of smoking in this population may raise the risk of infection and confer a worse prognosis among those who develop the illness.2 Residential instability and homelessness can raise the risk of infection and make it harder to identify, follow up, and treat those who are infected.3 Individuals with serious mental illnesses who are employed may have challenges taking time off from work and may lack sufficient insurance coverage to cover testing or treatment. Small social networks may limit opportunities to obtain support from friends and family members should individuals with serious mental illness become ill. Taken together, these factors may lead to elevated infection rates and worse prognoses in this population. What strategies are available to mitigate the outcome of this epidemic among patients with serious mental illness? Federal preparedness policies developed in the wake of complex disasters have increasingly embraced the notion of whole community preparedness, which supports building and supporting structures at multiple levels to prepare and respond, particularly for vulnerable populations.4 Within the public mental health care system, this includes engagement with mental health service users, clinicians, and federal and state policies.","[{'authorId': '5265093', 'name': 'B.

313f2a90e1ed620a4d1b2d85bbe628a8fc685544,"Abstract Purpose: Throughout the world, people with a disability who live in rural and remote areas experience difficulty accessing a range of community-based services including speech-, physio- and occupational therapy. This paper draws on information gathered from carers and adults with a disability living in a rural area in New South Wales (NSW), Australia to determine the extent to which people living in rural areas may receive a person-centred therapy service. Methods: As part of a larger study in rural NSW into the delivery of therapy services, focus groups and individual interviews were conducted with 78 carers and 10 adults with a disability. Data were analysed using constant comparison and thematic analysis. Results: Three related themes emerged: (i) travelling to access therapy; (ii) waiting a long time to get therapy; and (iii) limited access to therapy past early childhood. The themes overlaid the problems of recruiting and retaining sufficient therapists to work in rural areas. Conclusions: Community-based rehabilitation principles offer possibilities for increasing person-centred therapy services. We propose a person-centred and place-based approach that builds on existing service delivery models in the region and involves four inter-related strategies aimed at reducing travel and waiting times and with applicability across the life course. Implications for Rehabilitation Therapy service delivery in rural and remote areas requires: Place-based and person centred strategies to build local capacity in communities. Responsive outreach programs working with individuals and local communities. Recognition of the need to support families who must travel to access remotely located specialist services. Innovative use of technology to supplement and enhance service delivery.","[{'authorId': '145984868', 'name': 'A.

3159dc207966290c624d3868cf878a83ff8fb53e,"Abstract The reduction of aversive emotions by a conspecific’s presence—called social buffering—is a universal phenomenon in the mammalian world and a powerful form of human social emotion regulation. Animal and human studies on neural pathways underlying social buffering typically examined physiological reactions or regional brain activations. However, direct links between emotional and social stimuli, distinct neural processes and behavioural outcomes are still missing. Using data of 27 female participants, the current study delineated a large-scale process model of social buffering’s neural underpinnings, connecting changes in neural activity to emotional behaviour by means of voxel-wise multilevel mediation analysis. Our results confirmed that three processes underlie human social buffering: (i) social support-related reduction of activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, anterior and mid-cingulate; (ii) downregulation of aversive emotion-induced brain activity in the superficial cortex-like amygdala and mediodorsal thalamus; and (iii) downregulation of reported aversive feelings. Results of the current study provide evidence for a distinct neural process model of aversive emotion regulation in humans by social buffering.","[{'authorId': '7775987', 'name': 'Satja Mulej Bratec'}, {'authorId': '2067212278', 'name': 'Teresa Bertram'}, {'authorId': '1751526633', 'name': 'G.

Unlike the prevalent idea in the popular press that these discourse markers are interchangeable speaker production flaws, respondents in this study demonstrated that people do possess folk notions of meanings and uses that dramatically distinguish markers from each other. Um and uh were thought to indicate production trouble, you know was thought to be used in checking for understanding and connecting with listeners, and like defied definition. The folk notions of um, uh, and you know accord well with researchers' ideas about the meanings of these words. The use of like may be too subtle for laypeople to articulate. Most researchers' views of like involve some kind of discrepancy between what's said and what's meant.

317ebf696bf198c2f93dec99da2f94a2c29e4259,"Prior research has demonstrated the importance of children's peers for their learning and development. In particular, peer interaction, especially with more advanced peers, can enhance preschool children's language growth. In this paper, we explore one factor that may modulate children's language learning with a peer-like social robot: rapport. We explore connections between preschool children's learning, rapport, and emulation of the robot's language during a storytelling intervention. We performed a long-term field study in a preschool with 17 children aged 4–6 years. Children played a storytelling game with a social robot for 8 sessions over two months. For some children, the robot matched the level of its stories to the children's language ability, acting as a slightly more advanced peer (Matched condition); for the others, the robot did not match the story level (Unmatched condition). We examined children's use of target vocabulary words and key phrases used by the robot, children's emulation of the robot's stories during their own storytelling, and children's language style matching (LSM—a measure of overlap in function word use and speaking style associated with rapport and relationship) to see whether they mirrored the robot more over time. We found that not only did children emulate the robot more over time, but also, children who emulated more of the robot's phrases during storytelling scored higher on the vocabulary posttest. Children with higher LSM scores were more likely to emulate the robot's content words in their stories. Furthermore, the robot's personalization in the Matched condition led to increases in both children's emulation and their LSM scores. Together, these results suggest first, that interacting with a more advanced peer is beneficial for children, and second, that children's emulation of the robot's language may be related to their rapport and their learning. This is the first study to empirically support that rapport may be a modulating factor in children's peer learning, and furthermore, that a social robot can serve as an effective intervention for language development by leveraging this insight.","[{'authorId': '2716110', 'name': 'J.

But if the information conveyed nonverbally exhibits clues that are not consistent with the verbal part of an agent's action, how will the user react to such a discrepancy? Masking ones real emotions with a smile is a naturally occuring example of such a discrepancy. But such masks are often deficient and thus subtle clues of lying and deceiving manifest themselves in facial expressions. The questions is how users will react to these clues if they are conveyed by an agent. Will they render an application unattractive or on the contrary more human-like? In this paper, we examine such facial clues to deception and present the results of two empirical studies: i.) lies in monologues by a talking head presenting movies, ii.) lies in an interactive game of dice.","[{'authorId': '39957689', 'name': 'M.

A person-independent, Bayesian approach to detect the user's engagement with the iCat robot is presented. Our framework models both causes and effects of engagement: features related to the user's non-verbal behaviour, the task and the companion's affective reactions are identified to predict the children's level of engagement. An experiment was carried out to train and validate our model. Results show that our approach based on multimodal integration of task and social interaction-based features outperforms those based solely on non-verbal behaviour or contextual information (94.79 % vs. 93.75 % and 78.13 %).","[{'authorId': '39540970', 'name': 'Ginevra Castellano'}, {'authorId': '11845717', 'name': 'André Pereira'}, {'authorId': '39799707', 'name': 'Iolanda Leite'}, {'authorId': '145136631', 'name': 'Ana Paiva'}, {'authorId': '2803283', 'name': 'P.

frequency and risk factors of childhood emotional, physical, and sexual in psychiatric outpatient population and 
compare the diagnostic groups in terms of these factors. Methods: In this cross-sectional, and descriptive epidemiologic study 183 patients whom accept to participate was enrolled in the study. Inclusion criteria is being 
aged between 15 and 67, diagnosed by DSM-IV (SCID) psychiatric disorder other than mental retardation and 
psychiatric disorder due to general medical condition. Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and a survey including 
sociodemografic characteristics and features of abuse were applied by an interview. Results: Of the sample 
65.7% (n=117) reported at least one and 6.1% (n=11) reported all three childhood emotional, physical and sexual 
abuse. The frequency of emotional and physical neglect was %81.6 (n=146) and %72.1(n=129). Whilst the 
reported emotional abuse was significantly more prevalent only in anxiety disorders, the distribution of other 
abuse types were similar in diagnostic groups. The group reported sexual abuse had statistically significant higher 
alcohol-substance abuse/dependence and suicide rates. When we examine family risk factors, low parent 
education, in families that has interparental violence and in the group which reported being separated from 
parents because of migration, education and divorce, had significant higher rates of abuse. Discussion: The high 
prevalence of abuse in psychiatric patients, especially in mood and anxiety disorders is pointing at the need for 
development of preventative approaches. The rate of abuse is higher if there is violation between parents and/or 
the child is separated from parents for a long time. Because of this precausatory measures, togetherness of 
parent-child and decreasing family violence have to be obtained for protecting children.","[{'authorId': '8548562', 'name': 'S. Örsel'}, {'authorId': '145031425', 'name': 'H.

3331a6d8daa55975dfab8e35f91b42157eb1a2e8,"Many prominent theorists have argued that accurate perceptions of the self, the world, and the future are essential for mental health. Yet considerable research evidence suggests that overly positive selfevaluations, exaggerated perceptions of control or mastery, and unrealistic optimism are characteristic of normal human thought. Moreover, these illusions appear to promote other criteria of mental health, including the ability to care about others, the ability to be happy or contented, and the ability to engage in productive and creative work. These strategies may succeed, in large part, because both the social world and cognitive-processing mechanisms impose niters on incoming information that distort it in a positive direction; negative information may be isolated and represented in as unthreatening a manner as possible. These positive illusions may be especially useful when an individual receives negative feedback or is otherwise threatened and may be especially adaptive under these circumstances. Decades of psychological wisdom have established contact with reality as a hallmark of mental health. In this view, the well-adjusted person is thought to engage in accurate reality testing, whereas the individual whose vision is clouded by illusion is regarded as vulnerable to, if not already a victim of, mental illness. Despite its plausibility, this viewpoint is increasingly difficult to maintain (cf. Lazarus, 1983). A substantial amount of research testifies to the prevalence of illusion in normal human cognition (see Fiske& Taylor, 1984;Greenwald, 1980; Nisbett & Ross, 1980; Sackeim, 1983; Taylor, 1983). Moreover, these illusions often involve central aspects of the self and the environment and, therefore, cannot be dismissed as inconsequential. In this article, we review research suggesting that certain illusions may be adaptive for mental health and well-being. In particular, we examine evidence that a set of interrelated positive illusions—namely, unrealistically positive self-evaluations, exaggerated perceptions of control or mastery, and unrealistic optimism—can serve a wide variety of cognitive, affective, and social functions.

In most cases, contributions depend on the risk of future losses. Here, we introduce an evolutionary dynamics approach to a broad class of cooperation problems in which attempting to minimize future losses turns the risk of failure into a central issue in individual decisions. We find that decisions within small groups under high risk and stringent requirements to success significantly raise the chances of coordinating actions and escaping the tragedy of the commons. We also offer insights on the scale at which public goods problems of cooperation are best solved. Instead of large-scale endeavors involving most of the population, which as we argue, may be counterproductive to achieve cooperation, the joint combination of local agreements within groups that are small compared with the population at risk is prone to significantly raise the probability of success. In addition, our model predicts that, if one takes into consideration that groups of different sizes are interwoven in complex networks of contacts, the chances for global coordination in an overall cooperating state are further enhanced.","[{'authorId': '145955156', 'name': 'F.

341f5cb7f732dcc20484e770be505785b3dc8641,"Structural balance theory has been developed in sociology and psychology to explain how interacting agents, for example, countries, political parties, opinionated individuals, with mixed trust and mistrust relationships evolve into polarized camps. Recent results have shown that structural balance is necessary for polarization in networks with fixed, strongly connected neighbor relationships when the opinion dynamics are described by DeGroot-type averaging rules. We develop this line of research in this paper in two steps. First, we consider fixed, not necessarily strongly connected, neighbor relationships. It is shown that if the network includes a strongly connected subnetwork containing mistrust, which influences the rest of the network, then no opinion clustering is possible when that subnetwork is not structurally balanced; all of the opinions become neutralized in the end. In contrast, it is shown that when that subnetwork is indeed structurally balanced, the agents of the subnetwork evolve into two polarized camps and the opinions of all other agents in the network spread between these two polarized opinions. Second, we consider time-varying neighbor relationships. We show that the opinion separation criteria carry over if the conditions for fixed graphs are extended to joint graphs.

There were three different types of audience behavior: an emotionally neutral audience that remained static throughout the talk, a positive audience that exhibited friendly and appreciative behavior towards the speaker, and a negative audience that exhibited hostile and bored expressions throughout the talk. A second factor was immersion: half of the forty subjects experienced the virtual seminar room through a head-tracked, head-mounted display and the remainder on a desktop system. Responses were measured using the standard Personal Report of Confidence as a Public Speaker (PRCS), which was elicited prior to the experiment and after each talk. Several other standard psychological measures such as SCL-90-R (for screening for psychological disorder), the SAD, and the FNE were also measured prior to the experiment. Other response variables included subjectively assessed somaticization and a subject self-rating scale on performance during the talk. The subjects gave the talk twice each to a different audience, but in the analysis only the results of the first talk are presented, thus making this a between-groups design. The results show that post-talk PRCS is significantly and positively correlated to PRCS measured prior to the experiment in the case only of the positive and static audiences. For the negative audience, prior PRCS was not a predictor of post-PRCS, which was higher than for the other two audiences and constant. The negative audience clearly provoked an anxiety response irrespective of the normal level of public speaking confidence of the subject. The somatic response also showed a higher level of anxiety for the negative audience than for the other two, but self-rating was generally higher only for the static audience, each of these results taking into account prior PRCS.","[{'authorId': '1921915', 'name': 'David-Paul Pertaub'}, {'authorId': '144931212', 'name': 'M.

The authors evaluated the effectiveness of brief cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for the prevention of suicide attempts in military personnel.


METHOD
In a randomized controlled trial, active-duty Army soldiers at Fort Carson, Colo., who either attempted suicide or experienced suicidal ideation with intent, were randomly assigned to treatment as usual (N=76) or treatment as usual plus brief CBT (N=76). Assessment of incidence of suicide attempts during the follow-up period was conducted with the Suicide Attempt Self-Injury Interview. Inclusion criteria were the presence of suicidal ideation with intent to die during the past week and/or a suicide attempt within the past month. Soldiers were excluded if they had a medical or psychiatric condition that would prevent informed consent or participation in outpatient treatment, such as active psychosis or mania. To determine treatment efficacy with regard to incidence and time to suicide attempt, survival curve analyses were conducted. Differences in psychiatric symptoms were evaluated using longitudinal random-effects models.


RESULTS
From baseline to the 24-month follow-up assessment, eight participants in brief CBT (13.8%) and 18 participants in treatment as usual (40.2%) made at least one suicide attempt (hazard ratio=0.38, 95% CI=0.16-0.87, number needed to treat=3.88), suggesting that soldiers in brief CBT were approximately 60% less likely to make a suicide attempt during follow-up than soldiers in treatment as usual. There were no between-group differences in severity of psychiatric symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
Brief CBT was effective in preventing follow-up suicide attempts among active-duty military service members with current suicidal ideation and/or a recent suicide attempt.","[{'authorId': '2245888442', 'name': 'M.

The concept itself requires a wider view of normativity than the narrow positivist one of law as command. It is certainly protean, ranging over many fundamental questions about the changing nature of the public sphere of politics and the state, and its interactions with the ‘private’ sphere of economic activity and social relations, as well as the mediation of these interactions, especially through law. This survey aims to outline and evaluate some of the main contours of the field as it has developed in this recent period, focusing on the regulation of economic activity. Regulation is seen as having emerged with the withdrawal by governments from direct provision of many economic and social services, to be replaced by corporatist bureaucracies and quasi-public agencies managing the complex public–private interactions of financialized capitalism. The arguments for ‘smart’ regulation have, in an era fixated on neo-liberalism, generally legitimized delegation of responsibility to big business. Its advocates, having been drawn into policy fields, have perhaps too often lost their critical edge, and allowed it to become instrumentalized, reflecting the technicist character of its practice.","[{'authorId': '35720444', 'name': 'S.

The work is motivated by the aim to provide technology with competences in perceiving and producing the emotional and nonverbal behaviors required to sustain a conversational dialogue. We present the Sensitive Artificial Listener (SAL) scenario as a setting which seems particularly suited for the study of emotional and nonverbal behavior since it requires only very limited verbal understanding on the part of the machine. This scenario allows us to concentrate on nonverbal capabilities without having to address at the same time the challenges of spoken language understanding, task modeling, etc. We first report on three prototype versions of the SAL scenario in which the behavior of the Sensitive Artificial Listener characters was determined by a human operator. These prototypes served the purpose of verifying the effectiveness of the SAL scenario and allowed us to collect data required for building system components for analyzing and synthesizing the respective behaviors. We then describe the fully autonomous integrated real-time system we created, which combines incremental analysis of user behavior, dialogue management, and synthesis of speaker and listener behavior of a SAL character displayed as a virtual agent. We discuss principles that should underlie the evaluation of SAL-type systems. Since the system is designed for modularity and reuse and since it is publicly available, the SAL system has potential as a joint research tool in the affective computing research community.","[{'authorId': '144951065', 'name': 'M.

However, although the Big Five factors are held to be orthogonal, they are not orthogonal in previous marker sets developed for them. The author describes methods for creating relatively orthogonal marker sets for orthogonal factors and demonstrates that the Big Five can be operationalized in relatively orthogonal marker scales. The three marker sets presented are a 40-item short form of Goldberg's 100 unipolar markers (Ortho-Markers), a new set of Modular Markers built with item parcels, and a 40-item short form of these (Mini-Modular Markers [the 3M40]). The new Big Five marker sets are shown to have markedly lower interscale correlations, with no loss of validity, relative to previous marker sets with comparable numbers of items.

Providing emotional support is an effective way to help them overcome the unpleasant effects of negative affect and adhere to their regimen. Building computers with such ability has grabbed the attention of the HCI community in recent years. Early research has shown some promising results when adopting strategies of how we comfort others, but many questions on how to build such systems remain unanswered. This paper presents the results of a 2 (modality: animated vs. no visual) by 3 (intervention: non-empathy vs. empathy vs. empathy and expressivity) between-subjects study that investigates the impact of two important factors and their interaction in the design of such systems: (1) different ways of expressing empathy, and (2) the modality of delivering such content.

379f11eab37f086cc9f0db6e3fc79b97c327f89a,"Institutions can provide incentives to enhance cooperation in a population where this behaviour is infrequent. This process is costly, and it is thus important to optimize the overall spending. This problem can be mathematically formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem where one wishes to minimize the cost of providing incentives while ensuring a minimum level of cooperation, sustained over time. Prior works that consider this question usually omit the stochastic effects that drive population dynamics. In this paper, we provide a rigorous analysis of this optimization problem, in a finite population and stochastic setting, studying both pairwise and multi-player cooperation dilemmas. We prove the regularity of the cost functions for providing incentives over time, characterize their asymptotic limits (infinite population size, weak selection and large selection) and show exactly when reward or punishment is more cost efficient. We show that these cost functions exhibit a phase transition phenomenon when the intensity of selection varies. By determining the critical threshold of this phase transition, we provide exact calculations for the optimal cost of the incentive, for any given intensity of selection. Numerical simulations are also provided to demonstrate analytical observations. Overall, our analysis provides for the first time a selection-dependent calculation of the optimal cost of institutional incentives (for both reward and punishment) that guarantees a minimum level of cooperation over time. It is of crucial importance for real-world applications of institutional incentives since the intensity of selection is often found to be non-extreme and specific for a given population.","[{'authorId': '35225892', 'name': 'M.

Purpose
This study aims to examine if a pedagogical agent’s expressed anger, when framed as a feedback cue, can enhance mental effort and learning performance in a multimedia learning environment than expressed happiness.


Design/methodology/approach
A between-subjects experiment was conducted in which learners engaged with a multimedia learning material that taught programming algorithms, featuring a pedagogical agent who expressed anger or happiness as a feedback cue in response to the learners’ prior performance. Learners completed a self-reported scale and post-test for measuring mental effort and learning performance, respectively.


Findings
Female learners reported higher mental effort and had better learning performance when the pedagogical agent expressed anger than happiness. Male learners reported marginally lower mental effort when the pedagogical agent expressed anger than happiness.


Originality/value
This study focuses on a pedagogical agent’s expressed emotion as social information to learners. Extending from research advocating a pedagogical agent’s positive emotional expression, this study highlights the potential benefits of a pedagogical agent’s negative emotional expression, such as anger, as a cue for learners to enhance learning effort and performance in a multimedia learning environment.

37fc9bfc2b2059bc25ca2e5f638b7aa7186d29da,"Surprisingly little is known about the way people use space. Social scientists in the field of human ecology have been concerned primarily with the distribution of such things as social classes, economic institutions, and mental illness. An almost unexplored area is microecology or the way that people in pairs or small groups arrange themselves. In the studies of Hediger (5), Howard (6), and Von Uexkull (15), ""space"" has had two different meanings. The more familiar of these refers to space in the geographic sense, i.e., space as area. It is most commonly discussed with reference to the animal's territory or home. However, some writers have applied the concept of territory to human behavior. W. F. Whyte (16) and Thrasher (14) have studied the territories of adolescent gangs. W. H. Whyte (17) also has studied the groupings of people within a housing development. Probably the most intensive investigation thus far has been that of Barker and Wright (2) in the Midwest. Yet this still remains relatively unexplored territory for social scientists. The second way in which the term ""space"" is used can be called ""personal space of the organism."" Although it has its roots in the work of zoologists and ethologists, it is an entirely different concept from that of territory. Personal distance is the distance that the organism customarily places between itself and other organisms. This distance may vary from species to species and individual to individual. Hediger speaks of this as ""flight distance"" and has measured this for hundreds of animals. This concept would seem to have relevance for the study of human behavior, although it has never been studied empirically so far as we know. It seems obvious that people feel uncomfortable when they talk to others who either stand too close or too far away. The concept itself has been used several times in the literature. David Katz (8) used the term ""personal space"" and compared it to the shell of a snail. Von Uexkull used the graphic analogy of people ""surrounded by soap-bubble worlds."" Stern (13) developed the concept of personal world. He noted that the physical world was without a center, but the","[{'authorId': '153534954', 'name': 'R.

This research focuses on the potential ability of animated avatars (a digital representation of the user) and virtual agents (a digital representation of a coach, buddy, or teacher) to deliver computer-based interventions for adolescents' chronic weight management. An exploration of the acceptance and desire of teens to interact with avatars and virtual agents for self-management and behavioral modification was undertaken.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The utilized approach was inspired by community-based participatory research. Data was collected from 2 phases: Phase 1) focus groups with teens, provider interviews, parent interviews; and Phase 2) mid-range prototype assessment by teens and providers.


RESULTS
Data from all stakeholder groups expressed great interest in avatars and virtual agents assisting self-management efforts. Adolescents felt the avatars and virtual agents could: 1) reinforce guidance and support, 2) fit within their lifestyle, and 3) help set future goals, particularly after witnessing the effect of their current behavior(s) on the projected physical appearance (external and internal organs) of avatars. Teens wanted 2 virtual characters: a virtual agent to act as a coach or teacher and an avatar (extension of themselves) to serve as a ""buddy"" for empathic support and guidance and as a surrogate for rewards. Preferred modalities for use include both mobile devices to accommodate access and desktop to accommodate preferences for maximum screen real estate to support virtualization of functions that are more contemplative and complex (e.g., goal setting). Adolescents expressed a desire for limited co-user access, which they could regulate. Data revealed certain barriers and facilitators that could affect adoption and use.


DISCUSSION
The current study extends the support of teens, parents, and providers for adding avatars or virtual agents to traditional computer-based interactions. Data supports the desire for a personal relationship with a virtual character in support of previous studies. The study provides a foundation for further work in the area of avatar-driven motivational interviewing.


CONCLUSIONS
This study provides evidence supporting the use of avatars and virtual agents, designed using participatory approaches, to be included in the continuum of care.

It integrates three major affective characteristics: emotions, moods and personality that cover short, medium, and long term affect. The use of this model consists of two phases: In the preparation phase appraisal rules and personality profiles for characters must be specified with the help of AffectML - our XML based affect modeling language. In the runtime phase, the specified appraisal rules are used to compute real-time emotions and moods as results of a subjective appraisal of relevant input. The computed affective characteristics are represented in AffectML and can be processed by sub-sequent modules that control the cognitive processes and physical behavior of embodied conversational characters. ALMA is part of the VirtualHuman project which develops interactive virtual characters that serve as dialog partners with human-like conversational skills. ALMA provides our virtual humans with a personality profile and with real-time emotions and moods.

More recently, work on both human and non–human primates has suggested that social groups are often hierarchically structured. We combine data on human grouping patterns in a comprehensive and systematic study. Using fractal analysis, we identify, with high statistical confidence, a discrete hierarchy of group sizes with a preferred scaling ratio close to three: rather than a single or a continuous spectrum of group sizes, humans spontaneously form groups of preferred sizes organized in a geometrical series approximating 3–5, 9–15, 30–45, etc. Such discrete scale invariance could be related to that identified in signatures of herding behaviour in financial markets and might reflect a hierarchical processing of social nearness by human brains.","[{'authorId': '47862712', 'name': 'Wei‐Xing Zhou'}, {'authorId': '1744895', 'name': 'D.

As long as we have only two strategies, many results from two-player games can be generalized to multiple players. For games with multiple players and more than two strategies, we show that statements derived for pairwise interactions no longer hold. For two-player games with any number of strategies there can be at most one isolated internal equilibrium. For any number of players with any number of strategies , there can be at most isolated internal equilibria. Multiplayer games show a great dynamical complexity that cannot be captured based on pairwise interactions.

39df7432dc7e401c9d3043e8d7619e888af6eca0,"When avoiding a group, a walker has two possibilities: either he goes through it or around it. Going through very dense groups or around huge ones would not seem natural and could break any sense of presence in a virtual environment. This paper aims to enable crowd simulators to handle such situations correctly. To this end, we need to understand how real humans decide to go through or around groups. As a first hypothesis, we apply the Principle of Minimum Energy (PME) on different group sizes and density. According to this principle, a walker should go around small and dense groups whereas he should go through large and sparse groups. Such principle has already been used for crowd simulation; the novelty here is to apply it to decide on a global avoidance strategy instead of local adaptations only. Our study quantifies decision thresholds. However, PME leaves some inconclusive situations for which the two solutions paths have similar energetic costs. In a second part, we propose an experiment to corroborate PME decisions thresholds with real observations. As controlling the factors of an experiment with many people is extremely hard, we propose to use Virtual Reality as a new method to observe human behavior. This work represents the first crowd simulation algorithm component directly designed from a VR-based study. We also consider the role of secondary factors in inconclusive situations. We show the influence of the group appearance and direction of relative motion in the decision process. Finally, we draw some guidelines to integrate our conclusions to existing crowd simulators and show an example of such integration. We evaluate the achieved improvements.","[{'authorId': '2123864', 'name': 'Julien Bruneau'}, {'authorId': '1851306', 'name': 'A. Olivier'}, {'authorId': '2235773', 'name': 'J.

However, most such conversational interactions in videogames are quite limited in how they take into account the identities of those characters. Conversation in videogames typically varies, if at all, based only on one aspect of the character such as a non-player character (NPC) referring to the character by race, class, or a gendered pronoun. In this paper, we present an approach to developing conversational narratives that addresses such limitations. Toward this end, we present the Chimeria platform, which uses a cognitive science-grounded model of social category membership to customize how conversational narratives unfold. We also present a playable interactive conversational scenario called “Chimeria:Gatekeeper” authored using the Chimeria Platform. This scenario demonstrates how the system considers multiple aspects of a character’s identity and degree of membership with, and between, social group categories in generating conversational dialog between a player character (PC) and an NPC.

3a4b124b9b3c1f965fd781370ccc62c42f4c7df1,"Background: The COVID-19 crisis has become the largest crisis in modern times and has particularly impacted students due to school closures, prolonged social isolation, and anxieties related to their future and health. All these factors may have caused significant stress and led to anxiety and depression in students. The purpose of this study was to study the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 associated mental health morbidity in students in the United States (US). Methods: A online cross-sectional survey was conducted using two instruments – the Perceived Stress Scale-4 (PSS-4) and the Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety-4 (PHQ-4). The survey was administered in the months of March to June during the COVID-19 pandemic to both high school and undergraduate college students. Results: In total, 369 students agreed to participate: 51.8% were male, 44.1% were college students. An elevated perceived stress level (PSS4 > 8) and a positive mood disorder (PHQ-4 > 4) was present in 49.6% and 56.6% of respondents, respectively. The mean (SD) PSS scores in males and females were 6.7 (2.7) and 8.2 (2.9) respectively among all the respondents, while the mean (SD) PHQ scores in males and females were 3.7 (3.2) and 5.3 (3.2) respectively. Prevalence of anxiety and depression in the respondents was 35.0% and 36.3% respectively. Females students reported higher PSS and PHQ scores compared to male students. There is a significant correlation between PSS and PHQ (r=0.66) Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an extremely high level of stress and mental health morbidity in both high school and college students, and this is more pronounced in females. Specific screening measures and interventions to improve the mental health of students is urgently warranted with a focus on females.","[{'authorId': '88339368', 'name': 'Akshar Aiyer'}, {'authorId': '4268339', 'name': 'S.

The sample consisted of 31 adults suffering from snake phobia. The study featured a randomized within-between design with two conditions and three counterbalanced immersions: (a) a baseline control immersion (BASELINE), (b) an immersion in a threatening and anxiety-inducing environment (ANX), and (c) an immersion in a nonthreatening environment that should not induce anxiety (NOANX). In the NOANX environment, participants were immersed for 5 min in a virtual Egyptian desert. They were told that the environment was safe and contained no snakes. The ANX immersion was identical, except that participants were led to believe that a multitude of hidden and dangerous snakes were lurking in the environment. A period of distraction (reading a text on relaxation) separated the ANX and NOANX immersions. Experimenters recorded presence and anxiety in the middle of and after each VR immersion. These brief measures of presence supported our hypothesis and were significantly higher in the anxious immersion than in the baseline or the nonanxious immersion. This finding was not corroborated by the presence questionnaire, where scores varied significantly in the opposite direction. The results from the brief one-item measures of presence support the significant contribution of emotions felt during the immersion on the subjective feeling of presence. The mixed results with the presence questionnaire are discussed, along with psychological factors potentially involved in presence.","[{'authorId': '144981172', 'name': 'S.

The 1982 Circle integrates and expands the content of four major adult interpersonal measures (LaForge & Suczek's Interpersonal Check List, Wiggins's Interpersonal Adjective Scales, Lorr & McNair's Interpersonal Behavior Inventory, and Kiesler et al.'s Impact Message Inventory) to provide a circle taxonomy consisting of 16 segments, 128 subclasses, 2 levels, and 350 bipolar items. Second, the article reviews previous conceptions of interpersonal complementarity and, using the 1982 Circle as a theoretical and operational guide, derives 11 propositions of complementarity as they apply in personality, psychopathology, and psychotherapy.","[{'authorId': '3765044', 'name': 'D.

We consider the case in which each agent navigates independently without explicit communication with other agents. Our formulation is an extension of the Velocity Obstacle concept [3], which was introduced for navigation among (passively) moving obstacles. Our approach takes into account the reactive behavior of the other agents by implicitly assuming that the other agents make a similar collision-avoidance reasoning. We show that this method guarantees safe and oscillation- free motions for each of the agents. We apply our concept to navigation of hundreds of agents in densely populated environments containing both static and moving obstacles, and we show that real-time and scalable performance is achieved in such challenging scenarios.","[{'authorId': '144721873', 'name': 'J.

This experiment tested the effects of different character presentations on user anxiety, task performance, and subjective evaluations of two commerce websites. There were three character conditions (no character, a character that ignored the user, and a character that closely monitored work on the website). Users were separated into two groups that had different attitudes about accepting help from others: people with control orientations that were external (users thought that other people controlled their success) and those with internal orientations (users thought they were in control). Results showed that the effects of monitoring and individual differences in thoughts about control worked as they do in real life. Users felt more anxious when characters monitored their website work and this effect was strongest for users with an external control orientation. Monitoring characters also decreased task performance, but increased trust in website content. Results are discussed in terms of design considerations that maximize the positive influence of animated agents.","[{'authorId': '3253649', 'name': 'R.

Research design: Feasibility study involving single case experimental design with two participants. Methods and procedures: TBI Express is an established program for improving social interactions between people with TBI and their CPs. To improve access to the program, we developed a modified version called TBIconneCT that can be delivered via videoconferencing. Two participants with TBI and their CPs completed TBIconneCT training. Outcome measures included exchange structure analysis of conversation samples, blinded ratings of conversation samples and self-report measures. Main outcomes and results: The study indicated positive change on blinded ratings of conversation and self-reported measures for both participants. Exchange structure analysis conducted on session-by-session data did not demonstrate treatment effects due to variability during baseline. Conclusion: This study indicated potential for using telehealth to provide social communication skills training to people with TBI and their families. The study findings provide a foundation for a phase one clinical trial which will compare in-person with videoconferencing delivery of TBIconneCT.","[{'authorId': '8264733', 'name': 'R.

To do so, the first step is to understand the intricate organization of strategic disclosures and appeals employed in human persuasion conversations. We designed an online persuasion task where one participant was asked to persuade the other to donate to a specific charity. We collected a large dataset with 1,017 dialogues and annotated emerging persuasion strategies from a subset. Based on the annotation, we built a baseline classifier with context information and sentence-level features to predict the 10 persuasion strategies used in the corpus. Furthermore, to develop an understanding of personalized persuasion processes, we analyzed the relationships between individuals’ demographic and psychological backgrounds including personality, morality, value systems, and their willingness for donation. Then, we analyzed which types of persuasion strategies led to a greater amount of donation depending on the individuals’ personal backgrounds. This work lays the ground for developing a personalized persuasive dialogue system.","[{'authorId': '47120703', 'name': 'Xuewei Wang'}, {'authorId': '8299781', 'name': 'Weiyan Shi'}, {'authorId': '2054541342', 'name': 'Richard Kim'}, {'authorId': '2072731142', 'name': 'Y.

To the traditional scenario where students interact primarily with a single coach or tutor character on-screen, we introduce the addition of both a social, animate colearner, and the student’s own avatar character. Variations of the colearner’s attributes, informed by research literature on human partners, are explored through an online testbed application of English language idioms. Results from an experimental study with 76 Japanese college students reveal that cooperative colearners have a positive impact on students’ performance and experience, as well as increasing perceptions of the character’s intelligence and credibility. Findings provide grounding for a fruitful new direction for pedagogical characters, where students learn alongside emotional companions. Computer Characters and Pedagogical Applications: A Perfect Match Drawing inspiration from traditional cartoon animation and comic layout processes, computer characters resemble actors in their emotional range and improvisational responses. Appearing on screen as embodied entities – whether humans, or anthropomorphized objects and animals – these agents facilitate our interactions with software applications and are rapidly gaining prevalence in our everyday online activities. Embodied conversational characters bring with them a host of social expectations and behavior patterns. In situations where time and efficiency are of the essence, the added layer of a social exchange may add to the cognitive load of the human interacting with them. Yet for cases when the social aspects of the interaction are the center, or central to, the human interactor’s objective, characters rule the day -and with good reason! Computer characters have been shown to be effective proxy sellers, customer service representatives, and teachers, by engaging us – consciously or unconsciously – through life-like language, presence and behaviors. Of particular importance for the educational domain, computer characters generate additional interest and motivation in the content presented, as well as influence proactive changes in everyday behavior. In fact, computer characters are perhaps the best interface modality for teaching and learning because they allow for mimicry and mirroring, fundamental aspects of learning. Beyond the explicit lesson plan, educational exchanges are fraught with implicit social content and tacit knowledge that instructors model for students. Through learning and teaching, we implement information gathering and problem solving skills that best exemplify our cultural practices and beliefs, whether the subject matter are skateboard moves on staircases learned from peers, algebra or Shakespeare in the classroom, or customization of characters in online gaming environments. Every day, societal values and norms for acceptable behaviors, affective and motivational exchanges, role models and speech patterns, are taught alongside lessons in classrooms around the globe. The richness of the social and emotional exchanges that make computer characters challenging to integrate in productivity suite applications make them ideal for communicating these additional channels of expressiveness in educational content, through their gestures, word choice, affective reactions, and facial expressions, among others (Maldonado and Hayes-Roth, 2004). Characters can reliably showcase the same pattern of behavior, with slight improvisations, for many users. This makes computer agents particularly interesting from the researchers’ perspective, leading to detailed analysis of different learning effects and behaviors based on each student’s characteristics and preferred learning situations. Pedagogical characters, have appeared in language learning applications, middle school curricula, oral storytelling, corporate training, health behavior change interventions, and even military instruction. Yet research and industry applications including embodied conversational computer characters in pedagogical domains have structured the interaction as a one-to-one tutoring or coaching intervention. The learner primarily interacts with one character on the screen at a time; when more than one character is present simultaneously in the application, their roles tend to be supplementary or supportive ones, providing background tips for the interaction as an articulate “Help” menu, or acting as movie extras in the background. A new paradigm: Learning together online We believe that giving the student a virtual presence in the environment, and enriching the learner’s world with a colearner, will lead to greater gains in learning and enjoyment of the educational application. To evaluate these claims, we have designed and built online application testbeds, with which we vary characteristics of the colearne,r according to research-based predictions of factors that maximize achievement and enjoyment. We’ll report in this article on the eSchool application, focused on teaching Japanese college students American idioms. This system has shown great promise for breaking free of the traditional paradigm of a single interactive character on the screen (for detailed discussion on these experiments, please refer to Maldonado el al, 2005). Today, computer characters exhibiting realistic behaviors in the pedagogical arena tend to follow three primary models, mirroring Taylor’s 1980 taxonomy of computer usage in schools: tutor, tool and tutee. Characters may be cast as expert teachers or coaches, presented as role-play partners in simulations of real-world situations, or act as learners whom the human student teaches. Most often, computer characters inhabit the role of expert or knowledgeable teacher, experienced coach, or erudite tutor. The second category, where characters are presented as partners in role-play simulations is prevalent for on-the-job training and eLearning situations, is prevalent in cases where the learner may be older and more experienced. Computer characters act as colleagues and coworkers, with whom the student practices concepts, strategies, and behaviors. The third mode of interaction with computer characters prevalent today presents the computer character as a learner, progressing alongside the human student, or being taught by him or her. Peer characters are perceived as possessing as no more content knowledge on the subject as the human learner, and often less. When students teach the peer character, the cyclical act of preparing content for teaching, and successfully communicating it becomes the learning experience in itself. In the last twenty years since Taylor published his taxonomy, we have developed the technologies to implement and render believable, animate characters, yet we have made comparatively little progress in developing applications for these characters that maximize the social and emotional relationship with human interactors. For starters, the human student tends to be implicitly present alongside the character, rather than visually embodied on screen, and the interaction is limited to exchanges between the human learner and a single computer character. Few graphical representations of the human interactors appear on-screen in pedagogical applications, despite how common these “avatars” are in commercial sociable applications and games. We propose a radical reframing of the learning context in which students interact with animated pedagogical computer characters, which we believe will maximize the students’ learning gains and enjoyment. Introducing eSchool: Our Experimental Testbed In the eSchool application we have developed, students interact with two computer characters at the same time, a teacher and a peer fellow student, within one screen. Students are themselves represented through an avatar, who they can direct in emotional and subject matter responses. The avatar’s conversational behaviors and gestures are autonomously derived from the directions of the human learner and this learner’s answers to the questions. This mode of interaction is perceived as more natural than avatars whose behaviors are minutely controlled by the users. The colearner, or classmate, learning alongside the human student, has no additional knowledge on the subject nor explanations to provide, and is called to answer questions as often as the student, on average; it also exchanges friendly banter with the student’s avatar. We have introduced this presence in the learning environment to determine the effects that learning alongside a social animate character has upon the student’s performance and attitudes, rather than using the colearner to elicit nuanced explanations from the student, or model understanding, as is the case with some intelligent tutoring systems. Figure 1: eSchool 2003 for Handhelds featuring cartoon characters Figure 2: eSchool 2005 for the PC featuring photorealistic characters Figure 1 shows the first eSchool interface for handheld computers using cartoon characters, and Figure 2, the current interface on a PC using photographic images at the same moment in the interaction. In both cases the teacher character is located on the upper right hand side of the screen, above the chalkboard, which displays the multiple choice interpretations the student must decide between, mimicking the learning space of a classroom. In Figure 1, the students’ avatar is Neko the cat, and the colearner is Taro the Tiger, while in Figure 2 the students’ avatar is Susy and the colearner is Ryota. Each of the three interactors has their own emotions and embodiment. The content of our learning application is an intermediate English language lesson, with accompanying video and evaluation instruments, primarily aimed at Japanese college students.

3f24bb4bf632cb05df08039cb8b7139a273f3338,"An experiment was carried out to examine the impact on electrodermal activity of people when approached by groups of one or four virtual characters at varying distances. It was premised on the basis of proxemics theory that the closer the approach of the virtual characters to the participant, the greater the level of physiological arousal. Physiological arousal was measured by the number of skin conductance responses within a short time period after the approach, and the maximum change in skin conductance level 5 s after the approach. The virtual characters were each either female or a cylinder of human size, and one or four characters approached each subject a total of 12 times. Twelve male subjects were recruited for the experiment. The results suggest that the number of skin conductance responses after the approach and the change in skin conductance level increased the closer the virtual characters approached toward the participants. Moreover, these response variables were inversely correlated with the number of visits, showing a typical adaptation effect. There was some evidence to suggest that the number of characters who simultaneously approached (one or four) was positively associated with the responses. Surprisingly there was no evidence of a difference in response between the humanoid characters and cylinders on the basis of this physiological data. It is suggested that the similarity in this quantitative arousal response to virtual characters and virtual objects might mask a profound difference in qualitative response, an interpretation supported by questionnaire and interview results. Overall the experiment supported the premise that people exhibit heightened physiological arousal the closer they are approached by virtual characters.","[{'authorId': '48334647', 'name': 'J.

Aims To examine the theoretical underpinnings of stepped care, together with the practicalities of the adoption of this system of care. Method Narrative literature review. Results The potential clinical and economic benefits of stepped care are dependent upon underlying assumptions of equivalence in terms of clinical outcomes, efficiency in terms of resource use and costs, and acceptability of ‘minimal interventions' to patients and therapists. Illustrative studies of these issues are considered.

By organizing the stimulus input simultaneously into several dimensions and successively into a sequence or chunks, we manage to break (or at least stretch) this informational bottleneck. Second, the process of recoding is a very important one in human psychology and deserves much more explicit attention than it has received. In particular, the kind of linguistic recoding that people do seems to me to be the very lifeblood of the thought processes. Recoding procedures are a constant concern to clinicians, social psychologists, linguists, and anthropologists and yet, probably because recoding is less accessible to experimental manipulation than nonsense syllables or T mazes, the traditional experimental psychologist has contributed little or nothing to their analysis. Nevertheless, experimental techniques can be used, methods of recoding can be specified, behavioral indicants can be found. And I anticipate that we will find a very orderly set of relations describing what now seems an uncharted wilderness of individual differences. Third, the concepts and measures provided by the theory of information provide a quantitative way of getting at some of these questions. The theory provides us with a yardstick for calibrating our stimulus materials and for measuring the performance of our subjects. In the interests of communication I have suppressed the technical details of information measurement and have tried to express the ideas in more familiar terms; I hope this paraphrase will not lead you to think they are not useful in research. Informational concepts have already proved valuable in the study of discrimination and of language; they promise a great deal in the study of learning and memory; and it has even been proposed that they can be useful in the study of concept formation. A lot of questions that seemed fruitless twenty or thirty years ago may now be worth another look. In fact, I feel that my story here must stop just as it begins to get really interesting.

What about the seven-point rating scale, the seven categories for absolute judgment, the seven objects in the span of attention, and the seven digits in the span of immediate memory? For the present I propose to withhold judgment. Perhaps there is something deep and profound behind all these sevens, something just calling out for us to discover it.

However, while previous work studied this from the point of view of emotion recognition and processing, not much is known about what effect a multimodal agent would have on a human-agent interaction task. Also, agent appearance could influence this interaction too. Here we manipulated the agent’s multimodal emotional expression (”smiling face” and ”smiling voice”, or both) and agent type (photorealistic or cartoon-like virtual human) and assessed people’s trust toward this agent. We measured trust using a mixed-methods approach, combining behavioural data from a survival task, questionnaire ratings and qualitative comments. These methods gave different results: while people commented on the importance of emotional expressivity in the agent’s voice, this factor had limited influence on trusting behaviours; while people rated the cartoon-like agent on several traits higher than the photorealistic one, the agent’s style also was not the most influential feature on people’s trusting behaviour.

However, coding patient language is a resource-intensive exercise and difficult to perform at scale. Our aim was to develop a deep learning model to automatically identify patient utterances during text-based internet-enabled Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and to determine the association between utterances and clinical outcomes. Method: Using 340 manually annotated transcripts we trained a deep learning model to categorize patient utterances into one or more of five categories. The model was used to automatically code patient utterances from our entire data set of transcripts (∼34,000 patients), and logistic regression analyses used to determine the association between both reliable improvement and engagement, and patient responses. Results: Our model reached human-level agreement on three of the five patient categories. Regression analyses revealed that increased counter change-talk (movement away from change) was associated with lower odds of both reliable improvement and engagement, while increased change-talk (movement towards change or self-exploration) was associated with increased odds of improvement and engagement. Conclusions: Deep learning provides an effective means of automatically coding patient utterances at scale. This approach enables the development of a data-driven understanding of the relationship between therapist and patient during therapy.","[{'authorId': '1984805', 'name': 'M.

Description of and instruction in the art of motivational interviewing (MI) has made a significant contribution to the optimism of practitioners treating addiction disorders. This is the field in which MI arose 30 years ago. Its use has generalized into other health behaviour change interventions, and beyond into general decision making. For the addiction field, the essence of the contribution has been to give practitioners a set of skills to deal with that most challenging characteristic of people with addiction disorders, namely resistance to change.

This third edition of Motivational Interviewing elaborates on the method described in the two previous editions (Miller and Rollnick, 1991, 2002), but without the assistance of contributing authors and with the change of the sub-title to ‘Helping People Change’.

4194ef4004c30b5031fa4029f3e45c12c4692a62,"Because Officers are charged with counseling and mentoring their subordinates, successful leaders in the United States Army must possess strong interpersonal skills (Headquarters, Department of the Army, 2006, 2008, 2011). Most Officers, however, develop their interpersonal skills on the job. Further, what formal training they receive consists primarily of live role-play sessions, which can fail to provide consistent practice, effective feedback, or accurate skill assessment and improvement. To address these issues, we have created a virtual-human-based roleplaying environment. The Virtual Officer Leadership Trainer (VOLT) is a controlled practice environment that allows instructor management and facilitates throughput. Trainees learn interpersonal skills, see demonstrations of the skills being used correctly, and then practice the skills interacting with a virtual human via branching, scripted dialogue that allows the trainee to apply specific skills. The trainees in the classroom observe this interaction in real time. At each decision point in the interaction, trainees use personal response systems (“clickers”) to indicate what they believe to be the correct course of action. These data are available to an instructor who monitors the class’s performance and conducts an after-action review. VOLT thus allows an entire class to participate in a single roleplay exercise, stimulating discussion, and facilitating peer and instructor evaluation in real time. VOLT’s instructional design is based on cognitive task analyses with expert leaders, which identified a set of learning objectives. This paper discusses VOLT’s educational goals, instructional design, technological approach, and program evaluation plan.","[{'authorId': '152777918', 'name': 'Julia Campbell'}, {'authorId': '3276239', 'name': 'M.

41a42b8ef7addbc6ec7829c3016ea738046e7ba6,"Introduction Many patients with psychosis experience everyday social situations as anxiety-provoking. The fears can arise, for example, from paranoia, hallucinations, social anxiety or negative-self beliefs. The fears lead patients to withdraw from activities, and this isolation leads to a cycle of worsening physical and mental health. Breaking this cycle requires highly active treatment directly in the troubling situations so that patients learn that they can safely and confidently enter them. However patients with psychosis seldom receive such life-changing interventions. To solve this problem we have developed an automated psychological treatment delivered in virtual reality (VR). It allows patients to experience computer simulations of the situations that they find anxiety-provoking. A virtual coach guides patients, using cognitive techniques, in how to overcome their fears. Patients are willing to enter VR simulations of anxiety-provoking situations because they know the simulations are not real, but the learning made transfers to the real world. Methods and analysis 432 patients with psychosis and anxious avoidance of social situations will be recruited from National Health Service (NHS) secondary care services. In the gameChange trial, they will be randomised (1:1) to the six-session VR cognitive treatment added to treatment as usual or treatment as usual alone. Assessments will be conducted at 0, 6 (post-treatment) and 26 weeks by a researcher blind to allocation. The primary outcome is avoidance and distress in real-life situations, using a behavioural assessment task, at 6 weeks. The secondary outcomes are psychiatric symptoms, activity levels and quality of life. All main analyses will be intention-to-treat. Moderation and mediation will be tested. An economic evaluation will be conducted. Ethics and dissemination The trial has received ethical approval from the NHS South Central - Oxford B Research Ethics Committee (19/SC/0075). A key output will be a high-quality automated VR treatment for patients to overcome anxious avoidance of social situations.

We examined the covariation of mind perception with three subclinical syndromes—autism-spectrum disorder, schizotypy, and psychopathy—and found that each presents a unique mind-perception profile. Autism-spectrum disorder involves reduced perception of agency in adult humans. Schizotypy involves increased perception of both agency and experience in entities generally thought to lack minds. Psychopathy involves reduced perception of experience in adult humans, children, and animals. Disorders are differentially linked with the over- or underperception of agency and experience in a way that helps explain their real-world consequences.","[{'authorId': '144470585', 'name': 'Kurt Gray'}, {'authorId': '32979394', 'name': 'Adrianna C.

Artists rely on stylization to increase appeal or expressivity, exaggerating or softening specific features. In this paper we analyze two of the most influential factors that define how a character looks: shape and material. With the help of artists, we design a set of carefully crafted stimuli consisting of different stylization levels for both parameters, and analyze how different combinations affect the perceived realism, appeal, eeriness, and familiarity of the characters. Moreover, we additionally investigate how this affects the perceived intensity of different facial expressions (sadness, anger, happiness, and surprise). Our experiments reveal that shape is the dominant factor when rating realism and expression intensity, while material is the key component for appeal. Furthermore our results show that realism alone is a bad predictor for appeal, eeriness, or attractiveness.","[{'authorId': '39800733', 'name': 'E.

With virtual reality (VR), computer-generated interactive environments, individuals can repeatedly experience their problematic situations and be taught, via evidence-based psychological treatments, how to overcome difficulties. VR is moving out of specialist laboratories. Our central aim was to describe the potential of VR in mental health, including a consideration of the first 20 years of applications. A systematic review of empirical studies was conducted. In all, 285 studies were identified, with 86 concerning assessment, 45 theory development, and 154 treatment. The main disorders researched were anxiety (n = 192), schizophrenia (n = 44), substance-related disorders (n = 22) and eating disorders (n = 18). There are pioneering early studies, but the methodological quality of studies was generally low. The gaps in meaningful applications to mental health are extensive. The most established finding is that VR exposure-based treatments can reduce anxiety disorders, but there are numerous research and treatment avenues of promise. VR was found to be a much-misused term, often applied to non-interactive and non-immersive technologies. We conclude that VR has the potential to transform the assessment, understanding and treatment of mental health problems. The treatment possibilities will only be realized if – with the user experience at the heart of design – the best immersive VR technology is combined with targeted translational interventions. The capability of VR to simulate reality could greatly increase access to psychological therapies, while treatment outcomes could be enhanced by the technology's ability to create new realities. VR may merit the level of attention given to neuroimaging.","[{'authorId': '2136711807', 'name': 'Daniel Freeman'}, {'authorId': '29021285', 'name': 'S. Reeve'}, {'authorId': '48325879', 'name': 'A.

This visual aspect of speech aids understanding and helps communicating additional information, such as the speaker's mood. We analyze quantitatively head and facial movements that accompany speech and investigate how they relate to the text's prosodic structure. We recorded several hours of speech and measured the locations of the speakers' main facial features as well as their head poses. The text was evaluated with a prosody prediction tool, identifying phrase boundaries and pitch accents. Characteristic for most speakers are simple motion patterns that are repeatedly applied in synchrony with the main prosodic events. Direction and strength of head movements vary widely from one speaker to another, yet their timing is typically well synchronized with the spoken text.

However, there are barriers that constrain group attendance, such as mobility, time, and distance. Using videoconferencing may overcome known barriers and improve the accessibility of group-based interventions. Objective The aim of this study was to review the literature to determine the feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, and implementation of health professional–led group videoconferencing to provide education or social support or both, into the home setting. Methods Electronic databases were searched using predefined search terms for primary interventions for patient education and/or social support. The quality of studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. We developed an analysis framework using hierarchical terms feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, and implementation, which were informed by subheadings. Results Of the 1634 records identified, 17 were included in this review. Home-based groups by videoconferencing are feasible even for those with limited digital literacy. Overall acceptability was high with access from the home highly valued and little concern of privacy issues. Some participants reported preferring face-to-face groups. Good information technology (IT) support and training is required for facilitators and participants. Communication can be adapted for the Web environment and would be enhanced by clear communication strategies and protocols. A range of improved outcomes were reported but because of the heterogeneity of studies, comparison of these across studies was not possible. There was a trend for improvement in mental health outcomes. Benefits highlighted in the qualitative data included engaging with others with similar problems; improved accessibility to groups; and development of health knowledge, insights, and skills. Videoconference groups were able to replicate group processes such as bonding and cohesiveness. Similar outcomes were reported for those comparing face-to-face groups and videoconference groups. Conclusions Groups delivered by videoconference are feasible and potentially can improve the accessibility of group interventions. This may be particularly useful for those who live in rural areas, have limited mobility, are socially isolated, or fear meeting new people. Outcomes are similar to in-person groups, but future research on facilitation process in videoconferencing-mediated groups and large-scale studies are required to develop the evidence base.","[{'authorId': '13528409', 'name': 'Annie Banbury'}, {'authorId': '6512464', 'name': 'S.

4377ee92d2709190eee61be049ddcf5e10effb2a,"BACKGROUND
Several studies have found a heightened prevalence of mental health disorders in people with intellectual disabilities (ID). There have been a number of successful case series and two promising controlled treatment trials of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for emotional disorders (excluding anger) for people with ID. Several authors have promoted the development of trans-diagnostic approaches to cognitive treatment. The present study extends this work with the development and evaluation of a trans-diagnostic treatment manual for CBT in people with ID.


METHOD
A controlled treatment trial was conducted with 12 participants in treatment and waiting list control data. Each treatment participant was matched to a control on age, IQ, presenting problem, and Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) global severity index (GSI) score. The treatment group was also evaluated on the Glasgow anxiety and depression scales and was followed up for 3 to 6 months after treatment.


RESULTS
There were no significant differences between groups at baseline. Following treatment, the CBT group was significantly improved when compared with the control group on the GSI scale of the BSI. The ancovas for all other measures were not significant but there were significant improvements for the treatment group on all scaled except BSI depression from pre to post-CBT. Gains were maintained to follow up, and changes were associated with large effect sizes.


CONCLUSIONS
It was possible to treat a range of symptoms and psychiatric diagnoses with a general trans-diagnostic CBT manual. The effects of therapy were promising, suggesting that the participants could respond to treatment in a meaningful and helpful manner and supporting the case for further evaluation of the trans-diagnostic approach in ID.","[{'authorId': '2151649', 'name': 'W.

Their systematic study also resorts to agent-based modelling and simulation (ABM) techniques, thus enabling the study of aforesaid mechanisms under a variety of conditions, parameters, and alternative virtual games. This paper summarises some main research directions and challenges tackled in our group, using methods from EGT and ABM. These range from the introduction of cognitive and emotional mechanisms into agents' implementation in an evolving MAS, to the cost-efficient interference for promoting prosocial behaviours in complex networks, to the regulation and governance of AI safety development ecology, and to the equilibrium analysis of random evolutionary multi-player games. This brief aims to sensitize the reader to EGT based issues, results and prospects, which are accruing in importance for the modeling of minds with machines and the engineering of prosocial behaviours in dynamical MAS, with impact on our understanding of the emergence and stability of collective behaviours. In all cases, important open problems in MAS research as viewed or prioritised by the group are described.","[{'authorId': '2928820', 'name': 'H.

The virtual environment models a collaborative problem space of scheduling a two-day trip for students in a tourist office. Usability issues are analyzed within the framework of James Reason's where errors observed are interpreted as rule-based mistakes, i.e. the false application of rules from the physical world in the virtual reality. The issues observed qualitatively on video recordings reveal that these rule-based errors of usability in the 3D cave are related to the lack of feedback. Participants fail to seize an object because they do not “feel” that they reached it unless they have something similar to tactile feedback. Other mistakes in usability are related to typing in the 3D cave which is connected to previous findings about the immersion breaking nature of typing. Those findings implicate that the virtual reality cave as a user interface should induce applicable rules. It would be another solution to fit this interface to the rules of the real world by implementing new feedback channels replacing tactile and postural information.","[{'authorId': '2475130', 'name': 'E.

Our model simulates the interplay between these two modes of expressiveness on two levels. First, two kinds of knowledge representation (propositional and imagistic) are utilized to capture the modality-specific contents and processes of content planning. Second, specific planners are integrated to carry out the formulation of concrete verbal and gestural behavior. A probabilistic approach to gesture formulation is presented that incorporates multiple contextual factors as well as idiosyncratic patterns in the mapping of visuo-spatial referent properties onto gesture morphology.

The zeitgeist for short-term psychotherapy efficacy has fundamentally shifted away from evidence-based practices to include evidence-informed practices, resulting in an equally important paradigm shift in outcome measurement designed to reflect change in this short-term modality.


OBJECTIVE
The present article delineates a short-term psychotherapy structure which defines four fundamental stages that all brief therapies may have in common, and are represented through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Solution-Focused Brief Therapy, Narrative Therapy, and Emotion-Focused Therapy.


METHOD
These four theoretical approaches were analyzed via a selected literature review through comparing and contrasting specific and common tasks as they relate to the process of psychotherapy and change. Once commonalities were identified within session, they were categorized or grouped into themes or general stages of change within the parameters of a four to six session model of short-term therapy. Commonalities in therapeutic stages of change may more accurately and uniformly measure outcome in short-term work, unlike the symptom-specific psychometric instruments of longer-term psychotherapy.


RESULTS
A systematic framework for evaluating the client and clinician adherence to 20 specific tasks for these four short-term therapies is presented through the newly proposed, Brief Task Acquisition Scale (BTAS). It is further proposed that the client-clinicians' adherence to these tasks will track and ultimately increase treatment integrity.


CONCLUSION
Thus, when the client-clinician relationship tracks and evaluates the three pillars of (1) stage/process change, (2) task acquisition, and (3) treatment integrity, the culmination of these efforts presents a new way of more sensitively measuring outcome in short-term psychotherapy. Data collection is suggested as a first step to empirically evaluate the testable hypotheses suggested within this current model. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message The clinician practitioner will note that the proposed Brief Services model removes the subjectivity of client satisfaction as a reliable outcome measure, and relies upon client and therapist adherence to specific tasks and stages of change within and across short-term psychotherapy. The clinical significance of the BTAS for the practitioner is three fold. The psychometric instrument (1) tracks stage or process change, (2) guides task acquisition, and (3) incorporates greater treatment integrity unlike other outcome measures. The BTAS present a new way of conceptualizing change in short-term psychotherapy regardless of modality or presenting issue, making it a more flexible and usable instrument for the clinician. The BTAS may measure outcome more sensitively and accurately, thus offering the client, therapist and client-therapist more information regarding change at each stage and at the end of short-term psychotherapy.","[{'authorId': '7151618', 'name': 'Everett McGuinty'}, {'authorId': '144428149', 'name': 'John Nelson'}, {'authorId': '31454550', 'name': 'A.

43fc8e0b9eb867f253e1159548421aa135a66eb5,"This paper presents an effective and direct method to study Non-verbal Cue in computer-mediated communication context (CMC). The real digital communications such as the Internet are used to the logical information converted easily into a digital signal for the communication media. However, a human communication is composed of not only logical information, but also sensitivity-like non-verbal one. Non-verbal information like the human voice, gesture, and emotion rather than verbal one is more useful to understand the user's inclination exactly. However it is quite difficult to catch the meaning of non-verbal information without using a specially purposed device such as the motion capture. Although the devices can use for the experimental purposes of understanding the meaning of non-verbal information, the confidence of results is not enough because the devices give an invisible pressure to a testee wearing the equipments. In this paper, we develop a mouse-tracking system, namely Recoding tool Of Mouse trace In The Web (ROMIT), for the purpose of studying the non-verbal information on CMC. ROMIT supports on-line communication between communicators through the Internet. It can provide more exact remote users' inclination for the system manager from avoiding the invisible pressure on the users. We investigate the user’s mouse behavior on the web by using ROMIT system, and our demonstration show that the mouse behavior of each user is the effective and direct method to understand the user's inclination. Then, we confirm that the mouse behavior can be used as the medium for transferring the KANSEI or non-verbal information on CMC.","[{'authorId': '2100129337', 'name': '-.

Although emotion dysregulation is not a defining feature of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), there is a growing consensus that emotional problems play a prominent role in this disorder.


METHODS
The present study examined a wide range of emotion regulation (ER) strategies in 32 individuals with ASD compared to 31 group-matched typically developing (TD) participants in three emotional domains (anger, anxiety, and amusement). Parents of individuals with ASD and TD individuals were interviewed about their child's emotional experience and the use and efficacy of 10 ER strategies. In addition, participants filled out daily diaries on experience and regulation in the same emotional domains.


RESULTS
Compared to TD individuals, parents reported that individuals with ASD experienced more anger and anxiety and less amusement, made less frequent use of a variety of adaptive ER strategies (e.g. problem solving, cognitive reappraisal), and made more frequent use of maladaptive strategies (e.g. repetitive behavior). Moreover, individuals with ASD were less effective at utilizing adaptive ER strategies. Self-reports showed differences in experience of amusement and in ER strategies for anger and anxiety, but not in experience of anger and anxiety.


CONCLUSIONS
This study provides evidence that individuals with ASD less frequently use adaptive - but more frequently use maladaptive - ER strategies. Implications for ASD treatments that focus on increasing the use of adaptive strategies are discussed.","[{'authorId': '38707445', 'name': 'Andrea C. Samson'}, {'authorId': '33448033', 'name': 'W.

The schools workpackage carried out a systematic review of reviews of work on mental health in schools from which it identified evidence-based interventions and programmes and extracted the general principles from evidence-based work. A systematic search of the literature uncovered 52 systematic reviews and meta-analyses of mental health in schools. The interventions identified by the reviews had a wide range of beneficial effects on children, families and communities and on a range of mental health, social, emotional and educational outcomes. The effect sizes associated with most interventions were generally small to moderate in statistical terms, but large in terms of real-world impacts. The effects associated with interventions were variable and their effectiveness could not always be relied on. The characteristics of more effective interventions included: teaching skills, focusing on positive mental health; balancing universal and targeted approaches; starting early with the youngest children and continuing with older ones; operating for a lengthy period of time and embedding work within a multi-modal/whole-school approach which included such features as changes to the curriculum including teaching skills and linking with academic learning, improving school ethos, teacher education, liaison with parents, parenting education, community involvement and coordinated work with outside agencies. Interventions were only effective if they were completely and accurately implemented: this applied particularly to whole-school interventions which could be ineffective if not implemented with clarity, intensity and fidelity. The implications for policy and practice around mental health in schools are discussed, including the suggestion of some rebalancing of priorities and emphases.","[{'authorId': '6133530', 'name': 'K.

Such a mechanism is crucial for the design of resource-bounded agents that must operate in highly-dynamic, semi-predictable environments and which need mechanisms for allocating their computational resources efficiently. The aim of this work is to propose a logical analysis of emotions and their influences on an agent's behavior. We focus on four emotion types (viz., hope, fear, joy, and distress) and provide their logical characterizations in a modal logic frame-work. As the intensity of emotion is essential for its influence on an agent's behavior, the logic is devised to represent and reason about graded beliefs, graded goals and intentions. The belief strength and the goal strength determine the intensity of emotions. Emotions trigger different types of coping strategy which are aimed at dealing with emotions either by forming or revising an intention to act in the world, or by changing the agent's interpretation of the situation (by changing beliefs or goals).","[{'authorId': '1707738', 'name': 'M.

Drawing on psychological research, we evaluate perception of our agents' personalities and credibility by human viewers (N = 187). Our results suggest that we succeeded in validating theoretically grounded indicators of personality in our virtual agents, and that it is feasible to place our characters on Eysenck's scales. A key finding is that the presence of behavioral characteristics reinforces the prescribed personality profiles that are already emerging from the still images. Our long-term goal is to enhance agents' ability to sustain realistic interaction with human users, and we discuss how this preliminary work may be further developed to include more systematic variation of Eysenck's personality scales.","[{'authorId': '2314861', 'name': 'Margaret McRorie'}, {'authorId': '145688200', 'name': 'I.

We separately model the observer effect (or individual differences of observers), and the conversational-scene effect or the video-clip effect (how interlocutors are interacting), based on Bayes' theorem with the assumption of their conditional independence. The observer term describes the observer's cognitive tendency, including bias, in a probabilistic form, and does not include any clip information. In contrast, the clip term describes how a target clip is recognized by an unspecified observer. The perceived emotion is predicted to be the state that maximizes the conditional probability given the observer and target clip. An experiment with 100 observers and 97 clips demonstrated, in a leave-one-out cross-validation scenario, that 1) there is in fact no statistically and practically significant interaction between observer and clip, and 2) our Bayesian modelling achieves a 97 percent accuracy as a reference of test-retest reliability. Furthermore, when combined with existing observer and clip models that can handle unknown observers and clips, our model yielded an accuracy of around 50 percent in a more challenging leave-one-subject-and-clip-out cross-validation scenario.","[{'authorId': '144108036', 'name': 'Shiro Kumano'}, {'authorId': '1736448', 'name': 'Ryo Ishii'}, {'authorId': '1713258', 'name': 'K.

461f46ced01dea2ecbe603bfa21c7279e3630fb8,"Background Gestural interaction systems are increasingly being used, mainly in games, expanding the idea of entertainment and providing experiences with the purpose of promoting better physical and/or mental health. Therefore, it is necessary to establish mechanisms for evaluating the usability of these interfaces, which make gestures the basis of interaction, to achieve a balance between functionality and ease of use. Objective This study aims to present the results of a systematic review focused on usability evaluation methods for gesture-based games, considering devices with motion-sensing capability. We considered the usability methods used, the common interface issues, and the strategies adopted to build good gesture-based games. Methods The research was centered on four electronic databases: IEEE, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), Springer, and Science Direct from September 4 to 21, 2015. Within 1427 studies evaluated, 10 matched the eligibility criteria. As a requirement, we considered studies about gesture-based games, Kinect and/or Wii as devices, and the use of a usability method to evaluate the user interface. Results In the 10 studies found, there was no standardization in the methods because they considered diverse analysis variables. Heterogeneously, authors used different instruments to evaluate gesture-based interfaces and no default approach was proposed. Questionnaires were the most used instruments (70%, 7/10), followed by interviews (30%, 3/10), and observation and video recording (20%, 2/10). Moreover, 60% (6/10) of the studies used gesture-based serious games to evaluate the performance of elderly participants in rehabilitation tasks. This highlights the need for creating an evaluation protocol for older adults to provide a user-friendly interface according to the user’s age and limitations. Conclusions Through this study, we conclude this field is in need of a usability evaluation method for serious games, especially games for older adults, and that the definition of a methodology and a test protocol may offer the user more comfort, welfare, and confidence.","[{'authorId': '2083877639', 'name': 'Fernando Winckler Simor'}, {'authorId': '2240564', 'name': 'Manoela Rogofski Brum'}, {'authorId': '31537036', 'name': 'Jaison Dairon Ebertz Schmidt'}, {'authorId': '34775267', 'name': 'Rafael Rieder'}, {'authorId': '40477792', 'name': 'A.

Social robots can offer tremendous possibilities for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) interventions. To date, most studies with this population have used short, isolated encounters in controlled laboratory settings. Our study focused on a 1-month, home-based intervention for increasing social communication skills of 12 children with ASD between 6 and 12 years old using an autonomous social robot. The children engaged in a triadic interaction with a caregiver and the robot for 30 min every day to complete activities on emotional storytelling, perspective-taking, and sequencing. The robot encouraged engagement, adapted the difficulty of the activities to the child’s past performance, and modeled positive social skills. The system maintained engagement over the 1-month deployment, and children showed improvement on joint attention skills with adults when not in the presence of the robot. These results were also consistent with caregiver questionnaires. Caregivers reported less prompting over time and overall increased communication.","[{'authorId': '1792053', 'name': 'B.

It tests the hypothesis that gender will influence the exhibition of stress outcomes resulting from exposure to high-density living environments, with women displaying internalized responses and men responding with externalized styles. Expanding on the types of gender-appropriate disorders examined in this area of research, I selected depression, aggression, and withdrawal as gender-specific disorders based on theory and prior research. Multilevel analyses of data from a survey of Toronto residents indicate that, while the effects of household density are conditioned by gender, support for the existence of gender-equivalent outcomes is mixed.

Hobfoll, Hall, Canetti-Nisim, Galea, Johnson, and Palmieri's (2007) insightful paper highlights important weaknesses in existing theory and data. Although we commend Hobfoll et al. for offering a provocative new way to conceptualise PTG in terms of action-focused growth, we also find a number of limitations in their approach. In this article, we attempt to place PTG within a broader framework of individual differences in response to potential trauma. As in most of the literature on PTG, Hobfoll et al. implicitly equate growth with resilience or view it as superior to resilient outcomes. We argue, however, that many if not most people are resilient in the face of trauma and that resilient outcomes typically provide little need or opportunity for PTG. We close by exploring the literature on resilience for possible mechanisms underlying a link between PTG and adaptation. For example, Hobfoll et al. dismiss some forms of reported growth as illusory. In contrast, we review evidence for the adaptive value of self-enhancing illusions in coping with adversity.

On essaie, dans cet article, de replacer le PTG dans le cadre plus vaste des differences individuelles en reponse au traumatisme potentiel. Comme souvent dans la litterature sur le PTG, Hobfoll & al. assimilent le developpement a la resilience ou le considerent comme superieur aux consequences de la resilience. Nous defendons au contraire l’idee que beaucoup de gens, voire la plupart, sont resilients face au traumatisme et que les apports de la resilience peuvent se passer ou n’offrent habituellement que peu d’opportunites au PTG. On termine en examinant la litterature sur la resilience a la recherche d’eventuels processus sous-tendant un lien entre PTG et adaptation. Par exemple, Hobfoll & al. rejettent certains temoignages de developpement comme relevant de l’illusion; nous avons par contre releve des preuves que des illusions valorisant le moi contribuent a l’adaptation dans la lutte contre l’adversite.","[{'authorId': '37562569', 'name': 'Maren Westphal'}, {'authorId': '5188130', 'name': 'G.

Yet it is not clear what mechanisms might underlie the participation in and compliance with such a commitment, especially when participation is costly and non-compliance can be profitable. Here, we develop a theory of participation and compliance with respect to an explicit commitment formation process and to institutional incentives where individuals, at first, decide whether or not to join a cooperative agreement to play a one-shot social dilemma game. Using a mathematical model, we determine whether and when participating in a costly commitment, and complying with it, is an evolutionarily stable strategy, resulting in high levels of cooperation. We show that, given a sufficient budget for providing incentives, rewarding of commitment compliant behaviours better promotes cooperation than punishment of non-compliant ones. Moreover, by sparing part of this budget for rewarding those willing to participate in a commitment, the overall level of cooperation can be significantly enhanced for both reward and punishment. Finally, the presence of mistakes in deciding to participate favours evolutionary stability of commitment compliance and cooperation.","[{'authorId': '34751767', 'name': 'T.

Drawing on emotions as social information (EASI) theory (Van Kleef, 2009), we hypothesized that people use the emotional expressions of others to inform their own attitudes, but only when they are sufficiently motivated and able to process those expressions. Five experiments support these ideas. Participants reported more positive attitudes about various topics after seeing a source's sad (rather than happy) expressions when topics were negatively framed (e.g., abandoning bobsleighing from the Olympics). Conversely, participants reported more positive attitudes after seeing happy (rather than sad) expressions when topics were positively framed (e.g., introducing kite surfing at the Olympics). This suggests that participants used the source's emotional expressions as information when forming their own attitudes. Supporting this interpretation, effects were mitigated when participants' information processing was undermined by cognitive load or was chronically low. Moreover, a source's anger expressions engendered negative attitude change when directed at the attitude object and positive change when directed at the recipient's attitude. Effects occurred regardless of whether emotional expressions were manipulated through written words, pictures of facial expressions, film clips containing both facial and vocal emotional expressions, or emoticons. The findings support EASI theory and indicate that emotional expressions are a powerful source of social influence.","[{'authorId': '5980688', 'name': 'Gerben A. van Kleef'}, {'authorId': '49436535', 'name': 'Helma van den Berg'}, {'authorId': '5073127', 'name': 'Marc W.

47524f71f2e22307a6bd2e86dabd9aabe3a140bd,"What kinds of social relationships can people have with computers? Are there activities that computers can engage in that actively draw people into relationships with them? What are the potential benefits to the people who participate in these human-computer relationships? To address these questions this work introduces a theory of Relational Agents, which are computational artifacts designed to build and maintain long-term, social-emotional relationships with their users. These can be purely software humanoid animated agents--as developed in this work--but they can also be non-humanoid or embodied in various physical forms, from robots, to pets, to jewelry, clothing, hand-helds, and other interactive devices. Central to the notion of relationship is that it is a persistent construct, spanning multiple interactions; thus, Relational Agents are explicitly designed to remember past history and manage future expectations in their interactions with users. Finally, relationships are fundamentally social and emotional, and detailed knowledge of human social psychology--with a particular emphasis on the role of affect--must be incorporated into these agents if they are to effectively leverage the mechanisms of human social cognition in order to build relationships in the most natural manner possible. People build relationships primarily through the use of language, and primarily within the context of face-to-face conversation. Embodied Conversational Agents--anthropomorphic computer characters that emulate the experience of face-to-face conversation--thus provide the substrate for this work, and so the relational activities provided by the theory will primarily be specific types of verbal and nonverbal conversational behaviors used by people to negotiate and maintain relationships. This work also provides an analysis of the types of applications in which having a human-computer relationship is advantageous to the human participant. In addition to applications in which the relationship is an end in itself (e.g., in entertainment systems), human-computer relationships are important in tasks in which the human is attempting to undergo some change in behavior or cognitive or emotional state. One such application is explored here: a system for assisting the user through a month-long health behavior change program in the area of exercise adoption. This application involves the research, design and implementation of relational agents as well as empirical evaluation of their ability to build relationships and effect change over a series of interactions with users.

Results support an association between exposure to Hurricane Katrina and reactive aggression via posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and poorly regulated emotion. The proposed model fits well for both boys and girls; however, results suggest that minority youth in this sample were more likely to experience emotional dysregulation in relation to posttraumatic stress than Caucasian youth. Further, results indicate that hurricane exposure, PTSD symptoms, and poorly regulated emotion are associated with reactive aggression even after controlling for proactive aggression. These findings have implications for postdisaster mental health services. Researchers examining mental health problems in youth after a significant disaster have traditionally focused on the presence of internalizing problems such as anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, with very little empirical attention paid to the incidence of post-disaster externalizing problems such as aggression.

This type of ‘in-group bias’ is evident in mimicry behaviors. We tend to automatically mimic the behaviors of in-group members, and this behavior is associated with interpersonal sensitivity and empathy. However, mimicry is reduced when interacting with out-group members. Although race is considered an unchangeable trait, it is possible using embodiment in immersive virtual reality to engender the illusion in people of having a body of a different race. Previous research has used this technique to show that after a short period of embodiment of White people in a Black virtual body their implicit racial bias against Black people diminishes. Here we show that this technique powerfully enhances mimicry. We carried out an experiment with 32 White (Caucasian) female participants. Half were embodied in a White virtual body and the remainder in a Black virtual body. Each interacted in two different sessions with a White and a Black virtual character, in counterbalanced order. The results show that dyads with the same virtual body skin color expressed greater mimicry than those of different color. Importantly, this effect occurred depending on the virtual body’s race, not participants’ actual racial group. When embodied in a Black virtual body, White participants treat Black as their novel in-group and Whites become their novel out-group. This reversed in-group bias effect was obtained regardless of participants’ level of implicit racial bias.

Picture-evoked affects also modulate responses to independently presented startle probe stimuli.

4881e926632f7a5110b802e618ba5bab3e8956c1,"‘Swarm intelligence’ is defined in the preface of this book to be ‘the emergent collective intelligence of groups of simple agents’. As such, there is a huge range of work that the book could cover – from distributed software agents to cellular automata. A more accurate gloss of the actual content of the book comes in the introductory chapter – ‘designing problem solving devices inspired by social insects’ (p.23). Within this more circumscribed eld, the book provides fairly comprehensive coverage of recent research developments. It thus constitutes an excellent resource for researchers in the eld or for those wishing to familiarize themselves with current approaches e.g. it would be an ideal introduction for a doctoral student wanting to enter this area. But why and how should social insects inspire methods for problem solving? The introduction (Chapter 1) claims the critical concepts are self-organization and stigmergy. Self-organization is more or less self-explanatory – the idea that some kind of global coherence in structure or behaviour can emerge from purely local interactions. As such it is not a new concept (as the authors recognize, much of the theoretical work in this area comes from physics) nor is it evident that it applies to all social insect behaviour. For example, it could be argued that the idea (discussed in Chapter 5) of a template – a structure in the environment that organises the local activity towards a constrained result – is a global mechanism in much the same way as a centralized plan. However it is true that much of the success and exibility of social insect behaviour does seem to be the emergent result of local actions. Insect swarms provide an existence proof of the potential power of self-organizing systems. They can also provide specic ideas as to the kinds of local interactions to implement. If termites can build a huge, well-structured nest, and ants alternate their activities dynamically to increase colony efciency, then it should be possible to copy their local behaviours to achieve comparable global results. Stigmergy may be a less familiar term but refers to one important mechanism for successful self-organization: how agents’ effects on their environment can feed back to modify each others’ and their own behaviour. A good example discussed at length in Chapter 4 is distributed clustering. A simple agent behaviour of picking up isolated objects and dropping them when another object is encountered leads to the formation of initial small clusters that can effectively guide the further development of larger ones. These ideas have become an attractive (some might say seductive) alternative to more conventional ‘centralized’ approaches to problem solving. By providing an overview, this book allows some assessment of how successful this approach has been, as discussed further below. The presentation is nicely structured, with each chapter taking a different example of insect social behaviour – foraging, task allocation, brood sorting, self-organization and templates, nest building and co-operative transport – and presenting rst the biological data, then models proposed to explain it, then the generalization of such models to solve analogous problems such as routing in Connection Science, Vol. 14, No. 2, 2002, 163–164","[{'authorId': '144145429', 'name': 'B.

Therefore, it is essential to design machines to elicit trust, so as to make interactions with them acceptable and successful. However, while there is a substantial literature on first impressions of trustworthiness based on various characteristics, including voice, not much is known about the trust development process. Are first impressions maintained over time? Or are they influenced by the experience of an agent's behaviour? We addressed these questions in three experiments using the ""iterated investment game"", a methodology derived from game theory that allows implicit measures of trust to be collected over time. Participants played the game with various agents having different voices: in the first experiment, participants played with a computer agent that had either a Standard Southern British English accent or a Liverpool accent; in the second experiment, they played with a computer agent that had either an SSBE or a Birmingham accent; in the third experiment, they played with a robot that had either a natural or a synthetic voice. All these agents behaved either trustworthily or untrustworthily. In all three experiments, participants trusted the agent with one voice more when it was trustworthy, and the agent with the other voice more when it was untrustworthy. This suggests that participants might change their trusting behaviour based on the congruency of the agent's behaviour with the participant's first impression. Implications for human-machine interaction design are discussed.","[{'authorId': '1996210170', 'name': 'Ilaria Torre'}, {'authorId': '2826399', 'name': 'Jeremy Goslin'}, {'authorId': '8375293', 'name': 'Laurence White'}, {'authorId': '3364118', 'name': 'Debora Zanatto'}]",50.0,,28.0,"Trust in artificial voices: A ""congruency effect"" of first impressions and behavioural experience",2018.0

In order to depict the effect from hazards and other agents to crowd movement, we first classify hazards into different types (transient and persistent, concurrent and nonconcurrent, and static and dynamic) based on their inherent characteristics. Second, we introduce the concept of perilous field for each hazard and further transform the critical level of the field to its invoked-panic emotion. After that, we propose an emotional contagion model to simulate the evolving process of panic emotion caused by multiple hazards. Finally, we introduce an emotional reciprocal velocity obstacles (RVOs) model to simulate the crowd behaviors by augmenting the traditional RVO model with emotional contagion, which for the first time combines the emotional impact and local avoidance together. Our experimental results demonstrate that the overall approach is robust, can better generate realistic crowds and the panic emotion dynamics in a crowd.

4a191bb8c04538cae794379502ce552a0b7adf15,"Introduction Everyone experiences stress at one time or another – from major events such as the death of a loved one, to more minor stressors such as financial difficulties. Not surprisingly, exposure to stress is generally associated with a wide range of negative outcomes, including decreased well-being, increased incidence of disease, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder (Dohrenwend & Dohrenwend, 1974; Kendler et al., 1999; Monat et al., 2007). However, not all individuals who are exposed to even high levels of stress develop such negative outcomes. In fact, recent evidence suggests that a considerable number of individuals exhibit resilience, which is commonly defined as maintained or improved mental health in the face of stress, after short disruptions (if any) to normal functioning (Freitas & Downey, 1998; Rutter, 1999; Luthar et al., 2000; Bonanno, 2005). Note that this definition, which we adapt here, conceptualizes resilience as a potential outcome after exposure to stress rather than a psychological trait that leads to positive outcomes (c.f. Norris et al., 2008). It, therefore, appears that, in the face of comparable stressors, some individuals exhibit significantly impaired functioning while others show impressive resilience. Understanding the factors that govern the great individual variance in outcomes after stress is important for understanding mental health and for developing interventions and prevention programs that foster resilience. What factors, then, might predict resilience? One key to this question might lie in the fact that stressful events are inherently highly emotional (Sarason et al., 1978; Lazarus, 1999). For this reason, people’s ability to regulate emotions may be a critically important factor in determining resilience (Figure 2.1). The present chapter will review relevant literatures and suggest that there is indeed evidence to support this thesis. More specifically, we will propose that a specific type of emotion regulation, cognitive emotion regulation, holds particular promise for contributing to resilience.","[{'authorId': '4041983', 'name': 'Allison S.

Here we present results that show that this effect is weaker in males than in females (Experiment 1). This result is predicted by the ‘extreme male brain’ theory of autism (Baron-Cohen, 2003), which suggests that males in the normal population should display more autism-like traits than females (e.g., poor joint attention). Indeed, participants′ scores on the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Stott, Bolton, & Goodyear, 2001) negatively correlated with cueing magnitude. Furthermore, exogenous orienting did not differ between the sexes in two peripheral cueing experiments (Experiments 2a and 2b). However, a final experiment showed that using non-predictive arrows instead of eyes as a central cue also revealed a large gender difference. This demonstrates that reduced orienting from central cues in males generalizes beyond gaze cues. These results show that while peripheral cueing is equivalent in the male and female brains, the attention systems of the two sexes treat noninformative symbolic cues very differently.","[{'authorId': '40471972', 'name': 'A.

It has, of course, been a central concept within symbolic interactionism since the seminal writings of Mead ( 1934), Cooley (1902), and James ( 1890). However, even within this sociological tradition there has been a revitalization of interest in the self-concept: with developments in role theory (Turner 1978; Gordon 1976), with the increasing focus on the concept of identity (McCall & Simmons 1978; Stryker 1980; Gordon 1968; Guiot 1977; Burke 1980), with the reemergence of interest in social structure and person­ ality (House 198 1 ; Turner 1976; Kohn 1969, 198 1 ; Rosenberg 1979), and with the reconceptualization of small group experimental situations (Alexander and colleagues 197 1 , 1 98 1 ; Webster & Sobieszek 1974). The reemergence of the self-concept is even more dramatic within psycho­ logical social psychology. Much of this revitalization of interest in self­ phenomena (e.g. self-awareness, self-esteem, self-image, self-evaluation) is due to the ""cognitive revolution"" in psychology (Dember 1974; Manis 1977), generally at the expense of behaviorism.

Several studies have been conducted comprising of classical human human interaction and human computer interaction. They concluded that for intelligent interaction, emotions play an important role. By embedding the emotions in the interaction of human with machine, machine would be in a position to sense the mood of the user and change its interaction accordingly. Hence the system will be friendlier to the user and its responses will be more similar to human behaviour. In general, human beings make use of emotions through speech, facial expression and gestures for conveying the crucial information. This paper presents an attempt to recognize selected emotion categories from keyboard stroke pattern. The emotional categories considered for our analysis are neutral, positive and negative. We have used various classifiers like Simple Logistics, SMO, Multilayer Perceptron, Random Tree, J48 and BF Tree, which is a part of WEKA tool, to analyse the selected features from keyboard stroke pattern.","[{'authorId': '2249144228', 'name': 'Preeti Khanna'}]",91.0,,16.0,Recognising Emotions from Keyboard Stroke Pattern,2010.0
4aa9b1c9078b596c5daaf4d51e729c16163d5dac,"In social interactions, humans are expected to regulate interpersonal distance in response to the emotion displayed by others. Yet, the neural mechanisms implicated in approach‐avoidance tendencies to distinct emotional expressions have not been fully described. Here, we investigated the neural systems implicated in regulating the distance to different emotions, and how they vary as a function of empathy. Twenty‐three healthy participants assessed for psychopathic traits underwent fMRI scanning while they viewed approaching and withdrawing angry, fearful, happy, sad and neutral faces. Participants were also asked to set the distance to those faces on a computer screen, and to adjust the physical distance from the experimenter outside the scanner. Participants kept the greatest distances from angry faces, and shortest from happy expressions. This was accompanied by increased activation in the dorsomedial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices, inferior frontal gyrus, and temporoparietal junction for angry and happy expressions relative to the other emotions. Irrespective of emotion, longer distances were kept from approaching faces, which was associated with increased activation in the amygdala and insula, as well as parietal and prefrontal regions. Amygdala activation was positively correlated with greater preferred distances to angry, fearful and sad expressions. Moreover, participants scoring higher on coldhearted psychopathic traits (lower empathy) showed reduced amygdala activation to sad expressions. These findings elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying social approach‐avoidance, and how they are related to variations in empathy.

Method: Two hundred and sixty clinicians completed an on-line survey that was disseminated through professional brain injury organisations. Of respondents around 90% were allied health clinicians, with the remainder comprising medical, nursing and academia. Main outcomes: The four areas of social cognition that were routinely assessed across the disciplines were insight, disinhibition, anger and social adjustment. The least routinely assessed areas were theory of mind and alexithymia. The test suggested most likely to identify social cognition impairments was The Awareness of Social Inference Test, although only 8% of clinicians responded to this question. Clinicians preferred informal assessment methods over standardised assessment methods for identifying social cognition rehabilitation goals. Higher levels of education were associated with greater use of standardised assessment modalities. Whilst there was paucity of responses overall, TBI Express was most commonly used for social cognition rehabilitation. Conclusions: Considering the high prevalence of social cognition impairments in this population, formal assessment is extremely limited. The under-utilisation of assessment tools is problematic for the assessment and rehabilitation initiatives offered to people with TBI. These results have implications for the training of clinicians working in brain injury rehabilitation.","[{'authorId': '8060857', 'name': 'M. Kelly'}, {'authorId': '143982280', 'name': 'S.

Acceptance of these synthetic characters depends on their ability to properly and recognizably convey basic emotion states to a user population. This study presents an analysis of the interaction between emotional audio (human voice) and video (simple animation) cues. The emotional relevance of the channels is analyzed with respect to their effect on human perception and through the study of the extracted audio-visual features that contribute most prominently to human perception. As a result of the unequal level of expressivity across the two channels, the audio was shown to bias the perception of the evaluators. However, even in the presence of a strong audio bias, the video data were shown to affect human perception. The feature sets extracted from emotionally matched audio-visual displays contained both audio and video features while feature sets resulting from emotionally mismatched audio-visual displays contained only audio information. This result indicates that observers integrate natural audio cues and synthetic video cues only when the information expressed is in congruence. It is therefore important to properly design the presentation of audio-visual cues as incorrect design may cause observers to ignore the information conveyed in one of the channels.","[{'authorId': '2523983', 'name': 'E.

Participants were presented with one of two virtual human conditions in a between-subjects experiment, static (non-animated) and dynamic (animated). Our objective measures included the use of psycho-physical Electro Dermal Activity (EDA) sensors, and subjective measures inspired by social psychology research included the Differential Emotions Survey (DES IV) and Positive and Negative Affect Survey (PANAS). We analyzed the quantitative and qualitative measures associated with participants' emotional state at four distinct time-steps in the simulated interpersonal experience as the virtual patient's medical condition deteriorated. Results suggest that participants in the dynamic condition with animations exhibited a higher sense of co-presence and greater emotional response as compared to participants in the static condition, corresponding to the deterioration in the medical condition of the virtual patient. Negative affect of participants in the dynamic condition increased at a higher rate than for participants in the static condition. The virtual human animations elicited a stronger response in negative emotions such as anguish, fear, and anger as the virtual patient's medical condition worsened.","[{'authorId': '2134149709', 'name': 'Yanxiang Wu'}, {'authorId': '144403504', 'name': 'Sabarish V.

Nonverbal gestures such as facial expressions are important to human communication and should be considered by speech-driven face animation systems. In this paper, we present a framework that systematically addresses facial deformation modeling, automatic facial motion analysis, and real-time speech-driven face animation with expression using neural networks. Based on this framework, we learn a quantitative visual representation of the facial deformations, called the motion units (MUs). A facial deformation can be approximated by a linear combination of the MUs weighted by MU parameters (MUPs). We develop an MU-based facial motion tracking algorithm which is used to collect an audio-visual training database. Then, we construct a real-time audio-to-MUP mapping by training a set of neural networks using the collected audio-visual training database. The quantitative evaluation of the mapping shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Using the proposed method, we develop the functionality of real-time speech-driven face animation with expressions for the iFACE system. Experimental results show that the synthetic expressive talking face of the iFACE system is comparable with a real face in terms of the effectiveness of their influences on bimodal human emotion perception.","[{'authorId': '8824068', 'name': 'P.

However, understanding their impact requires taking into account that inhibition is not a unitary construct, but consists of distinct functions underlain by specific mechanisms. In this study, 88 participants performed two emotional versions of classic laboratory tasks designed to assess (1) the ability to inhibit a prepotent response (a stop-signal task using faces with different emotional expressions) and (2) the capacity to resist the effect of proactive interference (PI; a recent negative task that included emotional words). Overall results showed that emotional stimuli interfered with inhibition capacities in both tasks. Although tending in the same direction, these results suggest that different underlying mechanisms (e.g., top-down vs. bottom-up processes) or consecutive differences in emotional processing (e.g., different interactions with stimulus/task properties, processing stages or motivational aspects) are at play in these two inhibition-related functions.","[{'authorId': '5506164', 'name': 'Marie My Lien Rebetez'}, {'authorId': '4231942', 'name': 'L.

Communication and roles are added to achieve individualistic behaviors and a realistic way to spread information about the environment. To expand the range of realistic human behaviors, we use a system (PMFserv) that implements human behavior models from a range of ability, stress, emotion, decision theoretic and motivation sources.

A few studies on virtual reality have been conducted with people suffering from OCD, but they all focus on the subtype characterized by checking rituals. The goal of this study is to confirm the potential of a “contaminated” virtual environment in inducing anxiety in 12 adults suffering from contamination-subtype OCD compared to 20 adults without OCD (N = 32) using a within-between protocol. Subjective (questionnaire) and objective (heart rate) measurements were compiled.

Immersions were conducted in a 6-wall CAVE-like system. As hypothesized, the results of repeated-measures ANCOVAs revealed the significant impact of immersion in a filthy public restroom for participants suffering from OCD on both measures. Presence was correlated with anxiety in OCD participants and no difference in presence was observed between groups. Unwanted negative side effects induced by immersions in virtual reality were higher in the OCD group.

4e3fbf9d06210b556b27b6ae720266113dac4092,"Two studies established the psychometric properties of two friendship questionnaires; one taps respondents' feelings for a friend and satisfaction with the friendship, the other, respondents' assessments of the degree to which a friend fulfills six friendship functions (stimulating companionship, help, intimacy, reliable alliance, self-validation, and emotional security). Factor analysis confirmed the subscale structure of each questionnaire. The subscales showed high internal consistency, distinguished best from casual friends, and did not covary with social desirability. They did covary with the duration of being a best friend and with a self-esteem subscale regarding close friends, but not with other self-esteem measures. Women reported higher positive feelings for their friend than did men, and evaluated the friend higher on friendship functions. Finally, positive feelings and satisfaction covaried with each friendship function subscale. The research here concerns the development and validation of two multi-scale friendship questionnaires-one concerning a respondent's feelings for a friend and friendship, the other concerning the respondent's assessment of the degree to which the friend fulfills six friendship functions. The studies grew out of work on friendship quality in children and young adolescents (Aboud & Mendelson, 1996; Mendelson, Aboud, & Lanthier, 1994). The goal here was to design measures, based on a similar model of friendship, suitable for late adolescents and young adults. Friendships, like other relationships, vary in quality. Although it is difficult to judge friendship quality in behavioral terms, length of the relationship and reciprocated versus nonreciprocated nominations are gross criterion measures of friendship quality. Furthermore, individuals can specify types of friendships, distinguishing, for example, between best friends, good friends, casual friends, and acquaintances (i.e., nonfriends); and such distinctions are also gross criterion measures of quality. Gender also provides a criterion for validating friendship measures, because there is ample evidence that gender differences do exist, with women's friendships characterized by better overall quality, closeness, enjoyment, intimacy, and nurturance (e.g., Bell, 1991; Jones, 1991; Sapadin, 1988; Wright & Scanlon, 1991). Thus, any friendship measure should be sensitive enough to differentiate women's and men's friendships. At the most general level, relationships can be assessed as positive or negative. In these terms, friendship scales have been developed to assess attachment to the friend and conflict.2 Attachment refers to the special 1This paper was completed in 1997; we subsequently published a brief version (Mendelson & Aboud, 1999). Part of the research was presented as a poster (Measuring Friendship Quality in Late Adolescents and Young Adults) at the American Psychological Association, Toronto, ON, August, 1996. We heartily thank the following: Jocelyne Andrews, Sophie Beugnot, Lisa Seidel, and Tsafrir Vanounou collected data reported here as part of their undergraduate theses. Rhonda Amsel offered excellent statistical advice. Finally, Barry Corenblum, Richard Koestner, and Debbie Moskowitz constructively criticized a draft of the manuscript.

Send correspondence to Morton J. Mendelson (morton.mendelson@mcgill.ca). 2Conflict, which might be considered the opposite of attachment, can certainly be an important aspect of any relationship. Indeed, friends often have conflicts, but may nonetheless be able to resolve them equitably and without bad feelings (Hartup, Laursen, Stewart & Eastenson, 1988). Thus, numerous friendship measures have subscales related to conflict or conflict resolution (Bukowski et al., 1994; Furman & Adler, 1982; Furman McGill Friendship Questionnaires 2 feelings that individuals have for a friend. Mutual liking has often been used as a criterion to identify a friend, but a separate subscale may be used to assess liking in greater depth (cf. Bukowski, Hoza, & Boivin, 1994; Sharabany, 1974; Wright, 1991). One of the measures reported here, taps positive feelings for the friend and satisfaction with the friendship, which will be viewed as criterion measures of undifferentiated friendship quality. Although the two measures are conceptually distinct, they should covary highly because they are both assumed to reflect overall friendship quality. However, an important assumption guiding research on friendship is that it is possible to assess specific qualities of friendships. Consideration of the theoretical foundations of various scales suggested that a framework based on friendship functions (Furman & Buhrmester, 1985; Parker & Asher, 1989)--rather than specific behaviors (Bukowski, et al. 1994; Sharabany, Gershoni, & Hofman, 1981) or motives (Wright, 1991)-is preferable for a number of reasons: It provides a broader scope, yields a better ideal for a mature relationship, and makes it possible to develop analogous, if not identical, measures for different developmental stages. Within a functional approach, a friend is seen as a source of certain social, emotional and instrumental resources that a person seeks (Asher & Parker, 1989; Weiss, 1974). In a review of existing measures (Aboud & Mendelson, 1992), we sought to define friendship functions that were theoretically distinct, that distinguished between friends and nonfriends, and that were associated with affection/satisfaction. We identified six relevant functions (stimulating companionship, help, intimacy, reliable alliance, self-validation and, emotional security). It is assumed that individual friends fulfill some, if not all, of these functions, so measures of the different functions should covary. Nonetheless, the following definitions describe what are clearly six conceptually distinguishable functions of friendship: Stimulating Companionship refers to doing things together that arouse enjoyment, amusement, and excitement. This quality seems to be an important expectation of friends at all ages. Some measures have focused mainly on doing things together (Buhrmester, 1990; Bukowski et al., 1994; Parker & Asher, 1989; Sharabany, 1974), but it seems important to stress the fun and excitement in common activities (Jones, 1991; Wright, 1991). Help refers to providing guidance, assistance, information, advice, and other forms of tangible aid necessary to meet needs or goals. Thus, it need not be reciprocal (Jones, 1991). Help has been assessed in specific subscales (Bukowski et al., 1994; Parker & Asher, 1989; Wright, 1991) and it has also been combined with support (Bukowski et al., 1994; Sharabany, 1974). However, the instrumental aspect of support tapped by help is distinguishable from other aspects of support tapped by Emotional Security and Self-Validation. Intimacy refers to sensitivity to the other's needs and states, providing an accepting context in which personal thoughts and feelings can be openly and honestly expressed, and openly and honestly disclosing personal information about oneself. A number of researchers have Intimacy subscales (e.g., Buhrmester & Furman, 1987), although Mannarino (1976) and Buhrmester (1990) assess it as a composite along with companionship. Sharabany's (1974) Sensitivity and Knowing subscale stresses the importance of knowing without any explicit disclosure. Wright (1991) does not include such a subscale except as it pertains to selfaffirmation or the expression of true feelings. Reliable Alliance refers to being able to count on the continuing availability and loyalty of the friend. This was an important dimension underlying Selman's (1980) distinction between a fair-weather friend who would end the relationship if conflict or strains arose and a more durable friend. It is assessed in a specific Conflict and Betrayal subscale (Parker & Asher, 1989) and in a Trust and Loyalty subscale (Sharabany, 1974). Bukowski and colleagues' (1994) Reliable Alliance subscale concerns self-disclosure, which is referred to here & Buhrmester, 1985; Parker and Asher, 1989; Wright, 1991). However, these constructs are not theoretically analogous to the six friendship functions considered here. Therefore, we are currently developing separate instruments to tap negative feelings for a friend and the incidence of conflict and conflict resolution in a friendship. McGill Friendship Questionnaires 3 as Intimacy; but they combine it with a Transcending Problems subscale that is closer to the definition of Reliable Alliance. Self-Validation refers to perceiving the other as reassuring, agreeing, encouraging, listening, and otherwise helping to maintain one's self-image as a competent and worthwhile person. This is often achieved through social comparison and consensual validation of one's attributes and beliefs. Similar items have been referred to as Attachment (Sharabany, 1974), as Ego Support and Self-Affirmation (Wright, 1991), and as Reflected Appraisal (Bukowski et al., 1994), although that was combined with an Affective Bond subscale as part of Closeness. Emotional Security refers to the comfort and confidence provided by the friend in novel or threatening situations. Although the emotional support provided by a friend is considered to be important, only Wright (1991) includes items in a Security subscale to assess perception of the friend as safe and unthreatening because he or she does not betray one's trust or draw attention to one's weaknesses. Besides assessing the respondent's feelings for the friend and satisfaction with the friendship, it seems important to choose between assessing the functions that the friend is perceived to fulfill and the functions that the respondent reportedly fulfills.

The architecture is a form of Memory Network [23] but unlike the model in that work, it is trained end-to-end, and hence requires significantly less supervision during training, making it more generally applicable in realistic settings. It can also be seen as an extension of RNNsearch [2] to the case where multiple computational steps (hops) are performed per output symbol. The flexibility of the model allows us to apply it to tasks as diverse as (synthetic) question answering [22] and to language modeling. For the former our approach is competitive with Memory Networks, but with less supervision. For the latter, on the Penn TreeBank and Text8 datasets our approach demonstrates comparable performance to RNNs and LSTMs. In both cases we show that the key concept of multiple computational hops yields improved results.","[{'authorId': '2265067', 'name': 'Sainbayar Sukhbaatar'}, {'authorId': '3149531', 'name': 'Arthur Szlam'}, {'authorId': '145183709', 'name': 'J.

Yet, due to the ethical controversy that his experiments ignited, it is nowadays impossible to carry out direct experimental studies in this area. In the study reported in this paper, we have used a similar paradigm to the one used by Milgram within an immersive virtual environment. Our objective has not been the study of obedience in itself, but of the extent to which participants would respond to such an extreme social situation as if it were real in spite of their knowledge that no real events were taking place. Methodology Following the style of the original experiments, the participants were invited to administer a series of word association memory tests to the (female) virtual human representing the stranger. When she gave an incorrect answer, the participants were instructed to administer an ‘electric shock’ to her, increasing the voltage each time. She responded with increasing discomfort and protests, eventually demanding termination of the experiment. Of the 34 participants, 23 saw and heard the virtual human, and 11 communicated with her only through a text interface. Conclusions Our results show that in spite of the fact that all participants knew for sure that neither the stranger nor the shocks were real, the participants who saw and heard her tended to respond to the situation at the subjective, behavioural and physiological levels as if it were real. This result reopens the door to direct empirical studies of obedience and related extreme social situations, an area of research that is otherwise not open to experimental study for ethical reasons, through the employment of virtual environments.","[{'authorId': '144931212', 'name': 'M.

Many of the human-human social rules that have been well researched and defined in social psychology also seem to apply in human-computer interaction (HCI). This presents an opportunity for computers to use many of the principles and rules from human-human interaction and utilise them for enhancing HCI. One such set of principles that have been extensively investigated and examined in social psychology are influence strategies. A number of different approaches and techniques can be used to influence another’s attitudes and behaviour. These persuasive techniques could potentially be used by computers to influence or change user attitudes and behaviour for beneficial purposes (e.g. smoking cessation or improving exercise behaviour). In this project I will investigate how we respond to interface agents which make use of influence strategies when attempting to change our attitudes and behaviour toward eating. The manipulation of emotions is an essential aspect of attitude and behaviour change and it is proposed that the role of emotion in HCI will also be investigated. Interface designers often incorporate emotional expressions and statements into interface agents, through the use of textual content, synthetic or recorded speech, embodied characters, or multimedia video, without an understanding of the psychological impact on users. Moreover, it is largely unknown how strong user responses are to the synthetic emotional expressions made by computers. I will attempt to address these issues through three different investigations. Firstly, an examination of how users respond to the emotional expressions of different types of interface agents will be undertaken. Secondly, an investigation will be conducted to help understand whether agents that make use of influence strategies are able to influence or change user attitudes and behaviour more effectively than agents which do not. Finally, I will test whether emotional interface agents (which employ influence tactics) are able to influence or change user attitudes and behaviour more effectively than unemotional agents.","[{'authorId': '3134697', 'name': 'C.

We investigate a variety of methods to mitigate these issues in the context of open-domain generative dialogue models. We introduce a new human-and-model-in-the-loop framework for both training safer models and for evaluating them, as well as a novel method to distill safety considerations inside generative models without the use of an external classifier at deployment time. We conduct experiments comparing these methods and find our new techniques are (i) safer than existing models as measured by automatic and human evaluations while (ii) maintaining usability metrics such as engagingness relative to the state of the art.

CT was designed to enable investigation of properties of decision-making strategies in multi-agent situations of varying complexity. The paper presents the results of an initial series of experiments of CT games in which agentsý choices affected not only their own outcomes but also the outcomes of other agents. It compares the behavior of people with that of computer agents deploying a variety of decision-making strategies. The results align with behavioral economics studies in showing that people cooperate when they play and that factors of social dependency influence their levels of cooperation. Preliminary results indicate that people design agents to play strategies closer to game-theory predictions, yielding lower utility. Additional experiments show that such agents perform worse than agents designed to make choices that resemble human cooperative behavior. The paper describes challenges raised by these results for designers of agents, especially agents that need to operate in heterogeneous groups that include people.","[{'authorId': '1692242', 'name': 'B.

We extended an existing text dialogue corpus by adding variations of emotional responses to cover different combinations of broad dialogue context and a variety of emotional states by crowd-sourcing.

508e75ab4b16abe288230156e5b88428ce446c2f,"Background Many adolescents in special education are affected by anxiety in addition to their behavioral problems. Anxiety leads to substantial long-term problems and may underlie disruptive behaviors in the classroom as a result of the individual’s inability to tolerate anxiety-provoking situations. Thus, interventions in special needs schools that help adolescents cope with anxiety and, in turn, diminish disruptive classroom behaviors are needed. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a virtual reality biofeedback game, DEEP, on daily levels of state-anxiety and disruptive classroom behavior in a clinical sample. In addition, the study also aimed to examine the duration of the calm or relaxed state after playing DEEP. Methods A total of 8 adolescents attending a special secondary school for students with behavioral and psychiatric problems participated in a single-case experimental ABAB study. Over a 4-week period, participants completed 6 DEEP sessions. In addition, momentary assessments (ie, 3 times a day) of self-reported state-anxiety and teacher-reported classroom behavior were collected throughout all A and B phases. Results From analyzing the individual profiles, it was found that 6 participants showed reductions in anxiety, and 5 participants showed reductions in disruptive classroom behaviors after the introduction of DEEP. On a group level, results showed a small but significant reduction of anxiety (d=–0.29) and a small, nonsignificant reduction of disruptive classroom behavior (d=−0.16) on days when participants played DEEP. Moreover, it was found that the calm or relaxed state of participants after playing DEEP lasted for about 2 hours on average. Conclusions This study demonstrates the potential of the game, DEEP, as an intervention for anxiety and disruptive classroom behavior in a special school setting. Future research is needed to fully optimize and personalize DEEP as an intervention for the heterogeneous special school population.","[{'authorId': '1589467497', 'name': 'Rineke Bossenbroek'}, {'authorId': '5712457', 'name': 'A.

To this end, the Spanish adaptation of the CER-Q and the Spanish adaptation of the STAI were applied to a sample of 266 high school students. A multiple linear regression model was proposed, where anxiety level was the dependent variable, and the use frequencies of emotional regulation strategies were the independent variables. Gender was also considered as an independent variable since the data showed differences in anxiety level and in the use of emotional regulation strategies between male and female subjects. The model explained 46.3% of the variance, and the predictive variables were Self-blame, Positive Reinterpretation, Catastrophizing, Rumination and gender. Based on the findings and the previous literature, it is suggested that the use of adaptive strategies of emotional regulation promotes lower levels of anxiety, and the use of maladaptive strategies results in higher levels of anxiety.","[{'authorId': '113492372', 'name': 'Macarena Verónica del Valle'}, {'authorId': '146581384', 'name': 'Elena Betegón'}, {'authorId': '2091091747', 'name': 'M.

The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure.

Methods This was a pragmatic, multicentre, three arm, parallel randomised controlled trial with simple randomisation. Treatment allocation was not blinded. Participants were adults with symptoms of depression (score ≥10 on nine item patient health questionnaire, PHQ-9) who were randomised to receive a commercially produced cCBT programme (“Beating the Blues”) or a free to use cCBT programme (MoodGYM) in addition to usual GP care. Participants were supported and encouraged to complete the programme via weekly telephone calls. Control participants were offered usual GP care, with no constraints on the range of treatments that could be accessed. The primary outcome was severity of depression assessed with the PHQ-9 at four months. Secondary outcomes included health related quality of life (measured by SF-36) and psychological wellbeing (measured by CORE-OM) at four, 12, and 24 months and depression at 12 and 24 months. Study answer and limitations Participants offered commercial or free to use cCBT experienced no additional improvement in depression compared with usual GP care at four months (odds ratio 1.19 (95% confidence interval 0.75 to 1.88) for Beating the Blues v usual GP care; 0.98 (0.62 to 1.56) for MoodGYM v usual GP care). There was no evidence of an overall difference between either programme compared with usual GP care (0.99 (0.57 to 1.70) and 0.68 (0.42 to 1.10), respectively) at any time point. Commercially provided cCBT conferred no additional benefit over free to use cCBT or usual GP care at any follow-up point. Uptake and use of cCBT was low, despite regular telephone support. Nearly a quarter of participants (24%) had dropped out by four months. The study did not have enough power to detect small differences so these cannot be ruled out. Findings cannot be generalised to cCBT offered with a much higher level of guidance and support. What this study adds Supported cCBT does not substantially improve depression outcomes compared with usual GP care alone. In this study, neither a commercially available nor free to use computerised CBT intervention was superior to usual GP care.

Whether we believe a message depends not only on its content but also on our model of the communicator. The actions we take are influenced by how we believe others will react. However, theory of mind is usually ignored in computational models of social interaction. In this paper, we present PsychSim, an implemented multiagent-based simulation tool for modeling interactions and influence among groups or individuals. Each agent has its own decision-theoretic model of the world, including beliefs about its environment and recursive models of other agents. Having thus given the agents a theory of mind, PsychSim also provides them with a psychologically motivated mechanism for updating their beliefs in response to actions and messages of other agents. We discuss PsychSim and present an example of its operation.","[{'authorId': '1748597', 'name': 'D. Pynadath'}]",178.0,,18.0,PsychSim: Agent-based Modeling of Social Interactions and Influence,2004.0

Effective face-to-face treatments are Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT) and Problem Solving Treatment (PST). However, about two-thirds of persons who die by suicide have not been in contact with mental health care services in the preceding year, and many have never been treated. Furthermore, many patients do not disclose their suicidal thoughts to their care provider. This may be out of shame, due to fear of stigma or due to lack of trust in (mental) health care. Since many suicidal individuals seek information online, the internet provides an opportunity to reach suicidal individuals who would not be contacted otherwise. By providing a self-help intervention online, persons can anonymously learn to gain control over their suicidal thoughts. There is convincing evidence that self-help is effective for a number of mental disorders. In this study the effectiveness for suicidal thoughts is examined.Methods/DesignIn this study, a recently developed self-help intervention will be evaluated in a Randomized Controlled Trial. The intervention is based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and is aimed at subjects who experience mild to moderate suicidal thoughts. This is defined as a score between 1 and 26 on the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSS). Higher and lower scores are excluded. In addition, severely depressed subjects are excluded. In total, 260 subjects will be randomly allocated to the intervention-condition (N = 130) or to the information-control condition (N = 130). Self-report questionnaires will be filled out at baseline, 6 weeks after baseline and 18 weeks after baseline. Primary outcome measure is the reduction in frequency and intensity of suicidal thoughts. Secondary outcome measures are the reduction of hopelessness, anxiety and depression, sleeplessness, worry and quality of life measures.DiscussionThis study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based self-help intervention for suicidal thoughts.

53052e7b5d0ffb9f5626d769e07295dfd838a4b9,"In my first major effort at elaborating Differential Emotions Theory (DET), I proposed that personality was a supersystem consisting of five separate though highly interacting subsystems (Izard, 1971). The emotions were conceived as one of the subsystems of personality, and, following Tomkins (1962), the emotions were viewed as the primary motivational system for human behavior. Furthermore, each discrete emotion was interpreted as a system with distinct though interacting components. Although DET has changed to accommodate new thought and data, the essence of the systems approach has remained integral (cf. Izard et al., 1995). The systems concept is important in presenting a perspective on facial expressions, because the perspective I present hinges on the concepts of systems and separate, dissociable components. Facial expression (as well as vocal, postural, gestural expression) is conceived as an evolved, genetically influenced but highly modifiable and dissociable component of emotion. However, as stated on previous occasions (e.g., Izard, 1977), observable expression is not viewed as a necessary component of emotion . One goal of this chapter is to summarize the argument for this position and to place it in perspective by addressing two kinds of counterarguments, argument against the evolutionary-genetic origin of facial expressions and argument against their links to emotion (feeling/motivational) states. Another goal is to reaffirm the theoretical significance of the concept of patterns. In DET, the term pattern refers to one of two phenomena: A set of movements that index a discrete emotion or a set or cluster of discrete emotions that interact to produce complex affective phenomena such as anxiety and depression (Izard & Youngstrom, 1996).","[{'authorId': '38430881', 'name': 'C.

In this study, 268 users assessed the usability of 20 different products retrospectively with the SUS. Five broad personality traits were then measured using the Mini-IPIP scale.

532ce26200b801b8ab6f7332f92dfc7213bb00b8,"The question of whether there are different patterns of autonomic nervous system responses for different emotions is examined. Relevant conceptual issues concerning both the nature of emotion and the structure of the autonomic nervous system are discussed in the context of the development of research methods appropriate for studying this question. Are different emotional states associated with distinct patterns of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity? This is an old question that is currently enjoying a modest revival in psychology. In the 1950s autonomic specificity was a key item on the agenda of the newly emerging discipline of psychophysiology, which saw as its mission the scientific exploration of the mind-body relationship using the tools of electrophysiological measurement. But the field of psychophysiology had the misfortune of coming of age during a period in which psychology drifted away from its physiological roots, a period in which psychology was dominated by learning, behaviourism, personality theory and later by cognition. Psychophysiology in the period between 1960 and 1980 reflected these broader trends in psychology by focusing on such issues as autonomic markers of perceptual states (e.g. orienting, stimulus processing), the interplay between personality factors and ANS responsivity, operant conditioning of autonomic functions, and finally, electrophysiological markers of cognitive states. Research on autonomic specificity in emotion became increasingly rare. Perhaps as a result of these historical trends in psychology, or perhaps because research on emotion and physiology is so difficult to do well, there 18 SOCIAL PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY AND EMOTION exists only a small body of studies on ANS specificity. Although almost all of these studies report some evidence for the existence of specificity, the prevailing zeitgeist has been that specificity has not been empirically established. At this point in time a review of the existing literature would not be very informative, for it would inevitably dissolve into a critique of methods. Instead, what I hope to accomplish in this chapter is to provide a new framework for thinking about ANS specificity, and to propose guidelines for carrying out research on this issue that will be cognizant of the recent methodological and theoretical advances that have been made both in psychophysiology and in research on emotion. Emotion as organization From the outset, the definition of emotion that underlies this chapter should be made explicit. For me the essential function of emotion is organization. The selection of emotion for preservation across time and species is based on the need for an efficient mechanism than can mobilize and organize disparate response systems to deal with environmental events that pose a threat to survival. In this view the prototypical context for human emotions is those situations in which a multi-system response must be organized quickly, where time is not available for the lengthy processes of deliberation, reformulation, planning and rehearsal; where a fine degree of co-ordination is required among systems as disparate as the muscles of the face and the organs of the viscera; and where adaptive behaviours that normally reside near the bottom of behavioural hierarchies must be instantaneously shifted to the top. Specificity versus undifferentiated arousal In this model of emotion as organization it is assumed that each component system is capable of a number of different responses, and that the emotion will guide the selection of responses from each system. Component systems differ in terms of the number of response possibilities. Thus, in the facial expressive system a selection must be made among a limited set of prototypic emotional expressions (which are but a subset of the enormous number of expressions the face is capable of assuming). A motor behaviour must also be selected from a similarly reduced set of responses consisting of fighting, fleeing, freezing, hiding, etc. All major theories of emotion would accept the proposition that activation of the ANS is one of the changes that occur during emotion. But theories differ as to how many different ANS patterns constitute the set of selection possibilities. At one extreme are those who would argue that there are only two ANS patterns: 'off' and 'on'. The 'on' ANS pattern, according to this view, consists EMOTION AND THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 19 of a high-level, global, diffuse ANS activation, mediated primarily by the sympathetic branch of the ANS. The manifestations of this pattern rapid and forcefulcontractions of the heart, rapid and deep breathing, increased systolic blood pressure, sweating, dry mouth, redirection of blood flow to large skeletal muscles, peripheral vasoconstriction, release of large amounts of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla, and the resultant release of glucose from the liver are well known. Cannon (1927) described this pattern in some detail, arguing that this kind of high-intensity, undifferentiated arousal accompanied all emotions .. Among contemporary theories the notion of undifferentiated arousal is most clearly found in Mandler's theory (Mandler, 1975). However, undifferentiated arousal also played a major role in the extraordinarily influential cognitive/physiological theory of Schachter and Singer (1962). According to this theory, undifferentiated arousal is a necessary precondition for emotionan extremely plastic medium to be moulded by cognitive processes working in concert with the available cues from the social environment. At the other extreme are those who argue that there are a large number of patterns of ANS activation, each associated with a different emotion (or subset of emotions). This is the traditional specificity position. Its classic statement is often attributed to James (1884), although Alexander (1950) provided an even more radical version. The specificity position fuelled a number of experimental studies in the 1950s and 1960s, all attempting to identify some of these autonomic patterns (e.g. Averill, 1969; Ax, 1953; Funkenstein, King and Drolette, 1954; Schachter, 1957; Sternbach, 1962). Despite these studies, all of which reported support for ANS specificity, the undifferentiated arousal theory, especially as formulated by Schachter and Singer (1962) and their followers, has been dominant for a great many years. Is the ANS capable of specific action No matter how appealing the notion of ANS specificity might be in the abstract, there would be little reason to pursue it in the laboratory if the ANS were only capable of producing one pattern of arousal. There is no question that the pattern of high-level sympathetic arousal described earlier is one pattern that the ANS can produce. Cannon's arguments notwithstanding, I believe there now is quite ample evidence that the ANS is capable of a number of different patterns of activation. Whether these patterns are reliably associated with different emotions remains an empirical question, but the potential is surely there. A case in support of this potential for specificity can be based on: (a) the neural structure of the ANS; (b) the stimulation neurochemistry of the ANS; and (c) empirical findings. 20 SOCIAL PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY AND EMOTION","[{'authorId': '2001910', 'name': 'R.

Virtual faces with human expressiveness are usually designed with a limited amount of facial regulators. Such regulators are derived from the facial muscle parts that are concurrently activated. Common tools for editing such facial expressions use slider-based interfaces where only a single input at a time is possible. Novel input devices, such as gamepads or data gloves, which allow parallel editing, could not only speed up editing, but also simplify the composition of new facial expressions. We created a virtual face with 23 facial controls and connected it with a slider-based GUI, a gamepad, and a data glove.

Unlike simple regression/correlation, rmcorr does not violate the assumption of independence of observations. Also, rmcorr tends to have much greater statistical power because neither averaging nor aggregation is necessary for an intra-individual research question. Rmcorr estimates the common regression slope, the association shared among individuals.

The ‘Emotion Mirror’ is an example of a system where the user’s emotions are reflected back to the user, and hence allows to train emotion management and regulation. The ‘Emphatic Companion’ is an extension of the previous system employing a decision-theoretic embodied agent that adapts its behavior depending the recognized emotional state of the user, e.g. by giving support and encouragement.

The main goal is to individuate a minimal representation of emotional displays based on nonverbal gesture features. The GEMEP (Geneva multimodal emotion portrayals) corpus was used to validate this framework. Twelve emotions expressed by 10 actors form the selected data set of emotion portrayals. Visual tracking of trajectories of head and hands were performed from a frontal and a lateral view. Postural/shape and dynamic expressive gesture features were identified and analyzed. A feature reduction procedure was carried out, resulting in a 4D model of emotion expression that effectively classified/grouped emotions according to their valence (positive, negative) and arousal (high, low). These results show that emotionally relevant information can be detected/measured/obtained from the dynamic qualities of gesture. The framework was implemented as software modules (plug-ins) extending the EyesWeb XMI Expressive Gesture Processing Library and is going to be used in user centric, networked media applications, including future mobiles, characterized by low computational resources, and limited sensor systems.","[{'authorId': '2162070', 'name': 'D.

Numerous authors associate child abuse with serious long-term consequences to the general and psychological well-being in particular. Clinical research to date reveals strong correlation between childhood abuse and neglect and anxiety disorders, especially panic disorder.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
This study was conducted in order to assess the level of emotional, physical and sexual childhood abuse as well as the physical and emotional childhood neglect in 40 adult patients suffering from panic disorder, diagnosed in accordance with the 10th International Classification of Disorders diagnostic criteria, compared with the control group of 40 healthy test subjects without a history of psychiatric disorders, using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. The severity of the clinical manifestation in patients with panic disorder was assessed using the Panic Disorder Severity Scale.


RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
There were no significant differences between the groups as to the level of sexual abuse and physical neglect, whereas in the group of patients with panic disorder, the level of physical and emotional abuse was significantly higher, with emphasis on emotional neglect. With regards to the correlation between the severity of the clinical manifestation in patients with panic disorder and the severity of suffered abuse and neglect in childhood age, significant correlation was found in the physical and emotional abuse as well as emotional neglect. There was no significant correlation in the aspect of the physical neglect and sexual abuse.


CONCLUSION
Our research underlines the importance of childhood physical abuse, and especially emotional abuse and emotional neglect in the occurrence of panic disorder later in life.","[{'authorId': '49108284', 'name': 'D.

Tracking is a more complex problem than speech-to-text alignment, since presenters rarely follow their exact presentation notes, and it must be performed in realtime. In this paper, we propose a novel system that can track the current degree of coverage of each slide’s contents. To do this, the presentation notes for each slide are segmented into sentences, and the words are filtered into keyword candidates. These candidates are then scored based on word specificity and semantic similarity measures to find the most useful keywords for the tracking task. Real-time automatic speech recognition results are matched against the keywords and their synonyms. Sentences are scored based on detected keywords, and the ones with scores higher than a threshold are tagged as covered. We manually and automatically annotated 150 slide presentation recordings to evaluate the system. A simple tracking method, matching speech recognition results against the notes, was used as the baseline. The results show that our approach led to higher accuracy measures compared to the baseline method.","[{'authorId': '145216113', 'name': 'R. Asadi'}, {'authorId': '1738306', 'name': 'H.

Within-session process outcomes (subjective units of distress and belief ratings on individual behavioral experiments), as well as patient feedback, generated the hypothesis that this type of virtual environment can potentially add value to CBT by helping patients understand the role of avoidance and safety behaviors in the maintenance of social anxiety and paranoia and by boosting their confidence to carry out ""real-life"" behavioral experiments.","[{'authorId': '2322850', 'name': 'L.

Many actions in the real world require that people act without prior planning, and these actions are executed quite successfully. In this paper, we study the common action of two people passing through an aperture together in both the real world (Experiment 1) and in a distributed, collaborative IVE (Experiment 2). The aperture's width is varied from too narrow to be passable to so wide as to be easily passable by both participants together simultaneously. We do this in the real world for all possible gender-based pairings. In virtual reality, however, there is potential for the gender of the participant and the gender of the self-avatar to be different. We also investigate the joint action for all possible gender-based pairings in the distributed IVE. Results indicated that, in the real world, social dynamics between gendered pairings emerged; male-male pairings refused to concede to one another until absolutely necessary while other pairings did not. Male-female pairings were most likely to provide ample space to one another during passage. These behaviors seemed not to appear in the IVE, and avatar gender across all pairings generated no significant behavioral differences. In addition, participants tended to require wider gaps to allow for passage in the IVE. These findings establish base knowledge of social dynamics and affordance behaviors within multi-user IVEs.","[{'authorId': '1693375988', 'name': 'Lauren E.

Believable agents allow people to not just watch, but also interact with such powerful, personality-rich characters.

Here, we show how the hedonic “liking” and motivation “wanting” signals for a sweet reward are distinctly modulated and tracked in this circuit separately from signals for Pavlovian predictions (learning). Animals first learned to associate a fixed sequence of Pavlovian cues with sucrose reward. Subsequent intraaccumbens microinjections of an opioid-stimulating drug increased the hedonic liking impact of sucrose in behavior and firing signals of ventral pallidum neurons, and likewise, they increased incentive salience signals in firing to the reward-proximal incentive cue (but did not alter firing signals to the learned prediction value of a reward-distal cue). Microinjection of a dopamine-stimulating drug instead enhanced only the motivation component but did not alter hedonic impact or learned prediction signals. Different dedicated neuronal subpopulations in the ventral pallidum tracked signal enhancements for hedonic impact vs. incentive salience, and a faster firing pattern also distinguished incentive signals from slower hedonic signals, even for a third overlapping population. These results reveal separate neural representations of wanting, liking, and prediction components of the same reward within the nucleus accumbens to ventral pallidum segment of mesocorticolimbic circuitry.","[{'authorId': '143932442', 'name': 'Kyle S.

However, understanding how social and emotional skills are learned, and how this process can be supported by technology, is an important but underresearched area in HCI so far. To address this gap, we review existing approaches to social and emotions skills learning (SEL) in other fields, with a specific focus on SEL in education, in which a large number of evidence-based programs is widely deployed. In doing so, the primary aim of this article is to provide a foundation and set an agenda for future research on the design of technology that would support, and help teach, social and emotional skills. We identify the key challenges to successful learning shared by SEL programs in education—such as embedding skills learned in class also into everyday situations, promoting reflection, and providing additional opportunities for practice—and outline how these could be addressed by digital technology. Overall, our key argument is that much existing HCI work could be used in support of social and emotional skills learning in education, and possibly other domains, but that the topic has not been explored so far.

In addition, the cognitive emotion regulation strategies accounted for considerable amounts of variance in emotional problems and strong relationships were found between the cognitive strategies self-blame, rumination, catastrophizing and positive reappraisal (inversely) and symptoms of depression and anxiety, both at first measurement and at follow-up. The CERQ might therefore be considered a valuable and reliable tool in the study of individual risk and protective factors associated with emotional problems, while providing us with important targets for intervention.","[{'authorId': '5361370', 'name': 'N.

 A number of recent Managing Sport and Leisure commentaries have explored how COVID-19 is touching sport. Our commentary adds to these discussions by considering COVID-19, lockdown and (disability) sport. This is especially pertinent given the positioning of disabled people as particularly “vulnerable” in relation to current political discourse. Four key points of discussion are focused upon. First, we explore how the media has attended to issues concerning (disability) sport during lockdown. Second, consideration is given to how sporting and physical activity opportunities have been promoted during lockdown. Third, we focus on the notion of inclusion and explore the ways in which this has thrived during lockdown. Fourth, attention is given to community (disability) sport post-lockdown and what this may mean for disability sport. We conclude by arguing that the future legacy of lockdown and COVID-19 will tell us much about how disabled people have really been embraced within sport.","[{'authorId': '96467479', 'name': 'H.

We address interindividual versus person-dependent recognition, recognition based on discrete affective states versus recognition based on affective dimensions, and efficient feature extraction with respect to affect. Principal component analysis (PCA), kernel PCA, linear discriminant analysis, and general discriminant analysis are compared to either reduce temporal information in gait or extract relevant features for classification. Although expression of affect in gait is covered by the primary task of locomotion, person-dependent recognition of motion capture data reaches 95% accuracy based on the observation of a single stride. In particular, different levels of arousal and dominance are suitable for being recognized in gait. It is concluded that gait can be used as an additional modality for the recognition of affect. Application scenarios include monitoring in high-security areas, human-robot interaction, and cognitive home environments.","[{'authorId': '2326840', 'name': 'M.

587b7fb571d8088df449bcac8446a6304a2926a5,"Emotion has a substantial influence on the cognitive processes in humans, including perception, attention, learning, memory, reasoning, and problem solving. Emotion has a particularly strong influence on attention, especially modulating the selectivity of attention as well as motivating action and behavior. This attentional and executive control is intimately linked to learning processes, as intrinsically limited attentional capacities are better focused on relevant information. Emotion also facilitates encoding and helps retrieval of information efficiently. However, the effects of emotion on learning and memory are not always univalent, as studies have reported that emotion either enhances or impairs learning and long-term memory (LTM) retention, depending on a range of factors. Recent neuroimaging findings have indicated that the amygdala and prefrontal cortex cooperate with the medial temporal lobe in an integrated manner that affords (i) the amygdala modulating memory consolidation; (ii) the prefrontal cortex mediating memory encoding and formation; and (iii) the hippocampus for successful learning and LTM retention. We also review the nested hierarchies of circular emotional control and cognitive regulation (bottom-up and top-down influences) within the brain to achieve optimal integration of emotional and cognitive processing. This review highlights a basic evolutionary approach to emotion to understand the effects of emotion on learning and memory and the functional roles played by various brain regions and their mutual interactions in relation to emotional processing. We also summarize the current state of knowledge on the impact of emotion on memory and map implications for educational settings. In addition to elucidating the memory-enhancing effects of emotion, neuroimaging findings extend our understanding of emotional influences on learning and memory processes; this knowledge may be useful for the design of effective educational curricula to provide a conducive learning environment for both traditional “live” learning in classrooms and “virtual” learning through online-based educational technologies.","[{'authorId': '9259162', 'name': 'C.

Increased amygdala reactivity during processing of certain types of emotional stimuli (e.g., fear, anger) has been observed in patients with anxiety disorders such as social phobia and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is uncertain whether this heightened amygdala reactivity is specific to treatment-seeking patients with anxiety disorders or is a general feature of individuals with increased anxiety-related temperamental traits.


METHOD
Thirty-two physically healthy subjects 18-21 years old were recruited from a large pool of college students. Of these, 16 were chosen on the basis of scoring in the upper-15th percentile on a measure of trait anxiety (anxiety-prone group), and 16 were chosen on the basis of scoring in the normative range (40th-60th percentile). Subjects participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an emotion face assessment task that has been shown to reliably engage amygdala and associated limbic structures.


RESULTS
Anxiety-prone subjects had significantly greater bilateral amygdala and insula activation to emotional faces than did the anxiety-normative comparison subjects. Higher scores on several measures assessing anxiety proneness (e.g., neuroticism, trait anxiety, and anxiety sensitivity) were associated with greater activation of the amygdala (predominantly left-sided) and the anterior insula (bilateral).


CONCLUSIONS
Increased amygdala and insula reactivity to certain types of emotional processing is seen in young adults with increased anxiety-related temperamental traits. Therefore, this brain emotion-processing profile may be a functional endophenotype for proneness to (certain kinds of) anxiety disorders.","[{'authorId': '2863415', 'name': 'M.

Using the EVA algorithm, we can simulate gaits and gazing behaviors of hundreds of virtual agents in real-time with known emotional characteristics. We have evaluated the benefits in different multi-agent VR simulation environments.

The key idea of our approach is an online learning algorithm that automatically constructs a series of local mixtures of autoregressive models (MAR) to capture the complex relationships between styles of motion. We construct local MAR models on the fly by searching for the closest examples of each input pose in the database. Once the model parameters are estimated from the training data, the model adapts the current pose with simple linear transformations. In addition, we introduce an efficient local regression model to predict the timings of synthesized poses in the output style. We demonstrate the power of our approach by transferring stylistic human motion for a wide variety of actions, including walking, running, punching, kicking, jumping and transitions between those behaviors. Our method achieves superior performance in a comparison against alternative methods. We have also performed experiments to evaluate the generalization ability of our data-driven model as well as the key components of our system.","[{'authorId': '2314567', 'name': 'Shi-hong Xia'}, {'authorId': '2116638364', 'name': 'Congyi Wang'}, {'authorId': '1759700', 'name': 'Jinxiang Chai'}, {'authorId': '1788773', 'name': 'J.

5a518c21ad9efb79318c7eb0530d8baa7f64dd44,"Behavioral therapy techniques for treating phobias often includes graded exposure of the patient to anxiety-producing stimuli (Systematic Desensitization). However, in utilizing systematic desensitization, research reviews demonstrate that many patients appear to have difficulty imaging the prescribed anxiety-evoking scene. They also express strong aversion to experiencing real situations. This chapter describes the Virtual Reality Therapy (VRT), a new therapeutical approach that can be used to overcome some of the difficulties inherent in the traditional treatment of phobias. VRT, like current imaginal and in vivo modalities, can generate stimuli that could be utilized in desensitization therapy. Like systematic desensitization therapy, VRT can provide stimuli for patients who have difficulty in imagining scenes and/or are too phobic to experience real situations. Unlike in vivo systematic desensitization, VRT can be performed within the privacy of a room, thus avoiding public embarrassment and violation of patient confidentiality. VRT can generate stimuli of much greater magnitude than standard in vivo techniques. Since VRT is under patient control, it appears safer than in vivo desensitization and at the same time more realistic than imaginal desensitization. Finally, VRT adds the advantage of greater efficiency and economy in delivering the equivalent of in vivo systematic desensitization within the therapist's office. The chapter also describes how to use virtual reality in the treatment of specific phobias: fear of flying, fear of heights, fear of being in certain situations (such as a dark barn, an enclosed bridge over a river, and in the presence of an animal [a black cat] in a dark room), and fear of public speaking.","[{'authorId': '3176814', 'name': 'M.

Then, 3 different control protocols, using full‐state feedback, static output feedback, and dynamic output feedback are designed at each agent to solve the bipartite output synchronization problem based on solutions to the corresponding output regulator equations. Explicit local design procedures are proposed for all 3 control protocols. The compensators employed in these protocols incorporate only one copy of the virtual exosystem's dynamics, regardless of the dimensions of the outputs. This results in lower‐dimensional compensators and controllers and, hence, is more computationally tractable compared to the popular internal model principle‐based control protocols.

5ad65c6474c135a6c15e7127d8bb91de8c8a55a1,"Introduction Performing electrical tests involves dangerous activities. Therefore, efficient training is needed in order to minimize training time, costs, and equipment damage, and most importantly, to prevent accidents that could injure electricians. However, training on electrical tests faces some problematic situations, such as limited opportunity to practice in an actual substation, since substations are operating on a regular basis. We have developed a Virtual Reality System (VRS) to support traditional training. Trainees still attend classroom courses but they complement their learning and practice aided by the VRS. The system is used at the Mexican electricity utility by a number of electricians. However, the VRS is not adaptive to trainees' knowledge and emotional states. Training still depends on a courses schedule, which most of the times, means waiting for a training course for a long time. Based on this VRS that supports traditional training, we composed a blended learning model. Blended learning is a new strand in education, although the concept itself has already existed for a long time. It can take many forms and there are several definitions that include the same elements roughly. In a formal education context, blended learning is a formal educational program in which a student learns, at least in part through online delivery of content and instruction with some elements of student control over time, place, path, or pace, and at least in part at a supervised brick-and-mortar location away from home (Staker & Horn, 2012). A more general and perhaps more accepted definition states that blended learning is learning that is facilitated by the effective combination of different delivery modes, teaching models and learning styles, and founded on transparent communication amongst all parties involved in a course (Heinze & Procter, 2004). In addition to blended learning, the characteristics of electrical tests demand faster and more efficient training, where instruction is adaptive and responds to needs of the trainees. For that reason, we have defined a roadmap to achieve efficient and tailored training. The roadmap starts with traditional training and ends with intelligent and adaptive training. In order to have more adaptive training, we have built a trainee model. This model represents the affective and knowledge states of trainees and allows the training system to adapt the instruction to a particular trainee. Our proposal for the affective state is based on facial expressions and contextual information. We propose to present the instruction by an animated agent representing the instructor. We are designing an empathetic agent to try to engage the trainee, promote a positive emotional state and improve learning. A key highlight of the agent's design is that it is presented as an electrician so that trainees can feel identified with him. With all these elements, we are developing a model and a platform for blended training, which adapts itself to needs of the trainee in an intelligent way based on the roadmap for training. In this paper we present the outcomes of a study that we conducted on animated agents in order to refine our empathetic agent before full integration to the VRS. Experts in electrical tests who know the VRS participated in the study. We gathered useful information to improve the design of the agent, which includes ingredients such as appearance, behavior, and facial expressions. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the next section presents some related work. Then, we present the roadmap for training, describing the virtual reality system and the elements of the blended training model, particularly, the affective student model and the empathetic agent. After that, we present the evaluation of the empathetic agent. Then, results are analysed.

We investigate children's (age 1 - 5) transitions to and from screen-based activities to understand the boundaries families have set and their experiences living within them. We report on interviews with 27 parents and a diary study with a separate 28 families examining these transitions. These families turn on screens primarily to facilitate parents' independent activities. Parents feel this is appropriate but self-audit and express hesitation, as they feel they are benefiting from an activity that can be detrimental to their child's well-being. We found that families turn off screens when parents are ready to give their child their full attention and technology presents a natural stopping point. Transitioning away from screens is often painful, and predictive factors determine the pain of a transition. Technology-mediated transitions are significantly more successful than parent-mediated transitions, suggesting that the design community has the power to make this experience better for parents and children by creating technologies that facilitate boundary-setting and respect families' self-defined limits.","[{'authorId': '2749233', 'name': 'Alexis Hiniker'}, {'authorId': '83550719', 'name': 'Hye-Ji Suh'}, {'authorId': '3396372', 'name': 'Sabina Cao'}, {'authorId': '1738606', 'name': 'J.

Thus we used fMRI to determine which brain areas subserve processing of high‐valence expressions and if distinct brain areas are activated when facial expressions are processed explicitly or implicitly. Nine healthy volunteers were scanned (1.5T GE Signa with ANMR, TE/TR 40/3,000 ms) during two similar experiments in which blocks of mixed happy and angry facial expressions (“on” condition) were alternated with blocks of neutral faces (control “off” condition). Experiment 1 examined explicit processing of expressions by requiring subjects to attend to, and judge, facial expression. Experiment 2 examined implicit processing of expressions by requiring subjects to attend to, and judge, facial gender, which was counterbalanced in both experimental conditions. Processing of facial expressions significantly increased regional blood oxygenation level‐dependent (BOLD) activity in fusiform and middle temporal gyri, hippocampus, amygdalohippocampal junction, and pulvinar nucleus. Explicit processing evoked significantly more activity in temporal lobe cortex than implicit processing, whereas implicit processing evoked significantly greater activity in amygdala region. Mixed high‐valence facial expressions are processed within temporal lobe visual cortex, thalamus, and amygdalohippocampal complex. Also, neural substrates for explicit and implicit processing of facial expressions are dissociable: explicit processing activates temporal lobe cortex, whereas implicit processing activates amygdala region.

Our algorithm is based on a novel data-driven friendliness model that is computed using a user-study and psychological characteristics. We use our model to control the movements corresponding to the gaits, gestures, and gazing of friendly virtual agents (FVAs) as they interact with the user's avatar and other agents in the environment. We have integrated FVA agents with an AR environment using with a Microsoft HoloLens. Our algorithm can generate plausible movements at interactive rates to increase the social presence. We also investigate the perception of a user in an AR setting and observe that an FVA has a statistically significant improvement in terms of the perceived friendliness and social presence of a user compared to an agent without the friendliness modeling.

However, the existing methods cannot rely on the common smart bracelets or watches for emotion monitoring in daily life. To address this issue, our study proposes a method for emotional recognition using heart rate data from a wearable smart bracelet. A ‘neutral + target’ pair emotion stimulation experimental paradigm was presented, and a dataset of heart rate from 25 subjects was established, where neutral plus target emotion (neutral, happy, and sad) stimulation video pairs from China’s standard Emotional Video Stimuli materials (CEVS) were applied to the recruited subjects. Normalized features from the data of target emotions normalized by the baseline data of neutral mood were adopted. Emotion recognition experiment results approved the effectiveness of ‘neutral + target’ video pair simulation experimental paradigm, the baseline setting using neutral mood data, and the normalized features, as well as the classifiers of Adaboost and GBDT on this dataset.

One type of communication is the argumentative dialogue where both agents aim to convert each others’ point of view. Argumentative reinforcement learning (RL) agents can learn from experience via trial and error. For an agent learning to argue with other agents, it would be useful to discover some useful argument patterns i.e. state and action pairs, which will enable a RL agent to transfer what has been learned from one domain to another. A dialogue model is needed to manage the evolving dialogue between agents. In this paper we adopt the DE dialogue game and construct an RL agent that can win a debate with the minimum number of moves. The result is promising so far and this enables us to move forward to transfer learning in order to generalise our approach. It is anticipated that our research will contribute to the design and implementation of argumentative learning agents.","[{'authorId': '32063446', 'name': 'Sultan Alahmari'}, {'authorId': '31536328', 'name': 'Tommy Yuan'}, {'authorId': '2380005', 'name': 'D.

In the present study, we investigated the relationship between mimicry and cognitive and emotional empathy. To assess mimicry, facial electromyography was recorded for 70 participants while they completed the Multifaceted Empathy Test, which presents complex context-embedded emotional expressions. As predicted, inter-individual differences in emotional and cognitive empathy were associated with the level of facial mimicry. For positive emotions, the intensity of the mimicry response scaled with the level of state emotional empathy. Mimicry was stronger for the emotional empathy task compared to the cognitive empathy task. The specific empathy condition could be successfully detected from facial muscle activity at the level of single individuals using machine learning techniques. These results support the view that mimicry occurs depending on the social context as a tool to affiliate and it is involved in cognitive as well as emotional empathy.","[{'authorId': '4673179', 'name': 'Hanna Drimalla'}, {'authorId': '3208878', 'name': 'Niels Landwehr'}, {'authorId': '3067657', 'name': 'U.

If robotic companions could acquire their human counterparts' sense of humor in an unobtrusive manner, they could improve their skills of engagement.

We evaluated our approach in a test scenario with a Reeti robot acting as an entertainer and telling different types of jokes. The exemplary adaptation process is accomplished only by using the audience's vocal laughs and visual smiles, but no other form of explicit feedback.

However, current findings are lacking as to whether the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and cortical regions are involved in the learning effect when subjects retrieve associative memory, and whether their activations differentially change over time due to learning experience. To address these issues, we designed an fMRI experiment in which face-scene pairs were learned once (L1) or six times (L6). Subjects learned the pairs at four retention intervals, 30-min, 1-day, 1-week and 1-month, after which they finished an associative recognition task in the scanner. The results showed that compared to learning once, learning six times led to stronger activation in the hippocampus, but weaker activation in the perirhinal cortex (PRC) as well as anterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vLPFC). In addition, the hippocampal activation was positively correlated with that of the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and negatively correlated with that of the vLPFC when the L6 group was compared to the L1 group. The hippocampal activation decreased over time after L1 but remained stable after L6.

We develop an efficient technique for supervised learning of UVFAs, by factoring observed values into separate embedding vectors for state and goal, and then learning a mapping from s and g to these factored embedding vectors. We show how this technique may be incorporated into a reinforcement learning algorithm that updates the UVFA solely from observed rewards.

But what happens when one of the interlocutors is a machine? The facilitation of human-machine communication and cooperation is of growing importance as smartphones, autonomous cars, or social robots increasingly pervade human social spaces. Previous research has shown that emotionally expressive virtual characters generally elicit higher cooperation and trust than 'neutral' ones. Since emotional expressions are multi-modal, and given that virtual characters can be designed to our liking in all their components, would a mismatch in the emotion expressed in the face and voice influence people's cooperation with a virtual character? We developed a game where people had to cooperate with a virtual character in order to survive on the moon.

The experiment was set up in a museum over the course of several weeks; we report preliminary results from over 500 visitors, showing that people tend to trust the virtual character in the mismatched condition with the smiling face and neutral voice more.

Some of these experiences can be purposely designed, for example, to detect and regulate students' affective states to improve aspects of their learning experiences.

This special section aims to contribute ideas, methods and case studies for how affective computing can move toward the goal of promoting wellbeing. The papers spread across some of the multiple modalities and techniques used to perceive and detect affect from text, physiology facial expressions, and gaze, and some of the approaches to analyze the expression of sentiments shared via online communities by depressed patients.

This study aims at analyzing population-based data of parents with MHP and their children and the effects of associated risk factors in order to further targeted preventive and therapeutic interventions. Methods The BELLA study is the mental health module of the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey among Children and Adolescents. MHP in parents and in their children as well as associated risk factors were examined in a sample of N = 1158 parents with children aged 11 to 17 years. Results Parental MHP were identified in 18.6% of the sample. Risk factors associated with parental MHP were low SES, parental unemployment, stressful life events, parental daily strain, parental chronic disease, and child MHP. A rate of 19.1% of the children of parents with MHP reported MHP themselves, the corresponding rate among children of parents without MHP was 7.7%. In multiple regression analyses the risk for children of parents with MHP to report MHP themselves was almost two times higher than the risk of children of parents without MHP. Other significant associations with child MHP included gender, the parents’ age, and stressful life events. Conclusions Parental MHP constitute a significant risk for the mental health of their children. Targeted screening methods and preventive interventions are needed.","[{'authorId': '1417587897', 'name': 'A. Plass-Christl'}, {'authorId': '144617833', 'name': 'A.

Design Qualitative semistructured interviews with 36 participants. Participants Depressed patients with a Patient Health Questionnaire 9 of 10 or above recruited into the REEACT randomised controlled trial. Setting Primary care settings in England. Results Participant experience was on a continuum, with some patients unable or unwilling to accept psychological therapy without interpersonal contact while others appreciated the enhanced anonymity and flexibility of cCBT. The majority of patients were ambivalent, recognising the potential benefits offered by cCBT but struggling with challenges posed by the severity of their illness, lack of support and limited personalisation of programme content. Low completion rates were commonly reported, although more positive patients reported greater engagement. Both positive and ambivalent patients perceived a need for monitoring or follow-up to support completion, while negative patients reported deliberate non-adherence due to dissatisfaction with the programme. Patients also reported that severity of depression impacted on engagement, and viewed cCBT as unsuitable for patients undergoing more severe depressive episodes. Conclusions The study demonstrates both the unique demands and benefits of computerised therapy. cCBT was preferred by some patients and rejected by others, but the majority of patients were ambivalent about the therapy. cCBT could be offered within a menu of options in stepped care if matched appropriately to individual patients or could be offered with enhanced support to appeal to a greater number of patients.

The study conducts ethnographic interviews with 20 South Korean parents of two- to six-year-olds and observes 10 children in their media use and interaction with parents. We find that parents presumed that touchscreen media wielded a more negative than positive influence on their children. As a result, parents engaged in restrictive and technical mediation, though they often failed to effectively manage their children’s media use due to practical challenges. The failure of parental mediation made the parents feel guilty. We suggest a greater need to attend to the contexts and emotions in which parental mediation of children’s media use occurs.","[{'authorId': '101188407', 'name': 'Hogeun Seo'}, {'authorId': '153897473', 'name': 'C.

5fbdbe6d870b7927a10c5bde74baf868b5cfacbf,"Touch plays a prominent role in communicating emotions and intensifying interpersonal communication. Affective haptics is an emerging field, which focuses on the analysis, design, and evaluation of systems that can capture, process, or display emotions through the sense of touch. The objective of this paper is to present an overview of the recent achievements in affective haptics and to discuss how the sense of touch can elicit or influence human emotions. We first introduce a definition to the term affective haptics and describe its multidisciplinary nature-as a field that integrates ideas from affective computing, haptic technology, and user experience. Second, we provide a thorough discussion about the effectiveness of using the haptic channel to communicate affective information through direct and mediated means. Third, we present a variety of applications in the area ranging from interhuman social interaction systems to human robot interaction applications. Finally, we discuss some of the key findings discerned from the various surveyed papers, and present some of the challenges and trends in this field. We extract the following conclusions pertaining to affective haptics: 1) haptic stimulation can be successfully used to achieve a higher level of emotional immersion during media consumption or emotional telepresence; 2) existing research has demonstrated that haptics is effective in communicating valence and arousal, and the emotions of happiness, sadness, anger and fear, and less focus have been given to the communication of disgust and surprise; 3) the haptic-based affect detection remains an understudied topic, whereas the haptic-based affect display is a well-established subject; and 4) the interpretation of the haptic stimulation by human beings is highly contextual.","[{'authorId': '36728550', 'name': 'M.

5fd3ce235f5fcebd3d2807f710b060add527183b,"Traditional exploration methods in RL require agents to perform random actions to find rewards. But these approaches struggle on sparse-reward domains like Montezuma's Revenge where the probability that any random action sequence leads to reward is extremely low. Recent algorithms have performed well on such tasks by encouraging agents to visit new states or perform new actions in relation to all prior training episodes (which we call across-training novelty). But such algorithms do not consider whether an agent exhibits intra-life novelty: doing something new within the current episode, regardless of whether those behaviors have been performed in previous episodes. We hypothesize that across-training novelty might discourage agents from revisiting initially non-rewarding states that could become important stepping stones later in training. We introduce Deep Curiosity Search (DeepCS), which encourages intra-life exploration by rewarding agents for visiting as many different states as possible within each episode, and show that DeepCS matches the performance of current state-of-the-art methods on Montezuma's Revenge. We further show that DeepCS improves exploration on Amidar, Freeway, Gravitar, and Tutankham (many of which are hard exploration games). Surprisingly, DeepCS doubles A2C performance on Seaquest, a game we would not have expected to benefit from intra-life exploration because the arena is small and already easily navigated by naive exploration techniques. In one run, DeepCS achieves a maximum training score of 80,000 points on Seaquest, higher than any methods other than Ape-X. The strong performance of DeepCS on these sparse- and dense-reward tasks suggests that encouraging intra-life novelty is an interesting, new approach for improving performance in Deep RL and motivates further research into hybridizing across-training and intra-life exploration methods.","[{'authorId': '51287873', 'name': 'C.

However, the existence of preferred landing positions in face recognition is less well established. It is also unknown how many fixations are required to recognize a face. To investigate these questions, we recorded eye movements during face recognition. During an otherwise standard face-recognition task, subjects were allowed a variable number of fixations before the stimulus was masked. We found that optimal recognition performance is achieved with two fixations; performance does not improve with additional fixations. The distribution of the first fixation is just to the left of the center of the nose, and that of the second fixation is around the center of the nose. Thus, these appear to be the preferred landing positions for face recognition. Furthermore, the fixations made during face learning differ in location from those made during face recognition and are also more variable in duration; this suggests that different strategies are used for face learning and face recognition.","[{'authorId': '2392506', 'name': 'J.

In Experiment 1, 65 participants rated faces for threat, arousal and valence (pleasantness). The faces varied in eyebrow shape (V-shaped, flat), mouth type (closed, open), eye type (wide, normal) and mouth curvature (down-turned, up-turned). In replication of previous research (Lundqvist, Esteves, & Öhman, 1999, 2004), the V-shaped eyebrow was the most important determinant of facial threat. Faces with a V-shaped eyebrow were rated as more aroused and threatening, and less pleasant than faces with a flat eyebrow. Similar, albeit weaker, effects were recorded for mouth and eye type, leading to a new hierarchical ordering of facial features for determining facial threat (eyebrow type > mouth type > eye type > mouth curvature). In Experiment 2 (n=37) the effects and ordering recorded in Experiment 1 were replicated for ratings of face of a woman and, moreover , individual features (except an up-turned mouth) increased ratings of threat compared to an expressionless control condition.","[{'authorId': '4046128', 'name': 'J.

Traditionally, interactions between humans and machines like computers do not exhibit any emotional exchanges. If we could build any system that is intelligent enough to interact with humans that involves emotions, that is, it can detect user emotions and change its behaviour accordingly, then using machines could be more effective and friendly. Many approaches have been taken to detect user emotions. Affective computing is the field that detects user emotion in a particular moment. Our approach in this paper is to detect user emotions by analysing the keyboard typing patterns of the user and the type of texts (words, sentences) typed by them. This combined analysis gives us a promising result showing a substantial number of emotional states detected from user input. Several machine learning algorithms were used to analyse keystroke timing attributes and text pattern. We have chosen keystroke because it is the cheapest and most available medium to interact with computers. We have considered seven emotional classes for classifying the emotional states. For text pattern analysis, we have used vector space model with Jaccard similarity method to classify free-text input. Our combined approach showed above 80% accuracies in identifying emotions.","[{'authorId': '2079188586', 'name': 'A. F. M. N. H.

Social skills training groups have been developed to provide an evidence-based practice to target these difficulties. However, several barriers exist to implementing these groups within real-world settings, including community mental health clinics serving children with autism spectrum disorders. Our article identifies these barriers and poses potential solutions to overcoming these obstacles. Specifically, we share adaptations to the implementation of a social skills curriculum in order to meet the needs of an urban, underserved, economically challenged, and diverse population; tailor the curriculum to meet the individual needs of each participant; and facilitate generalization of the learned skills to different settings, most notably the school setting. Effectiveness of these adaptations was measured through assessing parent, teacher, and child perspective of social skills, emotion regulation skills, and anxiety at preintervention, postintervention, and follow-up time points. It is our hope that the adaptations implemented in this setting can be translated to inform social skills groups in other similar settings.","[{'authorId': '117942031', 'name': 'Jennifer S.

This anxiety is further energised by an AI race narrative that makes people believe they might be missing out. Whether real or not, a belief in this narrative may be detrimental as some stake-holders will feel obliged to cut corners on safety precautions, or ignore societal consequences just to “win”. Starting from a baseline model that describes a broad class of technology races where winners draw a significant benefit compared to others (such as AI advances, patent race, pharmaceutical technologies), we investigate here how positive (rewards) and negative (punishments) incentives may beneficially influence the outcomes. We uncover conditions in which punishment is either capable of reducing the development speed of unsafe participants or has the capacity to reduce innovation through over-regulation. Alternatively, we show that, in several scenarios, rewarding those that follow safety measures may increase the development speed while ensuring safe choices. Moreover, in the latter regimes, rewards do not suffer from the issue of over-regulation as is the case for punishment. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the nature and kinds of regulatory actions most suitable to improve safety compliance in the contexts of both smooth and sudden technological shifts.","[{'authorId': '2928820', 'name': 'H.

The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a new multi-component social skills intervention for children with Asperger syndrome (AS): The Junior Detective Training Program. This 7-week program included a computer game, small group sessions, parent training sessions and teacher handouts.


METHOD
Forty-nine children with AS were recruited to participate and randomly assigned to intervention (n = 26) or wait-list control (n = 23) conditions.


RESULTS
Relative to children in the wait-list group, program participants showed greater improvements in social skills over the course of the intervention, as indicated by parent-report measures. Teacher-report data also confirmed that children receiving the intervention made significant improvements in social functioning from pre- to post-treatment. Treatment group participants were better able to suggest appropriate emotion-management strategies for story characters at post-intervention than at pre-intervention, whereas control participants were not. However, there was no difference in the improvements made by children in the intervention and control conditions on facial expression and body-posture recognition measures. Follow-up data suggested that treatment gains were maintained by children at 5-months post-intervention.


CONCLUSIONS
The Junior Detective Training Program appeared to be effective in enhancing the social skills and emotional understanding of children with AS.

In the control condition, Keepon only facilitated and directed the play session and did not intervene during children’s conflicts. Results show that children were more likely to resolve conflicts constructively in the mediation condition than in the control condition, and that a key function for a robot mediator within the conflict process is to successfully flag the conflict onset.

However, the mechanism of this effect, critical to enhancing public health, remains poorly understood. Objective To investigate the neurodevelopmental trajectory of the association between early ACEs and adolescent general and emotional health outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants A prospective longitudinal study that began when patients were aged 3 to 6 years who underwent neuroimaging later at ages 7 to 12 years and whose mental and physical health outcomes were observed at ages 9 to 15 years. Sequential mediation models were used to investigate associations between early ACEs and brain structure, emotion development, and health outcomes longitudinally. Children were recruited from an academic medical center research unit. Exposure Early life adversity. Main Outcomes and Measures Early ACEs in children aged 3 to 7 years; volume of a subregion of the prefrontal cortex, the inferior frontal gyrus, in children aged 6 to 12 years; and emotional awareness, depression severity, and general health outcomes in children and adolescents aged 9 to 15 years. Results The mean (SD) age of 119 patients was 9.65 (1.31) years at the time of scan. The mean (SD) ACE score was 5.44 (3.46). The mean (SD) depression severity scores were 2.61 (1.78) at preschool, 1.77 (1.58) at time 2, and 2.16 (1.64) at time 3. The mean (SD) global physical health scores at time 2 and time 3 were 0.30 (0.38) and 0.33 (0.42), respectively. Sequential mediation in the association between high early ACEs and emotional and physical health outcomes were found. Smaller inferior frontal gyrus volumes and poor emotional awareness sequentially mediated the association between early ACEs and poor general health (model parameter estimate = 0.002; 95% CI, 0.0002-0.056) and higher depression severity (model parameter estimate = 0.007; 95% CI, 0.001-0.021) in adolescence. An increase from 0 to 3 early ACEs was associated with 15% and 25% increases in depression severity and physical health problems, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance Study findings highlight 1 putative neurodevelopmental mechanism by which the association between early ACEs and later poor mental and physical health outcomes may operate.

Personal technologies such as smartphones, computers, and gaming devices, are ubiquitous in the civilian world. Consequently they represent ideal vehicles for disseminating psychological and other health resources and interventions. However, almost nothing is known about personal technology use in the U.S. military. We conducted the most comprehensive survey to date of the use, availability, and need for personal technologies by U.S. military service members. Our survey asked detailed questions about computers and the Internet, phones and smartphones, other mobile or portable technologies, gaming devices, and TV and video media used during deployment and at permanent duty station or home.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We collected data by paper-and-pencil survey in 2010 and 2011 from 331 active Army service members at a processing and registration center in a large military installation in the western United States. Two cohorts were surveyed: Soldiers who had previously been deployed to a warzone and soldiers who had never been deployed.


RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
We measured high rates of personal technology use by service members at home across all popular electronic media. Soldiers at home essentially resembled civilian consumers in their use of popular technologies. Some technologies, including the Internet, gaming, and TV, were widespread on deployment. Others, most notably cellphones, were more restricted by availability, connectivity, opportunity, and military regulation in the warzone. Results will enable researchers and technology developers target their efforts on the most promising and popular technologies for psychological health in the military.","[{'authorId': '40146228', 'name': 'N.

Participants walked in a virtual environment toward a goal (Experiment 1) and around an obstacle (Experiment 2) whose initial angle and distance varied. Goals and obstacles behave as attractors and repellers of heading, respectively, whose strengths depend on distance. The observed behavior was modeled as a dynamical system in which angular acceleration is a function of goal and obstacle angle and distance. By linearly combining terms for goals and obstacles, one could predict whether participants adopt a route to the left or right of an obstacle to reach a go (Experiment 3). Route selection may emerge from on-line steering dynamics, making explicit path planning unnecessary.","[{'authorId': '2615143', 'name': 'B. Fajen'}, {'authorId': '2070647803', 'name': 'W. H.

We identified 3 insular subregions with distinct patterns of connectivity: a posterior region, functionally connected with primary and secondary somatomotor cortices; a dorsal anterior to middle region, connected with dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, along with other regions of a previously described control network; and a ventral anterior region, primarily connected with pregenual anterior cingulate cortex. Applying these regions to a separate task data set, we found that dorsal and ventral anterior insula responded selectively to disgusting images, while posterior insula did not. These results demonstrate that clustering of connectivity patterns can be used to subdivide cerebral cortex into anatomically and functionally meaningful subregions; the insular regions identified here should be useful in future investigations on the function of the insula.","[{'authorId': '2305032', 'name': 'Ben Deen'}, {'authorId': '2273865', 'name': 'Naomi B.

Virtual reality therapy (VRT) uses multimodal stimulation that includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and gustatory stimuli. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of VRT in treating subjects with alcohol dependence (AD) by evaluating changes in brain metabolism.


METHOD
The VRT protocol consisted of three steps: relaxation, presentation of a high-risk situation, and presentation of an aversive situation. Twelve alcohol-dependent subjects underwent 10 sessions of VRT. The alcohol-dependent subjects were assessed with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography images before and after VRT, whereas the control group underwent imaging according to the same protocol only at baseline.


RESULTS
Compared with the healthy control group, AD subjects showed higher metabolism in the right lentiform nucleus and right temporal lobe (BA20) at baseline (P(FDR < .05) = .026). In addition, the metabolism in the left anterior cingulate was lower in subjects with AD (P(uncorr) = .001). After VRT, alcohol-dependent subjects showed decreased brain metabolism in the right lentiform nucleus (P(FDR < .05) = .026) and right temporal lobe (BA38, P(FDR < .05) = .032) relative to that at baseline.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest a neurobiological imbalance, notably, a high sensitivity to stimuli, in the limbic system in subjects with AD. Furthermore, we determined that metabolism decreased in the basal ganglia after VRT, which may explain the limbic-regulated responses of reward and regulation. Therefore, we tentatively recommend VRT to treat AD through its regulating effect on limbic circuits.","[{'authorId': '48432801', 'name': 'J. H.

In terms of NHS spending, at least £1 in every £8 spent on long-term conditions is linked to poor mental health and well-being – between £8 billion and £13 billion in England each year. Long-term conditions and mental health: The cost of co-morbidities, published jointly by The King’s Fund and the Centre for Mental Health, suggests that care for a large number of people with long-term conditions could be improved by: integrating mental health support with primary care and chronic disease management programmes improving the provision of liaison psychiatry services in acute hospitals providing health professionals of all kinds with basic mental health knowledge and skills removing policy barriers to integration, for example, through redesign of payment mechanisms. This paper suggests that developing more integrated support for people with mental and physical health problems could improve outcomes and play an important part in helping the NHS meet the quality, innovation, productivity and prevention challenge.

Unlike formless conversational agents, like smart speakers or chatbots, VH bring together the capabilities of both a conversational agent and an interactive avatar (computer-represented digital characters). Although their use in patient-facing systems has garnered substantial interest, it is unknown to what extent VH are effective in health applications. Objective The purpose of this review was to examine the effectiveness of VH in patient-facing systems. The design and implementation characteristics of these systems were also examined. Methods Electronic bibliographic databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles with relevant key terms. Studies were included in the systematic review if they designed or evaluated VH in patient-facing systems. Of the included studies, studies that used a randomized controlled trial to evaluate VH were included in the meta-analysis; they were then summarized using the PICOTS framework (population, intervention, comparison group, outcomes, time frame, setting). Summary effect sizes, using random-effects models, were calculated, and the risk of bias was assessed. Results Among the 8,125 unique records identified, 53 articles describing 33 unique systems, were qualitatively, systematically reviewed. Two distinct design categories emerged — simple VH and VH augmented with health sensors and trackers. Of the 53 articles, 16 (26 studies) with 44 primary and 22 secondary outcomes were included in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of the 44 primary outcome measures revealed a significant difference between intervention and control conditions, favoring the VH intervention (SMD = .166, 95% CI .039-.292, P=.012), but with evidence of some heterogeneity, I2=49.3%. There were more cross-sectional (k=15) than longitudinal studies (k=11). The intervention was delivered using a personal computer in most studies (k=18), followed by a tablet (k=4), mobile kiosk (k=2), head-mounted display (k=1), and a desktop computer in a community center (k=1). Conclusions We offer evidence for the efficacy of VH in patient-facing systems. Considering that studies included different population and outcome types, more focused analysis is needed in the future. Future studies also need to identify what features of virtual human interventions contribute toward their effectiveness.","[{'authorId': '33623895', 'name': 'Debaleena Chattopadhyay'}, {'authorId': '2114186562', 'name': 'Tengteng Ma'}, {'authorId': '7923021', 'name': 'H.

Suicide attempts constitute a major risk factor for completed suicide, yet few interventions specifically designed to prevent suicide attempts have been evaluated.


OBJECTIVE
To determine the effectiveness of a 10-session cognitive therapy intervention designed to prevent repeat suicide attempts in adults who recently attempted suicide.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
Randomized controlled trial of adults (N = 120) who attempted suicide and were evaluated at a hospital emergency department within 48 hours of the attempt. Potential participants (N = 350) were consecutively recruited from October 1999 to September 2002; 66 refused to participate and 164 were ineligible. Participants were followed up for 18 months.


INTERVENTION
Cognitive therapy or enhanced usual care with tracking and referral services.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Incidence of repeat suicide attempts and number of days until a repeat suicide attempt. Suicide ideation (dichotomized), hopelessness, and depression severity at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months.


RESULTS
From baseline to the 18-month assessment, 13 participants (24.1%) in the cognitive therapy group and 23 participants (41.6%) in the usual care group made at least 1 subsequent suicide attempt (asymptotic z score, 1.97; P = .049). Using the Kaplan-Meier method, the estimated 18-month reattempt-free probability in the cognitive therapy group was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62-0.85) and in the usual care group was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.44-0.70). Participants in the cognitive therapy group had a significantly lower reattempt rate (Wald chi2(1) = 3.9; P = .049) and were 50% less likely to reattempt suicide than participants in the usual care group (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.26-0.997). The severity of self-reported depression was significantly lower for the cognitive therapy group than for the usual care group at 6 months (P= .02), 12 months (P = .009), and 18 months (P = .046). The cognitive therapy group reported significantly less hopelessness than the usual care group at 6 months (P = .045). There were no significant differences between groups based on rates of suicide ideation at any assessment point.

Cognitive therapy was effective in preventing suicide attempts for adults who recently attempted suicide.","[{'authorId': '4991407', 'name': 'Gregory K Brown'}, {'authorId': '49024809', 'name': 'T.

Similarly, individuals arrange commitments to guarantee that an action such as a cooperative one is in the others' best interest, and thus will be carried out to avoid eventual penalties for commitment failure. Hence, both apology and commitment should go side by side in behavioral evolution. Here we provide a computational model showing that apologizing acts are rare in non-committed interactions, especially whenever cooperation is very costly, and that arranging prior commitments can considerably increase the frequency of such behavior. In addition, we show that in both cases, with or without commitments, apology works only if it is sincere, i.e. costly enough. Most interestingly, our model predicts that individuals tend to use much costlier apology in committed relationships than otherwise, because it helps better identify free-riders such as fake committers: ""commitments bring about sincerity'. Furthermore, we show that this strategy of apology supported by commitments outperforms the famous existent strategies of the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.","[{'authorId': '2928820', 'name': 'H.

 BACKGROUND
 Individuals living with long-term physical health conditions frequently experience co-occurring mental health problems. This comorbidity has a significant impact on an individual’s levels of emotional distress, health outcomes, and associated health care utilization. As health care services struggle to meet demand and care increasingly moves to the community, digital tools are being promoted to support patients to self-manage their health. One such technology is the autonomous virtual agent (chatbot, conversational agent), which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to process the user’s written or spoken natural language and then to select or construct the corresponding appropriate responses.
 
 
 OBJECTIVE
 This study aimed to co-design the content, functionality, and interface modalities of an autonomous virtual agent to support self-management for patients with an exemplar long-term condition (LTC; chronic pulmonary obstructive disease [COPD]) and then to assess the acceptability and system content.
 
 
 METHODS
 We conducted 2 co-design workshops and a proof-of-concept implementation of an autonomous virtual agent with natural language processing capabilities. This implementation formed the basis for video-based scenario testing of acceptability with adults with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals involved in their care.
 
 
 RESULTS
 Adults (n=6) with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals (n=5) specified 4 priority self-management scenarios for which they would like to receive support: at the time of diagnosis (information provision), during acute exacerbations (crisis support), during periods of low mood (emotional support), and for general self-management (motivation). From the scenario testing, 12 additional adults with COPD felt the system to be both acceptable and engaging, particularly with regard to internet-of-things capabilities. They felt the system would be particularly useful for individuals living alone.
 
 
 CONCLUSIONS
 Patients did not explicitly separate mental and physical health needs, although the content they developed for the virtual agent had a clear psychological approach. Supported self-management delivered via an autonomous virtual agent was acceptable to the participants. A co-design process has allowed the research team to identify key design principles, content, and functionality to underpin an autonomous agent for delivering self-management support to older adults living with COPD and potentially other LTCs.

Using the tools of evolutionary game theory, here we address, for the first time, the role played by intention recognition in the final outcome of cooperation in large populations of self-regarding individuals. By equipping individuals with the capacity of assessing intentions of others in the course of repeated Prisoner's Dilemma interactions, we show how intention recognition opens a window of opportunity for cooperation to thrive, as it precludes the invasion of pure cooperators by random drift while remaining robust against defective strategies. Intention recognizers are able to assign an intention to the action of their opponents based on an acquired corpus of possible intentions. We show how intention recognizers can prevail against most famous strategies of repeated dilemmas of cooperation, even in the presence of errors. Our approach invites the adoption of other classification and pattern recognition mechanisms common among Humans, to unveil the evolution of complex cognitive processes in the context of social dilemmas.","[{'authorId': '2928820', 'name': 'H.

68385c20a25aea16a54bbaad4f4230a892c010c6,"A major goal of research on virtual humans is the animation of expressive characters that display distinct psychological attributes. Body motion is an effective way of portraying different personalities and differentiating characters. The purpose and contribution of this work is to describe a formal, broadly applicable, procedural, and empirically grounded association between personality and body motion and apply this association to modify a given virtual human body animation that can be represented by these formal concepts. Because the body movement of virtual characters may involve different choices of parameter sets depending on the context, situation, or application, formulating a link from personality to body motion requires an intermediate step to assist generalization. For this intermediate step, we refer to Laban Movement Analysis, which is a movement analysis technique for systematically describing and evaluating human motion. We have developed an expressive human motion generation system with the help of movement experts and conducted a user study to explore how the psychologically validated OCEAN personality factors were perceived in motions with various Laban parameters. We have then applied our findings to procedurally animate expressive characters with personality, and validated the generalizability of our approach across different models and animations via another perception study.","[{'authorId': '2643744', 'name': 'Funda Durupinar'}, {'authorId': '143980997', 'name': 'M.

Understanding the nature of these interactions could critically inform the design of educational technologies to facilitate children’s learning, research methods for use in future studies involving adult-child dyad technology use, and policy decisions regarding the use of educational technology with young children. In this study, we explored the natural interactions among parent, child, and a child-friendly virtual rabbit character named Floppy. Floppy is a virtual agent in a Smart Speaker app that models adult dialogic reading and conversational strategies for use with young children (ages 4-6 years). Over a span of four to six weeks, 18 parent-child dyads read The Rainbow Fish, a classic children’s book by Marcus Pfister, during 24 at-home, remote sessions with Floppy. Of the 189 conversations generated during this time, 125 were initiated by a prompt spoken by Floppy. Though there were some variations among the dyads, across all conversations, parent-driven interactions made up 63% of the conversations, followed by child-driven conversations at 15.3%, Floppy-driven at 14.3%, and Floppy-and-parent-driven at 7.4%. A select few parents were more comfortable having their children interact directly with Floppy, whereas the majority of the parents would direct children’s attention back to themselves or help children understand the questions by repeating or reformulating Floppy’s prompts. More than half of the parents reported that their children formed emotional connections with the virtual character. These findings point to a need to clearly define the role of virtual agents, even ones with limited AI, in this type of triadic interaction.","[{'authorId': '2172765178', 'name': 'Grace C.

Understanding the way we react to the interaction with virtual agents and the impact of emotions on social dynamics in the virtual world is fundamental. Therefore, in this study we investigated the implicit effect of emotional information by adopting a perceptual discrimination task. Specifically, we devised a task that explicitly required perceptual discrimination of a target while involving distance regulation in the presence of happy, neutral, or angry virtual agents. In two Immersive Virtual Reality experiments, participants were instructed to discriminate a target on the virtual agents’ t-shirts, and they had to provide the response by stopping the virtual agents (or themselves) at the distance where they could identify the target. Thus, facial expressions were completely irrelevant to the perceptual task. The results showed that the perceptual discrimination implied a longer response time when t-shirts were worn by angry rather than happy or neutral virtual agents. This suggests that angry faces interfered with the explicit perceptual task people had to perform. From a theoretical standpoint, this anger-superiority effect could reflect an ancestral fear/avoidance mechanism that prompts automatic defensive reactions and bypasses other cognitive processes.","[{'authorId': '47238167', 'name': 'M.

A large body of research has shown that alterations in ER are related to psychological disorders across different diagnostic categories. Because of the apparent ubiquity of ER difficulties in psychopathology, several authors have proposed that ER should be regarded as a transdiagnostic process. This article critically examines evidence regarding alterations in the use of cognitive ER strategies as a transdiagnostic process. Cognitive ER strategies are examined as 1 example of several possible ER-related processes that could be involved in psychopathology. There is consistent evidence showing that a reduced use of cognitive reappraisal and an increased use of negative rumination are present across a number of disorders, whereas increased levels of positive rumination appear to be confined to bipolar disorder. However, there is only preliminary evidence from prospective and/or experimental studies on the causal nature of altered ER strategy use in the development or maintenance of psychopathology. The article concludes by discussing future directions, including methodological and design issues, as well as implications for assessment and treatment when studying alterations in ER from a transdiagnostic perspective.

We studied whether the emotional expression of a virtual agent would affect the way humans touch the agent. Participants were asked to hold a pressure-sensing tube presented as the agent’s arm in VR. Upon seeing the agent’s emotional expression change, participants briefly squeezed the arm. The effect of emotional expressions on affective state was measured using self-reported valence and arousal as well as physiology-based indices. Onset, duration, and intensity of the squeeze were recorded to examine the haptic responses.

Investigating the neural underpinnings of adaptive emotion regulation and the extent to which such processes are compromised in MDD may be helpful in understanding the pathophysiology of depression. We report results from a functional magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrating left-lateralized activation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) when downregulating negative affect in nondepressed individuals, whereas depressed individuals showed bilateral PFC activation. Furthermore, during an effortful affective reappraisal task, nondepressed individuals showed an inverse relationship between activation in left ventrolateral PFC and the amygdala that is mediated by the ventromedial PFC (VMPFC). No such relationship was found for depressed individuals, who instead show a positive association between VMPFC and amygdala. Pupil dilation data suggest that those depressed patients who expend more effort to reappraise negative stimuli are characterized by accentuated activation in the amygdala, insula, and thalamus, whereas nondepressed individuals exhibit the opposite pattern. These findings indicate that a key feature underlying the pathophysiology of major depression is the counterproductive engagement of right prefrontal cortex and the lack of engagement of left lateral-ventromedial prefrontal circuitry important for the downregulation of amygdala responses to negative stimuli.","[{'authorId': '30361732', 'name': 'T.

In social psychological studies, helping behavior has been examined in the context of short-term encounters with strangers. This focus has tended to exclude from the research literature those helping behaviors prescribed by the female gender role, because they are displayed primarily in long-term, close relationships. In contrast, the helping behaviors prescribed by the male gender role have been generously represented in research findings because they are displayed in relationships with strangers as well as in close relationships. Results from our meta-analytic review of sex differences in helping behavior indicate that in general men helped more than women and women received more help than men. Nevertheless, sex differences in helping were extremely inconsistent across studies and were successfully predicted by various attributes of the studies and the helping behaviors. These predictors were interpreted in terms of several aspects of our social-role theory of gender and helping.","[{'authorId': '5689005', 'name': 'A.

In this article, using a “reverse engineering” approach, we suggest that emotion inference from facial expression mirrors the expression process. As a strong case can be made for an appraisal theory account of emotional expression, which holds that appraisal results directly determine the nature of facial muscle actions, we claim that observers first detect specific appraisals from different facial muscle actions and then use implicit inference rules to categorize and name specific emotions. We report three experiments in which, guided by theoretical predictions and past empirical evidence, we systematically manipulated specific facial action units individually and in different configurations via synthesized avatar expressions. Large, diverse groups of participants judged the resulting videos for the underlying appraisals and/or the ensuing emotions. The results confirm that participants can infer targeted appraisals and emotions from synthesized facial actions based on appraisal predictions. We also report evidence that the ability to correctly interpret the synthesized stimuli is highly correlated with emotion recognition ability as part of emotional competence. We conclude by highlighting the importance of adopting a theory-based experimental approach in future research, focusing on the dynamic unfolding of facial expressions of emotion.","[{'authorId': '2462740', 'name': 'K.

However, many clinicians feel ill equipped to deliver therapy via telehealth, while adhering to evidence‐based interventions. This article draws together clinician experiences of the issues that should be attended to, and how to address them within a telehealth framework. Method Seventy clinical colleagues of the authors were emailed and invited to share their concerns online about how to deliver cognitive‐behavioral therapy for eating disorders (CBT‐ED) via telehealth, and how to adapt clinical practice to deal with the problems that they and others had encountered. After 96 hr, all the suggestions that had been shared by 22 clinicians were collated to provide timely advice for other clinicians. Results A range of themes emerged from the online discussion. A large proportion were general clinical and practical domains (patient and therapist concerns about telehealth; technical issues in implementing telehealth; changes in the environment), but there were also specific considerations and clinical recommendations about the delivery of CBT‐ED methods. Discussion Through interaction and sharing of ideas, clinicians across the world produced a substantial number of recommendations about how to use telehealth to work with people with eating disorders while remaining on track with evidence‐based practice. These are shared to assist clinicians over the period of changed practice.","[{'authorId': '144838563', 'name': 'G. Waller'}, {'authorId': '145648852', 'name': 'M.

6b0165e1aa808b29d4790f9f725e867a97cb2789,"OBJECTIVE
Optimal mental health care is dependent upon sensitive and early detection of mental health problems. We have introduced a state-of-the-art method for the current study for remote behavioral monitoring that transports assessment out of the clinic and into the environments in which individuals negotiate their daily lives. The objective of this study was to examine whether the information captured with multimodal smartphone sensors can serve as behavioral markers for one's mental health. We hypothesized that (a) unobtrusively collected smartphone sensor data would be associated with individuals' daily levels of stress, and (b) sensor data would be associated with changes in depression, stress, and subjective loneliness over time.


METHOD
A total of 47 young adults (age range: 19-30 years) were recruited for the study. Individuals were enrolled as a single cohort and participated in the study over a 10-week period. Participants were provided with smartphones embedded with a range of sensors and software that enabled continuous tracking of their geospatial activity (using the Global Positioning System and wireless fidelity), kinesthetic activity (using multiaxial accelerometers), sleep duration (modeled using device-usage data, accelerometer inferences, ambient sound features, and ambient light levels), and time spent proximal to human speech (i.e., speech duration using microphone and speech detection algorithms). Participants completed daily ratings of stress, as well as pre- and postmeasures of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; Spitzer, Kroenke, & Williams, 1999), stress (Perceived Stress Scale; Cohen et al., 1983), and loneliness (Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale; Russell, Peplau, & Cutrona, 1980).


RESULTS
Mixed-effects linear modeling showed that sensor-derived geospatial activity (p < .05), sleep duration (p < .05), and variability in geospatial activity (p < .05), were associated with daily stress levels. Penalized functional regression showed associations between changes in depression and sensor-derived speech duration (p < .05), geospatial activity (p < .05), and sleep duration (p < .05). Changes in loneliness were associated with sensor-derived kinesthetic activity (p < .01).


CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE
Smartphones can be harnessed as instruments for unobtrusive monitoring of several behavioral indicators of mental health. Creative leveraging of smartphone sensing could provide novel opportunities for close-to-invisible psychiatric assessment at a scale and efficiency that far exceeds what is currently feasible with existing assessment technologies.","[{'authorId': '101333432', 'name': 'Dror Ben-Zeev'}, {'authorId': '47173776', 'name': 'E.

For this purpose, first, the factor structure of the scale was examined with a sample of 338 university students, and an identical factor structure with the original scale was obtained with the exclusion of a single item. Following the confirmation of the 6-factor structure of the scale with the current Turkish sample, the whole scale's and its six subscales' reliability coefficients were examined via internal consistency and test-retest reliability coefficients. These reliability analyses indicated satisfactory coefficients. As for the concurrent validity, the correlations of DERS and its subscales with measures of psychological distress were examined. This examination generally revealed strong correlations, although the awareness factor of DERS had relatively weaker correlations with the measures of psychological distress. Finally, concerning the criterion validity, all the measures of DERS could significantly differentiate the participants with ""high psychological distress"" from those with ""low psychological distress""; however, for the awareness subscale the effect size was small. These findings were discussed in line with the relevant literature.","[{'authorId': '4323102', 'name': 'R.

6b1e356674ec7ce0e43bf732ed770b25868f5e49,"Patients suffering from schizophrenia may report unusual experiences of their own actions. They may either feel that external forces are controlling their actions or even their thoughts, or they may feel in control of events that in fact are not caused by their actions. Most theories link these disturbances in the sense of agency to deficits in motor prediction, resulting in a mismatch between predicted and actual sensory feedback at a central comparator mechanism. Such theories therefore can account for situations in which the sense of agency is reduced. However, other experiments as well as clinical observations show an enhanced rather than reduced sense of agency in schizophrenic patients. Here, we distinguish between a predictive and a retrospective mechanism where both contribute to the experience of agency, and show that schizophrenia is associated with a specific impairment to the predictive component. We measured subjective time estimates of self-initiated voluntary action (a key press) that were followed by a sensory effect (a tone). When the voluntary actions had a high probability of causing tones, healthy volunteers showed a predictive shift of the perceptual estimate of the action towards the tone, even on occasional trials where the tone was omitted. No such shift occurred in the absence of the tone on blocks when tones were less frequent. The predictive component of action awareness was calculated as the difference between time estimates on 'action only' trials from blocks with lower and higher tone probabilities. Schizophrenic patients lacked this predictive component of action awareness, showing a shift on 'action only' trials, regardless of the probability of the tone. Importantly, the schizophrenic deficit in predicting the relation between action and effect was strongly correlated with severity of positive psychotic symptoms, specifically delusions and hallucinations. Furthermore, the patients showed an exaggerated retrospective binding between action and tone, shifting the perceived time of action whenever the tone occurred, relative to when it did not occur. Our quantitative, implicit measures show how basic sensory and motor experience may be altered in acute psychosis. The enhanced sense of agency in schizophrenia reflects reliance on retrospection, rather than prediction, to associate actions with external events. The failure to predict the effects of one's own actions may underlie the blurring and confusion in the relationship between the self and the world that characterizes acute psychosis.","[{'authorId': '31963288', 'name': 'M.

6b84e730bfc174f7a02b15c0c16f2a75f609a1bb,"Recent years have seen a significant expansion in research on computational models of human emotional processes, driven both by their potential for basic research on emotion and cognition as well as their promise for an ever-increasing range of applications. This has led to a truly interdisciplinary, mutually beneficial partnership between emotion research in psychology and in computational science, of which this volume is an exemplar. To understand this partnership and its potential for transforming existing practices in emotion research across disciplines and for disclosing important novel areas of research, we explore in this chapter the history of work in computational models of emotion including the various uses to which they have been put, the theoretical traditions that have shaped their development, and how these uses and traditions are reflected in their underlying architectures. For an outsider to the field, the last 15 years have seen the development of a seemingly bewildering array of competing and complementary computational models. Figure 1.2.1 lists a ‘family tree’ of a few of the significant models and the theoretical traditions from which they stem. Although there has been a proliferation of work, the field is far from mature: the goals that a model is designed to achieve are not always clearly articulated; research is rarely incremental, more often returning to motivating theories rather than extending prior computational approaches; and rarely are models contrasted with each other in terms of their ability to achieve their set goals. Contributing to potential confusion is the reality that computational models are complex systems embodying a number of, sometimes unarticulated, design decisions and assumptions inherited from the psychological and computational traditions from which they emerged, a circumstance made worse by the lack of a commonly accepted lexicon even for designating these distinctions. In this chapter, we lay out the work on computational models of emotion in an attempt to reveal the common uses to which they may be put and the underlying techniques and assumptions from which the models are built. Our aim is to present conceptual distinctions and common terminology that can aid in discussion and comparison of competing models. Our hope is that this will not only facilitate an understanding of the field for outside researchers but work towards a lexicon that can help foster the maturity of the field towards more incremental research. In characterizing different computational models of emotion, we begin by describing interdisciplinary uses to which computational models may be put, including their uses in improving human–computer interaction, in enhancing general models of intelligence, and as methodological tools for furthering our understanding of human behaviour. We next discuss how models have been built, including the underlying theoretical traditions that have shaped their development. These differing theoretical perspectives often conceptualize emotion in quite different ways, emphasizing different scenarios and proposed functions, different component processes, and different linkages between these components. It should then come as no surprise that such","[{'authorId': '1788771', 'name': 'S. Marsella'}, {'authorId': '145438097', 'name': 'J. Gratch'}, {'authorId': '1764052', 'name': 'P.

6c2b28f9354f667cd5bd07afc0471d8334430da7,"A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.","[{'authorId': '1751762', 'name': 'Yoshua Bengio'}, {'authorId': '36037226', 'name': 'Réjean Ducharme'}, {'authorId': '120247189', 'name': 'Pascal Vincent'}, {'authorId': '1909943744', 'name': 'Christian Janvin'}]",6928.0,,35.0,A Neural Probabilistic Language Model,2003.0

Doolittle is team lead for social behavioral research in the National Center for Education Research, Institute of Education Sciences, US Department of Education. Research increasingly suggests that social and emotional learning (SEL) matters a great deal for important life outcomes like success in school, college entry and completion, and later earnings. This research also tells us that SEL can be taught and nurtured in schools so that students increase their ability to integrate thinking, emotions, and behavior in ways that lead to positive school and life outcomes. Although the term social and emotional learning has been around for 20 years, we’ve recently seen a rapid surge in interest in SEL among parents, educators, and policymakers. For example, the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) is supporting 10 large school districts and 45 smaller ones through its Collaborating Districts Initiative as they begin to incorporate a variety of SEL programs and practices into their schools. CASEL also recently launched a Collaborating States Initiative to support states as they develop policies, standards, and guidelines for SEL in schools. All 50 states have SEL standards in place at the preschool level, and four (Illinois, Kansas, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania) have SEL standards for kindergarten through 12th grade. And the Aspen Institute recently launched a National Commission on Social, Emotional, and Academic Development to explore how schools can fully integrate SEL into policies and instruction that have traditionally emphasized academics. We also know that teachers believe SEL skills can be taught, although they may not always know the best way to do so in their classrooms.1","[{'authorId': '40521071', 'name': 'Stephanie M.

Although several studies designed to examine the correlation between extraversion and nonverbal behavior have been conducted, most attempts to summarize these studies reflect the inconsistent nature of the research findings. Indeed, correlations range from −.36 to .73. The extant literature summaries are limited to narrative reviews, however, which tend to be highly selective. The purpose of this study was to meta‐analyze the relevant studies. Results indicated that the mean correlation coefficient weighted for sample size was .13 for the entire sample of studies. Although 63% of the variance was attributable to sampling error, the distribution of correlations was heterogeneous. The remaining variance was due to two methodological artifacts: sample size and the number of nonverbal behaviors coded. For example, hierarchical breakdowns by moderator indicated that the mean correlation was .50 for highly focused studies—those in which researchers concentrated on a few behaviors and limited coding to 40 or fewer subjects. A cognitive‐overload model for these findings is offered and corroborated by findings from other research domains. Implications for communication research and theory are discussed.

We propose a unified learning framework that collectively addresses all the above issues by composing a committee of discriminators that can guide a base RNN generator towards more globally coherent generations. More concretely, discriminators each specialize in a different principle of communication, such as Grice’s maxims, and are collectively combined with the base RNN generator through a composite decoding objective. Human evaluation demonstrates that text generated by our model is preferred over that of baselines by a large margin, significantly enhancing the overall coherence, style, and information of the generations.","[{'authorId': '14487640', 'name': 'Ari Holtzman'}, {'authorId': '144685020', 'name': 'Jan Buys'}, {'authorId': '39191185', 'name': 'Maxwell Forbes'}, {'authorId': '2691021', 'name': 'Antoine Bosselut'}, {'authorId': '145798491', 'name': 'David Golub'}, {'authorId': '1699545', 'name': 'Yejin Choi'}]",186.0,,57.0,Learning to Write with Cooperative Discriminators,2018.0

These two modalities influence each other in perception. Under normal circumstances the speech information in both channels is coherent and complementary and integrated to a percept. But if the information is conflicting and nevertheless integrated then the percept in one of the modalities might be changed by the other modality. The experiment described here discovers that when the video of an utterance spoken in one emotion is dubbed with the audio of the utterance spoken in another emotion the perceived emotion might be a third – neither present in the auditory nor in the visual modality.,"[{'authorId': '1703808', 'name': 'Sascha Fagel'}]",34.0,,11.0,Emotional McGurk Effect,2006.0

This can be particularly apt for more at‐risk young people who may not engage readily with other approaches. Published evaluation of such interventions is however sparse. This paper aims to describe an evaluation of the DRUMBEAT program which uses drumming as a way to engage at‐risk youth, whilst simultaneously incorporating themes relating to mental wellbeing and healthy relationships., – An evaluation was undertaken in 19 schools participating in the ten‐week DRUMBEAT program. Pre, interim and post‐program surveys were administered to participating students (n=180). School‐based data on student behaviour and teacher feedback was also collected., – Positive changes were observed on several measures, including a 10 per cent increase in self‐esteem scores by program completion. School data showed a decrease in reported behaviour incidents for 29 per cent of participants. Overall, the evaluation indicated that the DRUMBEAT program provides a creative medium for working with at‐risk young people and helps develop self‐esteem and social relationship skills., – There is a paucity of published evaluations of interventions of this kind. Also novel is the delivery of the program in a school‐based rather than clinical therapy setting. The paper also demonstrates how a “real world” intervention program can go beyond basic process evaluation to collect outcome data that helps build the evidence base for mental health promotion.","[{'authorId': '145585911', 'name': 'L.

This study measured physiological responses to face-body-scene combinations. Participants freely viewed emotionally congruent and incongruent face-body and body-scene pairs whilst eye fixations, pupil-size, and electromyography (EMG) responses were recorded. Participants attended more to angry and fearful vs. happy or neutral cues, independent of the source and relatively independent from whether the face body and body scene combinations were emotionally congruent or not. Moreover, angry faces combined with angry bodies and angry bodies viewed in aggressive social scenes elicited greatest pupil dilation. Participants' face expressions matched the valence of the stimuli but when face-body compounds were shown, the observed facial expression influenced EMG responses more than the posture. Together, our results show that the perception of emotional signals from faces, bodies and scenes depends on the natural context, but when threatening cues are presented, these threats attract attention, induce arousal, and evoke congruent facial reactions.","[{'authorId': '27448594', 'name': 'M.

Unlike videoconference technology, which transmits direct video streams, immersive CVEs accurately track movements of interactants and render them nearly simultaneously (i.e., in real time) onto avatars, three-dimensional digital representations of the interactants. Nonverbal behaviors of interactants can be rendered veridically or transformed strategically (i.e., rendered nonveridically). This research examined augmented gaze, a transformation in which a given interactant's actual head movements are transformed by an algorithm that renders his or her gaze directly at multiple interactants simultaneously, such that each of the others perceives that the transformed interactant is gazing only at him or her. In the current study, a presenter read a persuasive passage to two listeners under various transformed gaze conditions, including augmented gaze. Results showed that women agreed with a persuasive message more during augmented gaze than other gaze conditions. Men recalled more verbal information from the passage than women.

Our proposed multi-user VR-based training subway environment offers flexibility to run multiple scenarios and evacuation drills for disaster preparedness and response.

First by defining rules for computer simulated agents, second by providing controls to the users to navigate in the VR environment as autonomous agents and the third by providing controls to the users with a keyboard/joystick along with an immersive VR head set in real time.

In this paper, head motion sequences in expressive facial animations are analyzed in terms of their naturalness and emotional salience in perception. Statistical measures are derived from an audiovisual database, comprising synchronized facial gestures and speech, which revealed characteristic patterns in emotional head motion sequences. Head motion patterns with neutral speech significantly differ from head motion patterns with emotional speech in motion activation, range, and velocity. The results show that head motion provides discriminating information about emotional categories. An approach to synthesize emotional head motion sequences driven by prosodic features is presented, expanding upon our previous framework on head motion synthesis. This method naturally models the specific temporal dynamics of emotional head motion sequences by building hidden Markov models for each emotional category (sadness, happiness, anger, and neutral state). Human raters were asked to assess the naturalness and the emotional content of the facial animations. On average, the synthesized head motion sequences were perceived even more natural than the original head motion sequences. The results also show that head motion modifies the emotional perception of the facial animation especially in the valence and activation domain. These results suggest that appropriate head motion not only significantly improves the naturalness of the animation but can also be used to enhance the emotional content of the animation to effectively engage the users","[{'authorId': '2106794', 'name': 'C.

Immersive virtual environments provide realistic and compelling experimental settings without sacrificing experimental control. The experiment reported here tested Argyle and Dean's (1965) equilibrium theory's specification of an inverse relationship between mutual gaze, a nonverbal cue signaling intimacy, and interpersonal distance. Participants were immersed in a three-dimensional virtual room in which a virtual human representation (that is, an embodied agent) stood. Under the guise of a memory task, participants walked towards and around the agent. Distance between the participant and agent was tracked automatically via our immersive virtual environment system. All participants maintained more space around agents than they did around similarly sized and shaped but nonhuman-like objects. Female participants maintained more interpersonal distance between themselves and agents who engaged them in eye contact (that is, mutual gaze behavior) than between themselves and agents who did not engage them in eye contact, whereas male participants did not.

However, this situation raises the following dilemma: the observation of a new action, different from the expected one, cannot be directly interpreted as an error; this action can instead constitute the beginning of a second plan, carried out in an interleaved way. In addition, this same action is not inevitably the result of a multiple plan realization; it can effectively be an error.

In this work, two experiments were conducted with that aim, one asking participants to compare two different versions of an application side-by-side when conveying a specific emotion, and another asking the participants to recognize the emotion being expressed in each version. We found that, for some emotions, the approach rated higher in terms of emotion expression during the side-by-side comparison would not translate to the approach with a higher emotion recognition in the second experiment. Although this discrepancy is generally consistent with what happens with emotion recognition in humans, it is noteworthy that some higher-rated choices ended up not being as effective in the expression of emotion. We discuss how these discrepancies might have originated from forced-choice and feature dominance, and why context should be taken into account when designing experiments.","[{'authorId': '2067551388', 'name': 'R.

In this paper, we propose to improve a VA's perceived EI by equipping it with personality-driven responsive expression of emotions. We conduct a within-subject experiment to verify this approach using a medical assistant VA. We ask participants to observe how the agent (displaying a dominant or submissive trait, or having no personality) handles user challenges when issuing reminders and rate its EI. Results show that simply being emotionally expressive is insufficient for suggesting VAs as fully emotionally intelligent. Equipping such VAs with a consistent, distinctive personality trait (especially submissive) can convey a significantly stronger sense of EI in terms of the ability to perceive, use, understand, and manage emotions, and can better mitigate user challenges.","[{'authorId': '3230330', 'name': 'Xiaojuan Ma'}, {'authorId': '2075453390', 'name': 'Emily P.

Here, we investigated the hypothesis that the vmPFC represents the subjective value or desirability of future outcomes during social decision-making. Both vmPFC-damaged patients and control participants acted as the responder in a single-round ultimatum game. To test outcome valuation, we contrasted concrete, immediately available gains with abstract, future ones. To test social valuation, we contrasted interactions with a human partner and those involving a computer. We found that, compared to controls, vmPFC patients substantially reduced their acceptance rate of unfair offers from a human partner, but only when financial gains were presented as abstract amounts to be received later. When the gains were visible and readily available, the vmPFC patients' acceptance of unfair offers was normal. Furthermore, unlike controls, vmPFC patients did not distinguish between unfair offers from a human agent and those from a computerized opponent. We conclude that the vmPFC encodes the expected value of abstract, future goals in a common neural currency that takes into account both reward and social signals in order to optimize economic decision-making.","[{'authorId': '46979318', 'name': 'L.

Student participants (N = 302) completed a survey about their most demanding class of the semester and reported on how demanding the class was, how much stress they experienced related to the class, and how often student peers communicated academic support in the class. A conditional process analysis revealed that (a) academic demands were positively associated with academic stress, (b) academic support from peers buffered the negative effect of stress on academic performance (moderation), and (c) academic demands produced a negative indirect effect on academic performance through stress, but this indirect effect was buffered by student academic support (moderated mediation). This study provides evidence that students earn lower grades when academic demands create stressors, but highlights the importance of peers communicating support in mitigating the effects of these stressors on grades.","[{'authorId': '115544029', 'name': 'Kevin C.

As a result, several mechanisms have been identified to work as catalyzers of cooperative behavior. Yet, these studies, mostly grounded on evolutionary dynamics and game theory, have neglected the important role played by intention recognition in behavioral evolution. Here we address explicitly this issue, characterizing the dynamics emerging from a population of intention recognizers. We derive a Bayesian network model for intention recognition in the context of repeated social dilemmas and evolutionary game theory, by assessing the internal dynamics of trust between intention recognizers and their opponents. Intention recognizers are then able to predict the next move of their opponents based on past direct interactions, which, in turn, enables them to prevail over the most famous strategies of repeated dilemmas of cooperation, even in presence of noise. Overall, our framework offers new insights on the complexity and beauty of behavioral evolution driven by elementary forms of cognition.","[{'authorId': '2928820', 'name': 'H.

To date, impaired ER (i.e., emotion dysregulation) has been identified as a transdiagnostic factor across a wide range of psychopathological conditions, which shows the importance of improving patients' ability to regulate negative and positive emotions in clinical practice. In addition to the increasing evidence showing its efficacy in the treatment of several clinical conditions, virtual reality (VR) has recently emerged as a potentially powerful tool for enhancing ER, thus breaking new ground in the development of cutting-edge transdiagnostic interventions. In the present narrative review, we will provide an overview of the existing evidence about VR-based interventions in the field of ER, emphasizing the promising findings and the barriers that still have to be addressed. To this aim, the available VR-based literature will be analysed in relation to four categories of ER strategies: Situational strategies, attentional strategies, cognitive strategies and response modulation strategies. Furthermore, new emerging fields of research targeting innovative aspects of ER will be highlighted, including the use of VR to promote positive emotions and interpersonal ER skills. Besides, its cost-effectiveness will be discussed, taking into account the costs for both developers (e.g., clinicians and researchers) and end-users.

Materials and Methods: The study included 80 patients who met the study criteria according to the DSM-5 criteria and 80 randomly selected healthy individuals with similar sociodemographic characteristics. Panic Agoraphobia Scale, Childhood Trauma Scale (CTQ-28), and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) were applied to the participants. Results: A total of 160 cases were included in the study, including 80 patients aged 18-53 and 80 control subjects aged 19-61. In the patient group, the total score of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)) and the Awareness, Openness, Disagreement, Strategies, Impulse and Goals subscales were statistically significantly higher than the control group. The prevalence of those with a CTQ score of ≥35 was 47.5% in the patient group and 26.3% in the control group, which was statistically significantly higher in the patient group. Increase in “Disagreement”, “Awareness”, and “Goals” subscores significantly increased the likelihood of being in the patient group. Conclusion: Pharmacological agents and therapies targeting the affected regions may reduce the adverse effects of childhood trauma and associated emotional regulation difficulties in patients with panic disorder, increasing the success of treatment and quality of life.

Here, we used functional MRI to clarify how the brain recognizes happiness or fear expressed by a whole body. Our results indicate that observing fearful body expressions produces increased activity in brain areas narrowly associated with emotional processes and that this emotion-related activity occurs together with activation of areas linked with representation of action and movement.

In Experiment 1, subjects negotiated and then learned that their opponent felt happy/disappointed/neutral. Negotiators felt less successful when their opponent was happy than when the opponent was disappointed. This effect occurred independent of negotiators′ actual performance on the task. The feeling of success was ""bittersweet"", however, in that individuals who felt successful also regarded themselves as less honest, less sincere, less generous, and less fair - in short, less honourable in the negotiations. Experiment 2 tested the prediction that intergroup relationships govern the inverse affect and bittersweet effects. Individuals who negotiated with a disappointed opponent felt successful when the opponent was an out-group member, but not when the opponent was an in-group member. Negotiators allocated substantially more resources to in-group members who expressed disappointment with a previous outcome than to out-group members who expressed disappointment.","[{'authorId': '50405579', 'name': 'Leigh Thompson'}, {'authorId': '3334136', 'name': 'Kathleen L.

Emotion regulation (ER) supports multiple individual functions and promotes mental health and wellbeing. Among the tools that may be used to help people in managing their affective states, videogames are reaching attention and are showing positive effects. Yet, little is known about their effectiveness.


OBJECTIVE
This study aims to assess the amount and quality of studies investigating the effects and modalities of the use of videogames for ER.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A systematic literature search according to PRISMA guidelines was performed. Subsequently, according to expert advice other few studies have been added.


RESULTS
Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review; they can be categorized into three groups, namely (1) cross-sectional and qualitative studies, (2) experimental studies investigating the effects of videogame experience on ER and (3) ER intervention with serious games.


DISCUSSION
Discussion of the reviewed studies highlights that frequent gaming with commercial games offers more opportunities for ER improvement (related to gameplay and enjoyment of fictional properties) than limited-time experiences, such as those supported by bespoke serious games. This research area is still in its infancy and findings need to be interpreted with caution; furthermore, future reviews are encouraged to include clinical populations.


CONCLUSION
Videogames offer several opportunities for ER and a challenge for educational and psychological interventions.","[{'authorId': '103238720', 'name': 'D. Villani'}, {'authorId': '2164209', 'name': 'C.

We perform a threefold evaluation based on self-assessment questionnaires, expert assessments, and two objectively annotated measures of eye-contact and avoidance of pause fillers.

Virtual human faces are useful for conducting controlled experiments. However, little is known regarding the possible differences between physiological responses elicited by virtual versus real human facial expressions. The aim of the current study was to determine if virtual and real emotional faces elicit the same rapid facial reactions for the perception of facial expressions of joy, anger, and sadness. Facial electromyography (corrugator supercilii, zygomaticus major, and depressor anguli) was recorded in 30 participants during the presentation of dynamic or static and virtual or real faces. For the perception of dynamic facial expressions of joy and anger, analyses of electromyography data revealed that rapid facial reactions were stronger when participants were presented with real faces compared with virtual faces. These results suggest that the processes underlying the perception of virtual versus real emotional faces might differ.","[{'authorId': '2560627', 'name': 'L.

These questions fascinate philosophers, biologists, and economists alike, for the ""invisible hand"" that should turn selfish efforts into public benefit is not always at work. The Calculus of Selfishness looks at social dilemmas where cooperative motivations are subverted and self-interest becomes self-defeating. Karl Sigmund, a pioneer in evolutionary game theory, uses simple and well-known game theory models to examine the foundations of collective action and the effects of reciprocity and reputation. Focusing on some of the best-known social and economic experiments, including games such as the Prisoner's Dilemma, Trust, Ultimatum, Snowdrift, and Public Good, Sigmund explores the conditions leading to cooperative strategies. His approach is based on evolutionary game dynamics, applied to deterministic and probabilistic models of economic interactions. Exploring basic strategic interactions among individuals guided by self-interest and caught in social traps, The Calculus of Selfishness analyzes to what extent one key facet of human nature--selfishness--can lead to cooperation.","[{'authorId': '1767754', 'name': 'K.

Participants were 38 parents and 41 children recruited from regional/rural Queensland and metropolitan Brisbane, Australia. Child participants completed measures of social skills and emotion management, and parents completed measures related to child behavioral problems, parent self-efficacy, child anxiety, and parent emotional distress at pre-intervention, post intervention, and 6-week follow-up. Analyses of outcomes were conducted with a series of repeated-measures MANOVAs and one-way ANOVAs at post intervention and 6-week follow-up. There were significant improvements in child social skills reported by parents with gains maintained at 6-week follow-up with large effect sizes. Parent self-efficacy, child behavior, and child anxiety levels also improved significantly. In addition, outcomes from the SAS self-directed program were compared with the original clinic-based program conducted by Beaumont and Sofronoff. Results indicated greater changes in social skills outcomes in the clinic-based program and no difference between groups on emotional management strategies.

According to Gross's (1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271-299) process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners. This review concludes with a consideration of five important directions for future research on emotion regulation processes.","[{'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

76c5bea02f6d6d6a7acd8bbb09425606edd213f1,"Novel systems and algorithms have been designed and built to recognize affective patterns in physiological signals. Experiments were conducted for evaluation of the new systems and algorithms in three types of settings: a highly constrained laboratory setting, a largely unconstrained ambulatory environment, and a less unconstrained automotive environment. The laboratory experiment was designed to test for the presence of unique physiological patterns given a relatively motionless seated subject, intentionally expressing one of eight different emotions. This experiment generated a large dataset of physiological signals containing many day-today variations, and the proposed features contributed to a success rate of 81% for discriminating all eight emotions and up to 100% for subsets of emotion based on similar emotion qualities. For experiments in a largely unconstrained ambulatory setting, new wearable computer systems and sensors were developed and tested on subjects who walked, jogged, talked, and otherwise went about daily activities. Although physical motion often overwhelmed affective signals in this context, the systems developed in this thesis are currently useful as activity monitors, providing an image diary correlated with physiological signals. A third experiment was conducted in the natural but physically constrained environment of an automobile, generating a large database of physiological signals covering over 40 hours of driving data. This experiment was designed to induce varying amounts of stress in three conditions: rest, city diving and highway driving. Algorithms for detecting driver stress achieved a recognition rates of 96% for stress ratings based on task conditions and 89% accuracy using ratings of perceived stress from driver questionnaires. The results of second by second video coding of stressors by independent coders showed highly significant correlations with physiological features (up to r = .77 for over 4000 samples). Together, these three experiments show a range of success in recognizing affect from physiology, highlighting the need for more automatic context sensing in unconstrained conditions, and showing high recognition rates given somewhat constrained conditions. The recognition rates obtained thus far lend support to the hypothesis that many emotional differences can be automatically discriminated in patterns of physiological changes.

The idea is put forward, based on the experience of a large number of experimental studies, that there are two orthogonal components that contribute to this realistic response. The first is ‘being there’, often called ‘presence’, the qualia of having a sensation of being in a real place. We call this place illusion (PI). Second, plausibility illusion (Psi) refers to the illusion that the scenario being depicted is actually occurring. In the case of both PI and Psi the participant knows for sure that they are not ‘there’ and that the events are not occurring. PI is constrained by the sensorimotor contingencies afforded by the virtual reality system. Psi is determined by the extent to which the system can produce events that directly relate to the participant, the overall credibility of the scenario being depicted in comparison with expectations. We argue that when both PI and Psi occur, participants will respond realistically to the virtual reality.","[{'authorId': '144931212', 'name': 'M.

Nevertheless, most attempts focused on using pedagogical agents to achieve traditional e-learning goals which place heavy emphasis on learning outcomes. In addition, the high technical barrier presented by the agent oriented software engineering (AOSE) paradigm have limited the complexity and wide acceptance of many pedagogical agents in virtual learning environments (VLE). In this paper, we leverage on our previous research results – the Multi-Agent Development Environment (MADE) which drastically reduced to the technical hurdle of incorporating pedagogical agents into VLEs. We present a VLE augmented with teachable agents designed based on the experiential learning model (ELM) to facilitate the learning of high school science topics and demonstrate the efficacy of MADE in designing complex learning activities, designing teachable agents that complement immersive experiential learning and supporting the design based research (DBR) development model.","[{'authorId': '9380191', 'name': 'Han Yu'}, {'authorId': '1679209', 'name': 'C.

When people are fearful of something, they tend to avoid the feared objects, activities, or situations. Although this avoidance might help reduce feelings of fear in the short term, over the long term it can make the fear become even worse. In such situations, a psychologist might recommend a program of exposure therapy in order to help break the pattern of avoidance and fear. In this form of therapy, psychologists create a safe environment in which to ""expose"" individuals to the things they fear and avoid.

Initial hypotheses suggested that firefighters would report disrupted world assumptions and that these disrupted assumptions would be linked with greater mental health symptomatology. Results revealed that firefighters were not different from controls on world assumptions and that world assumptions were unrelated to years of service. These results suggest that the psychological reactions of workers exposed to high levels of job-related traumatic stress may not be consistent with that described in previous literature regarding primary victims.

The purpose of this review is to configure primarily qualitative and mixed methods findings from studies meeting our selection and quality criterion to answer the review question: How do robotic construction kits function as computational manipulatives in P–12 STEM education? Our synthesis of the literature has resulted in four key insights that are new to the field. First, RCKs have a unique double application: They may be used for direct instruction in robotics (first-order uses) or as analogical tools for learning in other domains (second-order uses). Second, RCKs make possible additional routes to learning through the provision of immediate feedback and the dual modes of representation unique to RCKs. Third, RCKs support a computational thinking learning progression beginning with a lower anchor of sequencing and finishing with a high anchor of systems thinking. And fourth, RCKs support evolving problem-solving abilities along a continuum, ranging from trial and error to heuristic methods associated with robotics study. Furthermore, our synthesis provides insight into the second-order (analogical) uses of RCKs as computational manipulatives in the disciplines of physics and biology. Implications for practice and directions for future research are discussed.

We found that emotion drivers can induce the behavior of a trained agent. Our approach is a case of goal parameterized reinforcement learning. Thus, we create conditioning between emotion drivers and a set of goals that determine the behavioral profile of a virtual character. We train agents who can randomly assume these goals while trying to maximize a reward function based on intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. A mapping between motivation and emotion was carried out. So, the agent learned a behavior profile as a training goal. The developed approach was integrated with the Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm. Experiments showed that this approach produces behaviors consistent with the objectives given to agents, and has potential for the development of believable virtual characters.","[{'authorId': '153468821', 'name': 'Gilzamir Gomes'}, {'authorId': '1872209', 'name': 'C.

Gaze cues in particular are integral in mechanisms for communication and management of attention in social interactions, which can trigger important social and cognitive processes, such as establishment of affiliation between people or learning new information. The fundamental building blocks of gaze behaviors are gaze shifts: coordinated movements of the eyes, head, and body toward objects and information in the environment. In this article, we present a novel computational model for gaze shift synthesis for ECAs that supports parametric control over coordinated eye, head, and upper body movements. We employed the model in three studies with human participants. In the first study, we validated the model by showing that participants are able to interpret the agent’s gaze direction accurately. In the second and third studies, we showed that by adjusting the participation of the head and upper body in gaze shifts, we can control the strength of the attention signals conveyed, thereby strengthening or weakening their social and cognitive effects. The second study shows that manipulation of eye--head coordination in gaze enables an agent to convey more information or establish stronger affiliation with participants in a teaching task, while the third study demonstrates how manipulation of upper body coordination enables the agent to communicate increased interest in objects in the environment.","[{'authorId': '2633572', 'name': 'T.

This study aimed at analyzing the relationships between students' emotions, coping strategies, and self-regulated learning in online learning during COVID-19 home confinement. The participants were 1,290 Mexican students from different universities throughout the country, who answered an online self-report questionnaire from standardized instruments adapted to the pandemic. Data were analyzed with descriptive and inferential analyses, including a structural equation model (SEM). Findings indicate that, although anxiety, boredom, and frustration were present among participants during confinement, the primary emotions were gratitude, joy, and hope. Second, the main coping strategies used by students participating were focused on facing and reassessing the situation. Furthermore, tranquility, hope, gratitude, and joy were positively related to self-regulated learning, although, loneliness and disinterest were negatively related. Finally, it was found that an approach to coping strategies mediated the relationship between emotions and self-regulated learning. Thus, teachers should help students understand the relevance of active coping strategies and use student-centered learning models that promote autonomous and self-regulated learning, considering each learner's needs, during and after confinement.","[{'authorId': '48131750', 'name': 'M.

Increasing evidence demonstrates that deficits in the ability to adaptively cope with challenging emotions are related to depression, borderline personality disorder, substance-use disorders, eating disorders, somatoform disorders, and a variety of other psychopathological symptoms. Unfortunately, studies differ with regard to the conceptualization and assessment of emotion regulation, thus limiting the ability to compare findings across studies. Future research should systematically work to use comparable methods in order to clarify the following: which individuals have; what kinds of emotion regulation difficulties with; which types of emotions; and what interventions are most effective in alleviating these difficulties.

Aims The article is intended to (1) increase practitioners' knowledge of the empirical support for the effectiveness of single-session counselling with client populations typically served in community-based mental health and counselling agencies and (2) identify priorities for future research on SST. Method A thorough review of relevant databases was undertaken to locate published studies reporting client outcomes following SST. The focus of the review is research involving clients and presenting problems typically seen in community-based mental health and family counselling agencies. Results The findings suggest that the majority of clients attending either previously scheduled or walk-in SST find it sufficient and helpful. The studies imply that this model of service delivery leads to perceived improvement in presenting problems in general, and on specific measures of variables such as depression, anxiety, distress level and confidence in parenting skills.

7b0248cb101486188cf71cb021235e4413e54ff5,"Abstract In humans and monkeys, face perception activates a distributed cortical network that includes extrastriate, limbic, and prefrontal regions. Within face‐responsive regions, emotional faces evoke stronger responses than neutral faces (“valence effect”). We used fMRI and Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) to test the hypothesis that emotional faces differentially alter the functional coupling among face‐responsive regions. Three monkeys viewed conspecific faces with neutral, threatening, fearful, and appeasing expressions. Using Bayesian model selection, various models of neural interactions between the posterior (TEO) and anterior (TE) portions of inferior temporal (IT) cortex, the amygdala, the orbitofrontal (OFC), and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) were tested. The valence effect was mediated by feedback connections from the amygdala to TE and TEO, and feedback connections from VLPFC to the amygdala and TE. Emotional faces were associated with differential effective connectivity: Fearful faces evoked stronger modulations in the connections from the amygdala to TE and TEO; threatening faces evoked weaker modulations in the connections from the amygdala and VLPFC to TE; and appeasing faces evoked weaker modulations in the connection from VLPFC to the amygdala. Our results suggest dynamic alterations in neural coupling during the perception of behaviorally relevant facial expressions that are vital for social communication.","[{'authorId': '143881179', 'name': 'Ning Liu'}, {'authorId': '1402123088', 'name': 'F.

 This paper envisions a future where autonomous agents are used to foster and support pro-social behavior in a hybrid society of humans and machines. Pro-social behavior occurs when people and agents perform costly actions that benefit others. Acts such as helping others voluntarily, donating to charity, providing informations or sharing resources, are all forms of pro-social behavior. We discuss two questions that challenge a purely utilitarian view of human decision making and contextualize its role in hybrid societies: i) What are the conditions and mechanisms that lead societies of agents and humans to be more pro-social? ii) How can we engineer autonomous entities (agents and robots) that lead to more altruistic and cooperative behaviors in a hybrid society? We propose using social simulations, game theory, population dynamics, and studies with people in virtual or real environments (with robots) where both agents and humans interact. This research will constitute the basis for establishing the foundations for the new field of Pro-social Computing, aiming at understanding, predicting and promoting pro-sociality among humans, through artificial agents and multiagent systems.

Many have investigated emotional contents in speech alone, or recognition of human facial expressions solely from images. However, relatively little has been done in combining these two modalities for recognizing human emotions. L.C. De Silva et al. (1997) studied human subjects' ability to recognize emotions from viewing video clips of facial expressions and listening to the corresponding emotional speech stimuli. They found that humans recognize some emotions better by audio information, and other emotions better by video. They also proposed an algorithm to integrate both kinds of inputs to mimic human's recognition process. While attempting to implement the algorithm, we encountered difficulties which led us to a different approach. We found these two modalities to be complimentary. By using both, we show it is possible to achieve higher recognition rates than either modality alone.","[{'authorId': '2108579847', 'name': 'Lawrence S.

Recent studies suggest the involvement of frontal cortical regions in the modulation of amygdala reactivity and the mediation of effective emotion regulation. However, within-subject inter-regional connectivity between amygdala and prefrontal cortex in the context of affect regulation is unknown. Here, using psychophysiological interaction analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we show that activity in specific areas of the frontal cortex (dorsolateral, dorsal medial, anterior cingulate, orbital) covaries with amygdala activity and that this functional connectivity is dependent on the reappraisal task. Moreover, strength of amygdala coupling with orbitofrontal cortex and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex predicts the extent of attenuation of negative affect following reappraisal. These findings highlight the importance of functional connectivity within limbic-frontal circuitry during emotion regulation.","[{'authorId': '2103831216', 'name': 'S.

We illustrate how our probabilistic model assesses affect by integrating evidence on both possible causes of the user's emotional arousal (i.e., the state of the interaction) and its effects (i.e., bodily expressions that are known to be influenced by emotional reactions). The probabilistic model relies on a Dynamic Decision Network to leverage any indirect evidence on the user's emotional state, in order to estimate this state and any other related variable in the model. This is crucial in a modeling task in which the available evidence usually varies with the user and with each particular interaction.

We analyse four cases of parent–child digital co-play on Let’s Play gaming videos with Roblox on YouTube. Our research method adopts a netnography research approach and multimodal discourse analysis to examine the data. We identify three ways of digital co-play, which include the parent-directed, parent–child negotiated, and child-directed parent–child interaction styles from the analysis of the videos. Following the analysis, we discuss how each of the ways of parent–child digital co-play can be productive in helping the child learn through shared gameplay with parents. We suggest how children can learn through communicating with parents during gameplay, creating something by themselves in the game, modelling parents’ in-game behaviour, teaching their parents by sharing their knowledge, and leading the co-play. Our study aims to serve as a conversational starter to contribute to the global discourse on the phenomenon of parent and child shared interactions with digital technology as well as the ways in which learning can be facilitated through such experiences.","[{'authorId': '3443969', 'name': 'Weimin Toh'}, {'authorId': '37679213', 'name': 'Fei Victor Lim'}]",9.0,,57.0,Let’s play together: ways of parent–child digital co-play for learning,2021.0

Behavioural activation has attracted increased interest in recent years. It has been over 5 years since our meta-analyses summarised the evidence supporting and this systematic review updates those findings and examines moderators of treatment effect. Method Randomised trials of behavioural activation for depression versus controls or anti-depressant medication were identified using electronic database searches, previous reviews and reference lists. Data on symptom level and study level moderators were extracted and analysed using meta-analysis, sub-group analysis and meta-regression respectively. Results Twenty six randomised controlled trials including 1524 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. A random effects meta-analysis of symptom level post treatment showed behavioural activation to be superior to controls (SMD −0.74 CI −0.91 to −0.56, k = 25, N = 1088) and medication (SMD −0.42 CI −0.83 to-0.00, k = 4, N = 283). Study quality was low in the majority of studies and follow- up time periods short. There was no indication of publication bias and subgroup analysis showed limited association between moderators and effect size. Conclusions The results in this meta-analysis support and strengthen the evidence base indicating Behavioural Activation is an effective treatment for depression. Further high quality research with longer term follow-up is needed to strengthen the evidence base.","[{'authorId': '5122698', 'name': 'D. Ekers'}, {'authorId': '47726884', 'name': 'L.

To address the above challenges, we propose to leverage multi-type knowledge, i.e, the commonsense knowledge and emotional lexicon, to explicitly understand and express emotions in empathetic dialogue generation. We first enrich the dialogue history by jointly interacting with two-type knowledge and construct an emotional context graph. Then we introduce a multi-type knowledge-aware context encoder to learn emotional context representations and distill emotional signals, which are the prerequisites to predicate emotions expressed in responses. Finally, we propose an emotional cross-attention mechanism to exploit the emotional dependencies between the emotional context graph and the target empathetic response.

Extraversion covaried most strongly with physical attributes, and implicit theories on the covariation of traits with physical attributes were more accurate for extraversion and conscientiousness than for agreeableness, emotional stability, and culture. If judges indicate their impressions of other people, their judgments usually correlate with the self-reports of the ratees. Moreover, the correlations between self-ratings and ratings by judges tend to be higher the more the judges know about the targets (Cloyd, 1977; Funder & Colvin, 1988; Norman & Goldberg, 1966; Paunonen, 1989). The highest correlations are usually found between self-reports and ratings by spouses. McCrae and Costa (1989) report correlations between self-ratings and spouse ratings from .53 to .60, whereas they report somewhat lower correlations, ranging from .32 to .54, between self-reports and ratings by a single peer. These findings indicate that (a) personality ratings reflect actual attributes of the target persons rather than illusions that exist only in the eye of the beholder, and (b) self-ratings and ratings by others agree more the more that both reflect shared information concerning the targets' personality. Consensus at Zero Acquaintance This raises the question of how much information is required in order that ratings by others possess some validity. We use the term valid to indicate that ratings by strangers or acquaintances correlate substantially with the targets' self-reports. At first glance, this is a curious usage of the idea of validity because self-reports are usually more suspect than observer ratings and are therefore frequently validated against observer ratings. But we have a special case here: Because the observers are strangers, the self-ratings are the more dependable measure of the actual personality of the ratees.","[{'authorId': '49646545', 'name': 'P.

7e297a8431974c92e779fa16a2f40dec32b60e43,"Delivering appealing virtual characters conveying personality is becoming extremely important in the entertainment industry and beyond. A theory called the 'Uncanny Valley' has been used to describe the phenomenon that the appearance of a virtual character can contribute to negative/positive audience reactions to that character [Mori 1970]. Since the style used to render a character strongly changes the appearance, we investigate whether a difference in render style can indirectly influence audience reaction, which we measure based on perception of personality. Based on psychology research, we first scripted original character dialogues in order to convey a range of ten typical personality types. Then, a professional actor was recruited to act out these dialogues, while his face and body motion and audio were recorded. The performances were mapped onto a virtual character rendered in two styles that differ in appearance: an appealing cartoon style and unappealing ill style (Figure 1). In our experiment, participants were asked questions about the character's personality in order for us to test if the difference in render style causes differences in personality perception. Our results found an indirect effect of render style where the cartoon style was rated as having a more agreeable personality than the ill style. This result has implications for developers interested in creating appealing virtual humans, avoiding the 'Uncanny Valley' phenomenon.","[{'authorId': '1710384', 'name': 'Katja Zibrek'}, {'authorId': '145795454', 'name': 'R.

Under the SelfAttachment therapeutic framework, the causes of disorders such as chronic anxiety and depression are traced back to the quality of the individual’s attachment with their primary caregiver during childhood. Our proposed platform aims to assist the user in enhancing their capacities for self-regulation of emotion, by means of earning secure attachment through the experience of positive attachment interactions, missed in their childhood. In the virtual environment provided by the platform, the adult-self of the user learns to create and strengthen an affectional and supportive bond with the inner-child. It is hypothesised that by long term potentiation and neuroplasticity, the user gradually develops new neural pathways and matures into an effective secure attachment object for the inner-child, thereby enabling the self-regulation of emotions.","[{'authorId': '2585368', 'name': 'David Cittern'}, {'authorId': '1694989', 'name': 'A.

Affect labeling (labeling emotional experience) attenuates emotional responding. The current project examined whether affect labeling enhances exposure effectiveness in participants with public speaking anxiety. Participants were randomized to exposure with or without affect labeling. Physiological arousal and self-reported fear were assessed before and after exposure and compared between groups. Consistent with hypotheses, participants assigned to Affect Labeling, especially those who used more labels during exposure, showed greater reduction in physiological activation than Control participants. No effect was found for self-report measures. eScholarship provides open access, scholarly publishing services to the University of California and delivers a dynamic research platform to scholars worldwide. Also, greater emotion regulation deficits at baseline predicted more benefit in physiological arousal from exposure combined with affect labeling than exposure alone. The current research provides evidence that behavioral strategies that target prefrontal-amygdala circuitry can improve treatment effectiveness for anxiety and these effects are particularly pronounced for patients with the greatest deficits in emotion regulation. a b s t r a c t Exposure is an effective treatment for anxiety but many patients do not respond fully.

To establish the effects of gaze direction on the encoding process, participants were presented with to-be-studied faces displaying either direct or deviated gaze (i.e. encoding manipulation). At test, all the faces depicted persons with their eyes closed. To investigate the effects of gaze direction on the efficiency of the retrieval process, a second condition (i.e. retrieval manipulation) was run in which target faces were presented initially with eyes closed and tested with either direct or deviated gaze. The results revealed the encoding advantages enjoyed by faces with direct gaze was present for both children and adults. Faces with direct gaze were also recognized better than faces with deviated gaze at retrieval, although this effect was most pronounced for adults. Finally, the advantage for direct gaze over deviated gaze at encoding was greater than the advantage for direct gaze over deviated gaze at retrieval.

In principle, perceptual cancellation of the displacements of the retinal stimulus caused by fixational eye movements could be achieved either by means of motor/proprioceptive information or by inferring eye movements directly from the retinal stimulus. In this study, we examined the mechanisms underlying visual stability during ocular drift, the primary source of retinal image motion during fixation on a stationary scene. By using an accurate system for gaze-contingent display control, we decoupled the eye movements of human observers from the changes in visual input that they normally cause. We show that the visual system relies on the spatiotemporal stimulus on the retina, rather than on extraretinal information, to discard the motion signals resulting from ocular drift. These results have important implications for the establishment of stable visual representations in the brain and argue that failure to visually determine eye drift contributes to well known motion illusions such as autokinesis and induced movement.","[{'authorId': '39182871', 'name': 'Martina Poletti'}, {'authorId': '2081158757', 'name': 'Chiara Listorti'}, {'authorId': '1816366', 'name': 'M.

The VOR has three main components: the peripheral sensory apparatus (a set of motion sensors: the semicircular canals, SCCs, and the otolith organs), a central processing mechanism, and the motor output (the eye muscles). The SCCs sense angular acceleration to detect head rotation; the otolith organs sense linear acceleration to detect both head translation and the position of the head relative to gravity. The SCCs are arranged in a push-pull configuration with two coplanar canals on each side (like the left and right horizontal canals) working together. During angular head movements, if one part is excited the other is inhibited and vice versa. While the head is at rest, the primary vestibular afferents have a tonic discharge which is exactly balanced between corresponding canals. During rotation, the head velocity corresponds to the difference in the firing rate between SCC pairs. Knowledge of the geometrical arrangement of the SCCs within the head and of the functional properties of the otolith organs allows to localize and interpret certain patterns of nystagmus and ocular misalignment. This is based on the experimental observation that stimulation of a single SCC leads v ia the VOR to slowphase eye movements that rotate the globe in a plane parallel to that of the stimulated canal. Furthermore, knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie compensation for vestibular disorders is essential for correctly diagnosing and effectively managing patients with vestibular disturbances.","[{'authorId': '49390472', 'name': 'M.

Yet, their systematic experimental study remains a challenging open problem due to ethical and methodological constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate the viability of shared three-dimensional virtual environments as an experimental platform for conducting crowd experiments with real people. In particular, we show that crowds of real human subjects moving and interacting in an immersive three-dimensional virtual environment exhibit typical patterns of real crowds as observed in real-life crowded situations. These include the manifestation of social conventions and the emergence of self-organized patterns during egress scenarios. High-stress evacuation experiments conducted in this virtual environment reveal movements characterized by mass herding and dangerous overcrowding as they occur in crowd disasters. We describe the behavioural mechanisms at play under such extreme conditions and identify critical zones where overcrowding may occur. Furthermore, we show that herding spontaneously emerges from a density effect without the need to assume an increase of the individual tendency to imitate peers.

Data show an overall accuracy of 66% across all emotions and countries. Although accuracy was substantially better than chance, there were sizable differences ranging from 74% in Germany to 52% in Indonesia. However, patterns of confusion were very similar across all countries. These data suggest the existence of similar inference rules from vocal expression across cultures.

First, a model of lighting and filters inspired on the visual arts is integrated with a virtual human platform to manipulate color. Next, an evolutionary model, based on genetic algorithms, is created to evolve mappings between emotions and lighting and filter parameters. A first study is, then, conducted where subjects evolve mappings for joy and sadness without being aware of the evolutionary model. In a second study, the features which characterize the mappings are analyzed. Results show that virtual human images of joy tend to be brighter, more saturated and have more colors than images of sadness. The paper discusses the relevance of the results for the fields of expression of emotions and virtual humans.","[{'authorId': '1977901', 'name': 'C. D. Melo'}, {'authorId': '145438097', 'name': 'J.

Investigate the psychometric characteristics of the coping self-efficacy (CSE) scale, a 26-item measure of one's confidence in performing coping behaviors when faced with life challenges.


DESIGN
Data came from two randomized clinical trials (N1=149, N2=199) evaluating a theory-based Coping Effectiveness Training (CET) intervention in reducing psychological distress and increasing positive mood in persons coping with chronic illness.


METHODS
The 348 participants were HIV-seropositive men with depressed mood who have sex with men. Participants were randomly assigned to intervention and comparison conditions and assessed pre- and post-intervention. Outcome variables included the CSE scale, ways of coping, and measures of social support and psychological distress and well-being.


RESULTS
Exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) revealed a 13-item reduced form of the CSE scale with three factors: Use problem-focused coping (6 items, alpha=.91), stop unpleasant emotions and thoughts (4 items, alpha=.91), and get support from friends and family (3 items, alpha=.80). Internal consistency and test-retest reliability are strong for all three factors. Concurrent validity analyses showed these factors assess self-efficacy for different types of coping. Predictive validity analyses showed that residualized change scores in using problem- and emotion-focused coping skills were predictive of reduced psychological distress and increased psychological well-being over time.


CONCLUSIONS
The CSE scale provides a measure of a person's perceived ability to cope effectively with life challenges, as well as a way to assess changes in CSE over time in intervention research.","[{'authorId': '144965996', 'name': 'M.

On this basis, we propose a network to capture states of personal distress and (weak and strong forms of) empathic concern, which are particularly relevant for psychotherapists conducting attachment-based interventions. This model is then extended for the case of self-attachment therapy, in which conceptualized components of the self serve as both the source of and target for empathic resonance. In particular, we consider how states of empathic concern involving an other that is perceived as being closely related to the self might enhance the motivation for self-directed bonding (which in turn is proposed to lead the individual toward more compassionate states) in terms of medial prefrontal cortex–mediated activation of these caregiving pathways. We simulate our model computationally and discuss the interplay between the bonding and empathy protocols of the therapy.","[{'authorId': '2585368', 'name': 'David Cittern'}, {'authorId': '1694989', 'name': 'A.

Methods: The literature search was conducted in the Medline, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases. Main criteria for selection were that the participants were adult persons with TBI, social cognition as well as social behaviour or social outcome post-TBI was assessed and correlations between social cognition and social behaviour or outcome were reported. Average correlations were calculated based on weighted summation of the correlations from the individual studies. Results: Of the 511 publications identified in the search, 13 were selected. Ten of these assessed emotion recognition, six assessed understanding of intentions and two assessed empathy. Average correlations between social cognition performance and post-injury social behaviour or outcome were significant for each of the three social cognition functions; poorer performance was associated with poorer outcome. Effect sizes varied from small to moderate (understanding intentions) to moderate (emotion recognition) to large (empathy). Conclusions: The associations were in line with models of social cognition and proposals that impairments in social cognition may underlie social behaviour difficulties and poor social outcome following TBI.","[{'authorId': '3748173', 'name': 'M.

The COVID-19 pandemic is a public emergency of international concern that affects several nations. The widespread outbreak of COVID-19 virus has brought not only the risk of death but also major psychological pressure. However, the psychological impact on university students has not been studied in Ethiopia. Objective To assess the psychological impacts of COVID-19 pandemic among university students in Bench-Sheko Zone, South-west, Ethiopia, 2020. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 15 to June 15/2020. A systematic sampling technique was employed to select the study participants. The data were entered into EpiData 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 24 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify candidates and independent factors respectively. Independent factors of depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed using AORs with 95% confidence level at P-value <0.05 cut point. Results Three hundred and twenty-two university students were included with a 97.5% response rate. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was 21.2%, 27.7%, and 32.5%, respectively. Being female, staying at home, history of medical illness, and poor and moderate social support increased the risk of depression. Not living with their parents, relatives got coronavirus and low family income were risk factors for anxiety. Moreover, substance use, depression, anxiety, and poor social support were increasing the risk of stress among university students. Conclusions and Recommendations This study revealed a higher prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among university students. Thus, governments and policy makers should develop health system strategies to provide crisis-oriented psychological services for university students to minimize the mental health impact of the outbreak.","[{'authorId': '1906034738', 'name': 'Nigusie Shifera Aylie'}, {'authorId': '1995336859', 'name': 'M.

To address this issue, we focused on one strategy, reappraisal, which involves cognitively reframing affective events in ways that modulate one's emotional response to them. With a commonly used reappraisal task, we assessed the behavioral correlates of four laboratory sessions of guided practice in down-regulating responses to aversive photos. Two groups received practice in one of two types of reappraisal tactics: psychological distancing and reinterpretation. A third no-regulation control group viewed images in each session without instructions to regulate. Three key findings were observed. First, both distancing and reinterpretation training resulted in reductions over time in self-reported negative affect. Second, distancing participants also showed a reduction over time in negative affect on baseline trials in which they responded naturally. Only distancing group participants showed such a reduction over and above the reduction observed in the no-regulation control group, indicating that it was not attributable to habituation. Third, only participants who distanced reported less perceived stress in their daily lives. The present results provide the first evidence for the longitudinal trainability of reappraisal in healthy adults using short courses of reappraisal practice, particularly using psychological distancing.","[{'authorId': '38516262', 'name': 'Bryan T.

Contrary to rule- or template-based domain-specific dialog systems, open-domain conversation usually requires data-driven approaches, which can be roughly divided into two categories: retrieval-based and generation-based systems. Retrieval systems search a user-issued utterance (called a query) in a large database, and return a reply that best matches the query. Generative approaches, typically based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), can synthesize new replies, but they suffer from the problem of generating short, meaningless utterances. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based dialog systems in the open domain. In our approach, the retrieved candidate, in addition to the original query, is fed to an RNN-based reply generator, so that the neural model is aware of more information. The generated reply is then fed back as a new candidate for post-reranking.

Previous investigations, however, have relied on paradigms in which participants are passive observers of other persons’ gazes and do not adjust their gaze behavior as is the case in real-life social encounters. We used an interactive eye-tracking paradigm that allows participants to interact with an anthropomorphic virtual character whose gaze behavior is responsive to where the participant looks on the stimulus screen in real time. The character’s gaze reactions were systematically varied along a continuum from a maximal probability of gaze aversion to a maximal probability of gaze-following during brief interactions, thereby varying contingency and congruency of the reactions. We investigated how these variations influenced whether participants believed that the character was controlled by another person (i.e., a confederate) or a computer program. In a series of experiments, the human confederate was either introduced as naïve to the task, cooperative, or competitive. Results demonstrate that the ascription of humanness increases with higher congruency of gaze reactions when participants are interacting with a naïve partner. In contrast, humanness ascription is driven by the degree of contingency irrespective of congruency when the confederate was introduced as cooperative. Conversely, during interaction with a competitive confederate, judgments were neither based on congruency nor on contingency. These results offer important insights into what renders the experience of an interaction truly social: Humans appear to have a default expectation of reciprocation that can be influenced drastically by the presumed disposition of the interactor to either cooperate or compete.","[{'authorId': '48230544', 'name': 'U.

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the Virtual Hope Box (VHB), a smartphone app to improve stress coping skills, suicidal ideation, and perceived reasons for living among patients at elevated risk of suicide and self-harm.


METHODS
The authors conducted a parallel-group randomized controlled trial with two groups of U.S. service veterans in active mental health treatment who had recently expressed suicidal ideation. Between March 2014 and April 2015, 118 patients were enrolled in the study. Participants were assigned to use the VHB (N=58) or to a control group that received printed materials about coping with suicidality (N=60) to supplement treatment as usual over a 12-week period. Three measures-the Coping Self-Efficacy Scale, Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, and Brief Reasons for Living Inventory-were collected at baseline (before randomization) and three, six, and 12 weeks. Secondary measures-the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale, and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale-were collected at baseline and 12 weeks.


RESULTS
VHB users reported significantly greater ability to cope with unpleasant emotions and thoughts (Coping Self-Efficacy Scale) at three (b=2.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]=.29-4.55) and 12 weeks (b=2.99, 95% CI=.08-5.90) compared with the control group. No significant advantage was found on other outcome measures for treatment augmented by the VHB.


CONCLUSIONS
The VHB is a demonstrably useful accessory to treatment-an easily accessible tool that can increase stress coping skills. Because the app is easily disseminated across a large population, it is likely to have broad, positive utility in behavioral health care.","[{'authorId': '40146228', 'name': 'N.

Although a considerable amount of research has been conducted investigating age-related differences in emotion recognition of human faces (e.g., Sullivan, & Ruffman, 2004), the effect of age on emotion identification of virtual agent facial expressions has been largely unexplored. Age-related differences in emotion recognition of facial expressions are an important factor to consider in the design of agents that may assist older adults in a recreational or healthcare setting. The purpose of the current research was to investigate whether age-related differences in facial emotion recognition can extend to emotion-expressive virtual agents. Younger and older adults performed a recognition task with a virtual agent expressing six basic emotions. Larger age-related differences were expected for virtual agents displaying negative emotions, such as anger, sadness, and fear. In fact, the results indicated that older adults showed a decrease in emotion recognition accuracy for a virtual agent's emotions of anger, fear, and happiness.","[{'authorId': '1809740', 'name': 'Jenay M.

Specifically, a crosswalk scenario was created in which a virtual crowd was scripted to cross the road once the traffic light turned green. Participants were also instructed to walk across the road to the opposite sidewalk. During that time, the assessment of participant movement behavior was captured by the use of objective measurements (time, speed, and deviation). Five density conditions (no density, low density, medium density, high density, and extreme density) were developed to investigate which had the greatest effect on the movement behavior of the participants. The results obtained indicated that the extreme density condition of the virtual crowd did indeed alter the movement behavior of participants to a significant degree. Given that density had the greatest effect on the movement behavior of participants, a follow-up study was also conducted that utilized the density findings and explored whether density can affect the speed and direction of participants. This was achieved through examining five speed conditions and six directional conditions. The follow-up study provided some evidence that during an extreme density condition the speed of the crowd also affects the movement behavior of participants. However, no alteration in human movement behavior was observed when examining the direction of the virtual crowd. Implications for future research are discussed.","[{'authorId': '1921798420', 'name': 'Michael G.

– The two aims of this paper are to explore the development of trust for relationships between staff and customers in the banking sector and to investigate possible links between financial performance of relationship manager and their levels of emotional intelligence (EI) and trust. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
– An internet survey was undertaken, where respondents were asked to complete an EI test and questions relating to trusting behaviour. These data were integrated with financial performance data supplied by the bank. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and correlation analysis was used to identify links. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
– Trust was found to be made up of three components: dependability; knowledge; and expectations. Further, there were significant correlations between both trust and EI, when compared to the financial performance of a relationship manager. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
– The methods used by the bank to collect performance data have limited the analysis that could be conducted. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
– Increased awareness by the relationship managers of their own emotions, and how they perceive and act upon the emotions of others, should favourably impact financial performance. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
– This paper is an important initial step in highlighting the significance of EI and trust in the relationship marketing/selling arena.","[{'authorId': '98330508', 'name': 'Troy Heffernan'}, {'authorId': '1401746063', 'name': ""G.

868a88d9140b55cc67d948b01b391b1a0c6d75b0,"Background: Exposure therapy involves exposure to feared stimuli and is considered to be the gold-standard treatment for anxiety disorders. While its application in Virtual Reality (VR) has been very successful for phobic disorders, the effects of exposure to virtual social stimuli in Social Anxiety Disorder are heterogeneous. This difference has been linked to demands on realism and presence, particularly social presence, as a pre-requisite in evoking emotional experiences in virtual social interactions. So far, however, the influence of social presence on emotional experience in social interactions with virtual agents remains unknown. Objective: We investigated the relationship between realism and social presence and the moderating effect of social presence on the relationship between agent behavior and experienced emotions in virtual social interaction. Methods: Healthy participants (N = 51) faced virtual agents showing supportive and dismissive behaviors in two virtual environments (short interactions and oral presentations). At first, participants performed five blocks of short one-on-one interactions with virtual agents (two male and two female agents per block). Secondly, participants gave five presentations in front of an audience of 16 agents. In each scenario, agent behavior was a within subjects factor, resulting in one block of neutral, two blocks of negative, and two blocks of positive agent behavior. Ratings of agent behavior (valence and realism), experience (valence and arousal), and presence (physical and social) were collected after every block. Moderator effects were investigated using mixed linear models with random intercepts. Correlations were analyzed via repeated measures correlations. Results: Ratings of valence of agent behaviors showed reliable relationships with experienced valence and less reliable relationships with experienced arousal. These relationships were moderated by social presence in the presentation scenario. Results for the interaction scenario were weaker but potentially promising for experimental studies. Variations in social presence and realism over time were correlated but social presence proved a more reliable moderator. Conclusion: Our findings emphasize the role of social presence for emotional experience in response to specific agent behaviors in virtual social interactions. While these findings should be replicated with experimental designs and in clinical samples, variability in social presence might account for heterogeneity in efficacy of virtual exposure to treat social anxiety disorder.","[{'authorId': '2053795228', 'name': 'Michael Pfaller'}, {'authorId': '30692915', 'name': 'Leon O.

Data arefrom questionnaire responses provided by subjects in a computerized experiment who offered different group-pay allocations. Perceived procedural justice, which is affected by the conflict between initial pay divisions, enhances positivefeelings about the negotiation and attenuates depression over outcomes. One's own final pay level influences positivelyfairness of the outcome to self and negativelyfairness to others. Fairness to self decreases negativefeelings aboutfinal pay and increases pay satisfaction, but also guilt. Fairness to others, in contrast, only negatively affects guilt. The discussion emphasizes the importance of differentiating types ofjustice and of emotions to understand reactions to negotiations. Within the distributive justice literature, Homans's (1974) argument about emotional responses to injustice has been the cornerstone for research on the topic. He argues simply that those treated fairly will experience positive emotions, whereas those underrewarded are likely to feel anger and those overrewarded are likely to feel guilty.

Our main contribution is to propose a perceptual evaluation of a simple virtual reality system. The goal is to assess whether real humans are also able to accurately estimate a virtual human motion before collision avoidance. Results show that, even through a simple system, users are able to correctly evaluate the situation of an interaction on the qualitative point of view. Especially, in comparison with real interactions, users accurately decide whether they should give way to the virtual human or not. However, on the quantitative point of view, it is not easy for users to determine whether they will collide with virtual humans or not. On one hand, deciding to give way or not is a two-choice problem. On the other hand, detecting future collision requires to determine whether some visual variables belong some interval or not.

Summary 
The therapeutic relationship, between client and therapist, is seen as a fundamental aspect in the outcome of therapy in the nonlearning disabled population. Literature suggests that the issues that are important in psychological therapy with the nonlearning disabled population should not lose significance with individuals with learning disabilities. Despite this, there exists a poor empirical and theoretical understanding of the complexities of the therapeutic relationship, when the individual has a learning disability. As a discipline, Counselling Psychology has a particular interest and skill base in understanding the therapeutic relationship and is therefore in a position to offer a valuable contribution to understanding the therapeutic relationship when an individual has a learning disability. Through eight semi-structured interviews, counselling psychologists currently working with individuals with learning disabilities were asked to share their experiences and understanding of the nature and role of the therapeutic relationship. A qualitative methodology guided by interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) enabled detailed exploration of the counselling psychologists' perspective. Themes emerged identifying the therapeutic relationship as fundamental yet difficult due to variables such as the client's experience in relationships, the need for multiple relationships, the experience of needing to facilitate reassurance and the necessary skills for therapeutic approaches. Themes also emerged relating to therapist's motivations, values and needs when working with this client group and tensions concerning individualisation and the setting culture. The themes are discussed in relation to the existing literature and implications for theory and practice are explored.","[{'authorId': '2109213497', 'name': 'Rachel Jones'}]",21.0,,15.0,Therapeutic relationships with individuals with learning disabilities: a qualitative study of the counselling psychologists' experience,2014.0

In the first experiment, emotional contagion occurred among ""receivers"" who ""caught"" a happy emotion from ""senders"" whom the receivers liked. The relationship between the emotion experienced by senders and receivers was found to be mediated by receivers mimicking smiling on the part of senders. Exposing receivers to happy senders they liked also resulted in receivers having a positive attitudinal bias toward a product. The happiness experienced by receivers via contagion was found to mediate the effects of sender emotion and receiver liking of the sender on receiver product attitudes. The second experiment replicated the first while demonstrating that observation of the facial expressions of senders by receivers, thus allowing mimicking of smiling, was a necessary condition for emotional contagion to occur. The relevance of emotional contagion for understanding consumer behavior across various substantive domains is discussed.

Naturalistic observations were conducted on humans interacting in groups that differed in terms of age composition (and presumably social status). Three affiliative behaviours were recorded by focal sampling: spontaneous smiles, deliberate smiles and laughter. Interestingly, young men showed significantly higher proportions of deliberate smiles in comparison to laughter when interacting with people of a different age class than when interacting in same-age groups. The pattern of affiliative behaviours in women remained unaffected by the age composition of groups. This partly supports the power asymmetry hypothesis and suggests that in men, deliberate smiles could play a role in the regulation of hierarchical relationships.","[{'authorId': '48898927', 'name': 'M.

Use of virtual reality could facilitate new learning. Aims To test the hypothesis that enabling patients to test the threat predictions of persecutory delusions in virtual reality social environments with the dropping of safety-seeking behaviours (virtual reality cognitive therapy) would lead to greater delusion reduction than exposure alone (virtual reality exposure). Method Conviction in delusions and distress in a real-world situation were assessed in 30 patients with persecutory delusions. Patients were then randomised to virtual reality cognitive therapy or virtual reality exposure, both with 30 min in graded virtual reality social environments. Delusion conviction and real-world distress were then reassessed. Results In comparison with exposure, virtual reality cognitive therapy led to large reductions in delusional conviction (reduction 22.0%, P = 0.024, Cohen's d = 1.3) and real-world distress (reduction 19.6%, P = 0.020, Cohen's d = 0.8).

The chapter begins with a historical summary of theoretical movements and research trends that have led to today’s inclusion of SEL as part of many schools’ curricula, policies, and practices. Contemporary approaches that represent current policy and societal concerns are discussed in comparative terms. Based on the converging research evidence, this chapter identifies design elements and implementation quality characteristics of effective approaches to SEL.

The new Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (P&A) is presented in this paper. It was developed to assess the degree of severity of these disorders after a diagnosis has been made according to the criteria of the DSM-III-R/IV or the ICD-10. The P&A was specially developed for use in clinical drug trials. Factors which impair the quality of life, in panic disorder and agoraphobia patients (panic attacks, phobic avoidance, anticipatory anxiety, impairment in social relationships and work, assumption of somatic disease) were considered in the development of this scale so that the efficacy of a certain drug therapy on each of these factors can be assessed separately. Both an observer rating and a self-rating with matching items are available. The observer rating only takes about 10 minutes to complete. Translation into many European languages is planned so that it can be used in multicentre trials. Satisfactory results of item analysis., inter-rater reliability, objectivity, external validity and factor structure are presented.

Their perceptual judgments are based on simple movement features, such as overall speed, but also on more intricate posture and dynamic cues. The systematic analysis of such features is complicated due to the difficulty of considering the large number of potentially relevant kinematic and dynamic parameters. To identify emotion-specific features we motion-captured the neutral and emotionally expressive (anger, happiness, sadness, fear) gaits of 25 individuals. Body posture was characterized by average flexion angles, and a low-dimensional parameterization of the spatio-temporal structure of joint trajectories was obtained by approximation with a nonlinear mixture model. Applying sparse regression, we extracted critical emotion-specific posture and movement features, which typically depended only on a small number of joints. The features we extracted from the motor behavior closely resembled features that were critical for the perception of emotion from gait, determined by a statistical analysis of classification and rating judgments of 21 observers presented with avatars animated with the recorded movements. The perceptual relevance of these features was further supported by another experiment showing that artificial walkers containing only the critical features induced high-level after-effects matching those induced by adaptation with natural emotional walkers.","[{'authorId': '5273793', 'name': 'Claire L.

Over time, the landscape of these worlds evolves and changes as players create and personalise their own virtual property. In contrast, many non-player characters that populate virtual game worlds possess a fixed set of pre-programmed behaviours and lack the ability to adapt and evolve in time with their surroundings. This paper presents motivated reinforcement learning agents as a means of creating non-player characters that can both evolve and adapt. Motivated reinforcement learning agents explore their environment and learn new behaviours in response to interesting experiences, allowing them to display progressively evolving behavioural patterns. In dynamic worlds, environmental changes provide an additional source of interesting experiences triggering further learning and allowing the agents to adapt their existing behavioural patterns in time with their surroundings.","[{'authorId': '1758755', 'name': 'K.

89e6a25fcd35844cf5dd74206112c4b8b211c967,"Numerous studies use arm movements (arm flexion and extension) to investigate the interaction between emotional stimuli and approach/avoidance behaviour. In many experiments, however, these arm movements are ambiguous. Arm flexion can be interpreted either as pulling (approach) or as withdrawing (avoidance). On the contrary, arm extension can be interpreted as reaching (approach) or as pushing (avoidance). This ambiguity can be resolved by regarding approach and avoidance as flexible action plans that are represented in terms of their effects. Approach actions reduce the distance between a stimulus and the self, whereas avoidance actions increase that distance. In this view, action effects are an integral part of the representation of an action. As a result, a neutral action can become an approach or avoidance reaction if it repeatedly results in decreasing or increasing the distance to a valenced stimulus. This hypothesis was tested in the current study. Participants responded to positive and negative words using key-presses. These “neutral” responses (not involving arm flexion or extension) were consistently followed by a stimulus movement toward or away from the participant. Responses to emotional words were faster when the response's effect was congruent with stimulus valence, suggesting that approach/avoidance actions are indeed defined in terms of their outcomes.","[{'authorId': '117291811', 'name': 'Saskia van Dantzig'}, {'authorId': '2842071', 'name': 'D.

It remains unresolved how much recognition and discrimination of expressions rely on the perception of morphological patterns or the processing of affective content. This review of research on the role of visual and emotional factors in expression recognition reached three major conclusions. First, behavioral, neurophysiological, and computational measures indicate that basic expressions are reliably recognized and discriminated from one another, albeit the effect may be inflated by the use of prototypical expression stimuli and forced-choice responses. Second, affective content along the dimensions of valence and arousal is extracted early from facial expressions, although this coarse affective representation contributes minimally to categorical recognition of specific expressions. Third, the physical configuration and visual saliency of facial features contribute significantly to expression recognition, with “emotionless” computational models being able to reproduce some of the basic phenomena demonstrated in human observers. We conclude that facial expression recognition, as it has been investigated in conventional laboratory tasks, depends to a greater extent on perceptual than affective information and mechanisms.","[{'authorId': '144866673', 'name': 'M.

However, a growing number of researchers support the idea that nonconscious processes may hold the keys to higher forms of intelligence. Subliminal messages expose individuals to visual or/and auditory stimuli below the threshold of perception. The current review aims to explore the effectiveness of subliminal cues on fundamental aspects of metacognition such as higher cognitive and emotional meta-abilities, affective and behavioral regulation, and academic achievement. In this context, we search for and classify the existing subliminal training techniques, while evaluating the usability of ICTs such as virtual reality, mobile apps, intelligent tutoring systems, and software in subliminal learning and training. The results of this review revealed that subliminal techniques improve all those aspects that assure metacognitive improvements in terms of self- & emotional regulation, higher mental abilities, and behavioral modification. Subliminal cues lower people's shields and update filtering mechanisms enabling people to focus on positive rather than negative interpretations. Subliminal techniques are under the umbrella of metacognitive strategies, since they can used consciously to increase self-regulation capacity as wells as expand the horizons of consciousness. Subliminal teaching techniques can be used by teachers and parents in general and special education to instill higher-level needs & motives, accelerate students’ performance and unfold students’ existing but underdeveloped abilities. Therapists can also utilize these methods to help patients with phobia, anxiety and depression to overcome fear.

In general, VC facial expressions elicited congruent facial muscle activity. However, both frontal EEG asymmetry and facial EMG activity elicited by an angry VC facial expression varied as a function of preceding interactional events (human collaboration/defection). Pre-decision inner emotional-motivational processes and emotional facial expressions were dissociated, suggesting that human goals influence pre-decision frontal asymmetry, whereas display rules may affect (pre-decision) emotional expressions in human-VC interaction. An angry VC facial expression, high pre-decision corrugator EMG activity, and relatively greater left frontal activation predicted the participant's decision to defect. Both post-decision frontal asymmetry and facial EMG activity were related to reciprocal cooperation. The results suggest that the justifiability of VC emotional expressions and the perceived fairness of VC actions influence human emotional responses.","[{'authorId': '1751008', 'name': 'N.

Emphasis in this pursuit has varied, of course: empiricists have concentrated on the mind's interplay with an external world of nature, hoping to find the key in the association of sensations and ideas, while rationalists have looked inward to the powers of mind itself for the principles of right reason. The objective, in either case, has been to discover how we achieve ""reality,"" that is to say, how we get a reliable fix on the world, a world that is, as it were, assumed to be immutable and, as it were, ""there to be observed."" This quest has, of course, had a profound effect on the development of psychology, and the empiricist and rationalist traditions have dominated our conceptions of how the mind grows and how it gets its grasp on the ""real world."" Indeed, at midcentury Gestalt theory represented the rationalist wing of this enterprise and American learning theory the empiricist. Both gave accounts of mental development as proceeding in some more or less linear and uniform fashion from an initial incompetence in grasping reality to a final competence, in one case attributing it to the working out of internal processes or mental organization, and in the other to some unspecified principle of reflection by which—whether through reinforcement, association, or conditioning—we came to respond to the world ""as it is.""

8b0598b6cf3c1eb36291d4ca981e4985da971cfd,"Background Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is widely used to treat depression. However, CBT is not always available to patients because of a shortage of therapists and long waiting times. Computerized CBT (CCBT) is one of several alternatives currently available to treat patients with depression. Evidence of its clinical effectiveness has led to programs being used increasingly within the UK and elsewhere. However, little information is available regarding the acceptability of CCBT to patients. Method A systematic review of sources of information on acceptability to patients of CCBT for depression. Results Sources of information on acceptability included: recruitment rates, patient drop-outs and patient-completed questionnaires. We identified 16 studies of CCBT for the treatment of depression that provided at least some information on these sources. Limited information was provided on patient take-up rates and recruitment methods. Drop-out rates were comparable to other forms of treatment. Take-up rates, when reported, were much lower. Six of the 16 studies included specific questions on patient acceptability or satisfaction although information was only provided for those who had completed treatment. Several studies have reported positive expectancies and high satisfaction in routine care CCBT services for those completing treatment. Conclusions Trials of CCBT should include more detailed information on patient recruitment methods, drop-out rates and reasons for dropping out. It is important that well-designed surveys and qualitative studies are included alongside trials to determine levels and determinants of patient acceptability.","[{'authorId': '2538877', 'name': 'E.

While there is a large variety of research examining how to design the physical appearance of the character or the teaching strategies it should embody, there is comparatively little work around the design of the narrative the virtual human uses to communicate with the learner. In this study, we examine the use of four different types of text structures to structure the character’s narrative in an instructional video: expository, refutation text, deep reasoning questions, and refutation text and deep reasoning questions; and their effects on learning, perceptions, attitudes, and emotions about genetically modified foods. Our results largely indicated no significant differences between the different communication strategies.

This research is contextualised within the growing field of short‐term therapy as it intersects the growing demand to therapeutically address clients on the autism spectrum. The treatment intervention is delineated through five sequential phases within the walk‐in clinic setting for the practitioner clinician. A rationale, overview, and instruction for the practitioner clinician utilising this novel model is provided through a case study format. By using a more structured and integrated approach to treatment, organised through an externalised metaphor, it is suggested that the current model will be more effective for this specific clinical population. Additionally, a case illustration is provided that scaffolds the treatment model, which includes table formats and pictures. The case study illustrates the self‐regulation map metaphor visually and interactively linking client challenges, strategies, and motivations simultaneously on multiple electronic devices in session. Relevant works were selected to explore the effectiveness of single‐session consultation models for those presenting on the autism spectrum.

The emotion process helps to determine how humans perceive their internal status and needs in order to form consciousness of an individual. Emotions have been studied from multidisciplinary perspectives and covered a wide range of empirical and psychological topics, such as understanding the emotional processes, creating cognitive and computational models of emotions, and applications in computational intelligence. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of cognitive and computational models of emotions resulted from multidisciplinary studies. We concentrate on exploring how cognitive models have served as the theoretical basis of the computational models of emotions.

At each iteration of the experiment, four conditions (Self-Avatar LookAt, No Self-Avatar LookAt, Self-Avatar No LookAt, and No Self-Avatar No LookAt) were applied to examine users' movement behavior based on kinematic measures. During the experiment, 52 participants were asked to walk from a starting position to a target position. A virtual character was placed at the midpoint. Participants were asked to wear a head-mounted display throughout the task, and their locomotion was captured using a motion capture suit. We analyzed the captured trajectories of the participants' routes on four kinematic measures to explore whether the four experimental conditions influenced the paths they took. The results indicated that the Self-Avatar LookAt condition affected the path the participants chose more significantly than the other three conditions in terms of length, duration, and deviation, but not in terms of speed. Overall, the length and duration of the task, as well as the deviation of the trajectory from the straight line, were greater when a self-avatar represented participants. An additional effect on kinematic measures was found in the LookAt (Gaze) conditions.

Many efforts have been done to alleviate learner’s math anxiety with respect to curriculum design, math assessment, classroom culture, and teacher attitudes. In this study, math anxiety from the GED (General Educational Development) population is addressed through emotional and motivational support provided by pedagogical agents. There are two reasons to this approach. One major reason is the inherent social nature of learning and research on learners’ emotion and motivation are gaining more and more interest. The other major reason is that the embodiment nature of pedagogical agents have been recognized by researchers and the pedagogical agents become one of the ideal candidates to improve learning and influence learners’ emotion and motivation in a computer-based learning environment. 
In this study, emotional support and cognitive motivational messages were embedded in pedagogical agents to promote learning, alleviate math anxiety, and improve leaner motivation. 109 GED students affiliated with local community college participated in this study. This study used a 2 x 2 factorial design. The two independent variables were emotional support and cognitive motivational messages and each dependent variable contained two levels: presence versus absence. The dependent measure of study includes learning, math anxiety, and leaner motivation. 
MANOVA analysis revealed a main effect of emotional support. Further univariate analysis showed that students who worked with emotional support agents performed better in learning and had less math anxiety than those students who worked with none-emotional support agents. No significant results were found on the main effect of cognitive motivational messages. This study shows quantitative evidence of the effectiveness of pedagogical agents as a means to deliver emotional support in a computer based learning environment. 
Further research is suggested to examine the adaptive nature of emotional support and cognitive motivational messages.

Two of the technologies that are more consolidated in this field are virtual reality (VR) and telepsychology. There are other technological innovations that are beginning to be used in clinical and health psychology such as ambient intelligence, ubiquitous computing or persuasive computing. In the last fifteen years there has been a proliferation of studies testing the efficacy of immersive virtual reality in the delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for several mental disorders and health conditions. The essence of VR is that it can simulate reality and add a new possibility: the user has the illusion of “being” in the computer-generated environment while interacting with the VR objects. This unique feature of VR is very relevant for its use in Clinical Psychology. At the same time, it can raise several ethical issues. It is important to investigate the possible effects of blurring the distinction between real and virtual worlds in vulnerable populations. Some other concerns regarding the use of VR in therapy have already been investigated, such as cybersickness. After ten years of experience treating patients with VR, this has not been a problem in the published efficacy studies. Telepsychology has also been used to improve the delivery of CBT. A number of Internetdelivered programs have already become important tools in the health system. The main advantage is that online therapy can reach people who might not otherwise seek therapy, such as disabled people or those who live in remote areas. However, several concerns have been raised about self-help procedures, like the issue of self-diagnosis. and the fact that patients usually have all of the necessary self-help information at their disposal. It is important to establish criteria to protect people from the possible negative effects of this. Other innovations such as ambient intelligence and pervasive computing bring up other ethical issues. For example, is privacy being compromised too much when people are located using GPS or physiologically monitored 24 hours a day? Criteria for considering these issues must be established. Our research group has been working with new technologies and therapies for the last fifteen years.

For a long time, it has represented a sort of “oral encyclopedia” which, through narrative, has passed down from generation to generation traditions, customs and knowledge (Halverson, 1992). The role that storytelling played, even before the discovery of writing, in the diffusion of knowledge, in the construction of interpersonal relationships and in the birth of new societies, is well known. Without doubt writing is the earliest “technology” invented by man, through which culture and knowledge have been passed down over time, after having been transmitted orally for a long time. According to Barthes and Duisit (1975), in fact, storytelling begins with the same story of the human race, almost as if to represent an ontogenetically distinctive trait of the species, which unites homo sapiens with the homo digitalis of today’s society (Montag & Diefenbach, 2018). Other authors (Kenyon et al., 1996) argue that men and women not only have stories to tell, but that they are the stories they tell.

Objective The objective of this study was to compare two different delivery modalities of the same diagnostic assessment for individuals with non-affective psychosis—a native smartphone application employing a graphical, touch user interface against an SMS text-only implementation. The overall hypothesis of the study was that patient participants with sewrious mental illness would find both delivery modalities feasible and acceptable to use, measured by the quantitative post-assessment feedback questionnaire scores, the number of data points completed, and the time taken to complete the assessment. It was also predicted that a native smartphone application would (1) yield a greater number of data points, (2) take less time, and (3) be more positively appraised by patient participant users than the text-based system. Methods A randomized repeated measures crossover design was employed. Participants with currently treated Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (Fourth Edition) schizophrenia or related disorders (n=24) were randomly allocated to completing 6 days of assessment (four sets of questions per day) with a native smartphone application or the SMS text-only implementation. There was then a 1-week break before completing a further 6 days with the alternative delivery modality. Quantitative feedback questionnaires were administered at the end of each period of sampling. Results A greater proportion of data points were completed with the native smartphone application in comparison to the SMS text-only implementation (β = -.25, SE=.11, P=.02), which also took significantly less time to complete (β =.78, SE= .09, P<.001). Although there were no significant differences in participants’ quantitative feedback for the two delivery modalities, most participants reported preferring the native smartphone application (67%; n=16) and found it easier to use (71%; n=16). 33% of participants reported that they would be willing to complete mobile phone assessment for 5 weeks or longer. Conclusions Native smartphone applications and SMS text are both valuable methods of delivering real-time assessment in individuals with schizophrenia. However, a more streamlined graphical user interface may lead to better compliance and shorter entry times. Further research is needed to test the efficacy of this technology within clinical services, to assess validity over longer periods of time and when delivered on patients’ own phones.","[{'authorId': '145138477', 'name': 'J.

The purpose of this paper is to critically examine the current knowledge in developmental and affective neuroscience with an emphasis on the perception of pain in others. It will be argued that human empathy involves several components: affective arousal, emotion understanding and emotion regulation, each with different developmental trajectories. These components are implemented by a complex network of distributed, often recursively connected, interacting neural regions including the superior temporal sulcus, insula, medial and orbitofrontal cortices, amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex, as well as autonomic and neuroendocrine processes implicated in social behaviors and emotional states. Decomposing the construct of empathy into subcomponents that operate in conjunction in the healthy brain and examining their developmental trajectory provides added value to our current approaches to understanding human development. It can also benefit our understanding of both typical and atypical development.","[{'authorId': '3235030', 'name': 'J. Decety'}]",501.0,,64.0,The Neurodevelopment of Empathy in Humans,2010.0

Instead, individuals often turn to others for help in shaping their affective lives. How and under what circumstances does such interpersonal regulation modulate emotional experience? Although scientists have examined allied phenomena such as social sharing, empathy, social support, and prosocial behavior for decades, there have been surprisingly few attempts to integrate these data into a single conceptual framework of interpersonal regulation. Here we propose such a framework. We first map a ""space"" differentiating classes of interpersonal regulation according to whether an individual uses an interpersonal regulatory episode to alter their own or another person's emotion. We then identify 2 types of processes--response-dependent and response-independent--that could support interpersonal regulation. This framework classifies an array of processes through which interpersonal contact fulfills regulatory goals. More broadly, it organizes diffuse, heretofore independent data on ""pieces"" of interpersonal regulation, and identifies growth points for this young and exciting research domain.","[{'authorId': '2268731', 'name': 'Jamil Zaki'}, {'authorId': '2055993791', 'name': 'W.

In terms of symbolic forms, of course, the spontaneous and unwitting gestures we make while talking differ sharply from spoken language itself. Whereas spoken language is linear, segmented, standardized, and arbitrary, gestures are global, synthetic, idiosyncratic, and imagistic. In Hand and Mind, David McNeill presents a bold theory of the essential unity of speech and the gestures that accompany it. This long-awaited, provocative study argues that the unity of gestures and language far exceeds the surface level of speech noted by previous researchers and in fact also includes the semantic and pragmatic levels of language. In effect, the whole concept of language must be altered to take into account the nonsegmented, instantaneous, and holistic images conveyed by gestures. McNeill and his colleagues carefully devised a standard methodology for examining the speech and gesture behavior of individuals engaged in narrative discourse. A research subject is shown a cartoon like the 1950 Canary Row--a classic Sylvester and Tweedy Bird caper that features Sylvester climbing up a downspout, swallowing a bowling ball and slamming into a brick wall. After watching the cartoon, the subject is videotaped recounting the story from memory to a listener who has not seen the cartoon. Painstaking analysis of the videotapes revealed that although the research subjects--children as well as adults, some neurologically impaired--represented a wide variety of linguistic groupings, the gestures of people speaking English and a half dozen other languages manifest the same principles. Relying on data from more than ten years of research, McNeill shows thatgestures do not simply form a part of what is said and meant but have an impact on thought itself. He persuasively argues that because gestures directly transfer mental images to visible forms, conveying ideas that language cannot always express, we must examine language and gesture","[{'authorId': '145493778', 'name': 'D.

This article explores a novel, single-session treatment intervention for anxiety and depression through an externalizing process, transforming of metaphoric imagery, and shifting of underlying maladaptive emotional schemas within the Walk-in counseling setting.


PURPOSE
The purpose of this paper is to present a novel, single-session treatment protocol that is delineated through a six-stage process (or mediators of change) for the clinical population of youth presenting with anxiety and/or depression, mild-to-moderate severity. These are two of the most common presenting concerns for this population and the proposed treatment intervention is from a very brief format. A case study is used to illustrate the treatment protocol which is presented in table format and within-session description.


SOURCES USED
A composite literature review was conducted with relevant works specific to single-session consultation including Walk-in clinic models to mental health treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
The interconnected theoretical constructs both map and manualize its key clinical processes, which reflects the mechanism of change in this brief model. This proposed line of clinical research may introduce a paradigm shift towards specific treatments for specific presenting concerns in the Walk-in counseling modality for youth.","[{'authorId': '77582161', 'name': 'Jazlyn McGuinty'}, {'authorId': '31454550', 'name': 'A.

We tested spatial perception in the workspace using a combination of haptic matching and line drawing tasks. There were 132 participants with varying degrees of visual ability ranging from congenitally blind to normally sighted. Each participant was blindfolded and asked to match a haptic target position felt under a table with their nondominant hand using a pen in their dominant hand. Once the pen was in position on the tabletop, they had to draw a line of equal length to a previously felt reference object by moving the pen laterally. We used targets at three different locations to evaluate whether different starting positions relative to the body give rise to different matching errors, drawn line lengths, or drawn line angles. We found no influence of visual ability on matching error, drawn line length, or line angle, but we found that early-blind participants are slightly less consistent in their matching errors across space. We conclude that the elementary haptic abilities tested in these tasks do not depend on visual experience.","[{'authorId': '153162789', 'name': 'J. Nelson'}, {'authorId': '2505550', 'name': 'I. A.

We argue that emotional signals are intrinsically meaningful within a social relationship, which is crucial for understanding the functionality and boundary conditions of emotional mimicry. On the basis of a review of the literature on facial mimicry of emotion displays, we conclude that the classic matched motor hypothesis does not hold for emotional mimicry. We alternatively propose a contextual view of emotional mimicry, which states that emotional mimicry depends on the social context: we only mimic emotional signals that are interpreted to promote affiliation goals and not necessarily what we see. As a further consequence, we are less likely to mimic strangers and we do not mimic people we do not like nor emotions that signal antagonism.","[{'authorId': '3067657', 'name': 'U.

In Internet-based eHealth interventions, ECAs may be used for the delivery of automated human support factors. Objective We aim to provide an overview of the technological and clinical possibilities, as well as the evidence base for ECA applications in clinical psychology, to inform health professionals about the activity in this field of research. Methods Given the large variety of applied methodologies, types of applications, and scientific disciplines involved in ECA research, we conducted a systematic scoping review. Scoping reviews aim to map key concepts and types of evidence underlying an area of research, and answer less-specific questions than traditional systematic reviews. Systematic searches for ECA applications in the treatment of mood, anxiety, psychotic, autism spectrum, and substance use disorders were conducted in databases in the fields of psychology and computer science, as well as in interdisciplinary databases. Studies were included if they conveyed primary research findings on an ECA application that targeted one of the disorders. We mapped each study’s background information, how the different disorders were addressed, how ECAs and users could interact with one another, methodological aspects, and the study’s aims and outcomes. Results This study included N=54 publications (N=49 studies). More than half of the studies (n=26) focused on autism treatment, and ECAs were used most often for social skills training (n=23). Applications ranged from simple reinforcement of social behaviors through emotional expressions to sophisticated multimodal conversational systems. Most applications (n=43) were still in the development and piloting phase, that is, not yet ready for routine practice evaluation or application. Few studies conducted controlled research into clinical effects of ECAs, such as a reduction in symptom severity. Conclusions ECAs for mental disorders are emerging. State-of-the-art techniques, involving, for example, communication through natural language or nonverbal behavior, are increasingly being considered and adopted for psychotherapeutic interventions in ECA research with promising results. However, evidence on their clinical application remains scarce. At present, their value to clinical practice lies mostly in the experimental determination of critical human support factors. In the context of using ECAs as an adjunct to existing interventions with the aim of supporting users, important questions remain with regard to the personalization of ECAs’ interaction with users, and the optimal timing and manner of providing support. To increase the evidence base with regard to Internet interventions, we propose an additional focus on low-tech ECA solutions that can be rapidly developed, tested, and applied in routine practice.","[{'authorId': '39888309', 'name': 'Simon Provoost'}, {'authorId': '4940640', 'name': 'Ho Ming Lau'}, {'authorId': '3003041', 'name': 'Jeroen Ruwaard'}, {'authorId': '3850886', 'name': 'H.

Many of these hypotheses present computational challenges to scientific research, in that they require the analysis of numerous mental and bodily changes simultaneously over time. In this thesis, I applied statistical models of machine learning to address these challenges, and to investigate hypotheses concerning interaction effects, curvilinear associations, feedback among emotion components, synchronization of components, and the felt experience of synchronized changes (e.g., feeling angry). Results of the four studies generally supported the algorithmic complexity that underlies emotion unfolding, and that modelling these complexities is necessary to differentiate patterns of emotional responding quantitatively and qualitatively. Using a novel measure for emotional synchronization, I showed experimentally that changes in motivation, physiology, and expression responses synchronized following a manipulation of the appraised importance of a situation.","[{'authorId': '2727427', 'name': 'B.

905869f422731b1238f2872ecc6569a9d8248d25,"We have previously reported that a patient (DF) with visual form agnosia shows accurate guidance of hand and finger movements with respect to the size, orientation, and shape of the objects to which her movements are directed. Despite this, she is unable to indicate any knowledge about these object properties. In the present study, we investigated the extent to which DF is able to use visual shape or pattern to guide her hand movements. In the first experiment, we found that when presented with a stimulus aperture cut in the shape of the letter T, DF was able to guide a T-shaped form into it on about half of the trials, across a range of different stimulus orientations. On the remaining trials, her responses were almost always perpendicular to the correct Orientation. Thus, the visual information guiding the rotation of DF's hand appears to be limited to a single orientation. In other words, the visuomotor transformations mediating her hand rotation appear to be unable to combine the orientations of the stem and the top of the T, although they are sensitive to the orientation of the element(s) that comprise the T. In a second experiment, we examined her ability to use different sources of visual information to guide her hand rotation. In this experiment, DF was required to guide the leading edge of a hand-held card onto a rectangular target positioned at dHerent orientations on a flat surface. Here the orientation of her hand was determined primarily by the predominant orientation of the luminance edge elements present in the stimulus, rather than by information about orientation that was conveyed by nonluminance boundaries. Little evidence was found for an ability to use contour boundaries defined by Gestalt principles of grouping (good continuation or similarity) or nonaccidental image properties (colinearity) to guide her movements. We have argued elsewhere that the dorsal visual pathway from occipital to parietal cortex may underlie these preserved visuomotor skills in DF. If so, the limitations in her ability to use different kinds of pattern information to guide her hand rotation suggest that such information may need to be transmitted from the ventral visual stream to these parietal areas to enable the full range of prehensive acts in the intact individual.","[{'authorId': '145989594', 'name': 'M.

However, some patients are resistant to self-compassion. Aims To investigate whether the effects of self-identification with virtual bodies within immersive virtual reality could be exploited to increase self-compassion in patients with depression. Method We developed an 8-minute scenario in which 15 patients practised delivering compassion in one virtual body and then experienced receiving it from themselves in another virtual body. Results In an open trial, three repetitions of this scenario led to significant reductions in depression severity and self-criticism, as well as to a significant increase in self-compassion, from baseline to 4-week follow-up. Four patients showed clinically significant improvement. Conclusions The results indicate that interventions using immersive virtual reality may have considerable clinical potential and that further development of these methods preparatory to a controlled trial is now warranted.

We focus on the daily situation of walking together. We propose two experiments. In a first experiment, we measure the effect of emotions on the kinematics and metrics of interactions between two walkers. Then, in a second experiment, we reproduce a similar situation of interaction between a real subject and a virtual walker expressing emotions. We perform comparisons between real-real interactions and real-virtual ones. We show promising results: similar effects are observed on the kinematics of interactions in both experiments. We implicitly demonstrate the ability of real subjects to perceive emotions expressed by a virtual character through whole body motion. We show that real subjects' reaction to the behavior of an expressive virtual character complies with their reaction to the behavior of an expressive real human walker. This result is one step toward the use of such virtual reality platform to study social interactions through fully controlled experiments.","[{'authorId': '3328278', 'name': 'Jonathan Perrinet'}, {'authorId': '1851306', 'name': 'A.

9263e2f0419aab0b6c5a376d0d576fd98f3415da,"Psychiatric comorbidity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a subject of critical scientific importance, affecting the quality of life, prognosis, and functional outcomes. The prevalence of psychiatric disorders vary considerably according to variables such as index subject characteristics, study setting, sampling frame, diagnostic methods used, as well as country of geographic origin. To date, most studies comprise clinical or treatment referral samples in tertiary care or subjects enrolled in clinical trials and genetic cohort collections. Such samples carry the potential for overestimation of both the frequency and severity of psychiatric comorbidity. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed and Web of Science databases restricted to population-based study publications in the English between May 1, 2015, and May 31, 2020. A comprehensive keyword list was generated to investigate co-occurrence of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents with ASD. A wide range of DSM-5 based disorders such as anxiety, mood, ADHD, intellectual disability/intellectual developmental disorder, eating/feeding, gender dysphoria and sleep-wake disorders were assessed. Initial search revealed a total of 1674 articles after removal of duplicates. Two independent researchers conducted a parallel-blinded screening process to identify the eligible studies based on titles and abstracts; 39 studies were analyzed in the current review. The main findings show prevalence estimates of 22.9% (95% CI: 17.7- 29.2) for intellectual disability; 26.2% (22-31) for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; 11.1% (8.6-14.1) for anxiety disorders; 19.7% (11.9-30.7) for sleep disorders; 7% (5.2- 9.3) for disruptive disorders; 2% (1.3- 3.1) for bipolar disorders; 2.7% (1.8- 4.2) for depression; 1.8% (0.4–8.7) for obsessive-compulsive disorder; and 0.6% (0.3–1.1) for psychosis. Psychiatric comorbidity in population-based studies is lower than in clinical and referred samples. However, our results also indicate that the frequency of psychiatric comorbidity in children and adolescents with ASD in the population context is considerable, without the influence of referral bias implicit in clinical and treatment samples. There is a need for better targeted diagnostic tools to detect psychiatric comorbidity in children and youth in future population-based studies, as an essential component in providing care as well as new insights into the nature and mechanisms of its underlying associations.

Thus the lip image synthesis plays an important role to realize a natural human-like face of computer agents. Moreover the synthesized lip movement images can compensate lack of auditory information for hearing impaired people. We propose a novel lip movement synthesis method based on mapping from input speech based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM). This paper compares the HMM-based method and a conventional method using vector quantization (VQ). In the experiment, error and time differential error between synthesized lip movement images and original ones are used for evaluation. The result shows that the error of the HMM based method is 8.7% smaller than that of the VQ-based method. Moreover, the HMM-based method reduces time differential error by 32% than the VQ's. The result also shows that the errors are mostly caused by phoneme /h/ and /Q/. Since lip shapes of those phonemes are strongly dependent on succeeding phoneme, the context dependent synthesis on the HMM-based method is applied to reduce the error. The improved HMM-based method realizes reduction of the error (differential error) by 10.5% (11%) compared with the original HMM-based method.","[{'authorId': '2290237', 'name': 'E.

Work-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an important condition encountered by many occupational health practitioners.


AIMS
To carry out an in-depth review of the research on occupational groups that are at particular risk of developing work-related PTSD.


METHODS
A literature search was conducted in the databases OVID MEDLINE, OVID Embase, Ovid PsycINFO, ISI Web of Science and CSA Health and Safety Science Abstracts.


RESULTS
Professionals such as police officers, firefighters and ambulance personnel often experience incidents that satisfy the stressor criterion for the PTSD diagnosis. Other professional groups such as health care professionals, train drivers, divers, journalists, sailors and employees in bank, post offices or in stores may also be subjected to work-related traumatic events. Work-related PTSD usually diminishes with time.


CONCLUSIONS
Mental health problems prior to the traumatic event and weak social support increase the risk of PTSD. Prevention of work-related PTSD includes a sound organizational and psychosocial work environment, systematic training of employees, social support from colleagues and managers and a proper follow-up of employees after a critical event.","[{'authorId': '4942091', 'name': 'M.

In an Italian undergraduate sample (N = 416), the two-scale ERQ structure was confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis, and each of the two scales (Reappraisal and Suppression) showed good internal consistency. The Italian ERQ also showed the predicted associations with measures of coping, affect, personality, and social functioning. Specifically, Reappraisal was positively correlated with positive reinterpretation, positive affect, and extraversion, and negatively correlated with negative affect and neuroticism. Suppression, by contrast, was negatively correlated with the venting of emotions, positive affect, extraversion, social support and social diversion. Taken together, these findings suggest that the Italian ERQ is a reliable and valid measure that inherits the nomological network of associations from the original version of the ERQ.","[{'authorId': '2217183', 'name': 'S.

These parameters, however, are specific to the crowd models and may be difficult for an animator or naive user to use. We propose mapping these parameters to personality traits. In this paper, we extend the HiDAC (High-Density Autonomous Crowds) system by providing each agent with a personality model in order to examine how the emergent behavior of the crowd is affected. We use the OCEAN personality model as a basis for agent psychology. To each personality trait we associate nominal behaviors; thus, specifying personality for an agent leads to an automation of the low-level parameter tuning process. We describe a plausible mapping from personality traits to existing behavior types and analyze the overall emergent crowd behaviors.","[{'authorId': '2643744', 'name': 'Funda Durupinar'}, {'authorId': '1855748', 'name': 'J.

To do so, a computational model is proposed that embraces explicit intentions in the agents that are aimed at increasing the other's relations towards them. The model is inspired in the notion of emotional intelligence, and allows for agents to reason about the emotions of others and perform interpersonal emotion regulation (IER) in order to dynamically create the relations with others. The model was used to build the NPCs of a computer game scenario in NeverWinter Nights 2, where the player is required to work together with two agents to achieve a particular quest. An experiment was then conducted where players interacted with either a version with or without IER. By measuring friendship quality we were able to show that when one of the agents employed IER strategies it was perceived as more friendly according to four out of six dimensions of friendship.","[{'authorId': '2151066261', 'name': 'João Dias'}, {'authorId': '145136631', 'name': 'Ana Paiva'}]",24.0,{'pages': '777-784'},26.0,I want to be your friend: establishing relations with emotionally intelligent agents,2013.0

976c5579338aa76988fee9a8bdaa3056a0f6462e,"Chronic pain conditions are associated with abnormalities in brain structure and function. Moreover, some studies indicate that brain activity related to the subjective perception of chronic pain may be distinct from activity for acute pain. However, the latter are based on observations from cross-sectional studies. How brain activity reorganizes with transition from acute to chronic pain has remained unexplored. Here we study this transition by examining brain activity for rating fluctuations of back pain magnitude. First we compared back pain-related brain activity between subjects who have had the condition for ∼2 months with no prior history of back pain for 1 year (early, acute/subacute back pain group, n = 94), to subjects who have lived with back pain for >10 years (chronic back pain group, n = 59). In a subset of subacute back pain patients, we followed brain activity for back pain longitudinally over a 1-year period, and compared brain activity between those who recover (recovered acute/sub-acute back pain group, n = 19) and those in which the back pain persists (persistent acute/sub-acute back pain group, n = 20; based on a 20% decrease in intensity of back pain in 1 year). We report results in relation to meta-analytic probabilistic maps related to the terms pain, emotion, and reward (each map is based on >200 brain imaging studies, derived from neurosynth.org). We observed that brain activity for back pain in the early, acute/subacute back pain group is limited to regions involved in acute pain, whereas in the chronic back pain group, activity is confined to emotion-related circuitry. Reward circuitry was equally represented in both groups. In the recovered acute/subacute back pain group, brain activity diminished in time, whereas in the persistent acute/subacute back pain group, activity diminished in acute pain regions, increased in emotion-related circuitry, and remained unchanged in reward circuitry. The results demonstrate that brain representation for a constant percept, back pain, can undergo large-scale shifts in brain activity with the transition to chronic pain. These observations challenge long-standing theoretical concepts regarding brain and mind relationships, as well as provide important novel insights regarding definitions and mechanisms of chronic pain.","[{'authorId': '1890170', 'name': 'J.

The use of computers in the treatment of autistic children is highly controversial and emotional among parents and professionals. Fears of reinforcing autistic withdrawal are often mixed with insecurity and dislike of new technologies. On the other hand, positive effects of CAI on learning and behaviour are reported by parents and published as single case studies. The following paper relates perception, motivation, communication and behaviour--characteristics of autistic children to features of computer-assisted learning. Preliminary findings support the benefit of the use of computer-technology for the management of behaviour and learning of autistic children. In 12 autistics, video-taped evaluations showed higher enthusiasm ratings in computer-sessions than personal instruction sessions. Single case-studies demonstrated a positive influence of CAI on autistic children's behaviour-problems (e.g. avoidance of eye contact, echolalia) as well as improved spontaneous communication and better learning of academics.","[{'authorId': '1455360967', 'name': 'V.

One of the key skills to reading and writing is the ability to represent thoughts symbolically and share them in language with an audience who may not necessarily share the same temporal and spatial context. Children learn and practice these important language skills everyday, telling stories with the peers and adults around them. In particular, storytelling in the context of peer collaboration provides a key environment for children to learn language skills important for literacy. In light of this, an embodied conversational agent, Sam, who tells stories collaboratively with children was designed. Sam looks like a peer for pre-school children, but tells stories in a developmentally advanced way, modelling narrative skills important for literacy. Results demonstrated that children who played with the virtual peer told stories that more closely resembled the virtual peer's linguistically advanced stories: using more quoted speech and temporal and spatial expressions. In addition, children listened to Sam's stories carefully, assisting her and suggesting improvements. The potential benefits of having technology play a social role in young children's literacy learning is discussed.","[{'authorId': '2455971', 'name': 'Kimiko Ryokai'}, {'authorId': '2230970', 'name': 'C.

In a replication with 164 eighth graders, a behavioral delay-of-gratification task, a questionnaire on study habits, and a group-administered IQ test were added. Self-discipline measured in the fall accounted for more than twice as much variance as IQ in final grades, high school selection, school attendance, hours spent doing homework, hours spent watching television (inversely), and the time of day students began their homework. The effect of self-discipline on final grades held even when controlling for first-marking-period grades, achievement-test scores, and measured IQ.

The presentation of arguments is crucial – in particular in the context of dialogical argumentation. However, the effects of different discussion styles on the listener are hard to isolate in human dialogues. In order to demonstrate and investigate various styles of argumentation, we propose a multi-agent system in which different aspects of persuasion can be modelled and investigated separately. Our system utilizes argument structures extracted from text-based reviews for which a minimal bias of the user can be assumed. The persuasive dialogue is modelled as a dialogue game for argumentation that was motivated by the objective to enable both natural and flexible interactions between the agents. In order to support a comparison of factual against affective persuasion approaches, we implemented two fundamentally different strategies for both agents: The logical policy utilizes deep Reinforcement Learning in a multi-agent setup to optimize the strategy with respect to the game formalism and the available argument. In contrast, the emotional policy selects the next move in compliance with an agent emotion that is adapted to user feedback to persuade on an emotional level. The resulting interaction is presented to the user via virtual avatars and can be rated through an intuitive interface.","[{'authorId': '31728436', 'name': 'Niklas Rach'}, {'authorId': '1752551237', 'name': 'Klaus Weber'}, {'authorId': '2108802126', 'name': 'Yuchi Yang'}, {'authorId': '2295429', 'name': 'Stefan Ultes'}, {'authorId': '1742930', 'name': 'E.

97f7e4923a3ef76d3173b31d561d8fe93435b1ee,"Emotion regulation difficulties following trauma exposure have received increasing attention among researchers and clinicians. Previous work highlights the role of emotion regulation difficulties in multiple forms of psychological distress and identifies emotion regulation capacities as especially compromised among survivors of betrayal trauma: physical, sexual, or emotional maltreatment perpetrated by someone to whom the victim is close, such as a parent or partner. It is unknown, however, whether links between emotion regulation difficulties and psychological symptoms differ following exposure to betrayal trauma as compared with other trauma types. In the present study, 593 male and female university undergraduates completed the Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale (Gratz & Roemer, 2004), the Brief Betrayal Trauma Scale (Goldberg & Freyd, 2006), the Impact of Event Scale (Horowitz, Wilner, & Alvarez, 1979), and the Trauma Symptom Checklist (Elliott & Briere, 1992). A path analytic model demonstrated that betrayal trauma indirectly impacted symptoms of intrusion (β = .11), avoidance (β = .13), depression (β = .17), and anxiety (β = .14) via emotion regulation difficulties, an effect consistent with mediation.

The objectives of the study were to examine linkages between exposure to childhood abuse and interparental violence and the subsequent development of panic attacks and panic disorder using data gathered on a birth cohort of 1265 New Zealand young people studied to the age of 21 years. Method. Data on: (a) exposure to child abuse and interparental violence; (b) the development of panic attacks and panic disorder; and (c) other childhood and related factors were gathered over the course of a 21-year longitudinal study. Results. After adjustment for childhood and related factors, exposure to childhood physical abuse was associated with a significantly increased risk of later panic attack (OR 2·3, 95% CI 1·1–4·9) and panic disorder (OR 3·0, 95% CI 1·1–7·9); childhood sexual abuse was associated with a significantly increased risk of panic attack (OR 4·1, 95% CI 2·3–7·2) and a marginally significant increase risk of panic disorder (OR 2·2; 95% CI 0·98–5·0). Exposure to interparental violence was unrelated to later panic attack or disorder after adjustment. Conclusions. Exposure to childhood sexual and physical abuse was associated with increased risks of later panic attack/disorder even after adjustment for prospectively assessed confounding factors. However, exposure to interparental violence during childhood was not related to increased risk of later panic attack/disorder after adjustment. These data suggest the need for clinicians to be aware that patients with histories of childhood physical and sexual abuse may be at increased risk for panic during young adulthood.","[{'authorId': '5867204', 'name': 'R.

Most commitments depend on some incentive that is necessary to ensure that the action is in the agent's interest and thus, may be carried out to avoid eventual penalties. The capacity for using commitment strategies effectively is so important that natural selection may have shaped specialized capacities to make this possible. Evolutionary explanations for commitment, particularly its role in the evolution of cooperation, have been actively sought for and discussed in several fields, including Psychology and Philosophy. In this paper, using the tools of evolutionary game theory, we provide a new model showing that individuals tend to engage in commitments, which leads to the emergence of cooperation even without assuming repeated interactions. The model is characterized by two key parameters: the punishment cost of failing commitment imposed on either side of a commitment, and the cost of managing the commitment deal. Our analytical results and extensive computer simulations show that cooperation can emerge if the punishment cost is large enough compared to the management cost.","[{'authorId': '2928820', 'name': 'H.

In particular, he hypothesized that a person's response to a humanlike robot would abruptly shift from empathy to revulsion as it approached, but failed to attain, a lifelike appearance. This descent into eeriness is known as the uncanny valley. The essay appeared in an obscure Japanese journal called Energy in 1970, and in subsequent years, it received almost no attention. However, more recently, the concept of the uncanny valley has rapidly attracted interest in robotics and other scientific circles as well as in popular culture. Some researchers have explored its implications for human-robot interaction and computer-graphics animation, whereas others have investigated its biological and social roots. Now interest in the uncanny valley should only intensify, as technology evolves and researchers build robots that look human. Although copies of Mori's essay have circulated among researchers, a complete version hasn't been widely available. The following is the first publication of an English translation that has been authorized and reviewed by Mori.

Thus, the current study analyzed presence, self-reported anxiety, and a physiological parameter (heart rate [HR]) in a sample of 30 high anxious and 35 low anxious participants. Both groups delivered a 5 minute speech in a virtual lecture hall. Results indicate no mediating influences of presence on group differences in self-reported state anxiety during the speech, but point toward negative correlations between state anxiety and the iGroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ) scales ""sense of being there"" and ""realism."" Furthermore, HR was found to be unrelated to self-reported presence. Only the IPQ scale ""spatial presence"" showed a marginally significant influence on group differences in state anxiety. The present results support the assumption that presence and anxiety are logically distinct, meaning that presence does not directly influence the intensity of an emotion felt in a VE. Rather, it constitutes a precondition for an emotion to be at all elicited by a VE. Also, HR has proven to be no adequate substitute measure for presence, since it only assesses anxiety not presence. It may, however, mediate the interplay between trait anxiety and state anxiety. Possible implications of the current findings are discussed alongside the problem of using presence questionnaires that seem to be prone to subjective bias (i.e., participants confusing presence and emotion).","[{'authorId': '2144008', 'name': 'A.

Virtual reality (VR) can provide exposure to nature for those living in isolated confined environments. We evaluated VR-presented natural settings for reducing stress and improving mood.


METHODS
There were 18 participants (9 men, 9 women), ages 32 ± 12 yr, who viewed three 15-min 360° scenes (an indoor control, rural Ireland, and remote beaches). Subjects were mentally stressed with arithmetic before scenes. Electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate variability measured psycho-physiological arousal. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the 15-question Modified Reality Judgment and Presence Questionnaire (MRJPQ) measured mood and scene quality.


RESULTS
Reductions in EDA from baseline were greater at the end of the natural scenes compared to the control scene (-0.59, -0.52, and 0.32 μS, respectively). The natural scenes reduced negative affect from baseline ( 1.2 and 1.1 points), but the control scene did not ( 0.4 points). MRJPQ scores for the control scene were lower than both natural scenes (4.9, 6.7, and 6.5 points, respectively). Within the two natural scenes, the preferred scene reduced negative affect ( 2.4 points) more than the second choice scene ( 1.8 points) and scored higher on the MRJPQ (6.8 vs. 6.4 points).


DISCUSSION
Natural scene VR provided relaxation both objectively and subjectively, and scene preference had a significant effect on mood and perception of scene quality. VR may enable relaxation for people living in isolated confined environments, particularly when matched to personal preferences.Anderson AP, Mayer MD, Fellows AM, Cowan DR, Hegel MT, Buckey JC.

However, CVEs differ in type of avatar representation and level of behavioral realism afforded to users. The present investigation compared the effect of behavioral realism on users' nonverbal behavior, self-presence, social presence, and interpersonal attraction during a dyadic interaction. Fifty-one dyads (aged 18 to 26) embodied either a full-bodied avatar with mapped hands and inferred arm movements, an avatar consisting of only a floating head and mapped hands, or a static full-bodied avatar. Planned contrasts compared the effect of behavioral realism against no behavioral realism, and compared the effect of low versus high behavioral realism. Results show that participants who embodied the avatar with only a floating head and hands experienced greater social presence, self-presence, and interpersonal attraction than participants who embodied a full-bodied avatar with mapped hands. In contrast, there were no significant differences on these measures between participants in the two mapped-hands conditions and those who embodied a static avatar. Participants in the static-avatar condition rotated their own physical head and hands significantly less than participants in the other two conditions during the dyadic interaction. Additionally, side-to-side head movements were negatively correlated with interpersonal attraction regardless of condition. We discuss implications of the finding that behavioral realism influences nonverbal behavior and communication outcomes.","[{'authorId': '144681733', 'name': 'Fernanda Herrera'}, {'authorId': '48854188', 'name': 'Soo Youn Oh'}, {'authorId': '1737161', 'name': 'J.

In this context, it is increasingly common for preschool schools to incorporate students with special educational needs, including those with Down syndrome. These inclusion cases have been sparsely documented, so an investigation was proposed whose main objective was to know the characteristics of the teaching practice of those who work with these students. This approach was generated from four dimensions: personal, interpersonal, institutional and didactic. A qualitative research perspective and case study method were adopted. Three educators with experience in inclusion to students with Down syndrome participated. The technique used was the semi-structured interview, the data were categorized inductively. It was identified that teachers: have conceptual clarity in inclusive education and barriers to learning and participation; are looking for continuous training spaces for a relevant practice; emphasize the leadership as favorable for an inclusive education; its didactic planning privileges learning for life with the use of teaching materials; emphasize the importance of taking care of the student's location in the classroom, as well as following work routines; develop a qualitative evaluation of learning and promote collaborative work with parents and regular classroom support services. The research allows teachers to analyze efforts to attend students with relevance, through the self-training and support of the school community.","[{'authorId': '2126895139', 'name': 'Nayeli Lormendez Trujillo'}, {'authorId': '2126917748', 'name': 'Amanda Cano Ruíz'}]",3.0,,61.0,"Educación inclusiva de preescolares con síndrome de Down: la mirada de un grupo de educadoras de Veracruz, México",2020.0

Most existing methods for creating facial expressions of mixed emotions use operations like averaging to create the combined effect of two universal emotions. Such methods may be mathematically justifiable but are not necessarily valid from a perceptual point of view. The research reported here starts by user experiments aiming at understanding how people combine facial actions to express mixed emotions, and how the viewers perceive a set of facial actions in terms of underlying emotions. Using the results of these experiments and a three-dimensional emotion model, we associate facial actions to dimensions and regions in the emotion space, and create a facial expression based on the location of the mixed emotion in the three-dimensional space. We call these regionalized facial actions “facial expression units.”","[{'authorId': '145871176', 'name': 'A. Arya'}, {'authorId': '1700040', 'name': 'S.

This calls for a new theoretical approach that is dedicated specifically to understanding the interpersonal effects of emotional expressions. I summarize emotions as social information (EASI) theory, which posits that emotional expressions shape social influence by triggering affective reactions and/or inferential processes in observers, depending on the observer’s information processing and the perceived appropriateness of the emotional expression.

We presented subjects with 15 interpersonal distances ranging from 40 to 250 cm and obtained verbal and joystick-based ratings of discomfort. Whereas discomfort rose immediately when personal space was entered, the gradient was less steep for distances that exceeded the comfort region of personal space.

9bd36d63aac878782184217d73e1fda9b2603bb5,"Masahiro Mori observed that as robots come to look more humanlike, they seem more familiar, until a point is reached at which subtle deviations from human norms cause them to look creepy. He referred to this dip in familiarity and corresponding surge in strangeness as the uncanny valley. The eerie sensation associated with a mismatch between human expectations and a robot’s behavior provides a useful source of feedback to improve the cognitive models implemented in the robot. Is the uncanny valley a necessary property of near-humanlike forms? This paper contributes to ongoing work in understanding the nature and causes of the uncanny valley by means of an experiment: 56 participants were asked to rate 13 robots and 1 human, shown in video clips, on a very mechanical (1) to very humanlike (9) scale, a very strange (1) to very familiar (9) scale, and a not eerie (0) to extremely eerie (10) scale. Contrary to earlier studies with morphs [MacDorman and Ishiguro, 2006], plots of average and median values for ratings on these scales do not reveal a single U-shaped valley as predicted by Mori’s uncanny valley hypothesis [1970], although his hypothesis allows for some variation owing to movement. Robots rated similarly on the mechanical versus humanlike scale can be rated quite differently on the strange versus familiar or the eeriness scales. The results indicate that the perceived human likeness of a robot is not the only factor determining the perceived familiarity, strangeness, or eeriness of the robot. This suggests that other factors could be manipulated to vary the familiarity, strangeness, or eeriness of a robot independently of its human likeness. Introduction To build robots that at least superficially approach human likeness is leading to insights in human perception and face-to-face interaction. These android robots possess the physical presence that simulated characters lack, yet can be more perfectly controlled than any human actor, to isolate the factor under study. Even in experiments in which the android’s responses are identical, we can observe how human responses vary according to their beliefs. For example, Japanese participants showed the same modesty with their eyes by averting gaze downward when interacting with an android as when interacting with a human interlocutor if they believed the android were under human control by telepresence [MacDorman et al., 2005]. In addition, androids provide an ideal testing ground for theories from the social and cognitive sciences because competing models can be implemented in an android and then tested by letting the android interact with industrial robot humanoid robot","[{'authorId': '1690354', 'name': 'K.

Perceived agency was manipulated by telling the participants that the image was either an avatar controlled by a human, or an agent controlled by a computer. The results support the prediction that people respond socially to both human and computer-controlled entities, and that the existence of a virtual image increases tele-presence. Participants interacting with the less-anthropomorphic image reported more copresence and social presence than those interacting with partners represented by either no image at all or by a highly anthropomorphic image of the other, indicating that the more anthropomorphic images set up higher expectations that lead to reduced presence when these expectations were not met.","[{'authorId': '40372043', 'name': 'Kristine L.

We dismiss the traditional dichotomy between reactive and symbolic architectures. A classiication in terms of the amount of knowledge embedded in the system is made, instead, running from regulatory to planning to adaptive agents. Regulatory agents are implementable as control systems or automata, and represent the ideal case in which the agent has all the knowledge it needs. We nd that each type of agent is best suited for a particular kind of behavior. The diierent kinds of behavior form a hierarchy in terms of frequency of occurrence and response time, and do not gracefully reduce to each other. This suggests implementing agents as hierarchies of simpler agents, each specialized in the kind of behavior it implements. In this scheme, agents at one level act through agents at the next lower level. We introduce the concept of drive to address the issue of where an agent's goals come from. A discussion is made of common pitfalls and suggestions for the design of planning agents. Finally, a parallel architecture that embodies many of the ideas presented is sketched and discussed. This architecture solves the two major problems present in Georgee's earlier architecture, PRS: strictly sequential execution, and inability to learn.","[{'authorId': '1763484', 'name': 'J.

An important finding of the report is that the 2004 respondents continued to rate both interest-related and job-related reasons as important in their decisions to enrol in university study together with an increased sense of purpose. The respondents also revealed a greater clarity about occupational aspirations compared with their peers from 1994 and 1999 and were less likely to have come to university directly from school.","[{'authorId': '145192911', 'name': 'Kerri-Lee D.

Yet, it is unclear whether these strategies represent distinct cognitive styles associated with psychopathology, such that there are individuals who are predominantly “suppressors” or “reappraisers.” Using cluster analysis, we examined whether women with and without exposure to potentially traumatic events evidence distinct patterns of emotion regulation frequency, capacity, suppression, and cognitive reappraisal. Four patterns emerged: high regulators; high reappraisers/low suppressors; moderate reappraisers/low suppressors; and low regulators. Individuals who reported infrequently and ineffectively regulating their emotions (low regulators) also reported higher depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In contrast, individuals who reported frequently and effectively using reappraisal and low levels of suppression (high reappraisers/low suppressors) reported the lowest levels of these symptoms, suggesting that this specific combination of emotion regulation may be most adaptive. Our findings highlight that the capacity to regulate emotions and the ability to flexibly apply different strategies based on the context and timing may be associated with reduced psychopathology and more adaptive functioning.","[{'authorId': '36297101', 'name': 'A.

However, while the avatars look like their human counterparts, their movements often do not mimic their own due to existing challenges in accurate motion capture and retargeting. A better understanding of factors that influence the perception of biological motion would be valuable for creating virtual avatars that capture the essence of their human subjects. To investigate these issues, we captured 22 subjects walking in an open space. We then performed a study where participants were asked to identify their own motion in varying visual representations and scenarios. Similarly, participants were asked to identify the motion of familiar individuals. Unlike prior studies that used captured footage with simple “point‐light” displays, we rendered the motion on photo‐realistic 3D virtual avatars of the subject. We found that self‐recognition was significantly higher for virtual avatars than with point‐light representations. Users were more confident of their responses when identifying their motion presented on their virtual avatar. Recognition rates varied considerably between motion types for recognition of others, but not for self‐recognition. Overall, our results are consistent with previous studies that used recorded footage and offer key insights into the perception of motion rendered on virtual avatars.","[{'authorId': '3294674', 'name': 'S.

9cbd6c9b141ae5d1061946aaa81b2e7784800703,"Gaze represents a major non-verbal communication channel in social interactions. In this respect, when facing another person, one's gaze should not be examined as a purely perceptive process but also as an action-perception online performance. However, little is known about processes involved in the real-time self-regulation of social gaze. The present study investigates the impact of a gaze-contingent viewing window on fixation patterns and the awareness of being the agent moving the window. In face-to-face scenarios played by a virtual human character, the task for the 18 adult participants was to interpret an equivocal sentence which could be disambiguated by examining the emotional expressions of the character speaking. The virtual character was embedded in naturalistic backgrounds to enhance realism. Eye-tracking data showed that the viewing window induced changes in gaze behavior, notably longer visual fixations. Notwithstanding, only half of the participants ascribed the window displacements to their eye movements. These participants also spent more time looking at the eyes and mouth regions of the virtual human character. The outcomes of the study highlight the dissociation between non-volitional gaze adaptation and the self-ascription of agency. Such dissociation provides support for a two-step account of the sense of agency composed of pre-noetic monitoring mechanisms and reflexive processes, linked by bottom-up and top-down processes. We comment upon these results, which illustrate the relevance of our method for studying online social cognition, in particular concerning autism spectrum disorders (ASD) where the poor pragmatic understanding of oral speech is considered linked to visual peculiarities that impede facial exploration.","[{'authorId': '2791712', 'name': 'O.

These findings have served to motivate research on how to better develop and disseminate evidence-based treatments for PTSD. The current article presents the use of Virtual Reality (VR) as a clinical tool to address the assessment, prevention, and treatment of PTSD, based on the VR projects that were evolved at the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies since 2004. A brief discussion of the definition and rationale for the clinical use of VR is followed by a description of a VR application designed for the delivery of prolonged exposure (PE) for treating Service Members (SMs) and Veterans with combat- and sexual assault-related PTSD. The expansion of the virtual treatment simulations of Iraq and Afghanistan for PTSD assessment and prevention is then presented. This is followed by a forward-looking discussion that details early efforts to develop virtual human agent systems that serve the role of virtual patients for training the next generation of clinical providers, as healthcare guides that can be used to support anonymous access to trauma-relevant behavioural healthcare information, and as clinical interviewers capable of automated behaviour analysis of users to infer psychological state. The paper will conclude with a discussion of VR as a tool for breaking down barriers to care in addition to its direct application in assessment and intervention.","[{'authorId': '32772262', 'name': 'Albert A.

Information Technology can have an effect on quality and efficiency of care. Aims: The aim of this study is to gain the viewpoint of service users from a local mental health service in developing a mental health app. Method: A qualitative descriptive approach was used. Eight volunteers aged 18–49 years were interviewed with the aid of a semi-structured questionnaire. Results: Interviewees defined a good app by its ease of use. Common themes included availability of contact information, identifying triggers, the ability to rate mood/anxiety levels on a scale, guided relaxation techniques, and the option to personalise the app. The researchers will aim to produce an app that is easily accessible, highly personalisable and will include functions highlighted as important (i.e. contact information, etc.). Conclusions: This research will assist in the development of an easy-to-use app that could increase access to services, and allow service users to take an active role in their care. In previous studies, apps were developed without the involvement of service users. This study recognises the important role of service users in this area.","[{'authorId': '13233290', 'name': 'J.

Perceived stigma prevents many from reporting their symptoms. Stigma is a particularly pervasive problem among military service members, preventing them from reporting symptoms of combat-related conditions like posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, research shows increased reporting by service members when anonymous assessments are used. For example, service members report more symptoms of PTSD when they anonymously answer the Post-Deployment Health Assessment (PDHA) symptom checklist compared to the official PDHA, which is identifiable and linked to their military records. To investigate the factors that influence reporting of psychological symptoms by service members, we used a transformative technology: automated virtual humans that interview people about their symptoms. Such virtual human interviewers allow simultaneous use of two techniques for eliciting disclosure that would otherwise be incompatible; they afford anonymity while also building rapport. We examined whether virtual human interviewers could increase disclosure of mental health symptoms among active-duty service members that just returned from a year-long deployment in Afghanistan. Service members reported more symptoms during a conversation with a virtual human interviewer than on the official PDHA. They also reported more to a virtual human interviewer than on an anonymized PDHA. A second, larger sample of active-duty and former service members found a similar effect that approached statistical significance. Because respondents in both studies shared more with virtual human interviewers than an anonymized PDHA -even though both conditions control for stigma and ramifications for service members’ military records- virtual human interviewers that build rapport may provide a superior option to encourage reporting.","[{'authorId': '2419453', 'name': 'Gale M.

The activity of these neurons may signal a prediction of postsaccadic visual input, derived from an efference copy of saccadic motor output. Such a prediction is often thought to underlie our perception of a stable visual world, by compensating for the shifts in retinal image that accompany each eye movement. Here we review the evidence, and conclude that prediction does not in fact play a significant role in maintaining visual stability.

One such type of information consists of cues to the speaker's personality traits, the most fundamental dimension of variation between humans. Recent work explores the automatic detection of other types of pragmatic variation in text and conversation, such as emotion, deception, speaker charisma, dominance, point of view, subjectivity, opinion and sentiment. Personality affects these other aspects of linguistic production, and thus personality recognition may be useful for these tasks, in addition to many other potential applications. However, to date, there is little work on the automatic recognition of personality traits. This article reports experimental results for recognition of all Big Five personality traits, in both conversation and text, utilising both self and observer ratings of personality. While other work reports classification results, we experiment with classification, regression and ranking models. For each model, we analyse the effect of different feature sets on accuracy. Results show that for some traits, any type of statistical model performs significantly better than the baseline, but ranking models perform best overall. We also present an experiment suggesting that ranking models are more accurate than multi-class classifiers for modelling personality. In addition, recognition models trained on observed personality perform better than models trained using self-reports, and the optimal feature set depends on the personality trait. A qualitative analysis of the learned models confirms previous findings linking language and personality, while revealing many new linguistic markers.","[{'authorId': '1769183', 'name': 'François Mairesse'}, {'authorId': '2234088162', 'name': 'M.

Based on our work, the findings of other investigators on individual differences in risk for PTSD, and drawing on preclinical studies fear conditioning and extinction, we propose a conceptual model for the development of PTSD symptoms emphasizing the role of vulnerability and resilience to peritraumatic panic reactions. We tested this conceptual model in a cross‐sectional sample of police officers (n= 715). Utilizing an hierarchical linear regression model we were able to explain 39.7% of the variance in PTSD symptoms. Five variables remained significant in the final model; greater peritraumatic distress (β= 0.240, P < .001), greater peritraumatic dissociation (β= 0.174, P < .001), greater problem‐solving coping (β= 0.103, P < .01), greater routine work environment stress (β= 0.182, P < .001), and lower levels of social support (β=−0.246, P < .001). These results were largely consistent with the proposed conceptual model. Next steps in this line of research will be to test this model prospectively in a sample of 400 police academy recruits assessed during training and currently being followed for the first 2 years of police service.","[{'authorId': '2051570', 'name': 'C.

Sixty-four participants, assigned to one of the abuse type conditions, interacted with the three conversational agents in turn and reported their feelings about guiltiness, anger, and shame after each session.

We used a device which allowed us to present on a video monitor either the patient's hand or the examiner's hand simultaneously performing an identical or a different movement. In each trial, patients were required to decide whether the hand shown on the screen was their own or not. Hand movements produced in response to verbal command included simple (single-finger extension) and complex gestures (multi-finger extension). Ownership judgements were analysed and compared with those produced by six normal controls and two non-apraxic neurological patients. Apraxic patients and controls accurately recognized their own hand on the screen (own movement condition) and correctly identified the viewed hand as the examiner's when it performed a movement different from their own movement (incongruent movement condition). However, when the viewed hand was the examiner's hand executing their own movement (congruent movement condition), apraxic patients were significantly more impaired than controls. When the results were analysed as a function of gesture type, the number of correct responses was significantly lower for apraxic patients with respect to controls only for complex gestures. Interestingly, when patients executed the finger gestures inaccurately, they still failed to recognize the examiner's hand as alien, and claimed that the correct movement presented on the screen was their own. These results confirm that parietal lesions alter the representational aspects of gestures, and suggest a failure in evaluating and comparing internal and external feedback about movement. We conclude that the parietal cortex plays an important role in generating and maintaining a kinaesthetic model of ongoing movements.","[{'authorId': '2643325', 'name': 'A.

a03242b258194bff2e60200ec90608257f2ccc24,"Abstract : One of the key steps in creating quality interactive drama is the ability to create quality interactive characters (or believable agents). Two important aspects of such characters will be that they appear emotional and that they can engage in social interactions. My basic approach to these problems has been to use a broad agent architecture and minimal amounts of modeling of other agent in the environment. This approach is based on an understanding of the artistic nature of the problem. To enable agent-builders (artists) to create emotional agents, I provide a general framework for building emotional agents, default emotion-processing rules, and discussion about how to create quality, emotional characters. My framework gets a lot of its power from being part of a broad agent architecture. The concept is simple: the agent will be emotionally richer if there are more things to have emotions about and more ways to express them. This reliance on breadth has also meant that I have been able to create simple emotion models that rely on perception and motivation instead of deep modeling of other agents and complex cognitive processing. To enable agent builders to create social behaviors for believable agents, I have designed a methodology that provides heuristics for incorporating personality into social behaviors and suggests how to model other agents in the environment. I propose an approach to modeling other agents that calls for limiting the amount of modeling of other agents to that which is sufficient to create the desired behavior. Using this technique, I have been able to build robust social behaviors that use surprisingly little representation. I have used this methodology to build a number of social behaviors, like negotiation and making friends. I have built three simulations containing seven agents to drive and test this work.","[{'authorId': '145207410', 'name': 'J.

Ina field experiment at a science museum (Study 1), we randomly assigned parents to use their phones frequently or infrequently. Frequent phone use led parents to feel more distracted, which in turn impaired feelings of social connection and the meaning that parents derived when spending time with their children. In an additional weeklong diary study (Study 2), we found further evidence that smartphones can distract parents from reaping a sense of social connection when spending time with their children.

We describe the development of self and informant versions of a new questionnaire designed to measure the changes in social cognition that may occur following ABI, the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Trust (BIRT) Social Cognition Questionnaire (BSCQ). Seventy-two participants (Mean age  = 36 years, SD = 12), with different forms of ABI (76% traumatic brain injury, 8% cerebrovascular accident, 15% other) and who were on average 20 months post-injury (SD = 16), took part in the study. The measure demonstrates excellent psychometric properties, including high test-retest (.94) and split-half (.92) reliability, high internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = .92), and good concurrent validity. The questionnaire measures characteristics that are distinguishable from measures of cognitive ability. There was moderate overlap between self-report and informant versions of the questionnaire (r = .50), but the informant version had the strongest predictive value of outcome, measured with the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory III, one year later. The potential uses of the measure in relation to theory and practice are discussed.

PDM can predict dominance levels from trajectories with $\sim 85$% accuracy. Prior studies in psychology literature indicate that when interacting with humans, people are more comfortable around people that exhibit complementary movement behaviors. Our algorithm leverages this by enabling the robots to exhibit complementing responses to pedestrian dominance.

a113b3a576cd05ec56a039a3ee89e6d9b7ee208f,"Evaluation of spatial learning and memory in rodents is commonly carried out using different maze settings such as the Multiple T-Maze. State-of-the-art analysis is primarily based on statistics of quantitative measures stemming from animal trajectories in a maze, e.g. path length or correct decisions made. Currently trajectories themselves are analyzed and evaluated one at a time and comparison of multiple trajectories is a tedious task. The resulting ﬁndings may not fully answer complex questions that behavioral researchers encounter as well, e.g., why do animals behave in a certain way or can atypical behaviour be detected? This paper describes an innovative approach on how exploratory analysis for Multiple T-Maze studies can be enhanced through interactive visual analysis. We explain our solution for analyzing a whole ensemble of data at once and support the ﬁnding of orientational characteristics and migration patterns within the ensemble. We also abstract the analysis tasks for Multiple T-Maze studies and, based on these tasks, we extend a coordinated multiple views system to support the solving of fundamental problems which behavioral researchers face. Besides views of standard charts we deploy a multi-resolution heat map and the Gate-O-Gon, which is a novel visual element. It gives clues on the animals’ general movement orientation and distribution of revisited gates, as well as enhances the discovery of patterns in movement and identifying of irregular behavior. Finally we demonstrate the usefulness of the newly proposed approach using a real life data set consisting of 400 Multiple T-Maze runs.","[{'authorId': '83994270', 'name': 'Fabrizia Bechtold'}, {'authorId': '2050227', 'name': 'R.

However, the inadequate network bandwidth often limits the spatial resolution of the transmitted video, which will heavily degrade the recognition reliability. We develop a novel framework to achieve robust emotion recognition from low bit rate video. While video frames are downsampled at the encoder side, the decoder is embedded with a deep network model for joint super-resolution (SR) and recognition. Notably, we propose a novel max-mix training strategy, leading to a single “One-for-All” model that is remarkably robust to a vast range of downsampling factors. That makes our framework well adapted for the varied bandwidths in real transmission scenarios, without hampering scalability or efficiency. The proposed framework is evaluated on the AVEC 2016 benchmark, and demonstrates significantly improved stand-alone recognition performance, as well as rate-distortion (R-D) performance, than either directly recognizing from LR frames, or separating SR and recognition.","[{'authorId': '50563570', 'name': 'Bowen Cheng'}, {'authorId': '2969311', 'name': 'Zhangyang Wang'}, {'authorId': '2156120219', 'name': 'Zhaobin Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2000315344', 'name': 'Zhu Li'}, {'authorId': '1771885', 'name': 'Ding Liu'}, {'authorId': '1706007', 'name': 'Jianchao Yang'}, {'authorId': '144297666', 'name': 'Shuai Huang'}, {'authorId': '153652752', 'name': 'Thomas S.

In an increasing number of military personnel, the adverse effects of service and particularly of stressful combat exposure are significant long lasting and possibly fatal. Most stress research is focused on treatment, but because stress effects are liable to appear years after exposure, it is imperative that methodologies be developed to mitigate the adverse effects of military-related stress and prevent its post-exposure effects. It has long been accepted that warfighters adapt to combat stress after the first few experiences and that training can help duplicate this process, with recent studies showing that experienced military personnel are able to control and even utilize stress productively. A key part of what experienced personnel learn is self-awareness of their stress state and self-regulation of stress effects. These skills can be greatly enhanced by combining cognitive learning methodologies grounded in learning theory and biofeedback techniques based on Heart Rate Variability (HRV) with innovative simulation game-based training tools. The training system described here will be implemented on a mobile device such as an iPod/Touch, providing adaptive, tailored training that can be widely distributed to the Warfighter for initial stress resilience training, on-the-spot refreshment and practice.","[{'authorId': '46443615', 'name': 'Joseph Cohn'}, {'authorId': '2331114', 'name': 'G.

Personality has been conceptualized from a variety of theoretical perspectives, and at various levels of Each of these levels has made unique contributions to our understanding of individual differences in behavior and experience. However, the number of personality traits, and scales designed to measure them, escalated without an end in sight (Goldberg, 1971). Researchers, as well as practitioners in the field of personality assessment, were faced with a bewildering array of personality scales from which to choose, with little guidance and no overall rationale at hand. What made matters worse was that scales with the same name often measure concepts that are not the same, and scales with different names often measure concepts that are quite similar. Although diversity and scientific pluralism are useful, the systematic accumulation of findings and the communication among researchers became difficult amidst the Babel of concepts and scales. Many personality researchers had hoped that they might devise the structure that would transform the Babel into a community speaking a common language. However, such an integration was not to be achieved by any one researcher or by any one theoretical perspective. As Allport once put it, "" each assessor has his own pet units and uses a pet battery of diagnostic devices "" (1958, p. 258). What personality psychology needed was a descriptive model, or taxonomy, of its subject matter. One of the central goals of scientific taxonomies is the definition of overarching domains within which large numbers of specific instances can be understood in a simplified way. Thus, in personality psychology, a taxonomy would permit researchers to study specified domains of personality characteristics, rather than examining separately the thousands of particular attributes that make human beings individual and unique. Moreover, a generally accepted taxonomy would greatly facilitate the accumulation and communication of empirical findings by offering a standard vocabulary, or nomenclature. After decades of research, the field is approaching consensus on a general taxonomy of personality traits, the "" Big Five "" personality dimensions. These dimensions do not represent a particular theoretical perspective but were derived from analyses of the natural-language terms people use to describe themselves 3 and others. Rather than replacing all previous systems, the Big Five taxonomy serves an integrative function because it can represent the various and diverse systems of personality …","[{'authorId': '2254103', 'name': 'O.

To show that members of a preliterate culture who had minimal exposure to literate cultures would associate the same emotion concepts with the same facial behaviors as do members of Western and Eastern literate cultures, data were gathered in New Guinea by telling subjects a story, showing them a set of three faces, and asking them to select the face which showed the emotion appropriate to the story.

Close interpersonal distance (IPD) increases emotional responses during interaction and has been related to avoidance behavior in social anxiety. However, a systematic investigation of the effects of IPD on subjective experience combined with measures of physiological arousal and behavioral responses during real-time social interaction has been missing. Virtual Reality allows for a controlled manipulation of IPD while maintaining naturalistic social encounters. The present study investigates IPD in social interaction using a novel paradigm in Virtual Reality. Thirty-six participants approached virtual agents and engaged in short interactions. IPD was varied between 3.5 and 1 m by manipulating the distance at which agents reacted to the participant's approach. Closer distances were rated as more arousing, less pleasant, and less natural than longer distances and this effect was significantly modulated by social anxiety scores. Skin conductance responses were also increased at short distances compared to longer distances. Finally, an interaction of IPD and social anxiety was observed for avoidance behavior, measured as participants' backward motion during interaction, with stronger avoidance related to close distances and high values of social anxiety. These results highlight the influence of IPD on experience, physiological response, and behavior during social interaction. The interaction of social anxiety and IPD suggests including the manipulation of IPD in behavioral tests in Virtual Reality as a promising tool for the treatment of social anxiety disorder.","[{'authorId': '30692915', 'name': 'Leon O.

The magnitude of the sex differences was significantly related to various attributes of the studies. In particular, the tendency for men to aggress more than women was more pronounced for aggression that produces pain or physical injury than for aggression that produces psychological or social harm. In addition, sex differences in aggressive behavior were larger to the extent that women, more than men, perceived that enacting a behavior would produce harm to the target, guilt and anxiety in oneself, as well as danger to oneself. Our interpretation oftbese results emphasizes that aggression sex differences are a function of perceived consequences of aggression that are learned as aspects of gender roles and other social roles.","[{'authorId': '2260153116', 'name': 'J.

We provide experimental evidence that emotional contagion occurs without direct interaction between people (exposure to a friend expressing an emotion is sufficient), and in the complete absence of nonverbal cues. Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’ positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.","[{'authorId': '1845400', 'name': 'Adam D.

There are various side effects associated with drugs and not everyone has access to therapy, whether due to cost or availability. Self-administrable therapies allow for greater ease of access and as such, a novel virtual reality based self-attachment therapy is currently being developed. One of its main goals is for the user to develop a bond and reparent a child avatar representing one’s childhood self. To do so efficiently, the emotions, felt by the user when discussing their childhood, should be transferred to this child avatar. This project aims to train an emotion recognition model to allow the detection of multiple emotions. In addition, it aims to implement the self-attachment theory scenario to manage the dialogue between a user and a virtual therapist. The two parts of the project are to be integrated within the proposed virtual reality application. The devised multimodal and multi-emotion recognition model trained on CMUMOSEI dataset, achieves state-of-the-art results on happiness detection and competitive results for other emotions. The scenario was implemented using FAtiMA toolkit and together with the emotion recognition model was successfully integrated within the virtual reality application.","[{'authorId': '1694989', 'name': 'A.

To do this, an ad hoc questionnaire was designed and conducted in the months of June–July 2020. The sample consisted of 893 people who were studying at various Spanish universities. The results show little diversity in teaching methodologies; virtual teaching was carried out with the same parameters as face-to-face teaching. The role of the student body was one of passivity, consisting of little interaction with the teachers. Although it is true that there were no difficulties in following the course, there was limited attention paid to the emotional well-being of the students. Amongst the conclusions garnered significant, we point out the need to develop the adaptability of university teaching staff to unforeseen situations, as well as a continuing reflection on the model used in the teaching process mediated by digital technologies and the importance of promoting greater autonomy and self-regulation during learning.","[{'authorId': '2124159543', 'name': 'I. del Arco'}, {'authorId': '2115705935', 'name': 'Patrícia Silva'}, {'authorId': '47996296', 'name': 'Òscar Flores'}]",30.0,,58.0,University Teaching in Times of Confinement: The Light and Shadows of Compulsory Online Learning,2021.0

Results indicate that shame and guilt are distinct affective experiences that have important and quite different implications in the interpersonal realm. There was a substantial positive correlation between shame-proneness and guilt-proneness. Nonetheless, as predicted, other-oriented empathic responsiveness was negatively related to proneness to shame but positively correlated with proneness to guilt. In contrast, an index of more self-oriented personal distress was positively linked to shame-proneness.

First, no simple criterion picks out propositions about morality from within the larger set of deontic propositions concerning what is permissible and impermissible in social relations, the law, games, and manners. Second, the mechanisms underlying emotions and deontic evaluations are independent and operate in parallel, and so some scenarios elicit emotions prior to moral evaluations, some elicit moral evaluations prior to emotions, and some elicit them at the same time. Third, deontic evaluations depend on inferences, either unconscious intuitions or conscious reasoning. Fourth, human beliefs about what is, and isn’t, moral are neither complete nor consistent. The article marshals the evidence, which includes new studies, corroborating these principles, and discusses the relations between them and other current theories of moral reasoning.","[{'authorId': '48399217', 'name': 'M.

Including (minimal) social cues in Persuasive Technology (PT) increases the probability that people attribute human-like characteristics to that technology, which in turn can make that technology more persuasive (see, e.g., Nass, Steuer, Tauber, & Reeder, 1993). PT in the social actor role can be equipped with a variety of social cues to create opportunities for applying social influence strategies (for an overview, see Fogg, 2003). However, multiple social cues may not always be perceived as being consistent, which could decrease their perceived human-likeness and their persuasiveness. In the current article, we investigate the relation between consistency of social cues and persuasion by an artificial agent. Findings of two studies show that consistency of social cues increases people’s recognition and recall of artificial agents’ emotional expressions, and make those agents more persuasive. These findings show the importance of the combined meaning of social cues in the design of persuasive artificial agents.","[{'authorId': '3098701', 'name': 'Peter A. M.

Results suggest that age differences in emotion regulation (such as older adults' increased endorsement of passive emotion regulation relative to young adults) are partially due to older adults' decreased ability to integrate emotion and cognition, increased prioritization of emotion regulation goals, and decreased tendency to express anger.","[{'authorId': '5373056', 'name': 'A.

This was the birth of positive organizational scholarship, a new field that focused on what they called “positive deviance”—outcomes that far exceeded normal success. 
 
 In his previous book Positive Leadership, Cameron outlined four leadership strategies—Positive Climate, Positive Relationships, Positive Communications, and Positive Meaning—that characterize exceptionally high-performing organizations. Here he takes these strategies further by laying out tactics for implementing them: 
 
 • Creating a Culture of Abundance: five specific steps leaders can take to create an organizational culture that enables members to experience vitality, flourishing, and engagement 
 • Developing Positive Energy Networks: tools and practices for cultivating positive energy in oneself and for diffusing it throughout the organization 
 • Delivering Negative Feedback Positively: techniques for delivering difficult but necessary messages in ways that build and strengthen relationships 
 • Establishing and Achieving Everest Goals: guidelines for setting goals that have all the characteristics of SMART goals but go far beyond them 
 • Applying Positive Leadership in Organizations: a powerful tool for determining exactly how to implement positive leadership practices in the particular circumstances of your organization 
 
 Study after study (some of which are cited in the book) has shown that companies practicing positive leadership far outperform their competitors.

To answer this question, we investigated whether these spaces refer to a similar or different physical distance. Methodology Participants provided reachability-distance (for potential action) and comfort-distance (for social processing) judgments towards human and non-human virtual stimuli while standing still (passive) or walking toward stimuli (active). Principal Findings Comfort-distance was larger than other conditions when participants were passive, but reachability and comfort distances were similar when participants were active. Both spaces were modulated by the social valence of stimuli (reduction with virtual females vs males, expansion with cylinder vs robot) and the gender of participants. Conclusions These findings reveal that peripersonal reaching and interpersonal comfort spaces share a common motor nature and are sensitive, at different degrees, to social modulation.

This is the first controlled trial examining video-teleconferencing to remotely deliver behavioral parent training to the home setting with a live therapist. Method: Racially/ethnically diverse children ages 3–5 years with disruptive behavior disorders, and their caregiver(s), using webcams and parent-worn Bluetooth earpieces, participated in a randomized trial comparing Internet-delivered parent–child interaction therapy (I-PCIT) versus standard clinic-based PCIT (N = 40). Major assessments were conducted at baseline, midtreatment, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up. Linear regressions and hierarchical linear modeling using maximum-likelihood estimation were used to analyze treatment satisfaction, diagnoses, symptoms, functioning, and burden to parents across conditions. Results: Intent-to-treat analyses found 70% and 55% of children treated with I-PCIT and clinic-based PCIT, respectively, showed “treatment response” after treatment, and 55% and 40% of children treated with I-PCIT and clinic-based PCIT, respectively, continued to show “treatment response” at 6-month follow-up. Both treatments had significant effects on children’s symptoms and burden to parents, and many effects were very large in magnitude. Most outcomes were comparable across conditions, except that the rate of posttreatment “excellent response” was significantly higher in I-PCIT than in clinic-based PCIT, and I-PCIT was associated with significantly fewer parent-perceived barriers to treatment than clinic-based PCIT. Both treatments were associated with positive engagement, treatment retention, and very high treatment satisfaction. Conclusion: Findings build on the small but growing literature supporting the promising role of new technologies for expanding the delivery of behavioral parent training.","[{'authorId': '4454081', 'name': 'Jonathan S.

To test this distinction, 120 participants were shown a disgusting film while their experiential, behavioral, and physiological responses were recorded. Participants were told to either (a) think about the film in such a way that they would feel nothing (reappraisal, a form of antecedent-focused emotion regulation), (b) behave in such a way that someone watching them would not know they were feeling anything (suppression, a form of response-focused emotion regulation), or (c) watch the film (a control condition). Compared with the control condition, both reappraisal and suppression were effective in reducing emotion-expressive behavior. However, reappraisal decreased disgust experience, whereas suppression increased sympathetic activation. These results suggest that these 2 emotion regulatory processes may have different adaptive consequences.","[{'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

a882da20f6feeeabbc6aa66a7ccb39fc48059f7d,"Adolescent anxiety is debilitating, the most frequently diagnosed adolescent mental health problem, and leads to substantial long-term problems. A randomized controlled trial (n = 138) was conducted to test the effectiveness of a biofeedback video game (Dojo) for adolescents with elevated levels of anxiety. Adolescents (11–15 years old) were randomly assigned to play Dojo or a control game (Rayman 2: The Great Escape). Initial screening for anxiety was done on 1,347 adolescents in five high schools; only adolescents who scored above the “at-risk” cut-off on the Spence Children Anxiety Survey were eligible. Adolescents’ anxiety levels were assessed at pre-test, post-test, and at three month follow-up to examine the extent to which playing Dojo decreased adolescents’ anxiety. The present study revealed equal improvements in anxiety symptoms in both conditions at follow-up and no differences between Dojo and the closely matched control game condition. Latent growth curve models did reveal a steeper decrease of personalized anxiety symptoms (not of total anxiety symptoms) in the Dojo condition compared to the control condition. Moderation analyses did not show any differences in outcomes between boys and girls nor did age differentiate outcomes. The present results are of importance for prevention science, as this was the first full-scale randomized controlled trial testing indicated prevention effects of a video game aimed at reducing anxiety. Future research should carefully consider the choice of control condition and outcome measurements, address the potentially high impact of participants’ expectations, and take critical design issues into consideration, such as individual- versus group-based intervention and contamination issues.","[{'authorId': '48156000', 'name': 'H.

These gestures are known as symbolic gestures, emblematic gestures, or emblems. Just as every culture has its own verbal language, every culture also develops its own emblem vocabulary in gestures. Although the meaning and function of emblems are similar across cultures, their form is different. Thus, emblematic gestures are culture specific (and some are gender specific within cultures). This is true not only of national cultures but also of organizational cultures (e.g., the military, sports teams). Unlike illustrators, emblems can stand on their own without speech and convey verbal meaning, such as the American A-OK sign, the peace sign (two fingers up, palm facing outward), or OK (thumb up, hand in fist). Many of the emblems of most cultures are devoted to insults or obscenities. Emblems are true body language, with clear verbal meanings, for good or bad.

We analyze the walking behavior of users when avoiding real and virtual static obstacles. In order to generalize our study, we consider both anthropomorphic and inanimate objects, each having his virtual and real counterpart. The results showed that users exhibit different locomotion behaviors in the presence of real and virtual obstacles, and in the presence of anthropomorphic and inanimate objects. Precisely, the results showed a decrease of walking speed as well as an increase of the clearance distance (i. e., the minimal distance between the walker and the obstacle) when facing virtual obstacles compared to real ones. Moreover, our results suggest that users act differently due to their perception of the obstacle: users keep more distance when the obstacle is anthropomorphic compared to an inanimate object and when the orientation of anthropomorphic obstacle is from the profile compared to a front position.

a91582684c07e6481c99ff52aecd25c373d6f996,"In recent decades, many studies have shown that schizophrenia is associated with severe social cognitive impairments affecting key components, such as the recognition of emotions, theory of mind, attributional style, and metacognition. Most studies investigated each construct separately, precluding analysis of the interactive and immersive nature of real-life situation. Specialized batteries of tests are under investigation to assess social cognition, which is thought now as a link between neurocognitive disorders and impaired functioning. However, this link accounts for a limited part of the variance of real-life functioning. To fill this gap, advances in virtual reality and affective computing have made it possible to carry out experimental investigations of naturalistic social cognition, in controlled conditions, with good reproducibility. This approach is illustrated with the description of a new paradigm based on an original virtual card game in which subjects interpret emotional displays from a female virtual agent, and decipher her helping intentions. Independent variables concerning emotional expression in terms of valence and intensity were manipulated. We show how several useful dependant variables, ranging from classic experimental psychology data to metacognition or subjective experiences records, may be extracted from a single experiment. Methodological issues about the immersion into a simulated intersubjective situation are considered. The example of this new flexible experimental setting, with regards to the many constructs recognized in social neurosciences, constitutes a rationale for focusing on this potential intermediate link between standardized tests and real-life functioning, and also for using it as an innovative media for cognitive remediation.","[{'authorId': '2018806', 'name': 'A.

To optimize online assessment of suicidal patients, there is a need for short, good-quality tools to assess elevated risk of future suicidal behavior. Computer adaptive testing (CAT) can be used to reduce response burden and improve accuracy, and make the available pencil-and-paper tools more appropriate for online administration. Objective The aim was to test whether an item response–based computer adaptive simulation can be used to reduce the length of the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS). Methods The data used for our simulation was obtained from a large multicenter trial from The Netherlands: the Professionals in Training to STOP suicide (PITSTOP suicide) study. We applied a principal components analysis (PCA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), a graded response model (GRM), and simulated a CAT. Results The scores of 505 patients were analyzed. Psychometric analyses showed the questionnaire to be unidimensional with good internal consistency. The computer adaptive simulation showed that for the estimation of elevation of risk of future suicidal behavior 4 items (instead of the full 19) were sufficient, on average. Conclusions This study demonstrated that CAT can be applied successfully to reduce the length of the Dutch version of the BSS. We argue that the use of CAT can improve the accuracy and the response burden when assessing the risk of future suicidal behavior online. Because CAT can be daunting for clinicians and applied scientists, we offer a concrete example of our computer adaptive simulation of the Dutch version of the BSS at the end of the paper.","[{'authorId': '4453598', 'name': 'D.

It, e.g., affects people's interpersonal distance and is thus largely involved when navigating through social environments. However, the PS is regulated dynamically, its size depends on numerous social and personal characteristics and its violation evokes different levels of discomfort and physiological arousal. Thus, gaining more insight into this phenomenon is important. We contribute to the PS investigations by presenting the results of a controlled experiment in a CAVE, focusing on German males in the age of 18 to 30 years. The PS preferences of 27 participants have been sampled while they were approached by either a single embodied, computer-controlled virtual agent (VA) or by a group of three VAs. In order to investigate the influence of a VA's emotions, we altered their facial expression between angry and happy. Our results indicate that the emotion as well as the number of VAs approaching influence the PS: larger distances are chosen to angry VAs compared to happy ones; single VAs are allowed closer compared to the group. Thus, our study is a foundation for social and behavioral studies investigating PS preferences.","[{'authorId': '3249697', 'name': 'A.

We introduce a two-step registration process to efficiently build dense consistent surface correspondences across all the face scans. We reconstruct high-fidelity 3D facial performances by combining motion capture data with the minimal set of face scans in the blendshape interpolation framework.

One novel approach is to train parents to use evidence-based interventions for their child with ASD via telehealth. Pilot work examining the efficacy of one such program, ImPACT Online, demonstrated a high rate of parent program engagement, low attrition, and associated gains in parent learning and child social communication. Objective The objective of this study was to conduct an open trial of ImPACT Online to better understand its dissemination potential. Methods We examined the reach and representativeness of families who registered (n=36) compared to families who were referred (n=139) to the open trial for one referral site. We then compared the demographics of all families who enrolled in the open trial (n=112) to families who enrolled in one of two controlled trials of the same program (n=50). We also examined metrics of program engagement for the open and controlled trials, the relationship between program engagement and changes in parents’ intervention knowledge, and program evaluation for the participants in the open trial. Results In total, 25.8% (36/139) of the parents who were given information about the program at their child’s diagnostic feedback session registered with the program. The parents who enrolled in the open (OT) and controlled trials (CT), respectively, were similar in gender (OT: 84.8% (95/112); CT: 88% (44/50), female), marital status (OT: 80.4% (90/112) ; CT: 69.6% (32/46), married), education (OT: 58.0% (65/112); CT: 54.0% (27/50), college degree or higher), and employment status (OT: 58.0% (65/112); CT: 65.3% (32/49), employed outside the home). The child participants were similar in terms of gender (OT: 83.0% (93/112); CT: 76.0% (38/50), male) and race and ethnicity (OT: 38.4% (43/112); CT: 24.0% (12/50), minority). However, the mean chronological age of the child participants in the open trial group was significantly higher (Mean=60.0 months) than in the controlled trial group (Mean=43.0 months), with t160=5.22, P<.001. Parents in the open trial engaged with the program at a significantly lower rate than the controlled trial, F3,81=21.14, P<.001. Program engagement was significantly associated with gains in parent intervention knowledge across both the groups, beta=.41, t=2.43, P=.02.

We find that a flexible combination of animation approaches may be needed to satisfy these needs. In this paper we present SmartBody, an open source modular framework for animating ECAs in real time, based on the notion of hierarchically connected animation controllers. Controllers in SmartBody can employ arbitrary animation algorithms such as keyframe interpolation, motion capture or procedural animation. Controllers can also schedule or combine other controllers. We discuss our architecture in detail, including how we incorporate traditional approaches, and develop the notion of a controller as a reactive module within a generic framework, for realizing modular animation control. To illustrate the versatility of the architecture, we also discuss a range of applications that have used SmartBody successfully.","[{'authorId': '2096971', 'name': 'M.

The instructional impact of this interaction in learning environments has not been established, however. This study examined the impact of emotion and gender of a pedagogical agent as a learning companion (PAL) on social judgements, interest, self-efficacy, and learning. Two experiments investigated separately the effects of a PAL’s emotional expression and empathetic response. Experiment 1 focused on emotional expression (positive vs. negative vs. neutral) and gender (male vs. female) with a sample of 142 male and female college students in a computer literacy course. Experiment 2 investigated the impact of empathetic response (responsive vs. non-responsive) and gender with 56 pre-service teachers. Overall, the results yielded main and interaction effects of PAL emotion and gender on the dependent variables. In particular, the PAL’s empathetic response had a positive impact on learner interest and self-efficacy; PAL gender had a positive impact on recall. The findings imply that the emotion and the gender of the digital learning companion could be utilized to optimize college students’ motivation and learning.","[{'authorId': '32964910', 'name': 'Yanghee Kim'}, {'authorId': '25550816', 'name': 'A.

The perceiver was given no opportunity to interact with the target, a condition we refer to as zero acquaintance. We reasoned that in order to make personality judgments, perceivers would use the information available to them (physical appearance). Consensus in personality judgments would result, then, from shared stereotypes about particular physical appearance characteristics. Results from three separate studies with 259 subjects supported this hypothesis. On two of the five dimensions (extraversion and conscientiousness) on which subjects rated each other, a significant proportion of variance was due to the stimulus target. Consensus on judgments of extraversion appears to have been largely mediated by judgments of physical attractiveness. Across the three studies there was also evidence that the consensus in judgments on these two dimensions had some validity, in that they correlated with self-judgments on those two dimensions.","[{'authorId': '145859227', 'name': 'L.

ad07b99615407b4bf5c0967571d6bd8b9f969ff7,"Empathy and Moral Development represents the life’s work of Professor Hoffman, integrating over 30 years of research with information and ideas gleaned from the psychological and social development theories of the last century. Starting with biblical concepts of sin and guilt and drawing on the germinal theories of historical figures such as Rousseau, Freud and Piaget, the author also discusses Kohlberg’s theory and modifications by later followers. 
 
The first chapter begins with a brief overview of the previous and current theories and the historical sources for the book, giving clear definitions and outlining the theory to follow. Each of the seven sections of the book expands on important key concepts introduced earlier. There are frequent references to and review of the previously discussed material. The first section of the book explains the “innocent bystander” model that has been used for decades to explore human moral development. Concepts from animal arousal and behavior models are linked with human infant research on early affective and cognitive development. The research quoted is illustrative and extensive. The section ends with a discussion of the differences between empathy, guilt, sympathy and injustice. Parts Two and Three introduce the concept of guilt and how parental discipline interacts with a child’s cognitive skills to guide moral development. This first half of the book could have been expanded further through the use of more examples and further exploration of how genetics and innate brain processes contribute to the development of empathy. Hoffman also seemed to emphasize the psychosocial aspects over the behavioral cognitive and genetic aspects, but it is a good review of the field to date. 
 
The second half of the book is very interesting. The examples given are more current, complete and involved. The author shines as he discusses his integration of existing theory and research into a comprehensive model. He sketches a brief picture of different types of guilt, and a theoretical hierarchy. He expands on his assertion that both parental discipline and peer interaction are necessary for the development of guilt and morality. His collected statistics on parental discipline and its effects on children’s moral development are impressive. He explains why empathy can operate in some situations and can be overwhelmed in others, even when the individuals involved are highly empathic (i.e. therapist burnout). Numerous examples are given of how guilt and empathy are motivators for human action, especially prosocial and “altruistic” actions. In light of the events of September 11, 2001, Hoffman’s concepts explain much of the individual and social group actions which followed. 
 
Section Four of the book asks the question “Is Empathy Enough” to explain moral action. Types of bias which may affect empathy and moral action are examined. Empathy’s self-destructive and self-limiting qualities are explored and integrated in Darwinian fashion. Hoffman states that a morality based on empathy alone would not be fair in large mixed or larger human groups and would lead to bias and conflict. To live together peaceably, Hoffman insists that empathy must be embedded in moral principles, the subject of the fifth part of the book. Hoffman shows how empathy (affect) becomes linked or bonded to moral principles (of cognitive and social origin) as the person develops. The synthesis is used powerfully to explain the perpetuation of social attributes of caring and justice in western society. Useful definitions of key concepts in justice research are included. 
 
Parts six and seven of the book are the slimmest and cover culture, wherein issues of the universal applicability of the key concepts are examined, and intervention, which hopefully can someday be expanded into its own volume. A few directions in designing empathic training for use in young offenders and other children at risk are given, but not in the kind of depth currently desperately needed in the field. 
 
The book is well organized in its scant 300 pages and set up as a graduate course. It is an easy book from which to learn. It would make an ideal text and makes for a brilliant discussion overall, as it presents the author’s theory that will, no doubt, form the basis for future research and intervention in this area.","[{'authorId': '115702696', 'name': 'Lori Ann Vogt'}]",1802.0,,0.0,Empathy and Moral Development: Implications for caring and Justice.,2003.0

Existing studies on the relation between sense of presence and level of anxiety, however, have yielded mixed results on the correlation between the two. In this meta-analysis, we reviewed publications on VRET for anxiety that included self-reported presence and anxiety. The comprehensive search of the literature identified 33 publications with a total of 1196 participants. The correlation between self-reported sense of presence and anxiety was extracted and meta-analyzed. Potential moderators such as technology characteristics, sample characteristics including age, gender and clinical status, disorder characteristics and study design characteristics such as measurements were also examined. The random effects analysis showed a medium effect size for the correlation between sense of presence and anxiety (r = .28; 95% CI: 0.18–0.38). Moderation analyses revealed that the effect size of the correlation differed across different anxiety disorders, with a large effect size for fear of animals (r = .50; 95% CI: 0.30–0.66) and a no to small effect size for social anxiety disorder (r = .001; 95% CI: −0.19–0.19). Further, the correlation between anxiety and presence was stronger in studies with participants who met criteria for an anxiety disorder than in studies with a non-clinical population. Trackers with six degrees of freedom and displays with a larger field of view resulted in higher effect sizes, compared to trackers with three degrees of freedom and displays with a smaller field of view. In addition, no difference in effect size was found for the type of presence measurement and the type of anxiety measurement. This meta-analysis confirms the positive relation between sense of presence and anxiety and demonstrates that this relation can be affected by various moderating factors.","[{'authorId': '2055564023', 'name': 'Y.

A challenge in such environments is that the time that elapses between deciding to take an action and receiving a reward based on its outcome can be longer than the interval between successive decisions. We explore this in the context of a non-player character (NPC) in a modern first-person shooter game. Such games take place in 3D environments where players, both human and computer-controlled, compete by engaging in combat and completing task objectives. We investigate the use of RL to enable NPCs to gather experience from game-play and improve their shooting skill over time from a reward signal based on the damage caused to opponents. We propose a new method for RL updates and reward calculations, in which the updates are carried out periodically, after each shooting encounter has ended, and a new weighted-reward mechanism is used which increases the reward applied to actions that lead to damaging the opponent in successive hits in what we term “hit clusters”.","[{'authorId': '2884627', 'name': 'F.

ae6030e638cb2edf474229388bb8651e46fb9936,"ABSTRACT The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) ventral to the genu of the corpus callosum has been implicated in the modulation of emotional behavior on the basis of neuroimaging studies in humans and lesion analyses in experimental animals. In a combined positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging study of mood disorders, we demonstrated that the mean gray matter volume of this “subgenual” ACC (sgACC) cortex is abnormally reduced in subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder, irrespective of mood state. Neuropathological assessments of sgACC tissue acquired postmortem from subjects with MDD or bipolar disorder confirmed the decrement in gray matter volume, and revealed that this abnormality was associated with a reduction in glia, with no equivalent loss of neurons. In positron emission tomography studies, the metabolic activity was elevated in this region in the depressed relative to the remitted phases of the same MDD subjects, and effective antidepressant treatment was associated with a reduction in sgACC activity. Other laboratories replicated and extended these findings, and the clinical importance of this treatment effect was underscored by a study showing that deep brain stimulation of the sgACC ameliorates depressive symptoms in treatment-resistant MDD. This article discusses the functional significance of these findings within the context of the preclinical literature that implicates the putative homologue of this region in the regulation of emotional behavior and stress response. In experimental animals, this region participates in an extended “visceromotor network” of structures that modulates autonomic/neuroendocrine responses and neurotransmitter transmission during the neural processing of reward, fear, and stress. These data thus hold important implications for the development of neural models of depression that can account for the abnormal motivational, neuroendocrine, autonomic, and emotional manifestations evident in human mood disorders.","[{'authorId': '2079241', 'name': 'W.

af19ab2d2ef42d83c9cf5694a53abfbc25beb95d,"BACKGROUND
People with intellectual disability or borderline intellectual functioning may have poorer mental health than their peers. The present authors sought to (i) estimate the risk of poorer mental health among British adults with and without intellectual impairments and (ii) estimate the extent to which any between-group differences in mental health may reflect between-group differences in rates of exposure to common social determinants of poorer health.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The present authors undertook secondary analysis of confidentialized unit records collected in Wave 3 of Understanding Society.


RESULTS
British adults with intellectual impairments living in general households are at significantly increased risk of potential mental health problems than their non-disabled peers (e.g. GHQ Caseness OR = 1.77, 95% CI (1.25-2.52), P < 0.001). Adjusting for between-group differences in age, gender and indicators of socio-economic position eliminated this increased risk [GHQ Caseness adjusted OR = 1.06, 95% CI (0.73-1.52), n.s].


CONCLUSIONS
Our analyses are consistent with the hypothesis that the increased risk of poor mental health among people with intellectual impairments may be attributable to their poorer living conditions rather than their intellectual impairments per se. Greater attention should be given to understanding and addressing the impact of exposure to common social determinants of mental health among marginalized or vulnerable groups.","[{'authorId': '144072791', 'name': 'C.

af7b3323c7f3b80c3da6c0be78a85475aad1354a,"The uncanny valley hypothesis, proposed already in the 1970s, suggests that almost but not fully humanlike artificial characters will trigger a profound sense of unease. This hypothesis has become widely acknowledged both in the popular media and scientific research. Surprisingly, empirical evidence for the hypothesis has remained inconsistent. In the present article, we reinterpret the original uncanny valley hypothesis and review empirical evidence for different theoretically motivated uncanny valley hypotheses. The uncanny valley could be understood as the naïve claim that any kind of human-likeness manipulation will lead to experienced negative affinity at close-to-realistic levels. More recent hypotheses have suggested that the uncanny valley would be caused by artificial–human categorization difficulty or by a perceptual mismatch between artificial and human features. Original formulation also suggested that movement would modulate the uncanny valley. The reviewed empirical literature failed to provide consistent support for the naïve uncanny valley hypothesis or the modulatory effects of movement. Results on the categorization difficulty hypothesis were still too scarce to allow drawing firm conclusions. In contrast, good support was found for the perceptual mismatch hypothesis. Taken together, the present review findings suggest that the uncanny valley exists only under specific conditions. More research is still needed to pinpoint the exact conditions under which the uncanny valley phenomenon manifests itself.","[{'authorId': '48160993', 'name': 'J.

It has been suggested that one reason why obese children stop exercising is the perception of bodily sensations. In a counterbalanced design, a total of 109 children (33 overweight, 10-15 years old) were asked to walk twice for 6 minutes on a treadmill under one of two conditions: (a) traditional condition (TC)-focusing their attention on their physical feelings and sensations or (b) distraction condition (DC)-focusing their attention on a virtual environment. Attentional focus during exercise, bad-good feeling states (pre- and postexperimental), perceived exertion (3 minutes and post), heart rate, and enjoyment were assessed. Results indicated that overweight children focused on internal information under the TC, but they significantly shifted their attention to regard the external environment in the DC. This attentional distraction effect of VR was more intense in overweight than in normal-weight children. No differences between groups were found when examining changes in feeling states and perceived exertion. VR increased enjoyment during exercise, and children preferred exercise using virtual environments. VR is useful to promote distraction and may help overweight and obese children to enjoy exercise.","[{'authorId': '145562686', 'name': 'R.

In this paper, we present an integration of emotions, attachment, and learning in emotional decision‐making to achieve this goal. Based on emerging psychological theories, we aim at building human‐like emotional decision‐making, where emotions play a central role in selecting the next action to be performed by the agent. Here, we present our own approach for emotion appraisal where we use emotional attachment as an important impulse for determining the intensities of emotions. Emotions in their turn are used to calculate the emotional attachment toward the users and for learning to predict future consequences. We report on the results of a simulation evaluation where we assess the influence of emotions, attachment, and learning on decision‐making. It is our strong belief that by giving an agent the ability to have emotions and to feel empathy and emotional attachment toward others, we will ultimately give this agent the ability to learn and improve its social behavior skills through interactions with the users and through user feedback.

In many of these applications, situations arise in which the user has a face-to-face interaction with a virtual agent. In this work, we present an approach for multi-agent navigation that facilitates a face-to-face interaction between a real user and a virtual agent that is part of a virtual crowd. In order to predict whether the real user is approaching a virtual agent to have a face-to-face interaction or not, we describe a model of approach behavior for virtual agents. We present a novel interaction velocity prediction (IVP) algorithm that is combined with human body motion synthesis constraints and facial actions to improve the behavioral realism of virtual agents. We combine these techniques with full-body virtual crowd simulation and evaluate their benefits by conducting a user study using Oculus HMD in an immersive environment. Results of this user study indicate that the virtual agents using our interaction algorithms appear more responsive and are able to elicit more reaction from the users. Our techniques thus enable face-to-face interactions between a real user and a virtual agent and improve the sense of presence observed by the user.","[{'authorId': '3352747', 'name': 'Tanmay Randhavane'}, {'authorId': '2718563', 'name': 'Aniket Bera'}, {'authorId': '1699159', 'name': 'Dinesh Manocha'}]",16.0,,62.0,F2FCrowds: Planning Agent Movements to Enable Face-to-Face Interactions,2017.0

On the basis of a new process conception of emotion regulation, we hypothesized that in low-intensity negative situations, people would show a relative preference to choose to regulate emotions by engagement reappraisal, which allows emotional processing. However, we expected people in high-intensity negative situations to show a relative preference to choose to regulate emotions by disengagement distraction, which blocks emotional processing at an early stage before it gathers force. In three experiments, we created emotional contexts that varied in intensity, using either emotional pictures (Experiments 1 and 2) or unpredictable electric stimulation (Experiment 3). In response to these emotional contexts, participants chose between using either reappraisal or distraction as an emotion-regulation strategy. Results in all experiments supported our hypothesis. This pattern in the choice of emotion-regulation strategies has important implications for the understanding of healthy adaptation.","[{'authorId': '5236984', 'name': 'G.

This paper outlines assumptions of a model on how emotions influence students' learning and achievement. Such effects have been studied empirically for test anxiety, and for positive vs. negative mood. It may be assumed, however, that many other emotions exert effects on performance as well. Assumptions on such influences imply that they may be mediated: (1) by cognitive mechanisms of storage and retrieval of information, of processing information, and of emotion's attentional demands; and (2) by motivational mechanisms of intrinsic and extrinsic academic task motivation. The overall effects of emotions are hypothesised to depend on the interplay of different mechanisms. The net effects of positive emotions are assumed to be positive in most cases, whereas overall effects of negative emotions may be ambivalent. General implications for applied psychological research are described.","[{'authorId': '4862657', 'name': 'R.

b0ab145172b8456d13bddc81c55bc680a73ed10e,"We present an evolutionary game model that integrates the concept of tags, trust and migration to study how trust in social and physical groups influence cooperation and migration decisions. All agents have a tag, and they gain or lose trust in other tags as they interact with other agents. This trust in different tags determines their trust in other players and groups. In contrast to other models in the literature, our model does not use tags to determine the cooperation/defection decisions of the agents, but rather their migration decisions. Agents decide whether to cooperate or defect based purely on social learning (i.e. imitation from others). Agents use information about tags and their trust in tags to determine how much they trust a particular group of agents and whether they want to migrate to that group. Comprehensive experiments show that the model can promote high levels of cooperation and trust under different game scenarios, and that curbing the migration decisions of agents can negatively impact both cooperation and trust in the system. We also observed that trust becomes scarce in the system as the diversity of tags increases. This work is one of the first to study the impact of tags on trust in the system and migration behaviour of the agents using evolutionary game theory.","[{'authorId': '2393606', 'name': 'Sandeep Dhakal'}, {'authorId': '9093838', 'name': 'R.

b0dfdb9a4ff0b013beddc4874fc3d9e1fb68b6e5,"Background: Gambling disorder (GD) is characterized by a significant lack of self-control and is associated with impulsivity-related personality traits. It is also linked to deficits in emotional regulation and frequently co-occurs with anxiety and depression symptoms. There is also evidence that emotional dysregulation may play a mediatory role between GD and psychopathological symptomatology. Few studies have reported the outcomes of psychological interventions that specifically address these underlying processes. Objectives: To assess the utility of the Playmancer platform, a serious video game, as an additional therapy tool in a CBT intervention for GD, and to estimate pre-post changes in measures of impulsivity, anger expression and psychopathological symptomatology. Method: The sample comprised a single group of 16 male treatment-seeking individuals with severe GD diagnosis. Therapy intervention consisted of 16 group weekly CBT sessions and, concurrently, 10 additional weekly sessions of a serious video game. Pre-post treatment scores on South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), I7 Impulsiveness Questionnaire (I7), State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory 2 (STAXI-2), Symptom Checklist-Revised (SCL-90-R), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S-T), and Novelty Seeking from the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R) were compared. Results: After the intervention, significant changes were observed in several measures of impulsivity, anger expression and other psychopathological symptoms. Dropout and relapse rates during treatment were similar to those described in the literature for CBT. Conclusion: Complementing CBT interventions for GD with a specific therapy approach like a serious video game might be helpful in addressing certain underlying factors which are usually difficult to change, including impulsivity and anger expression.","[{'authorId': '2366468', 'name': 'S.

Recent works show that the performance of a FER algorithm can be improved by disentangling the expression information from identity features. In this paper, we present Transfer-based Expression Recognition Generative Adversarial Network (TER-G AN) that combines the effectiveness of a novel feature disentanglement technique with the concept of identity-invariant expression representation learning for FER. More specifically, TER-GAN learns a disentangled expression representation by extracting expression features from one image and transferring the expression information to the identity of another image. To improve the feature disentanglement process and to learn an identity-invariant expression representation, we introduce a novel expression consistency loss and an identity consistency loss that exploit expression and identity information from both real and synthetic images. We evaluated the performance of our proposed facial expression recognition technique by employing four public facial expression databases, CK+, Oulu-CASIA, MMI, BU-3DFE.

b1b8121a043fe95558292dc7a2dc49ace2e33789,"This article presents research conducted to establish how information is shared across the personal social network in the sensitive context of a health crisis. We worked with parents of very sick babies who were cared for in a hospital's Neonatal Unit (NNU). Through a combination of interviews, a focus group, and surveys, we developed a user model of the information that parents wanted to share, and how they adapted this information to individual recipients. We then developed a prototype software tool which created adaptive updates for members of the parents' social network. The updates contained summaries of large volumes of complex medical data about the baby, nonmedical information about the parents, and practical information about the hospital. Updates were automatically adapted to individual members of parents' social networks, based on our user model. The tool was evaluated in a large NNU in the United Kingdom with parents of babies who were currently being cared for in the unit. We found that parents adapted the information that they shared about themselves and their babies based on the emotional proximity of their network members. They gave most detail to those who were emotionally closest to them and least to those who were less close. Parents also adapted information content to the recipient's tendency to worry and empathize. Two adaptive strategies were deployed by parents, (a) benign deceit—not telling the whole truth—and (b) promotion of empathetic members of the social network to a higher level of emotional proximity, so that they were given more information. We generated a number of directions for future work, and issues to consider around designing adaptive mediated communications systems for sensitive contexts. These include the potential to generalize our model to other medical contexts and considerations to apply when deliberately designing deceit into adaptive systems.","[{'authorId': '1758268', 'name': 'Wendy Moncur'}, {'authorId': '145428594', 'name': 'J.

The subject has obsessive compulsive behavior in the form of using a handbody on the sole of the foot repeatedly. Researchers provide interventions in the form of cognitive behavior therapy as interventions to reduce obsessive compulsive behavior, and to improve mental health in schools. This therapy aims to oppose wrong thoughts and emotions by presenting evidence that contradicts beliefs about the problem at hand. The method used in this research is qualitative with a case study approach. Subjects were female who were 16 years old and had obsessive compulsive behavior for 14 months. The cognitive behavior therapy procedure is first, the subject is asked for relaxation in the form of progressivrizkie muscle relaxation to learn to stretch and relax various muscle groups and learn to notice the difference between tension and relax. Second, cognitive restructuring, reducing the anxiety level of the subject caused by negative thoughts and replacing them with more positive thoughts, and. Third, exposure with response prevention, to overcome obsessive compulsive behavior. Where the subject is faced with a situation of having the belief that must perform the usual ritual behavior but the subject is prevented from doing the ritual. If the subject can prevent not doing the ritual and it turns out that something terrible did not happen, this can help in changing the subject's belief in compulsive behavior. The intervention consisted of eight sessions with two sessions a week and 60 minutes each for each session. The results of this study indicate that cognitive behavior therapy is effectively used to reduce the subject's obsessive compulsive behavior, which is shown by decreasing levels of anxiety, negative thinking and compulsive behavior.","[{'authorId': '48434738', 'name': 'S.

A systematic review was conducted (in accordance with PRISMA guidelines) using five databases, two journals and reference lists. Titles and abstracts were screened for inclusion, with relevant studies reviewed in full-text. Initial searches identified 132 articles. Following exclusion of non-relevant studies, seven articles remained for inclusion. Results revealed both telehealth and in-person participants made significant and similar improvements when treatment effects were measured through five of the six outcome measures. Findings showed there is limited but promising evidence to support telehealth for delivering speech-language pathology intervention services to school-age children. Whilst this is encouraging, particularly for rural children where in-person services are limited, more rigorous study designs are required to support the efficacy of telehealth for this population.","[{'authorId': '16808238', 'name': 'Danielle Wales'}, {'authorId': '22582023', 'name': 'Leisa Skinner'}, {'authorId': '39802368', 'name': 'M.

Despite the importance of social networks for health and well-being, relatively little is known about the ways in which adults with intellectual disabilities in the U.K. experience their social networks.


METHOD
A systematic review was completed to identify research focused on the social networks of adults with intellectual disabilities. Studies published from 1990 to 2019 were identified. Studies were thematically analysed.


RESULTS
Quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods studies were analysed to identify key factors influencing social networks. Experiences of people with intellectual disabilities identified themes of identity, powerlessness, inclusion, family and support. These themes are discussed with reference to theories of stigma and normalisation.


CONCLUSIONS
Stigma and normalisation can be used to better understand the needs, desires and dreams of people with intellectual disabilities for ordinary relationships, from which they are regularly excluded. Implications for policy and practice are discussed in relation to building and repairing often spoiled identities.","[{'authorId': '2054696671', 'name': 'R.

A great challenge in this domain is that although the presence of hate speech can be deleterious to the quality of service provided by social platforms, it still comprises only a tiny fraction of the content that can be found online, which can lead to performance deterioration due to majority class overfitting. To this end, we perform a thorough study on the application of deep learning to the hate speech detection problem: a) we propose three text-based data augmentation techniques aimed at reducing the degree of class imbalance and to maximise the amount of information we can extract from our limited resources and b) we apply them on a selection of top-performing deep architectures and hate speech databases in order to showcase their generalisation properties. The data augmentation techniques are based on a) synonym replacement based on word embedding vector closeness, b) warping of the word tokens along the padded sequence or c) class-conditional, recurrent neural language generation. Our proposed framework yields a significant increase in multi-class hate speech detection, outperforming the baseline in the largest online hate speech database by an absolute 5.7% increase in Macro-F1 score and 30% in hate speech class recall.","[{'authorId': '40185455', 'name': 'Georgios Rizos'}, {'authorId': '2121244573', 'name': 'Konstantin Hemker'}, {'authorId': '145411696', 'name': 'Björn Schuller'}]",78.0,,50.0,Augment to Prevent: Short-Text Data Augmentation in Deep Learning for Hate-Speech Classification,2019.0

We investigate two bipartite consensus strategies for the agents such that all the agents converge to a final state characterized by identical modulus but opposite sign.

Lots of countries had closed their schools. As the first country to do so, Chinese colleges and universities were making use of different modes of learning, including online-learning based on different platforms to achieve the goal suggested by Ministry of Education in China, “suspending classes without suspending learning,” since middle February. This paper is the first one which aims to investigate the anxiety of Chinese university students after the outbreak of COVID-19 right before the start of new spring term. 3611 university students (female: male = 1.48:1) aged between 18 to 24 from all over China were enrolled to this study from a top university in China. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale – SAS (Zung, 1971) was used to assess anxiety 2 days before the start of new spring term in middle February. All four-year undergraduate students were included in the study. The mean SAS score was 40.53 (SD = 10.15), significantly higher than the national norm (Mean = 29.78, SD = 10.07, and p ≤ .001), and there were still 557 (15.43%, Mean = 58.75, and SD = 8.9) students met the cutoff of 50 and were screened positive. Comparisons among sexes, grades and majors were also conducted. Significant differences were found between all males and all female (p ≤ .001), and between all students majoring arts and sciences in the anxiety sample (n = 557, p = 0.05). The results also showed that the mean SAS scores were not correlated with the regions they came from/lived in. This study concluded that the Chinese university students showed higher anxiety for COVID-19.","[{'authorId': '1835544364', 'name': 'Chongying Wang'}, {'authorId': '2146229159', 'name': 'Hong Zhao'}]",392.0,,34.0,The Impact of COVID-19 on Anxiety in Chinese University Students,2020.0

b58b5a7bd4ad3dd0d8a821b83acfb9b69196276e,"In this article, we investigate the perception of gender from the motion of virtual humans under different emotional conditions and explore the effect of emotional bias on gender perception (e.g., anger being attributed to males more than females). As motion types can present different levels of physiological cues, we also explore how two types of motion (walking and conversations) are affected by emotional bias. Walking typically displays more physiological cues about gender (e.g., hip sway) and therefore is expected to be less affected by emotional bias. To investigate these effects, we used a corpus of captured facial and body motions from four male and four female actors, performing basic emotions through conversation and walk. We expected that the appearance of the model would also influence gender perception; therefore, we displayed both male and female motions on two virtual models of different sex. Two experiments were then conducted to assess gender judgments from these motions. In both experiments, participants were asked to rate how male or female they considered the motions to be under different emotional states, then classified the emotions to determine how accurately they were portrayed by actors. Overall, both experiments showed that gender ratings were affected by the displayed emotion. However, we found that conversations were influenced by gender stereotypes to a greater extent than walking motions. This was particularly true for anger, which was perceived as male on both male and female motions, and sadness, which was perceived as less male when portrayed by male actors. We also found a slight effect of the model when observing gender on different types of virtual models. These results have implications for the design and animation of virtual humans.","[{'authorId': '1710384', 'name': 'Katja Zibrek'}, {'authorId': '1869571', 'name': 'Ludovic Hoyet'}, {'authorId': '38592832', 'name': 'K.

In posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the stressful film paradigm is a frequently used analogue approach: Films depicting traumatic events are shown to non-clinical participants in order to elicit stress responses analogue to responses to traumatic events in real life. Previous studies used a large variety of films, which is problematic with regard to the comparability of results. The main goal of this study was to identify a film clip that (a) consistently provokes stress reactions and (b) provokes reactions that are as similar as possible to traumatic stress. We randomly exposed 105 male and female participants to one of four stressful films, differing, e.g., in content and origin. Intrusive memories of the film, reported immediately after the film and during a diary phase of three days, as well as distress, heart rate, and several mood states were measured. A film clip depicting rape elicited the most consistent reactions that were characterized by a higher heart rate, more distress and more intrusive memories, compared to the other three clips. Intrusive memories across all films were especially related to an increase in heart rate and disgust in response to the film.","[{'authorId': '32498114', 'name': 'Anke Weidmann'}, {'authorId': '2078473806', 'name': 'Ania Conradi'}, {'authorId': '1696408750', 'name': 'Kathrin Gröger'}, {'authorId': '4907997', 'name': 'L.

b5b6d87f663fcc56cd7319ea49d6baaa653ecaae,"Zusammenfassung Die menschliche Mimik ist einzigartig in ihrer Fähigkeit unseren Emotionen Ausdruck zu verleihen und diese anderen Menschen zu übermitteln. Die mimische Expression grundlegender Emotionen ist über verschiedene Kulturen hinweg sehr ähnlich und du weist auch Gemeinsamkeiten zu anderen Säugetieren auf. Dies deutet auf einen gemeinsamen genetischen Ursprung des Zusammenhangs von Mimik und Emotion. Neuere Untersuchungen zeigen aber auch kulturelle Einflüsse und Unterschiede. Die Erkennung von Emotionen aus der Mimik und auch der Prozess des mimischen Ausdrucks der eigenen Emotionen erfolgt in einem äußerst komplexen zerebralen Netzwerk. Aufgrund der Komplexität des zerebralen Verarbeitungssystems gibt es eine Vielzahl von neurologischen und psychiatrischen Erkrankungen, welche die Kopplung von Mimik und Emotionen erheblich stören können. Auch durch das Tragen von Masken wird unsere Fähigkeit zur Übermittlung und zum Erkennen von Emotionen über die Mimik eingeschränkt. Durch die Mimik lassen sich aber nicht nur „echte“ Emotionen ausdrücken, sondern auch gespielte. Damit eröffnet die Mimik die Möglichkeit sozial erwünschten Ausdruck vorzuspielen und auch Emotionen bewusst vorzutäuschen. Diese Täuschungen sind jedoch zumeist nicht perfekt und können von kurzfristigen Gesichtsbewegungen begleitet sein, die auf die tatsächlich vorhandenen Emotionen hinweisen (Mikroexpressionen). Diese Mikroexpressionen sind von nur sehr kurzer Dauer und vom Menschen häufig kaum wahrnehmbar, jedoch das ideale Anwendungsgebiet für computergestützte Analysen. Diese automatische Identifikation von Mikroexpressionen hat in den letzten Jahren nicht nur wissenschaftliche Aufmerksamkeit erfahren, sondern ihr Einsatz wird auch in sicherheitsrelevanten Bereichen getestet. Der vorliegende Artikel fasst den aktuellen Wissensstand von Mimik und Emotionen zusammen. ABSTRACT Human facial expressions are unique in their ability to express our emotions and communicate them to others. The mimic expression of basic emotions is very similar across different cultures and has also many features in common with other mammals. This suggests a common genetic origin of the association between facial expressions and emotion. However, recent studies also show cultural influences and differences. The recognition of emotions from facial expressions, as well as the process of expressing one’s emotions facially, occurs within an extremely complex cerebral network. Due to the complexity of the cerebral processing system, there are a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders that can significantly disrupt the coupling of facial expressions and emotions. Wearing masks also limits our ability to convey and recognize emotions through facial expressions. Through facial expressions, however, not only “real” emotions can be expressed, but also acted ones. Thus, facial expressions open up the possibility of faking socially desired expressions and also of consciously faking emotions. However, these pretenses are mostly imperfect and can be accompanied by short-term facial movements that indicate the emotions that are actually present (microexpressions). These microexpressions are of very short duration and often barely perceptible by humans, but they are the ideal application area for computer-aided analysis. This automatic identification of microexpressions has not only received scientific attention in recent years, but its use is also being tested in security-related areas. This article summarizes the current state of knowledge of facial expressions and emotions.","[{'authorId': '47016130', 'name': 'C. Klingner'}, {'authorId': '2149403111', 'name': 'O.

It was anticipated that gaze direction would moderate the efficiency of the mental operations through which these social-cognitive products are generated. Specifically, eye gaze was expected to influence both the speed with which targets could be categorized as men and women and the rate at which associated stereotypic material could be accessed from semantic memory. The results of two experiments supported these predictions: Targets with nondeviated (i.e., direct) eye gaze elicited facilitated categorical responses. The implications of these findings for recent treatments of person perception are considered.","[{'authorId': '145929749', 'name': 'C. Macrae'}, {'authorId': '5694798', 'name': 'B.

Notably, emotional abuse was the strongest predictor of emotion deregulation. Mediation analyses indicated that emotion dysregulation partially explained the relationship between physical and emotional abuse and symptoms of posttraumatic stress, suggesting that intervention efforts aimed at improving emotion regulation strategies might be beneficial in decreasing posttraumatic stress among women with child maltreatment histories.","[{'authorId': '48556931', 'name': 'E.

CBIs are based on constructive meditations where imagery abilities are essential. One of the major difficulties that participants report during the training is the difficulty related to imagery abilities. Virtual reality (VR) can be a useful tool to overcome this limitation because it can facilitate the construction and sustainment of mental images. The machine to be another (TMTBA) uses multi-sensory stimulation to induce a body swap illusion. This system allows participants to see themselves from a third perspective and have the illusion of touching themselves from outside. The main objective of the present study was to analyze the efficacy of a self-compassion meditation procedure based on the TMTBA system versus the usual meditation procedure (CAU) in increasing positive affect states, mindful self-care, and adherence to the practice, and explore the influence of imagery abilities as moderators of the effects of the condition on adherence. A sample of 16 participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: TMTBA-VR and CAU. All participants had to listen to an audio meditation about self-compassion and answer questionnaires before and after the training. The TMTBA-VR condition also had a body swap experience at the end of the meditation while listening to self-compassionate messages. Afterward, they were invited to practice this meditation for 2 weeks and then measured again. After the compassion practice, both conditions significantly increased positive qualities toward self/others, decreased negative qualities toward self, and increased awareness and attention to mental events and bodily sensations, with no differences between the conditions. After 2 weeks, both conditions showed a similar frequency of meditation practice and increases in specific types of self-care behaviors, with the frequency of clinical self-care behaviors being significantly higher in TMTBA. Finally, lower imagery ability in the visual and cutaneous modality were moderators of the efficacy of the TMTBA (vs. CAU) condition in increasing adherence to the practice. Embodied VR could be an interesting tool to facilitate and increase the efficacy of CBIs by facilitating the construction of positive and powerful mental images.","[{'authorId': '3325539', 'name': 'A.

Animals with inverted vision caused by eye rotation tend to turn continuously in circles (4, 6, 8). In fishes and amphibians this circling may persist indefinitely with little or no correction by reeducation. Similar circus movement is caused by contralateral transplantation of the eyeball with inversion on only one axis and also by cross-connection of the optic nerves to the wrong side of the brain (7). In all these situations movement on the part of the animal causes the visual image to pass over the retinal field or its central projection in a direction opposite to normal.","[{'authorId': '3168078', 'name': 'R.

b790285740e9f56040de820b048b38dd121cc9b5,"Inspired by psychological and evolutionary studies, we present here theoretical models wherein agents have the potential to express guilt with the ambition to study the role of this emotion in the promotion of pro-social behaviour. To achieve this goal, analytical and numerical methods from evolutionary game theory are employed to identify the conditions for which enhanced cooperation emerges within the context of the iterated prisoners dilemma. Guilt is modelled explicitly as two features, i.e. a counter that keeps track of the number of transgressions and a threshold that dictates when alleviation (through for instance apology and self-punishment) is required for an emotional agent. Such an alleviation introduces an effect on the payoff of the agent experiencing guilt. We show that when the system consists of agents that resolve their guilt without considering the co-player's attitude towards guilt alleviation then cooperation does not emerge. In that case those guilt prone agents are easily dominated by agents expressing no guilt or having no incentive to alleviate the guilt they experience. When, on the other hand, the guilt prone focal agent requires that guilt only needs to be alleviated when guilt alleviation is also manifested by a defecting co-player, then cooperation may thrive. This observation remains consistent for a generalised model as is discussed in this article. In summary, our analysis provides important insights into the design of multi-agent and cognitive agent systems where the inclusion of guilt modelling can improve agents' cooperative behaviour and overall benefit.","[{'authorId': '1747400', 'name': 'L.

It takes place through various considerations such as emotional representation in their behavioral patterns, facial expressions, head pose, body stance, and so on. Deciding on the emotional state of a virtual human at a moment, however, is still a challenge. Computational models of emotion, stemming from appraisal theories, are suggested for modeling emotion in virtual agents. Despite their competence in extracting emotion from appraisal values, they are poorly defined in describing how to assess appraisal values within a sense-think-act behavior model. Motivated by this lack of empirical knowledge on the appraisal stage, in this preliminary work, we propose a framework to bridge the gap between a computational model of emotion and a behavior model of virtual humans. To this end, we use a need-based, goal- oriented, autonomous behavior model to generate salient stimuli for eliciting emotions. Our simulation of a case study suggests that the proposed framework can produce sensible emotional states that conform to the essential principles of appraisal-based emotion theories.","[{'authorId': '9153232', 'name': 'S.

To test this hypothesis, the present study investigated the relation between the emotional responses registered through electrodermal activity (EDA) triggered by human-like point-light displays (PLDs) carrying different facial expressions (neutral, angry, happy) when located in the participants peripersonal or extrapersonal space, and the comfort distance with the same PLDs when approaching and crossing the participants fronto-parallel axis on the right or left side. The results show an increase of the phasic EDA for PLDs with angry facial expressions located in the peripersonal space (reachability judgment task), in comparison to the same PLDs located in the extrapersonal space, which was not observed for PLDs with neutral or happy facial expressions. The results also show an increase of the comfort distance for PLDs approaching the participants with an angry facial expression (interpersonal comfort distance judgment task), in comparison to PLDs with happy and neutral ones, which was related to the increase of the physiological response. Overall, the findings indicate that comfort social space can be predicted from the emotional reaction triggered by a confederate when located within the observer’s peripersonal space. This suggests that peripersonal-action space and interpersonal-social space are similarly sensitive to the emotional valence of the confederate, which could reflect a common adaptive mechanism in specifying theses spaces to subtend interactions with both the physical and social environment, but also to ensure body protection from potential threats.","[{'authorId': '41033515', 'name': 'A.

Participants viewed a confederate partner displaying a neutral expression, non-Duchenne smile, Duchenne smile, or controlled smile, paired with a written statement. Participants then made a behavioral decision based on how credible they perceived the confederate’s statement to be. Compared to a neutral expression, Experiment 1 found that participants were more likely to believe the confederate’s statement when it was paired with a deliberate Duchenne smile and less likely to believe the confederate’s statement when it was paired with a deliberate controlled smile. Experiment 2 replicated these findings with spontaneously emitted expressions.

In this problem, the class of plant parameter perturbations allowed is quite large; in particular, any perturbations in the plant data are allowed as long as the resultant closed-loop system remains stable. A complete characterization of all such robust controllers is made. It is shown that any robust controller must consist of two devices 1) a servocompensator and 2) a stabilizing compensator. The servocompensator is a feedback compensator with error input consisting of a number of unstable subsystems (equal to the number of outputs to be regulated) with identical dynamics which depend on the disturbances and reference inputs to the system. The sorvocompensator is a compensator in its own right, quite distinct from an observer and corresponds to a generalization of the integral controller of classical control theory. The sole purpose of the stabilizing compensator is to stabilize the resultant system obtained by applying the servocompensator to the plant. It is shown that there exists a robust controller for ""almost all"" systems provided that the number of independent plant inputs is not less than the number of independent plant outputs to be regulated, and that the outputs to be regulated are contained in the measurable outputs of the system; if either of these two conditions is not satisfied, there exists no robust controller for the system.","[{'authorId': '144799094', 'name': 'E.

In social psychology, rapport is described as the establishment of a positive relationship among interaction partners by rapidly detecting and responding to each other’s nonverbal behavior (Gratch et al., 2007a). This includes displaying behaviors that indicate positive emotions (such as head nods and smiles), showing mutual attentiveness (such as mutual gaze) and certain coordination behaviors (such as postural mimicry and synchronized movement) (Tickle-Degnan & Rosenthal, 1990). Niewiadomski et al. (2010) reports that when an agent displays appropriate and socially adapted emotional expressions, he is perceived as more human-like than an agent that shows human expressions which are inappropriate or not socially adapted. Garau et al. (2005) conducted a study showing that only participants who interacted with an agent that was responsive to their movements, experienced a sense of personal contact with the agent which influenced them to behave more socially considerate as opposed to interacting with a static or moving but unresponsive agent. This indicates that rapport is an important feature in order for the agent to be perceived as human-like and for any social effects, such as social facilitation, to occur. Previous research on social facilitation/inhibition illustrates how the presence of others affects an individuals’ task performance either positively or negatively (Guerin & Innes, 1982; Zanjonc, 1965; Sanders, Baron & Moore, 1978). Whether or not similar facilitation/inhibition effects occur in presence of virtual agents has been subject to several studies. Rickenberg and Reeves (2000) found that tasks are facilitated or inhibited by the “social” presence of a virtual agent. A study by Zanbaka et al. (2004) indicates that when asked to perform a task, participants reacted similarly to the presence of a virtual agent as they would have in the presence of another human. A follow-up study by Zanbaka et al. (2007) demonstrates that the presence of a virtual agent inhibits the performance of participants on a mathematical task. The limitation of this study was that the sample consisted of only female participants being confronted with an agent of matching gender. Hayes et al. (2010) found a similar decrease in performance with regard Abstract The purpose of the present research is to investigate whether virtual agents can help enhance participants’ performance, effort and motivation in mathematics. We hypothesize that a minimal amount behavioral realism induced by display of rapport is necessary for any social effects to occur in human- computer interaction. Further, we examine whether social facilitation effects occur depending on the gender of the participants and the interacting virtual agents. In a 2x2 between subjects design, participants interacted with a male or female virtual agent that either displayed rapport or no rapport. Our results confirm that gender plays a role when interacting with virtual agents that are capable of establishing rapport. Participants’ performance and effort were significantly enhanced when interacting with an agent of opposite gender that displayed rapport . Our results have implications on designing agents for education and training purposes. Keywords: social facilitation, STEM, rapport, virtual agents Introduction There is considerable interest in factors that enhance science and math performance. Recently, there has been an upsurge of interest in educational technology that exploits social and motivational factors that enhance math performance in general, and reduce gender inequality in particular (Kim, 2004; Baylor & Ryu, 2003). This work builds on the phenomena that people often treat computers as social actors. Therefore, psychological factors that improve people's performance in traditional face-to-face settings can be simulated by technologies in form of virtual learning companions or virtual instructors. In this paper, we seek to address two related goals. First, we aim to show that certain social psychological phenomena can enhance math performance in a human-computer setting. Specifically, we show that a form of social facilitation can improve performance on standardized math tests. Second, we seek to provide further evidence that people do treat computers as social actors and help elucidate the design principles that foster this effect. We specifically demonstrate that virtual agents must possess a minimum level of behavioral realism to achieve any social effects.","[{'authorId': '3364569', 'name': 'Bilge Karacora'}, {'authorId': '145707560', 'name': 'Morteza Dehghani'}, {'authorId': '1455003730', 'name': 'Nicole Krämer-Mertens'}, {'authorId': '145438097', 'name': 'J.

 Social punishment, whereby cooperators punish defectors, has been suggested as an important mechanism that promotes the emergence of cooperation or maintenance of social norms in the context of the one-shot (i.e. non-repeated) interaction. However, whenever antisocial punishment, whereby defectors punish cooperators, is available, this antisocial behavior outperforms social punishment, leading to the destruction of cooperation. In this paper, we use evolutionary game theory to show that this antisocial behavior can be efficiently restrained by relying on prior commitments, wherein agents can arrange, prior to an interaction, agreements regarding posterior compensation by those who dishonor the agreements. We show that, although the commitment mechanism by itself can guarantee a notable level of cooperation, a significantly higher level is achieved when both mechanisms, those of proposing prior commitments and of punishment, are available in co-presence. Interestingly, social punishment prevails and dominates in this system as it can take advantage of the commitment mechanism to cope with antisocial behaviors. That is, establishment of a commitment system helps to pave the way for the evolution of social punishment and abundant cooperation, even in the presence of antisocial punishment.

Growing evidence indicates that a significant proportion of individuals with TBI demonstrate an inability to recognize affective information from the face, voice, bodily movement, and posture. Because accurate interpretation of emotion in others is critical for the successful negotiation of social interactions, effective treatments are necessary.

bac377d3a051899dbe0d7249ed5d3d0b22d57310,"We introduce a new dataset, Human3.6M, of 3.6 Million accurate 3D Human poses, acquired by recording the performance of 5 female and 6 male subjects, under 4 different viewpoints, for training realistic human sensing systems and for evaluating the next generation of human pose estimation models and algorithms. Besides increasing the size of the datasets in the current state-of-the-art by several orders of magnitude, we also aim to complement such datasets with a diverse set of motions and poses encountered as part of typical human activities (taking photos, talking on the phone, posing, greeting, eating, etc.), with additional synchronized image, human motion capture, and time of flight (depth) data, and with accurate 3D body scans of all the subject actors involved. We also provide controlled mixed reality evaluation scenarios where 3D human models are animated using motion capture and inserted using correct 3D geometry, in complex real environments, viewed with moving cameras, and under occlusion. Finally, we provide a set of large-scale statistical models and detailed evaluation baselines for the dataset illustrating its diversity and the scope for improvement by future work in the research community. Our experiments show that our best large-scale model can leverage our full training set to obtain a 20% improvement in performance compared to a training set of the scale of the largest existing public dataset for this problem. Yet the potential for improvement by leveraging higher capacity, more complex models with our large dataset, is substantially vaster and should stimulate future research.

This review takes an evolutionary perspective and characterizes emotion in terms of response tendencies. Emotion regulation is defined and distinguished from coping, mood regulation, defense, and affect regulation. In the increasingly specialized discipline of psychology, the field of emotion regulation cuts across traditional boundaries and provides common ground. According to a process model of emotion regulation, emotion may be regulated at five points in the emotion generative process: (a) selection of the situation, (b) modification of the situation, (c) deployment of attention, (d) change of cognitions, and (e) modulation of responses. The field of emotion regulation promises new insights into age-old questions about how people manage their emotions.","[{'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

Contexts in which relationships are particularly important are described, together with specific benefits (like trust) and task outcomes (like improved learning) known to be associated with relationship quality. We especially consider the problem of designing for long-term interaction, and define relational agents as computational artifacts designed to establish and maintain long-term social-emotional relationships with their users. We construct the first such agent, and evaluate it in a controlled experiment with 101 users who were asked to interact daily with an exercise adoption system for a month. Compared to an equivalent task-oriented agent without any deliberate social-emotional or relationship-building skills, the relational agent was respected more, liked more, and trusted more, even after four weeks of interaction. Additionally, users expressed a significantly greater desire to continue working with the relational agent after the termination of the study. We conclude by discussing future directions for this research together with ethical and other ramifications of this work for HCI designers.","[{'authorId': '1690448', 'name': 'T.

However, functional imaging results cannot definitively establish that a brain area is necessary for a particular cognitive process. This requires evidence from lesion techniques, such as studies of human patients with focal brain damage. Here, we tested 7 patients with lesions in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and 12 healthy individuals in personal moral dilemmas, impersonal moral dilemmas and non-moral dilemmas. Compared to normal controls, patients were more willing to judge personal moral violations as acceptable behaviors in personal moral dilemmas, and they did so more quickly. In contrast, their performance in impersonal and non-moral dilemmas was comparable to that of controls. These results indicate that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is necessary to oppose personal moral violations, possibly by mediating anticipatory, self-focused, emotional reactions that may exert strong influence on moral choice and behavior.","[{'authorId': '3341935', 'name': 'E.

Participants were videotaped as they delivered talks, and their nonverbal behavior and personality were judged from videotapes. Participants' extraversion and masculinity–femininity (M–F) were reliably and accurately judged from videotapes. Judged extraversion correlated significantly with E, and judged M–F correlated most with GD, less with M, but not with F. For women but not men, judged M–F correlated strongly ( r = .67) with judged physical attractiveness. The current research identified nonverbal cues that correlated with judged and assessed extraversion more successfully than it identified cues that correlated with GD, M, F, and judged M–F. M–F proved to be as observable a trait as extraversion, even though it was judged from different kinds of cues.","[{'authorId': '5083408', 'name': 'R.

During the last years a multidisciplinary research team comprised of engineers, psychologists, physiotherapists and paediatricians have been testing these technologies. Throughout the tests, physiological (cardiovascular and metabolic response with biomedical sensors (smart fabrics TIAS) and psychological responses have been collected. The results presented in this paper reflect two main aspects: 1) the feasibility of the monitoring techniques employed and 2) the validity of virtual reality and exergaming technologies as promoters of physical activity and their potential as tools in clinical intervention programs. In the first study (n=90) children, a commercial platform was tested as support tool to aerobic exercise in a treadmill. Results showed a more physiological effort by obese group and limitations to measure effort perception with Borg scale especially in obese group. In second study (n=126) a new VR platform was developed (VREP) and tested as support of aerobic activities, a difference of first study, all the boys completed both conditions (same Aerobic exercise with/without support VR). 59.5% felt that they had to exert more effort in the traditional condition. Regarding to acceptability in both studies the vast majority of the participants liked the idea of combining physical activity with the VR platform as a form of treatment to increase physical activity. The capacity of VR technology to create controllable, multisensory, interactive 3D stimulus environments within which children's performance can be motivated, recorded, and measured, has been tested in these studies, offering clinical assessment and intervention options which are not possible using traditional methods.","[{'authorId': '3077120', 'name': 'J.

Several topics pertaining to Valkyrie's series elastic actuators are presented including control architecture, controller design, and implementation in hardware. A decentralized approach is taken in controlling Valkyrie's many series elastic degrees of freedom. By conceptually decoupling actuator dynamics from robot limb dynamics, the problem of controlling a highly complex system is simplified and the controller development process is streamlined compared to other approaches. This hierarchical control abstraction is realized by leveraging disturbance observers in the robot's joint‐level torque controllers. A novel analysis technique is applied to understand the ability of a disturbance observer to attenuate the effects of unmodeled dynamics. The performance of this control approach is demonstrated in two ways. First, torque tracking performance of a single Valkyrie actuator is characterized in terms of controllable torque resolution, tracking error, bandwidth, and power consumption. Second, tests are performed on Valkyrie's arm, a serial chain of actuators, to demonstrate the robot's ability to accurately track torques with the presented decentralized control approach.","[{'authorId': '2180510', 'name': 'N.

Its fidelity depends in part on the extent to which the VR environment provides a convincing simulation, for example whether a putatively stressful VR situation actually produces a stress response. Methods: We studied the stress response in 28 healthy men exposed either to a stressor VR elevator (which simulated travelling up the outside of a tall building and culminated in the participant being asked to step off the elevator platform), or to a control elevator. We measured psychological and physiological (salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase, blood pressure, pulse, skin conductance) stress indices. We also measured subsequent performance on the N-back task because acute stress has been reported to impact on working memory. Results: Compared to participants in the control elevator, those in the external elevator had increases in skin conductance, pulse and subjective stress and anxiety ratings, altered heart rate variability, and a delayed rise in cortisol. N-back performance was unaffected. Conclusions: A putatively stressful VR elevator produces a physiological as well as a psychological stress response, supporting its use in the investigation and treatment of stress-related disorders, and its potential value as an experimental laboratory stressor.","[{'authorId': '2057229443', 'name': 'M.

One reason for the emotional inexpressiveness of virtual agents is the lack of emotionally expressive gaze manner. For virtual agents to express emotion that observers can empathize with, they need to generate gaze - including eye, head, and torso movement - to arbitrary targets, while displaying arbitrary emotional states. Our previous work [18] describes the Gaze Warping Transformation, a method of generating emotionally expressive head and torso movement during gaze shifts that is derived from human movement data. Through an evaluation, it was shown that applying different transformations to the same gaze shift could modify the affective state perceived when the transformed gaze shift was viewed by a human observer. In this paper we propose a model of realistic, emotionally expressive gaze that builds upon the Gaze Warping Transformation by improving the transformation implementation, and by adding a model of eye movement drawn from the visual neuroscience literature. We describe how to generate a gaze to an arbitrary target, while displaying an arbitrary emotional behavior. Finally, we propose an evaluation to determine what emotions human observers will attribute to the generated gaze shifts. Once this work is completed, virtual agents will have access to a new channel for emotionally expressive behavior.","[{'authorId': '145417478', 'name': 'Brent Lance'}, {'authorId': '1788771', 'name': 'S.

A follow up evaluation study of the perceptions of different forms of alignment in the dialogues reveals that while similarity at polarity, topic and construction levels is viewed positively, similarity at the word level is regarded negatively.

In these experiments we tested the hypothesis that similar physiological responses can be evoked by observing emotional face and body signals and that the reaction to angry signals is amplified in anxious individuals. We designed three experiments in which participants categorized emotional expressions from isolated facial and bodily expressions and emotionally congruent and incongruent face-body compounds. Participants’ fixations were measured and their pupil size recorded with eye-tracking equipment and their facial reactions measured with electromyography. The results support our prediction that the recognition of a facial expression is improved in the context of a matching posture and importantly, vice versa as well. From their facial expressions, it appeared that observers acted with signs of negative emotionality (increased corrugator activity) to angry and fearful facial expressions and with positive emotionality (increased zygomaticus) to happy facial expressions. What we predicted and found, was that angry and fearful cues from the face or the body, attracted more attention than happy cues. We further observed that responses evoked by angry cues were amplified in individuals with high anxiety scores. In sum, we show that people process bodily expressions of emotion in a similar fashion as facial expressions and that the congruency between the emotional signals from the face and body facilitates the recognition of the emotion.","[{'authorId': '2512383', 'name': 'M.

The PSS showed adequate reliability and, as predicted, was correlated with life-event scores, depressive and physical symptomatology, utilization of health services, social anxiety, and smoking-reduction maintenance. In all comparisons, the PSS was a better predictor of the outcome in question than were life-event scores. When compared to a depressive symptomatology scale, the PSS was found to measure a different and independently predictive construct. Additional data indicate adequate reliability and validity of a four-item version of the PSS for telephone interviews. The PSS is suggested for examining the role of nonspecific appraised stress in the etiology of disease and behavioral disorders and as an outcome measure of experienced levels of stress.

These states--called core affect--influence reflexes, perception, cognition, and behavior and are influenced by many causes internal and external, but people have no direct access to these causal connections. Core affect can therefore be experienced as free-floating (mood) or can be attributed to some cause (and thereby begin an emotional episode). These basic processes spawn a broad framework that includes perception of the core-affect-altering properties of stimuli, motives, empathy, emotional meta-experience, and affect versus emotion regulation; it accounts for prototypical emotional episodes, such as fear and anger, as core affect attributed to something plus various nonemotional processes.","[{'authorId': '46367714', 'name': 'J.

Physiological indicators, including EEG (electroencephalogram), blood pressure, skin conductance, and pulse, were monitored in 180 Chinese university students (mean age: 20.72 ± 2.56 years) while they were watching bamboo videos. Before and after watching the videos, their psychological indicators, including positive and negative moods, were measured using the Profile of Mood States questionnaire. After watching the bamboo videos of different durations, all of the physiological indicators responded to the stimulation after only 1 min. The indicators showed different trends at 1, 3 and 5 min. EEG decreased and then was maintained at a stable level after 1 min, and the high β, low β, and α waves had no significant differences between 1, 3 and 5 min. Blood pressure dropped to a stable state after 3 min, and the decline was significantly different greater after 3 min than after 1 min. Skin conductance increased for 1 to 5 min, and it did not stabilize after a long time (5 min). Pulse decreased after 1 min but increased after 5 min. After watching the videos with bamboo of varying structures, the physiological and psychological indicators showed significantly different changes. Skin conductance significantly increased (mean value: 6.78%), and the amount of sweat was more effectively reduced, thereby reducing tension, when the students viewed videos of sympodial bamboo forests compared with monopodial bamboo forests. Bamboo forests with a higher canopy density (0.83–0.85) could significantly decrease α waves (mean value: 1.50 Hz), relaxing the human body. High β and low β waves showed greater decreases, with tension reduced more effectively, when bamboo forests with a low tilt ratio (< 1.5%) were viewed. Bamboo forests with neat undergrowth could have more beneficial physiological and psychological effects on the human body.","[{'authorId': '2108034919', 'name': 'Yuqian Wang'}, {'authorId': '46332956', 'name': 'Mingyan Jiang'}, {'authorId': '2118798532', 'name': 'Yinshu Huang'}, {'authorId': '1705432570', 'name': 'Zhiyi Sheng'}, {'authorId': '2107971005', 'name': 'Xiao Huang'}, {'authorId': '2108810892', 'name': 'Wei Lin'}, {'authorId': '6388016', 'name': 'Qibing Chen'}, {'authorId': '48568342', 'name': 'Xi Li'}, {'authorId': '2111854625', 'name': 'Zhenghua Luo'}, {'authorId': '40908491', 'name': 'Bingyang Lv'}]",14.0,,62.0,Physiological and Psychological Effects of Watching Videos of Different Durations Showing Urban Bamboo Forests with Varied Structures,2020.0

To assess emotional intelligence (EQ) and the construct validity of the EQ Appraisal survey among academic faculty, residents, and medical students.


STUDY DESIGN
From 2007 to 2011, 155 medical education personnel participated in 4 self-administered surveys. The EQ Appraisal survey measures Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness, and Relationship Management. The DISC survey defines 4 personality domains: Dominance, Influence, Steadiness/ Submissiveness, and Conscientious/Compliance. The Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Instrument defines 5 conflict styles: Competing, Collaborating, Compromising, Accommodating, and Avoiding. The Interpersonal Influence Inventory categorizes 4 behavior styles: Openly Aggressive, Assertive, Concealed Aggressive, and Passive behaviors. Statistical analysis was done as indicated. The p value of < 0.05 was taken as significant.


RESULTS
The overall mean EQ score was 75.9 (SD 8.2), and components scores were: Self-Awareness = 74.6 (SD 10), Self-Management = 74.8 (SD 10.6), Social Awareness = 77.0 (SD 9.6), and Relationship Management = 76.8 (SD 9.9). Faculty and residents had higher Social Awareness scores as compared to medical students (79.33 [SD 8] vs. 75.59 [SD 10.3], p = 0.01). Mean EQ scores correlated positively with Collaborating conflict style, Assertive Behavior, Influence, and Steadiness/Submissiveness but correlated negatively with Dominance personality domain, Passive, and Concealed Aggressive behaviors.


CONCLUSION
EQ varied with level of training. EQ competence may occur by Collaborating and Assertive Behaviors utilizing Influence and Steadiness/Submissiveness personality domains.","[{'authorId': '4201213', 'name': 'D.

However, until recently, the impact of emotion regulation difficulties for adolescents and young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has received little attention. We investigated emotion regulation difficulties from the perspective of those who would experience the sequelae. This included parents, teachers, and psychologists. Method Seven focus groups with parents, teachers, and psychologists, and 7 interviews with adolescents and young adults with ASD were conducted. Results Across the groups, participants discussed their triggers of distressing emotions, difficulties with emotional awareness, emotion regulation strategies, and the consequences of their distressing emotions. Both depression and anxiety were perceived as the most experienced distressing issues with the greatest consequences. Conclusions The implications of the themes revealed in the interviews and focus groups are discussed in light in previous literature and may help to inform future interventions.","[{'authorId': '6731644', 'name': 'D.

With a difficult criterion, supportive audiences elicited cautious, protective strategies that were associated with poor performance: Speed decreased without improving accuracy. Despite impairments caused by supportive audiences, performers found supportive audiences more helpful and less stressful than neutral or adversarial audiences, and participants believed (wrongly) that they performed better with a supportive audience.

The second meta-analysis tested whether the standard treatment for social anxiety, which includes in vivo or imaginal exposure, leads to greater effects than virtual reality exposure therapy. The second meta-analysis, consisting of seven studies and 340 total participants, showed essentially no difference in effect sizes between virtual reality exposure and in vivo or imaginal exposure.

Results indicated that achievement at kindergarten entry predicted children's growth for all 3 outcomes. Further, first-grade teachers' strong emotional support related to greater growth in students' phonological awareness.

Finally, the analysis shows how intentions can be adopted relative to a background of relevant beliefs and other intentions or goals.

We are interested in the circumstances under which bystanders are likely to intervene in order to prevent harm to the victim. Immersive virtual reality provides an ecologically valid setting in which to study this issue while at the same time removing the problem of physical danger, and overcoming the many ethical issues involved in the study of violence.

While counseling and psychotherapy can be effective treatments, our knowledge about how to conduct successful counseling conversations has been limited due to lack of large-scale data with labeled outcomes of the conversations. In this paper, we present a large-scale, quantitative study on the discourse of text-message-based counseling conversations. We develop a set of novel computational discourse analysis methods to measure how various linguistic aspects of conversations are correlated with conversation outcomes. Applying techniques such as sequence-based conversation models, language model comparisons, message clustering, and psycholinguistics-inspired word frequency analyses, we discover actionable conversation strategies that are associated with better conversation outcomes.","[{'authorId': '1745524', 'name': 'Tim Althoff'}, {'authorId': '144358401', 'name': 'Kevin Clark'}, {'authorId': '1702139', 'name': 'J.

A substantial body of research has highlighted the evolution of ToM in nonhuman primates, its emergence during human ontogeny, and impaired ToM in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. There is good empirical evidence that ToM is specifically impaired in schizophrenia and that many psychotic symptoms-for instance, delusions of alien control and persecution, the presence of thought and language disorganization, and other behavioral symptoms-may best be understood in light of a disturbed capacity in patients to relate their own intentions to executing behavior, and to monitor others' intentions. However, it is still under debate how an impaired ToM in schizophrenia is associated with other aspects of cognition, how the impairment fluctuates with acuity or chronicity of the schizophrenic disorder, and how this affects the patients' use of language and social behavior. In addition to these potential research areas, future studies may also address whether patients could benefit from cognitive training in this domain.","[{'authorId': '50161801', 'name': 'M.

Despite these successes, accumulating theoretical and craft knowledge has been stymied by the lack of a unified vocabulary to describe these systems and a consequent lack of a framework for understanding their design attributes. We argue that this area would significantly benefit from consensus about the design space of ambient information systems and the design attributes that define and distinguish existing approaches.

Intention recognition enables pro-activeness, in cooperating or promoting cooperation, and in pre-empting danger. Technically, intention recognition can be performed incrementally as you go along, which amounts to learning. Intention recognition can also use past experience from a database of past interactions, not necessarily with the same agent. Bayesian Networks BN can be employed to dynamically summarize general statistical evidence, furnishing heuristic information to link with the situation specific information, about which logical reasoning can take place, and decisions made on actions to be performed, possibly involving actions to obtain new observations. This situated reasoning feeds into the BN to tune it, and back again into the logic component. In this article, we provide a review bearing on the state-of-the-art work on intention and plan recognition, which includes a comparison with our recent research, where we address a number of important issues of intention recognition.

Our results show that the patient was able to solve the conflict and to generate accurate movements to a target in the absence of proprioceptive feedback and with very limited visual feedback from her movements.

However, whether this could be demonstrated using more realistic facial emotion recognition stimuli and applied to autistic females was unclear. In all, 83 females diagnosed with autism spectrum condition completed online self-report measures of autism spectrum condition severity and alexithymia, and afacial emotion recognition deficit that assessed their ability to identify multimodal displays of complex emotions. Higher levels of alexithymia, but not autism spectrum condition severity, were associated with less accurate facial emotion recognition. Difficulty identifying one’s own feelings and externally oriented thinking were the components of alexithymia that were specifically related to facial emotion recognition accuracy. However, alexithymia (and autism spectrum condition severity) was not associated with speed of emotion processing. The findings are primarily discussed with the theoretical view that perceiving and experiencing emotions share the same neural networks, thus being able to recognise one’s own emotions may facilitate the ability to recognise others’. This study is in line with previous similar research on autistic males and suggests impairments in facial emotion recognition in autistic females should be attributed to co-occurring alexithymia. Lay abstract Research with autistic males has indicated that difficulties in recognising facial expressions of emotion, commonly associated with autism spectrum conditions, may instead be due to co-occurring alexithymia (a condition involving lack of emotional awareness, difficulty describing feelings and difficulty distinguishing feelings from physical bodily sensations) and not to do with autism. We wanted to explore if this would be true for autistic females, as well as to use more realistic stimuli for emotional expression. In all, 83 females diagnosed with autism spectrum condition completed self-report measures of autism spectrum condition traits and alexithymia and completed a visual test that assessed their ability to identify multimodal displays of complex emotions. Higher levels of alexithymia, but not autism spectrum condition features, were associated with less accuracy in identifying emotions. Difficulty identifying one’s own feelings and externally oriented thinking were the components of alexithymia that were specifically related to facial emotion recognition accuracy.

The face and the body both normally contribute in conveying the emotional state of the individual. Here we show that observers judging a facial expression are strongly influenced by emotional body language. Photographs of fearful and angry faces and bodies were used to create face-body compound images, with either matched or mismatched emotional expressions. When face and body convey conflicting emotional information, judgment of facial expression is hampered and becomes biased toward the emotion expressed by the body. Electrical brain activity was recorded from the scalp while subjects attended to the face and judged its emotional expression. An enhancement of the occipital P1 component as early as 115 ms after presentation onset points to the existence of a rapid neural mechanism sensitive to the degree of agreement between simultaneously presented facial and bodily emotional expressions, even when the latter are unattended.","[{'authorId': '6702631', 'name': 'H.

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT®) is the most effective treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder, but demand for DBT® far exceeds existing clinical resources. Most patients with BPD never receive DBT®. Incorporating computer technology into the DBT® could help increase dissemination. Immersive Virtual Reality technology (VR) is becoming widely available to mainstream consumers. This case study explored the feasibility/clinical potential of using immersive virtual reality technology to enhance DBT® mindfulness skills training of a 32 year old female diagnosed with BPD. Prior to using VR, the patient experienced difficulty practicing DBT® mindfulness due to her emotional reactivity, and difficulty concentrating. To help the patient focus her attention, and to facilitate DBT® mindfulness skills learning, the patient looked into virtual reality goggles, and had the illusion of slowly “floating down” a 3D computer-generated river while listening to DBT® mindfulness training audios. Urges to commit suicide, urges to self harm, urges to quit therapy, urges to use substances, and negative emotions were all reduced after each VR mindfulness session and VR mindfulness was well accepted/liked by the patient. Although case studies are scientifically inconclusive by nature, results from this feasibility study were encouraging. Future controlled studies are needed to quantify whether VR-enhanced mindfulness training has long term benefits e.g., increasing patient acceptance and/or improving therapeutic outcome.

However, neuropsychological evidence suggests potential impairments in processing emotions in older adults. In the current study, 30 young adults (aged 20-40 years) and 30 older adults (aged 60-80 years) were tested on a range of emotional ability measures. There were no age effects on the ability to decode emotions from verbal material. Older people were less able to identify facial expressions of anger and sadness, and showed poorer ability to identify theory of mind from pictures of eyes. The results indicate specific age-related deficits in identifying some aspects of emotion from faces, but no age effects on the understanding of emotions in verbal descriptions.","[{'authorId': '1994871', 'name': 'L.

Six ASI studies on 2,250 respondents established convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity.

In the present study, we adopted a two-week ecological momentary assessment to explore the association between positive emotions and positive emotion regulation in daily life. According to our results, the less individuals felt positive emotions at one point, the more they tended to enhance their use of positive strategies from this time to the next, which in turn resulted in subsequent higher levels of positive emotions.

This review focuses on social cognition, that is, the capacity to attend to, recognize and interpret interpersonal cues that guide social behavior. Social cognition entails “hot” processes, that is, emotion perception and emotional empathy and “cold” processes, that is, the ability to infer the beliefs, feelings, and intentions of others (theory of mind: ToM) to see their point of view (cognitive empathy) and what they mean when communicating (pragmatic inference). This review critically examines research attesting to deficits in each of these domains and also examines evidence for theorized mechanisms including specific neural networks, the role of simulation, and non-social cognition. Current research is hampered by small, heterogeneous samples and the inherent complexity of TBI pathology. Nevertheless, there is evidence that facets of social cognition are impaired in this population. New assessment tools to measure social cognition following TBI are required that predict everyday social functioning. In addition, research into remediation needs to be guided by the growing empirical base for understanding social cognition that may yet reveal how deficits dissociate following TBI.

Study 2, which examined the effects of automarie stereotype activation on the evaluation of ambiguous stereotype-relevant behaviors performed by a race-unspecified person, suggested that when subjects' ability to consciously monitor stereotype activation is precluded, both high- and low-prejudice subjects produce stereotype-congruent evaluations of ambiguous behaviors.

However, the mechanism through which people judge the multimodal emotional display of these agents is not yet well understood. This study is an attempt to provide a better understanding of the interaction between video and audio channels through the use of a continuous dimensional evaluation framework of valence, activation, and dominance. The results indicate that the congruent audio-visual presentation contains information allowing users to differentiate between happy and angry emotional expressions to a greater degree than either of the two channels individually. Interestingly, however, sad and neutral emotions which exhibit a lesser degree of activation show more confusion when presented using both channels. Furthermore, when faced with a conflicting emotional presentation, users predominantly attended to the vocal channel. It is speculated that this is most likely due to the limited level of facial emotion expression inherent in the current animated face. The results also indicate that there is no clear integration of audio and visual channels in emotion perception as in speech perception indicated by the McGurk effect.

Employment provides an important avenue to social inclusion for most adults. A range of productivity options exist for persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) who wish to work, each offering unique challenges relative to inclusion.


METHODS
This qualitative study examined the productivity experiences of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities in Ontario, Canada. A purposive sample of 74 individuals with productivity experiences spanning the spectrum of no employment to community-based jobs was selected from a pool of volunteers recruited through a mailed survey. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with individuals and family members. Interview transcripts were subjected to a team-based analysis using grounded theory methods.


RESULTS
Varying needs and interests exist in regard to work. Participants revealed a multitude of factors contributing to inclusion and exclusion through productivity.


CONCLUSIONS
Productivity, whether paid or unpaid, can be an avenue to social inclusion.

After a description of the drama domain in a cross- cultural and media setting, we introduce the ontology Drammar. Drammar consists of two components, encoding respectively the conceptual model and the SWRL rules. The conceptual model, mainly grounding in AI theories, represents the major concepts of drama, such as agents, actions, plans, units, emotions and values. Then, the paper focuses on the rule component that augments the representation by mapping the intentions of the characters onto the actions actually performed and by appraising the emotion felt by the characters in the drama. To illustrate the functioning of the ontology we introduce a running example from an excerpt of the drama Hamlet. Finally, we carry out an evaluation of the approach on an annotation task that is relevant for drama studies research and teaching. In particular, the emotion appraisal is tested on the main characters of four dramas of different nature, by computing precision and recall results with respect to a human annotator.","[{'authorId': '152862473', 'name': 'V.

Data were obtained on the general population epidemiology of DSM-III-R posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including information on estimated life-time prevalence, the kinds of traumas most often associated with PTSD, sociodemographic correlates, the comorbidity of PTSD with other lifetime psychiatric disorders, and the duration of an index episode.


METHODS
Modified versions of the DSM-III-R PTSD module from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule and of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview were administered to a representative national sample of 5877 persons aged 15 to 54 years in the part II subsample of the National Comorbidity Survey.


RESULTS
The estimated lifetime prevalence of PTSD is 7.8%. Prevalence is elevated among women and the previously married. The traumas most commonly associated with PTSD are combat exposure and witnessing among men and rape and sexual molestation among women. Posttraumatic stress disorder is strongly comorbid with other lifetime DSM-III-R disorders. Survival analysis shows that more than one third of people with an index episode of PTSD fail to recover even after many years.


CONCLUSIONS
Posttraumatic stress disorder is more prevalent than previously believed, and is often persistent. Progress in estimating age-at-onset distributions, cohort effects, and the conditional probabilities of PTSD from different types of trauma will require future epidemiologic studies to assess PTSD for all lifetime traumas rather than for only a small number of retrospectively reported ""most serious"" traumas.","[{'authorId': '2350669', 'name': 'R.

The nature and consequences of emotion regulation, therefore, are likely to depend on the motives it is intended to serve. Nonetheless, limited attention has been devoted to studying what motivates emotion regulation. By mapping the potential benefits of emotion to key human motives, this review identifies key classes of motives in emotion regulation. The proposed taxonomy distinguishes between hedonic motives that target the immediate phenomenology of emotions, and instrumental motives that target other potential benefits of emotions. Instrumental motives include behavioral, epistemic, social, and eudaimonic motives. The proposed taxonomy offers important implications for understanding the mechanism of emotion regulation, variation across individuals and contexts, and psychological function and dysfunction, and points to novel research directions.","[{'authorId': '2636360', 'name': 'Maya Tamir'}]",410.0,,235.0,Why Do People Regulate Their Emotions?

One of them that is becoming very popular is hand tracking, as the idea to replace controllers for interactions in virtual worlds. This experiment aims to compare different interaction types in VR using either controllers or hand tracking. Participants had to play two simple VR games with various types of tasks in those games — grabbing objects or typing numbers. While playing, they were using interactions with different visualizations of hands and controllers. The focus of this study was to investigate user experience of varying interactions (controller vs. hand tracking) for those two simple tasks. Results show that different interaction types statistically significantly influence reported emotions with Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM), where for hand tracking participants were feeling higher valence, but lower arousal and dominance. Additionally, task type of grabbing was reported to be more realistic, and participants experienced a higher presence. Surprisingly, participants rated the interaction type with controllers where both where hands and controllers were visualized as statistically most preferred. Finally, hand tracking for both tasks was rated with the System Usability Scale (SUS) scale, and hand tracking for the task typing was rated as statistically significantly more usable. These results can drive further research and, in the long term, contribute to help selecting the most matching interaction modality for a task.","[{'authorId': '1390123460', 'name': 'Jan-Niklas Voigt-Antons'}, {'authorId': '51293010', 'name': 'Tanja Kojić'}, {'authorId': '2064469770', 'name': 'Danish Ali'}, {'authorId': '145733288', 'name': 'S.

From neuroscientific evidence, this mechanism is the product of conscious or unconscious processes. In particular, the mechanism generated by a conscious process needs a priori components to be computed. The behaviors generated by previous experiences are among these components. These behaviors need to be adapted to fulfill the objectives in a specific situation. The problem we address is how to endow virtual creatures with emotion regulation in order to compute an appropriate behavior in a specific emotional situation. This problem is clearly important and we have not identified ways to solve this problem in the current literature. In our proposal, we show a way to generate the appropriate behavior in an emotional situation using a learning classifier system (LCS). We illustrate the function of our proposal in unknown and known situations by means of two case studies. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to converge to the appropriate behavior even in the first case; that is, when the system does not have previous experiences and in situations where some previous information is available our proposal proves to be a very powerful tool.","[{'authorId': '36478575', 'name': 'Jonathan-Hernando Rosales'}, {'authorId': '145956015', 'name': 'Félix F.

To better understand the neuroscience of immoral behaviour, this review investigates two clinical populations that commonly present with changes in moral behaviour - behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia and acquired brain injuries. Based on evidence from these groups, it is argued that rather than a single underlying cause, immoral behaviour can result from three distinct types of cognitive failure: (1) problems understanding others; (2) difficulties controlling behaviour; or (3) deficits in the capacity to make appropriate emotional contributions. Each of these failures is associated with damage to different brain regions.

Throughout the model's approach, HR showed a signiﬁcant triphasic change (an initial decrease, a subsequent increase, and then a secondary decrease), whereas subjective feelings of anxiety and tension showed signiﬁcant, gradual increases. These trends were similar to those of Yaezawa and Yoshida’s. Nonetheless, their explanation that the triphasic change in HR reﬂected once hightened and then relieved tension, which was incongruent with the subjective ratings, seemed questionable. As the BP elevated to a moderate degree in spite of the modest HR changes, total peripheral resistance must have been increasing during the model's approach.

While stylistic control has traditionally relied on handcrafted rules, statistical methods are likely to be needed for generation systems to scale to the production of the large range of variation observed in human dialogues. Previous work on statistical natural language generation (SNLG) has shown that the grammaticality and naturalness of generated utterances can be optimized from data; however these data-driven methods have not been shown to produce stylistic variation that is perceived by humans in the way that the system intended. This paper describes Personage, a highly parameterizable language generator whose parameters are based on psychological findings about the linguistic reflexes of personality. We present a novel SNLG method which uses parameter estimation models trained on personality-annotated data to predict the generation decisions required to convey any combination of scalar values along the five main dimensions of personality.

In recent years, however, there have been growing efforts to use automated, data-driven approaches to find patterns of nonverbal behaviors in video corpora and even thereby discover new factors that have not been previously documented. However, there have been few studies that compare how the behaviors generated by different approaches are interpreted by people. In this paper, we present an evaluation study to compare the perception of nonverbal behaviors, more specifically head nods, generated by different approaches. Studies have shown that head nods serve a variety of communicative functions and that the head is in constant motion during speaking turns. To evaluate the different approaches of head nod generation, we asked human subjects to evaluate videos of a virtual agent displaying nods generated by a human, by a machine learning data-driven approach, or by a hand-crafted rule-based approach. Results show that there is a significant effect on the perception of head nods in terms of appropriate nod occurrence, especially between the data-driven approach and the rule-based approach.","[{'authorId': '9174234', 'name': 'Jina Lee'}, {'authorId': '2109046177', 'name': 'Zhiyang Wang'}, {'authorId': '1788771', 'name': 'S.

Multilevel models are used with data from the British Household Panel Survey and the Census of UK population to assess the nature and extent of variations in happiness and well-being to determine the relative importance of the area (district, region), household, and individual characteristics on these outcomes. Having taken into account the characteristics at these different levels, we are able to determine whether any areas are associated with especially positive or negative feelings of happiness and well-being. Whilst we find that most of the variation in happiness and well-being is attributable to the individual level, some variation in these measures is also found at the household and area levels, especially for the measure of well-being, before we control for the full set of individual, household, and area characteristics.

However so far the recognition of facial emotions is mainly addressed by computer vision researchers, based on facial display. Also detection of vocal expressions of emotions can be found in research work done by acoustic researchers. Most of these research paradigms are devoted purely to visual or purely to auditory human emotion detection. However we found that it is very interesting to consider both these auditory and visual information together, for processing, since we hope this kind of multi-modal information processing will become a datum of information processing in future multimedia era. By several intensive subjective evaluation studies we found that human beings recognise anger, happiness, surprise and dislike by their visual appearance, compared to voice only detection. When the audio track of each emotion clip is dubbed with a different type of auditory emotional expression, still anger, happiness and surprise were video dominant. However the dislike emotion gave mixed responses to different speakers. In both studies we found that sadness and fear emotions were audio dominant. As a conclusion, we propose a method of facial emotion detection by using a hybrid approach, which uses multi-modal information for facial emotion recognition.","[{'authorId': '2220211943', 'name': 'L.

Frequency and duration of peer interaction behaviours were coded. In terms of duration, multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) indicated that participants with ASD spent more time engaged in solitary behaviours, less time engaged in co-operative interaction with peers, and more time engaging in reactive aggression towards peers than either comparison group. In terms of frequency, similar patterns emerged, but additionally participants with ASD engaged in fewer instances of rough/vigorous play, and were subject to more instances of social initiation and instrumental verbal aggression by peers than either comparison group.

Boredom is considered as a main unpleasant emotional state at the workplace, which could lead to stress, depression and decreased well-being. Boredom is related to the situation at hand and may lead to decreased performance. We frame the situation by connecting socio-emotional and cognitive conflict and individual differences to shed light onto the function of boredom. We look at the relation of boredom to theoretically connected emotions and their regulation. We conducted an online experiment in a virtual workplace setting (N = 57). We induced a socio-emotional and cognitive conflict situation by using a socially interactive agent which shames participants. Individual differences were operationalised through social identity and self-consciousness. We tested how social identity (predictor) and self-consciousness (moderator) influence cognitive appraisal of threat (mediator) and boredom (outcome). The results revealed that self-consciousness moderates the effect of social identity on cognitive appraisal of threat which then mediates the effect of social identity on boredom.","[{'authorId': '2149701012', 'name': 'Lara Chehayeb'}, {'authorId': '1722662', 'name': 'Dimitra Tsovaltzi'}, {'authorId': '31428092', 'name': 'Rhythm Arora'}, {'authorId': '48785659', 'name': 'Patrick Gebhard'}]",0.0,"{'name': '2021 9th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction Workshops and Demos (ACIIW)', 'pages': '1-8'}",0.0,"Individual Differences and the Function of Emotions in Socio-Emotional and Cognitive Conflict: If an Agent Shames you, will you still be Bored?",2021.0

Classrooms with warm teacher-child relationships support deep learning and positive social and emotional development among students, writes Kimberly Schonert-Reichl. But when teachers poorly manage the social and emotional demands of teaching, students' academic achievement and behavior both suffer. If we don't accurately understand teachers' own social-emotional wellbeing and how teachers influence students' SEL, says Schonert-Reichl, we can never fully know how to promote SEL in the classroom.How can we boost teachers' social-emotional competence, and how can we help them create the kind of classroom environment that promotes students' SEL? Teachers are certainly at risk for poor social-emotional wellbeing. Research shows that teaching is one of the most stressful occupations; moreover, stress in the classroom is contagious—simply put, stressed-out teachers tend to have stressed-out students. In the past few years, several interventions have specifically sought to improve teachers' social-emotional competence and stress management in school, and Schonert-Reichly reviews the results, many of which are promising.She also shows how teachers' beliefs—about their own teaching efficacy, or about whether they receive adequate support, for example—influence the fidelity with which they implement SEL programs in the classroom. When fidelity is low, SEL programs are less successful. Finally, she examines the extent to which US teacher education programs prepare teacher candidates to promote their own and their students' social-emotional competence, and she argues that we can and should do much more.","[{'authorId': '1402084899', 'name': 'K.

Drawing together the threads of current research on the nature and funactions of emotional expression, of physiological reactions, and of emotional experience, this book offers a balanced survey of facts and theory. Nico Frijda discusses the motivational and neurophysiological preconditions for emotions, and the ways in which emotions are regulated by the individual. Considering the kinds of events that elicit emotions, he argues that emotions arise because events are appraised by people as favorable or harmful to their own interests. he takes an information-processing perspective: Emotions are viewed as outcomes of the process of assessing the world in terms of one's own concerns, which, in turn, modify action readiness. This analysis leads him to address such fundamental issues as the place of emotion in motivation generally and the discrepancy between the functions of the emotions and their often irrational and disruptive character.

As the strive for realism continues, there is a need to investigate the effect of photorealism on users’ perception, particularly for interactive, emotional scenarios in VR. In this article, we explored three main topics, where we predicted photorealism will make a difference: the illusion of being present with the virtual person and in an environment, altered emotional response toward the character, and a subtler response—comfort of being in close proximity to the character. We present a perceptual experiment, with an interactive expressive virtual character in VR, which was designed to induce particular social responses in people. Our participant pool was large (N = 797) and diverse in terms of demographics. We designed a between-group experiment, where each group saw either the realistic rendering or one of our stylized conditions (simple and sketch style), expressing one of three attitudes: Friendly, Unfriendly, or Sad. While the render style did not particularly effect the level of comfort with the character or increase the illusion of presence with it, our main finding shows that the photorealistic character changed the emotional responses of participants, compared to the stylized versions. We also found a preference for realism in VR, reflected in the affinity and higher place illusion in the scenario, rendered in the realistic render style.","[{'authorId': '1710384', 'name': 'Katja Zibrek'}, {'authorId': '47361874', 'name': 'Seán J.

Existing emergencies have shown that individuals are easy to be influenced by others' emotion during the evacuation. This will make it easier for people to aggregate together and increase security risks. Some of the existing evacuation models without considering emotion are therefore not suitable for describing crowd behaviors in emergencies. We propose a perception‐based emotion contagion model and use multiagent technology to simulate crowd behaviors. Navigation points are introduced to guide the movement of the agents. Based on the proposed model, a prototype simulation system for crowd emotion contagion is developed. The comparative simulation experiments verify that the model can effectively deduct the evacuation time and crowd emotion contagion.

We describe a new rating scale to assess resilience. The Connor‐Davidson Resilience scale (CD‐RISC) comprises of 25 items, each rated on a 5‐point scale (0–4), with higher scores reflecting greater resilience. The scale was administered to subjects in the following groups: community sample, primary care outpatients, general psychiatric outpatients, clinical trial of generalized anxiety disorder, and two clinical trials of PTSD. The reliability, validity, and factor analytic structure of the scale were evaluated, and reference scores for study samples were calculated. Sensitivity to treatment effects was examined in subjects from the PTSD clinical trials. The scale demonstrated good psychometric properties and factor analysis yielded five factors. A repeated measures ANOVA showed that an increase in CD‐RISC score was associated with greater improvement during treatment. Improvement in CD‐RISC score was noted in proportion to overall clinical global improvement, with greatest increase noted in subjects with the highest global improvement and deterioration in CD‐RISC score in those with minimal or no global improvement. The CD‐RISC has sound psychometric properties and distinguishes between those with greater and lesser resilience. The scale demonstrates that resilience is modifiable and can improve with treatment, with greater improvement corresponding to higher levels of global improvement.

These multiple representations encode locations and objects of interest in several egocentric reference frames. Stimulus representations are transformed from the coordinates of receptor surfaces, such as the retina or the cochlea, into the coordinates of effectors, such as the eye, head, or hand. The transformation is accomplished by dynamic updating of spatial representations in conjunction with voluntary movements. This direct sensory-to-motor coordinate transformation obviates the need for a single representation of space in environmental coordinates. In addition to representing object locations in motoric coordinates, parietal neurons exhibit strong modulation by attention. Both top-down and bottom-up mechanisms of attention contribute to the enhancement of visual responses. The saliance of a stimulus is the primary factor in determining the neural response to it. Although parietal neurons represent objects in motor coordinates, visual responses are independent of the intention to perform specific motor acts.","[{'authorId': '1890313', 'name': 'C.

There has additionally been an increase in depression due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Behavioral activation is considered an evidence-based treatment for MDD. However, there are many barriers that could hinder one’s ability to engage in behavioral activation, with COVID-19 “shelter-in-place” and social distancing orders being current and large impediments. Virtual reality (VR) has been successfully used to help treat a variety of mental health conditions, but it has not yet been used as a method of administering behavioral activation to a clinical population. Using VR to engage in behavioral activation could eliminate barriers that pandemic precautions place and help decrease symptoms of depression that are especially exacerbated in these times. Objective The following case report examines the feasibility, acceptability, and tolerability of VR behavioral activation for an adult with MDD during a global pandemic. This participant was part of a larger pilot study, and the case serves as a description of the VR intervention. Methods The participant engaged in a weekly 50-minute psychotherapy Zoom session for 4 weeks, in which a modified behavioral activation protocol was administered using a VR headset to simulate activities. Data on mood ratings, homework compliance, and headset use were obtained from the headset. Acceptability, tolerability, and depression symptoms were obtained using self-report rating scales. Results The intervention was feasible, acceptable, and tolerable, as reported by this participant. The participant’s depressive symptoms decreased by five-points on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 over a month, with a beginning score of 10 (moderate depression) and a final score of 5 (mild depression).

El maltrato se clasifica como fisico, fisico grave, emocional, negligencia y abuso sexual. La prevalencia del maltrato se ha reportado en estudios epidemiologicos (4.5% a 21%) y en estudios de poblacion clinica (6% a 48%) realizados en varios paises. En Mexico la encuesta de maltrato infantil y factores asociados reporto una prevalencia del maltrato de 16% a 20%, siendo el maltrato fisico, el maltrato fisico grave y el maltrato emocional los mas frecuentes. El maltrato infantil es un problema multicausal. Dentro de los factores familiares asociados al maltrato se han mencionado la desintegracion familiar, la violencia entre los padres y el menor nivel educativo de estos. La psicopatologia se ha reportado en 9% de los ninos y adolescentes maltratados, mencionandose al maltrato como predictor de esta. Se ha encontrado mayor frecuencia de trastornos afectivos, ansiosos, conductuales y de abuso de sustancias en sujetos victimas de maltrato cronico. Los objetivos del presente trabajo fueron determinar la frecuencia y tipos de maltrato reportados por pacientes adolescentes con psicopatologia y determinar la frecuencia de los factores demograficos y de funcionamiento familiar que se han asociado al maltrato en estos pacientes. Metodo El diseno del estudio fue transversal y descriptivo. La muestra incluyo adolescentes de 13 a 17 anos de ambos sexos, usuarios de los servicios de consulta externa, urgencias y hospitalizacion del Hospital Psiquiatrico Infantil «Dr. Juan N. Navarro». Los pacientes fueron evaluados con la Entrevista Semiestructurada para Adolescentes para obtener el diagnostico y contestaron la Encuesta de Maltrato Infantil, que incluye apartados para determinar la presencia de maltrato, las creencias del sujeto acerca del mismo, antecedentes de patologia en el adolescente, caracteristicas de la estructura y nivel socioeconomico familiar y su estilo para solucionar conflictos. Se utilizo estadistica descriptiva para el analisis de datos. Resultados: La muestra se conformo de un total de 100 pacientes (50% hombres, edad promedio 14.79±1.60 anos), 56% pertenecia a una familia integrada. Para ambos padres el nivel de escolaridad mas frecuentemente reportado fue de secundaria, 22% reporto violencia entre sus padres. Los diagnosticos mas frecuentemente encontrados fueron episodio depresivo mayor (61%), trastorno por deficit de atencion e hiperactividad (TDAH)(39%), trastorno disocial (31%), abuso de sustancias (31%) y trastornos de ansiedad (17%).Las frecuencias reportadas de los diferentes tipos de maltrato fueron: maltrato emocional 77%, maltrato fisico 41%, negligencia8% y abuso sexual 24%. La madre perpetro el abuso fisico y emocional con mayor frecuencia. Los pacientes con TDAH y trastorno disocial reportaron las frecuencias mas altas de todos los tipos de abuso, los adolescentes con diagnostico de abuso de sustancias tambien reportaron alta frecuencia de abuso emocional. El abuso sexual fue reportado con frecuencia similar por los pacientes con trastornos afectivos, de conducta y por uso de sustancias. Al preguntar a los pacientes las razones por las que sus padres los golpeaban, la desobediencia y la falta de respeto fueron las razones mas frecuentemente reportadas; el maltrato tambien se atribuyo a que los padres estuvieran nerviosos o hubieran consumido sustancias psicoactivas, siendo estas razones mas frecuentemente expuestas por los adolescentes con diagnostico de abuso de sustancias. Conclusiones: La muestra estudiada de adolescentes reporto frecuencias elevadas de maltrato y abuso sexual.

d012997e58d38de3f26ef75ae2fab0ad91ae102c,"Collaboration is often a necessity in order to reach one's goals in society, organizations, or among individuals. Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs) can be used as a medium supporting communication and interaction between people. By allowing real-time co-work with graphical representations, they offer new possibilities to facilitate collaboration. 
Yet, while the use of CVEs is continuously increasing, there is still little research on understanding the consequences of using them or about their usability. By reviewing previous research, we can see that existing studies have focused almost exclusively on improving technical aspects for these environments. Problems originating from multiple users and the collaborative characteristics associated with the technology have been neglected. This thesis addresses these problems. 
The empirical background consists of five experimental studies that comparatively evaluated different CVE technologies and applications. The first three studies used quantitative evaluations to show how new immersive technologies, where the projected environments surround the users, have both benefits and drawbacks for use in comparison to desktop systems or for working with full-scale models. The evaluation focused on users' experiences and on their performance. It was found that although immersive technologies provided greater presence, effectiveness varied more with the tasks than with the technology used. The symmetry or asymmetry in the distributed settings was also found to have a major impact on effectiveness. 
The methods used for the first three studies were found to have certain limitations in analyzing collaboration. In the other two studies additional methods were therefore developed for identifying successes and failures in interaction with the technology, and social interaction. By focusing on social interaction, interaction via technology and problem solving separately, small sequences of successes and failures during collaboration were analyzed. Many of these sequences can be considered as patterns since they recurred during several tasks. The results show that problems, particularly in social interaction, have an impact on the efficiency of interaction via technology, and vice versa. Adding problem solving as a third process provides a means of developing a systematic evaluation framework. This framework, moreover, includes both qualitative and quantitative analyses. 
The findings presented in this thesis contribute to developing better usability evaluation methods for CVEs, and hence to the design of new CVEs. The results from the comparative evaluations from the experiments can be used to examine the social implications of using CVEs and also to support the selection and practical use of different types of CVE.","[{'authorId': '2124792', 'name': 'I.

d014111c79b8a519d25d79b1c311e1745bc3d74f,"The research presented in this thesis concerns the contribution of different levels of virtual human (or ‘avatar’) fidelity to social interaction in virtual environments (VEs). VEs present new possibilities for mediated communication by placing people in a shared 3D context. However, there are technical constraints in creating photorealistic and behaviourally realistic avatars capable of mimicking a person’s actions or intentions in real time. At the same time, previous research findings indicate that virtual humans can elicit social responses even with minimal cues, suggesting that full realism may not be essential for effective social interaction. This research explores the lower boundaries of fidelity by investigating how different levels of responsiveness, photorealism and behavioural realism affect people’s experience of interacting with virtual humans. The research presented comprises three between-group experiments involving over 200 participants. The experiments focus on distinct but interrelated questions. In the first experiment, conducted in an immersive Cave-like system, participants explored a library containing a group of seated virtual readers. The aim was to investigate the degree to which the virtual humans were responded to as social entities as their responsiveness increased across the conditions. Results indicated that responsiveness significantly affected a range of responses, including the degree of sentience attributed to the agents. The findings signalled the need to further define the different social responses affected by virtual humans. Participants’ heart rate and electrodermal activity were also recorded to explore the possibility of employing objective measures to study responses to virtual humans. The remaining two experiments focused on behavioural realism and photorealism in the context of mediated communication between pairs of human participants. In the second experiment, participants interacted via a video-tunnel that provided them with a head-and-shoulders view of an avatar representing their conversation partner. Analysis of questionnaire responses indicated that the avatar whose gaze behaviour was inferred from conversational turntaking significantly outperformed the visually identical, but behaviourally less realistic, random-gaze avatar. An in-depth qualitative analysis of the interview responses yielded a theoretical model of the possible effects of avatar appearance and behaviour on perceptions of the communication","[{'authorId': '11554704', 'name': 'Maia Garau'}, {'authorId': '1752753', 'name': 'Dirk Weirich'}]",82.0,,172.0,The Impact of Avatar Fidelity on Social Interaction in Virtual Environments,2003.0
d01844be99a596da730fb3e96a6de3c17637a2e4,"Although player enjoyment is central to computer games, there is currently no accepted model of player enjoyment in games. There are many heuristics in the literature, based on elements such as the game interface, mechanics, gameplay, and narrative. However, there is a need to integrate these heuristics into a validated model that can be used to design, evaluate, and understand enjoyment in games. We have drawn together the various heuristics into a concise model of enjoyment in games that is structured by flow. Flow, a widely accepted model of enjoyment, includes eight elements that, we found, encompass the various heuristics from the literature. Our new model, GameFlow, consists of eight elements -- concentration, challenge, skills, control, clear goals, feedback, immersion, and social interaction. Each element includes a set of criteria for achieving enjoyment in games. An initial investigation and validation of the GameFlow model was carried out by conducting expert reviews of two real-time strategy games, one high-rating and one low-rating, using the GameFlow criteria. The result was a deeper understanding of enjoyment in real-time strategy games and the identification of the strengths and weaknesses of the GameFlow model as an evaluation tool. The GameFlow criteria were able to successfully distinguish between the high-rated and low-rated games and identify why one succeeded and the other failed. We concluded that the GameFlow model can be used in its current form to review games; further work will provide tools for designing and evaluating enjoyment in games.","[{'authorId': '1789962', 'name': 'P.

Para este propósito se definieron tres objetivos específicos: 1) identificar cuáles situaciones o condiciones del ambiente académico resultan más estresantes, 2) caracterizar las reacciones fisiológicas, psicológicas y comportamentales, y 3) conocer las estrategias de afrontamiento más frecuentes.
Método: se desarrolló una investigación con enfoque cuantitativo, transversal y de nivel descriptivo con una muestra de 450 estudiantes de tres universidades de Medellín y el Valle de Aburrá (dos instituciones privadas y una pública) utilizando el Inventario SISCO del Estrés Académico.
Resultados: para la categoría Situaciones y condiciones estresantes, el ítem con más porcentaje en la clasificación alto fue el de Sobrecarga de tareas y trabajos escolares. Para la categoría Reacciones físicas, el ítem con más porcentaje en la clasificación alto fue el de Inquietud (este ítem presentó diferencias según la edad). Para la categoría Reacciones psicológicas, el ítem con más porcentaje en la clasificación alto fue el de Somnolencia o mayor necesidad de dormir. Para la categoría Reacciones comportamentales, el ítem con más porcentaje en la clasificación alto fue el de Aumento o reducción del consumo de alimentos(este ítem presentó diferencias según el semestre). Para la categoría Estrategias de afrontamiento, el ítem con más porcentaje en la clasificación alto fue el de Habilidad asertiva.
Discusión: este conjunto de reacciones no hará más que menguar y perjudicar la capacidad intelectual y el desempeño académico de los estudiantes y, en muchos casos, el estrés académico (en conjunción con otras problemáticas) podría derivar en fracaso y deserción.

d21792b581d5dd504c6c6344cbba417155f7aa55,"For more than a century, empathy has been a central topic in the study of human emotion. It plays a crucial role in our everyday social life, having implications for the survival of the species. In the case of agents that inhabit virtual worlds and interact socially among each other and with humans, empathy has also been considered to be an important mechanism to promote engaging and believable interactions. However, creating empathic agents, until recently, has been accomplished mostly through the implementation of specific empathic behaviors or by using domain-dependent empirical models. In this article, we propose a generic computational model of empathy that is grounded on recent psychological theories about empathy. The proposed model treats empathy as a process in which the intensity of the empathic response is modulated by a set of factors that involve the relationship between the agents of the empathic interaction, namely, the similarity and affective link, as well as some characteristics of the empathizer agent, such as mood and personality. This model was implemented into an affective agent architecture, which was then used in an evaluation that had 77 participants. The results indicate that our empathy model, when used to simulate a social scenario with a small group of agents, significantly changed the way that the users perceived and described the interactions between those agents.","[{'authorId': '2997654', 'name': 'Sérgio Hortas Rodrigues'}, {'authorId': '145689493', 'name': 'S.

This chapter provides an overview of the state of the art in technology-supported resilience training for military professionals, which has considerable common ground with the interdisciplinary field of human computer confluence (HCC). The effectiveness of these technologies and the resilience strategies they support are reviewed through the literature.","[{'authorId': '1686887269', 'name': 'J.

After formulating the problem, we extend the concept of the virtual regulated output from the unsigned digraph to the signed digraph.

We then show that, under some standard conditions, the problem can be converted into the distributed stabilisation problem of the ancillary augmented system, thus leading to the solvability of the problem.

d325cb336f74cc884dcd311e0703b48ccee63da2,"Abstract With emerging technology, computerised, internet-based and virtual reality (VR)-based treatment and training became increasingly popular. VR provides an immersive experience into a simulated environment. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterised by social communication deficits and repetitive behaviours. Children with ASD often require social skills training while VR provides a safe, controllable environment to practice skills repeatedly. The Centre for Innovative Applications of Internet and Multimedia Technologies (AIMTech Centre) at City University of Hong Kong developed a VR-enabled training program to examine its efficacy on emotional and social skills with six VR scenarios depicting the daily lives of typical children in Hong Kong. 94 children from mainstream primary schools in Hong Kong completed the study and 72 children were included in the analysis. Children from training group scored higher on emotion expression and regulation (M = 20.2, SD = 3.00) than before the training (M = 18.9, SD = 3.57, t(35) = −2.174, p = .037) and higher on social interaction and adaptation after the training (M = 21.8, SD = 2.99) than before training (M = 20.2, SD = 3.43, t(35) = −3.987, p < .0005). There was a statistically significant interaction between group and time on affective expressions, F(1, 70) = 5.223, p = .025, partial η2 = .069, and on social reciprocity, F(1, 70) = 7.769, p = .007, partial η2 = .100. Children were able to engage in VR training despite initial challenges with viewing goggles. Some children declined to participate due to scheduling reasons which may be minimised through the adoption of head-mounted displays as a portable, cost-effective device. VR seems to be a promising asset to traditional training and therapy while the importance trainers’ or therapists’ support has yet to be further investigated.","[{'authorId': '46262782', 'name': 'Sze Ngar Vanessa Yuan'}, {'authorId': '1687108', 'name': 'H.

The purpose of the current pilot study was to evaluate the acceptability and preliminary impact of using immersive virtual reality environments (IVREs) paired with a brief emotion regulation and risk reduction intervention (ER + IVRE) relative to this same intervention content paired with role-plays (ER + RP).


METHODS
Eighty-five adolescents attending middle school (grades 6th-8th; ages 12-15 years) in an urban northeast city were recruited and randomized to ER + IVRE (n = 44) or ER + RP (n = 41) and had complete data. Data examining acceptability, feasibility, sexual knowledge and attitudes, and ER were collected at baseline and 3 months after intervention completion. Analyses of covariance controlling for baseline scores were used to evaluate study outcomes. Within and between intervention effect sizes were calculated with effect sizes ≥.20 considered meaningful.


RESULTS
At the 3-month follow-up assessment, several within intervention condition effect sizes were found to exceed d = 0.20 across the measured sexual attitudes and ER outcomes. Between intervention analyses found that adolescents randomized to ER + IVRE attended more intervention sessions, reported less difficulty accessing ER strategies (d = 0.46), and reported higher emotional self-efficacy (d = 0.20) at the 3-month follow-up relative to adolescents randomized to the ER + RP intervention.


CONCLUSIONS
This study provides preliminary evidence that using virtual reality environments to enhance ER skill building in risk situations was acceptable, feasible to deliver, and positively impacted ER abilities.","[{'authorId': '5289052', 'name': 'Wendy S Hadley'}, {'authorId': '4428663', 'name': 'Christopher Houck'}, {'authorId': '145978180', 'name': 'L.

We introduce governance as the administration of such a system by the stakeholders themselves. In this regard, governance is a peer-to-peer notion and contrasts with traditional management, which is a top-down hierarchical notion. Traditionally, there is no computational support for governance and it is achieved through out-of-band interactions among system administrators. Not surprisingly, traditional approaches simply do not scale up to large sociotechnical systems. We develop an approach for governance based on a computational representation of norms in organizations. Our approach is motivated by the Ocean Observatory Initiative, a thirty-year $400 million project, which supports a variety of resources dealing with monitoring and studying the world's oceans. These resources include autonomous underwater vehicles, ocean gliders, buoys, and other instrumentation as well as more traditional computational resources. Our approach has the benefit of directly reflecting stakeholder needs and assuring stakeholders of the correctness of the resulting governance decisions while yielding adaptive resource allocation in the face of changes in both stakeholder needs and physical circumstances.","[{'authorId': '1701132', 'name': 'Munindar P.

Interpersonal distance is an important nonverbal behavior, and is used to regulate personal space in a complex interplay with other nonverbal behaviors such as eye gaze. In social anxiety, studies regarding the impact of interpersonal distance on within-situation avoidance behavior are so far rare. Thus the present study aimed to scrutinize the relationship between gaze direction, sex, interpersonal distance, and social anxiety in social interactions. Social interactions were modeled in a virtual-reality (VR) environment, where 20 low and 19 high socially anxious women were confronted with approaching male and female characters, who stopped in front of the participant, either some distance away or close to them, and displayed either a direct or an averted gaze. Gaze and head movements, as well as heart rate, were measured as indices of avoidance behavior and fear reactions. High socially anxious participants showed a complex pattern of avoidance behavior: when the avatar was standing farther away, high socially anxious women avoided gaze contact with male avatars showing a direct gaze. Furthermore, they showed avoidance behavior (backward head movements) in response to male avatars showing a direct gaze, regardless of the interpersonal distance. Overall, the current study proved that VR social interactions might be a very useful tool for investigating avoidance behavior of socially anxious individuals in highly controlled situations. This might also be the first step in using VR social interactions in clinical protocols for the therapy of social anxiety disorder.","[{'authorId': '34439843', 'name': 'M.

We developed an easy-to-use VR self-management relaxation tool (VRelax) with immersive 360° nature videos and interactive animated elements. Objective To investigate the immediate effects of VR relaxation on negative and positive affective states and short-term effects on perceived stress and symptoms in patients with a psychiatric disorder, compared to standard relaxation exercises. Methods A randomized crossover trial was conducted in 50 patients receiving ambulatory treatment for anxiety, psychotic, depressive, or bipolar disorder. Participants were randomly assigned to start with VRelax or standard relaxation and used both interventions for 10 days at home. They completed 8 visual analog scales of momentary negative and positive affective states before and after each session. Global perceived stress and psychiatric symptoms were measured before and after both intervention periods. Treatment effects were analyzed with multilevel mixed model regression analyses and 2-way analysis of variance. Results Both VRelax and standard relaxation exercises led to a statistically significant immediate improvement of all negative and positive affective states. Compared to standard relaxation, VRelax resulted in a significantly greater reduction of total negative affective state (change 16.2% versus 21.2%; t1684=−2.02, 95% CI −18.70 to −0.28; P=.04). Specifically, VRelax had a stronger beneficial effect on momentary anxiety (t1684=−3.24, 95% CI −6.86 to −1.69), sadness (t1684=−2.32, 95% CI −6.51 to −0.55), and cheerfulness (t1684=2.35, 95% CI 0.51 to 5.75). There were no significant differences between short-term effects of the two treatments on global perceived stress and symptoms. Conclusions If the results of this trial are replicated and extended, VRelax may provide a much-needed, effective, easy-to-use self-management relaxation intervention to enhance psychiatric treatments.

In human-computer interaction, the need for advanced interface concepts arises, because an increasing number of untrained users seek access to information systems. Emotions, besides cognition, are considered to be a fundamental part of interactions. Therefore, they should not be neglected in human-computer interface design. Contemporary approaches focus on cognitive theories of emotion. In this article we offer possibili ties to extend these approaches by means of sociological emotion theory. It is illustrated how emotional actions can be related to the concept of “perceptual processing” to provide compatibility with existing models. We show how social norms and rules influence the emotion process and how these “social facts” are covered by the concept of “emotional action” .

These range from the introduction of cognitive and emotional mechanisms into agents’ implementation in an evolving MAS, to the cost-efficient interference for promoting prosocial behaviours in complex networks, to the regulation and governance of AI safety development ecology, and to the equilibrium analysis of random evolutionary multi-player games. This brief aims to sensitize the reader to EGT based issues, results and prospects, which are accruing in importance for the modeling of minds with machines and the engineering of prosocial behaviours in dynamical MAS, with impact on our understanding of the emergence and stability of collective behaviours. In all cases, important open problems in MAS research as viewed or prioritised by the group are described.","[{'authorId': '34751767', 'name': 'T.

d621786b597687f555fae83dc1a021fd21713d90,"Abstract The concept of an agent has become important in both artificial intelligence (AT) and mainstream computer science. Our aim in this paper is to point the reader at what we perceive to be the most important theoretical and practical issues associated with the design and construction of intelligent agents. For convenience, we divide these issues into three areas (though as the reader will see, the divisions are at times somewhat arbitrary). Agent theory is concerned with the question of what an agent is, and the use of mathematical formalisms for representing and reasoning about the properties of agents. Agent architectures can be thought of as software engineering models of agents; researchers in this area are primarily concerned with the problem of designing software or hardware systems that will satisfy the properties specified by agent theorists. Finally, agent languages are software systems for programming and experimenting with agents; these languages may embody principles proposed by theorists. The paper is not intended to serve as a tutorial introduction to all the issues mentioned; we hope instead simply to identify the most important issues, and point to work that elaborates on them. The article includes a short review of current and potential applications of agent technology.","[{'authorId': '48106342', 'name': 'M. Wooldridge'}, {'authorId': '144626042', 'name': 'N.

Keystroke analysis i.e. study of the typing behavior in desktop computer is found to be an effective modality for emotion detection because of its reliability, non-intrusiveness and low resource overhead. As smartphones proliferate, typing behavior on smartphone presents an equally powerful modality for emotion detection. It has the added advantage to run in-situ experiments with better coverage than the experiments using desktop computer keyboards. This work explores the efficacy of smartphone typing to detect multiple affective states. We use a qualitative and experimental approach to answer the question. We conduct an online survey among 120 participants to understand the typing habits in smartphones and collect feedback on multiple measurable parameters that affect their emotion while typing. The findings lead us to design and implement an Android based emotion detection system, TapSense, which can identify four different emotion states (happy, sad, stressed, relaxed) with an average accuracy (AUCROC) of 73% (maximum of 94%) based on typing features only. The analysis also reveals that among different features, typing speed is the most discriminative one.","[{'authorId': '40598977', 'name': 'Surjya Ghosh'}, {'authorId': '4213990', 'name': 'Niloy Ganguly'}, {'authorId': '144985652', 'name': 'Bivas Mitra'}, {'authorId': '50430940', 'name': 'Pradipta De'}]",25.0,,15.0,Evaluating effectiveness of smartphone typing as an indicator of user emotion,2017.0

Typical autonomic signals that change with emotion are wrinkles, blushing, sweating, tearing, and respiration. This article explores whether these signals can also influence the perception of emotion in embodied agents. The article first reviews the literature on specific autonomic signal patterns associated with certain affective states. Next, it proceeds to describe a real-time model for wrinkles, blushing, sweating, tearing, and respiration that is capable of implementing those patterns. Two studies are then described. In the first, subjects compare surprise, sadness, anger, shame, pride, and fear expressed in an agent with or without blushing, wrinkles, sweating, or tears. In the second, subjects compare excitement, relaxation, focus, pain, relief, boredom, anger, fear, panic, disgust, surprise, startle, sadness, and joy expressed in an agent with or without typical respiration patterns. The first study shows a statistically significant positive effect on perception of surprise, sadness, anger, shame, and fear. The second study shows a statistically significant positive effect on perception of excitement, pain, relief, boredom, anger, fear, panic, disgust, and startle.

Methods:  Twenty adolescents with ASD participated in a six-session virtual reality driving simulator-based experiment, during which their electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded alongside driving events and a therapist's rating of their affective states and mental workload. Five feature generation approaches including statistical features, fractal dimension features, higher order crossings (HOC)-based features, power features from frequency bands, and power features from bins ($\Delta \boldsymbol{f} = 2\;{\rm{Hz}}$ ) were applied to extract relevant features. Individual differences were removed with a two-step feature calibration method. Finally, binary classification results based on the k-nearest neighbors algorithm and univariate feature selection method were evaluated by leave-one-subject-out nested cross-validation to compare feature types and identify discriminative features. Results: The best classification results were achieved using power features from bins for engagement (0.95) and boredom (0.78), and HOC-based features for enjoyment (0.90), frustration (0.88), and workload (0.86). Conclusion: Offline EEG-based group-level classification models are feasible for recognizing binary low and high intensity of affect and workload of individuals with ASD in the context of driving. However, while promising the applicability of the models in an online adaptive driving task requires further development. Significance: The developed models provide a basis for an EEG-based passive brain computer interface system that has the potential to benefit individuals with ASD with an affect- and workload-based individualized driving skill training intervention.","[{'authorId': '2151856867', 'name': 'Jing Fan'}, {'authorId': '3285850', 'name': 'Joshua W.

Social exposure conducted in virtual reality (VR), embedded in individual cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT), could be an answer. Aims To show that conducting VR exposure in CBT for SAD is effective and is more practical for therapists than conducting exposure in vivo. Method Participants were randomly assigned to either VR exposure (n = 17), in vivo exposure (n = 22) or waiting list (n = 20). Participants in the active arms received individual CBT for 14 weekly sessions and outcome was assessed with questionnaires and a behaviour avoidance test. (Trial registration number ISRCTN99747069.) Results Improvements were found on the primary (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale) and all five secondary outcome measures in both CBT groups compared with the waiting list. Conducting exposure in VR was more effective at post-treatment than in vivo on the primary outcome measure and on one secondary measure. Improvements were maintained at the 6-month follow-up. VR was significantly more practical for therapists than in vivo exposure. Conclusions Using VR can be advantageous over standard CBT as a potential solution for treatment avoidance and as an efficient, cost-effective and practical medium of exposure.","[{'authorId': '144981172', 'name': 'S.

However, which of these “big three” health behaviors most strongly predicts mental health and well-being, and their higher-order relationships in predictive models, is less known. This study investigated the differential and higher-order associations between sleep, physical activity, and dietary factors as predictors of mental health and well-being in young adults. Method In a cross-sectional survey design, 1,111 young adults (28.4% men) ages 18–25 from New Zealand and the United States answered an online survey measuring typical sleep quantity and quality; physical activity; and consumption of raw and processed fruit and vegetables, fast food, sweets, and soda, along with extensive covariates (including demographics, socioeconomic status, body mass index, alcohol use, smoking, and health conditions) and the outcome measures of depressive symptoms [measured by the Center for Epidemiological Depression Scale (CES-D)] and well-being (measured by the Flourishing Scale). Results Controlling for covariates, sleep quality was the strongest predictor of depressive symptoms and well-being, followed by sleep quantity and physical activity. Only one dietary factor—raw fruit and vegetable consumption—predicted greater well-being but not depressive symptoms when controlling for covariates. There were some higher-order interactions among health behaviors in predicting the outcomes, but these did not survive cross-validation. Conclusion Sleep quality is an important predictor of mental health and well-being in young adults, whereas physical activity and diet are secondary but still significant factors. Although strictly correlational, these patterns suggest that future interventions could prioritize sleep quality to maximize mental health and well-being in young adults.","[{'authorId': '2034055971', 'name': 'Shay-Ruby Wickham'}, {'authorId': '1485669084', 'name': 'Natasha A.

The novelty of this work is that agents are able to control topological features during the network formation phase. We propose a commitment-based dynamic coalition formation approach that result in a single coalition where agents mutually cooperate. Agents play an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game with their immediate neighbors and offer commitments to their wealthiest neighbors in order to form coalitions. A commitment proposal, that includes a high breaching penalty, incentivizes opponent agents to form coalitions within which they mutually cooperate and thereby increase their payoff. We have analytically determined, and experimentally substantiated, how the value of the penalty should be set with respect to the minimum node degree and the payoff values such that convergence into optimal coalitions is possible. Using a computational model, we determine an appropriate partner selection strategy for the agents that results in a network facilitating the convergence into a single coalition and thereby maximizing average expected payoff.","[{'authorId': '34700608', 'name': 'Mohammad Rashedul Hasan'}, {'authorId': '143940792', 'name': 'A.

Human communication is grounded in fundamentally cooperative, even shared, intentions. In this original and provocative account of the evolutionary origins of human communication, Michael Tomasello connects the fundamentally cooperative structure of human communication (initially discovered by Paul Grice) to the especially cooperative structure of human (as opposed to other primate) social interaction. Tomasello argues that human cooperative communication rests on a psychological infrastructure of shared intentionality (joint attention, common ground), evolved originally for collaboration and culture more generally. The basic motives of the infrastructure are helping and sharing: humans communicate to request help, inform others of things helpfully, and share attitudes as a way of bonding within the cultural group. These cooperative motives each created different functional pressures for conventionalizing grammatical constructions. Requesting help in the immediate you-and-me and here-and-now, for example, required very little grammar, but informing and sharing required increasingly complex grammatical devices. Drawing on empirical research into gestural and vocal communication by great apes and human infants (much of it conducted by his own research team), Tomasello argues further that humans' cooperative communication emerged first in the natural gestures of pointing and pantomiming. Conventional communication, first gestural and then vocal, evolved only after humans already possessed these natural gestures and their shared intentionality infrastructure along with skills of cultural learning for creating and passing along jointly understood communicative conventions. Challenging the Chomskian view that linguistic knowledge is innate, Tomasello proposes instead that the most fundamental aspects of uniquely human communication are biological adaptations for cooperative social interaction in general and that the purely linguistic dimensions of human communication are cultural conventions and constructions created by and passed along within particular cultural groups.

d9789715a1088137e4ccce89d0a32f5699708dc3,"Summary:Adolescents may especially need social and emotional help. They're learning how to handle new demands in school and social life while dealing with new, intense emotions (both positive and negative), and they're increasingly feeling that they should do so without adult guidance. Social and emotional learning (SEL) programs are one way to help them navigate these difficulties.SEL programs try to help adolescents cope with their difficulties more successfully by improving skills and mindsets, and they try to create respectful school environments that young people want to be a part of by changing the school's climate. In this article, David Yeager defines those terms and explains the changes that adolescents experience with the onset of puberty. Then he reviews a variety of SEL programs to see what works best with this age group.On the positive side, Yeager finds that effective universal SEL can transform adolescents' lives for the better. Less encouragingly, typical SEL programs—which directly teach skills and invite participants to rehearse those skills over the course of many classroom lessons—have a poor track record with middle adolescents (roughly age 14 to 17), even though they work well with children.But some programs stand out for their effectiveness with adolescents. Rather than teaching them skills, Yeager finds, effective programs for adolescents focus on mindsets and climate. Harnessing adolescents' developmental motivations, such programs aim to make them feel respected by adults and peers and offer them the chance to gain status and admiration in the eyes of people whose opinions they value.","[{'authorId': '34677298', 'name': 'D.

Emotions, such as anger and happiness, affect concession-making, not only in human vs. human negotiations but also in human vs. agent negotiations. Recent research has demonstrated the impact of emotional expressions in morally-charged negotiations. Thus, taking people’s moral concerns into account is crucial for building agents that operate in morally sensitive domains. This paper explores the interplay between people’s moral concerns, emotional expressions and concession-making during a morally charged negotiation. Our results demonstrate that participants who had stronger concerns for the Individualizing foundations (Harm and Fairness) make greater concessions for sacred negotiation items when faced with a sad opponent than an angry opponent. Also, we find that participants who had high Binding foundations (In-group, Authority and Purity) are more sensitive to social status, and make greater concessions in scenarios that involve agents in a higher social status. Keywords: Emotion; Moral Foundations Theory; Sacred values; Negotiation; Agent Modeling. Introduction With the growing interest in understanding the role of emotional expressions in negotiation (e.g., Barry, Fulmer & Goates, 2006; Van Kleef et al., 2010), many studies have investigated how emotional expression affects negotiation processes and outcomes (Ames & Johar, 2009; Choi et al., 2012; de Melo et al., 2014). For instance, negotiators concede more when their opponent expresses anger instead of happiness (Van Kleef, De Dreu & Manstead, 2004a, 2004b). Sinaceur & Tiedens (2006) further reveal that the effect of anger on concession works only when anger recipients have poor alternatives. The past works on emotional expression suggest that emotion plays an important role as a signal (e.g., anger indicates a negotiator’s dissatisfaction with his opponent’s offer). Furthermore, negotiators respond to emotional expressions depending on their own conditions (e.g., alternatives). Thus, it is important to understand what moderates a negotiator’s reaction to emotional expression. Past studies have shown that positive moods in negotiation foster concession-making (e.g., Carnevale & Isen, 1986). Mood effects may be mediated by expression of positive emotion, for example, a positive-mood induction procedure may lead negotiators to smile more and this smiling may have an impact on perceptions and concession- making. Regardless, the possible interaction of emotion and other variables, for example, cognition as in decision frame (Carnevale, 2008), or motivation as in moral concerns, is a domain highly worthy of inquiry. Although some studies have tried to understand how people’s innate personality interacts with their emotion during negotiation games (Bolton, Katok, & Zwick, 1998; Batson & Moran, 1999), little research has paid attention to how moral concerns impact reactions to emotional expressions and affect concession-making. Our recent research demonstrates that emotional expressions can potentially shift moral concerns during a negotiation, such that displays of anger would backfire if the negotiator associates moral significance to the objects of the negotiation, whereas displays of sadness promote higher concession-making (Dehghani, Gratch and Carnevale, 2012). Because morality significantly influences decision- making (e.g., Sjoberg & Winroth, 1986; Gintis et al., 2003), the present research aims to examine the role of people’s moral concerns on how they react to emotional expressions and make concessions. Adapting the Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt & Graham, 2007; Haidt & Joseph, 2007; Graham, 2013), we examine effects of two different types of foundations (i.e., Individualizing foundations and Binding foundations) on concession-making. We predict that people who have stronger Individualizing foundations would react more to emotional expressions because the Individualizing foundations indicate the tendency to care about other people’s emotions (whether others are emotionally or physically suffering, or being treated fairly) and therefore, that would effect their concession-making. On the other hand, we predict that people with stronger Binding foundations be more sensitive to their negotiation partner’s social status because Binding foundations indicate concern about other people’s roles in the group (whether negotiation partner is their boss or co-worker). Understanding the interaction between moral concerns and emotion are crucial in designing autonomous decision- making agents that operate in morally sensitive domains. Progress in agent research has enabled us to work closely with software agents in morally sensitive situations where agents’ actions may lead to significant results, such as loss of life (Tambe, 2011; Dehghani et al., 2013). Therefore, it is important to better understand the interactions between people’s moral concerns, emotion and agent decision- making strategies. Our results suggest that incorporating","[{'authorId': '47056370', 'name': 'Eunkyung Kim'}, {'authorId': '145707560', 'name': 'Morteza Dehghani'}, {'authorId': '17837204', 'name': 'Y.

da58d554b6f7cc1bbe2e081d7d050733c79a90f8,"Abstract The ability and motivation to share attention is a unique aspect of human cognition. Despite its significance, the neural basis remains elusive. To investigate the neural correlates of joint attention, we developed a novel, interactive research paradigm in which participants' gaze behavior—as measured by an eye tracking device—was used to contingently control the gaze of a computer-animated character. Instructed that the character on screen was controlled by a real person outside the scanner, 21 participants interacted with the virtual other while undergoing fMRI. Experimental variations focused on leading versus following the gaze of the character when fixating one of three objects also shown on the screen. In concordance with our hypotheses, results demonstrate, firstly, that following someone else's gaze to engage in joint attention resulted in activation of anterior portion of medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) known to be involved in the supramodal coordination of perceptual and cognitive processes. Secondly, directing someone else's gaze toward an object activated the ventral striatum which—in light of ratings obtained from participants—appears to underlie the hedonic aspects of sharing attention. The data, therefore, support the idea that other-initiated joint attention relies upon recruitment of MPFC previously related to the “meeting of minds.” In contrast, self-initiated joint attention leads to a differential increase of neural activity in reward-related brain areas, which might contribute to the uniquely human motivation to engage in the sharing of experiences.","[{'authorId': '2127424', 'name': 'L.

The results indicate no significant difference in the perceived morality of the actions shown in the videos across the two victim agents. When the agents started to fight back, their reactive aggressive behaviour was rated differently. Humans fighting back were seen as less immoral compared with robots fighting back.

Agreement was highest for traits related to Extraversion and lowest for traits related to Agreeableness. More observable and less evaluative traits elicited higher interjudge agreement. On average, self-peer agreement was lower than peer-peer agreement. However, this effect was limited to evaluative traits; for neutral traits, self-peer agreement was as high as peer-peer agreement.

AbstractIn this study, relationships among childhood abuse history, difficulties in emotion regulation, interpersonal styles and psychological wellbeing were examined. Besides the mediator role of emotion regulation and interpersonal styles in the relationship between childhood abuse history and psychological wellbeing were examined. The sample is composed of 802 adults aged 18-65. Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) was used to assess the participants? abuse experiences before age 18, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) was used to evaluate participants? difficulties in emotion regulation, Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) was used to assess the psychological distress level and Interpersonal Relationship Styles Inventory (IRSI) was used to assess participants? interpersonal styles. The results of the study have shown that gender variable has a main effect on all the study variables excluding emotion regulation and education variable also has a main effect on all the study variables excluding negative interpersonal style. Besides it was determined that the group with a higher level of abuse has more difficulties in emotion regulation, has more psychological distress and exhibit more negative interpersonal relation styles than the group with a lower level of abuse. The predictor variables of psychological wellbeing was found to be psychiatric treatment history, education level, age, the education level of the father, gender, trauma history, physical abuse, sexual abuse, negative interpersonal style and dimensions of emotion regulation difficulties including strategies, clarity, impulse control and goals. Results revealed that both emotion regulation difficulties and negative interpersonal style variables mediate the relation between childhood abuse history and psychological wellbeing. The results of this research in general have shown that childhood abuse history might have negative effects on psychological wellbeing, emotion regulation and interpersonal styles in adult life.","[{'authorId': '2084049725', 'name': 'Gülçim Bilim'}]",7.0,,0.0,"Çocukluk çağı örselenme yaşantıları: Duygu düzenleme, kişilerarası tarz ve genel psikolojik sağlık açısından bir inceleme",2012.0

In this paper, we propose an Augmented Reality (AR) system using smartphone. The system allows us to leave emotional notes in the real environment using Virtual-Agent. The crucial part of the system focuses on the emotional short voice message exchange with the Virtual-Agents. Spatial note system is based on two parts, one is the virtual agent services and the other is the AR system. The virtual agent services allow users to make a voice message by recording user’s voice. Then, a Virtual-Agent with the appropriate facial expression is generated. User can also change the facial expressions as he likes. There are 4 emotions of the virtual agents: happy, sorrow, angry and calm. Each emotion has 4 levels to express. The AR system will detect planes from the smartphone view of the real world. Users can put the Virtual- Agent anywhere on a plane.","[{'authorId': '2181745962', 'name': 'Puxuan Qu'}, {'authorId': '144705533', 'name': 'J.

Although the same emotional intensity was added to both trustworthy and untrustworthy faces, trustworthy faces who expressed happiness were perceived as happier than untrustworthy faces, and untrustworthy faces who expressed anger were perceived as angrier than trustworthy faces. The authors also manipulated changes in face trustworthiness simultaneously with the change in expression. Whereas transitions in face trustworthiness in the direction of the expressed emotion (e.g., high-to-low trustworthiness and anger) increased the perceived intensity of the emotion, transitions in the opposite direction decreased this intensity. For example, changes from high to low trustworthiness increased the intensity of perceived anger but decreased the intensity of perceived happiness. These findings support the hypothesis that changes along the trustworthiness dimension correspond to subtle changes resembling expressions signaling whether the person displaying the emotion should be avoided or approached.","[{'authorId': '1896078', 'name': 'N.

Expressing these in a common form, we derive a novel algorithm, Retrace($\lambda$), with three desired properties: (1) it has low variance; (2) it safely uses samples collected from any behaviour policy, whatever its degree of ""off-policyness""; and (3) it is efficient as it makes the best use of samples collected from near on-policy behaviour policies. We analyze the contractive nature of the related operator under both off-policy policy evaluation and control settings and derive online sample-based algorithms. We believe this is the first return-based off-policy control algorithm converging a.s. to $Q^*$ without the GLIE assumption (Greedy in the Limit with Infinite Exploration). As a corollary, we prove the convergence of Watkins' Q($\lambda$), which was an open problem since 1989.

The aim of this study was to examine pre-service teachers’ (PST) perceptions about VR, inclusive of their beliefs about its capacity to be used as a teaching and learning tool. A case-study, conducted at an urban university in Australia involved a sample of n = 41. Participants’ positive perceptions of VR in their teaching relate to its potential to engage learners, the immersive potential of the platform and the scope of VR to offer students experiences they might otherwise not have with other learning tools. Concerns expressed by PSTs include their relatively low self-efficacy to use VR in their teaching, monitoring-related matters, financial cost and implementing the technology in a safe and supportive way. There was a significant difference in PSTs’ amount of self-efficacy to teach using VR when compared to their overall confidence to use digital technologies. PSTs typically had greater awareness of the immersive and engagement potential of VR and less awareness about its potential to foster and promote collaborative learning. This paper contributes to an emerging discourse regarding the possible applications of VR in educational environments and particularly in relation teacher-educator contexts.","[{'authorId': '153016337', 'name': 'G.

This theory defines emotions as tendencies to perform an action. This theory allows us to implement a strong connection between emotions and speech acts during an agent-human interaction. Our model presents an agent architecture with beliefs, desires, ideals and capacities. It relies on 6 appraisal variables for the selection of different emotional strategies depending on the context of the dialogue. It also supports social regulation of emotions depending on social rules. We implemented this model in an agent architecture and we give an example of dialogue with a virtual insurance expert in the context of customer relationship management.","[{'authorId': '2079769446', 'name': 'Alya Yacoubi'}, {'authorId': '1731432', 'name': 'N.

Conversational agents may offer a convenient, engaging way of getting support at any time. Objective The objective of the study was to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a fully automated conversational agent to deliver a self-help program for college students who self-identify as having symptoms of anxiety and depression. Methods In an unblinded trial, 70 individuals age 18-28 years were recruited online from a university community social media site and were randomized to receive either 2 weeks (up to 20 sessions) of self-help content derived from CBT principles in a conversational format with a text-based conversational agent (Woebot) (n=34) or were directed to the National Institute of Mental Health ebook, “Depression in College Students,” as an information-only control group (n=36). All participants completed Web-based versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale at baseline and 2-3 weeks later (T2). Results Participants were on average 22.2 years old (SD 2.33), 67% female (47/70), mostly non-Hispanic (93%, 54/58), and Caucasian (79%, 46/58). Participants in the Woebot group engaged with the conversational agent an average of 12.14 (SD 2.23) times over the study period. No significant differences existed between the groups at baseline, and 83% (58/70) of participants provided data at T2 (17% attrition). Intent-to-treat univariate analysis of covariance revealed a significant group difference on depression such that those in the Woebot group significantly reduced their symptoms of depression over the study period as measured by the PHQ-9 (F=6.47; P=.01) while those in the information control group did not. In an analysis of completers, participants in both groups significantly reduced anxiety as measured by the GAD-7 (F1,54= 9.24; P=.004). Participants’ comments suggest that process factors were more influential on their acceptability of the program than content factors mirroring traditional therapy. Conclusions Conversational agents appear to be a feasible, engaging, and effective way to deliver CBT.","[{'authorId': '2194363', 'name': 'K.

Whether these similarly named dimensions from different methodologies are actually equivalent was tested here by intercorrelating dimensions obtained from multidimensional scaling, successive-intervals scaling, semantic differential scaling, and factor analysis of verbal self-report data. Results strongly supported the convergent validity of pleasure-displeasure and degree of arousal, but were equivocal on additional dimensions. Separate multidimensional scalings of pleasant, intermediate, and unpleasant affect terms (a) confirmed the presence of an arousal dimension at each level of pleasure and (b) obtained three additional dimensions: control/potency/dominance, depth of experience, and locus of causation. These three dimensions were interpreted as describing not the emotion per se but rather beliefs about the antecedents or consequences of the emotion.

With newspapers going online and television becoming increasingly digital, the current generation of youth has little reason to consume analog media. Music, movies, and all other forms of mass-mediated content can be obtained via a wide array of digital devices, ranging from CDs to DVDs, from iPods to PDAs. Even their nonmedia experiences are often characterized by a reliance on digital devices. Most young people communicate with most of their acquaintances through cell phones and computer-mediated communication tools such as instant messengers and e-mail systems. 1 And, with the arrival of personal broadcasting technologies such as blogs and social networking sites, many youngsters experience the world through their own self-expression and the expressions of their peers. This serves to blur the traditional boundary between interpersonal and mass communication, leading to an idiosyncratic construction of one's media world. Customization in the digital age—be it in the form of Web sites such as cus-tomizable portals that allow users to shape content or devices such as iPods that allow for customized playlists—enables the user to serve as the gatekeeper of content. As media get highly interactive, multimodal, and navigable, the receiver tends to become the source of communication. 2 While this leads naturally to egocentric construals of one's information environment, it also raises questions about the veracity of all the material that is consumed. The ease of digital publishing has made authors out of us all, leading to a dramatic profusion of information available for personal as well as public consumption. Much of this information, however, is free-floating and does not follow any universally accepted gatekeeping standards, let alone a professional process of writing and editing. Therefore, the veridicality of information accessed on the Web and other digital media is often suspect. 3 This makes credibility a supremely key concern in the new media environment, necessitating the constant need to critically assess information while consuming it. Credibility is classically ascertained by considering the source of information. If the attributed source of a piece of information is a credible person or organization, then, according to conventional wisdom, that information is probably reliable. However, in Internet-based media, source is a murky entity because there are often multiple layers of sources in online transmission of information (e.g., e-mail from a friend giving you a piece of information that he or she found on a newsgroup, posted …","[{'authorId': '47493614', 'name': 'S.

To address this question, I draw on research on the interpersonal effects of emotions on behavior in personal relationships, parent–child interactions, conflict, negotiation, and leadership, and propose a new framework that can account for existing findings and guide future research: the emotions as social information (EASI) model. I demonstrate that emotional expressions affect observers' behavior by triggering inferential processes and/or affective reactions in them. The predictive strength of these two processes—which may inspire different behaviors—depends on the observer's information processing and on social-relational factors. Examples of moderators that determine the relative predictive strength of inferences and affective reactions include power, need for cognitive closure, time pressure, display rules, and the appropriateness and target of the emotional expression, which are all discussed.","[{'authorId': '5980688', 'name': 'Gerben A. van Kleef'}]",995.0,,25.0,How Emotions Regulate Social Life,2009.0

Although remarkable steps have been made in the field, the problem still remains open. Emotions are conveyed by many and varied factors, from very low-level cues, such as the colors of the stimulus, to high-level aspects, such as the semantics of the scene. One of the main challenges is the fact that even though some of these factors are known by neuro-scientists, computer scientists or artists, many of the stimulus features that play a role in eliciting emotion probably remain unknown. The recent success of deep learning methods, which are able to automatically learn relevant stimuli representations, seems to set a promising path to follow. Here we will explore new deep neural architectures suitable for affective content analysis, together with semi-supervised models that help handle the relative lack of available data and the uncertainty and subjectivity of the annotations.","[{'authorId': '83015253', 'name': 'Alex Hernández-García'}]",4.0,,44.0,Perceived emotion from images through deep neural networks,2017.0

Instead, many robots built in recent years have faces that are rendered onto a screen. This gives great flexibility in what a robot’s face can be and opens up a new design space with which to establish a robot’s character and perceived properties. Despite the prevalence of robots with rendered faces, there are no systematic explorations of this design space. Our work aims to fill that gap. We conducted a survey and identified 157 robots with rendered faces and coded them in terms of 76 properties. We present statistics, common patterns, and observations about this data set of faces. Next, we conducted two surveys to understand people’s perceptions of rendered robot faces and identify the impact of different face features. Survey results indicate preferences for varying levels of realism and detail in robot faces based on context, and indicate how the presence or absence of specific features affects perception of the face and the types of jobs the face would be appropriate for.","[{'authorId': '36104366', 'name': 'Alisa Kalegina'}, {'authorId': '39449608', 'name': 'G.

df6b48d955f71a663f8f30bf83f3f04fcb176a2f,"In this colorful and consistently engaging work, law and economics professor Gillian Hadfield picks up where New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman left off in his influential 2005 book, The World is Flat. Friedman was focused on the infrastructure of communications and technology-the new web-based platform that allows business to follow the hunt for lower costs, higher value and greater efficiency around the planet seemingly oblivious to the boundaries of nation states. Hadfield peels back this technological platform to look at the 'structure that lies beneath'--our legal infrastructure, the platform of rules about who can do what, when and how. Often taken for granted, economic growth throughout human history has depended at least as much on the evolution of new systems of rules to support ever-more complex modes of cooperation and trade as it has on technological innovation. When Google rolled out YouTube in over one hundred countries around the globe simultaneously, for example, it faced not only the challenges of technology but also the staggering problem of how to build success in the context of a bewildering and often conflicting patchwork of nation-state-based laws and legal systems affecting every aspect of the business-contract, copyright, encryption, censorship, advertising and more. Google is not alone. A study presented at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2011 found that for global firms, the number one challenge of the modern economy is increasing complexity, and the number one source of complexity is law. Today, even our startups, the engines of economic growth, are global from Day One. Put simply, the law and legal methods on which we currently rely have failed to evolve along with technology. They are increasingly unable to cope with the speed, complexity, and constant border-crossing of our new globally inter-connected environment. Our current legal systems are still rooted in the politics-based nation state platform on which the industrial revolution was built. Hadfield argues that even though these systems supported fantastic growth over the past two centuries, today they are too slow, costly, cumbersome and localized to support the exponential rise in economic complexity they fostered. While everything else in the economy strives to become cheaper, sleeker and faster, our outdated approach to law hampers the invention of new products, the development of new business models, the structuring of global supply chains, the management of the risks posed by complex technologies, the evolution of financial, ecological, and other systems, as well as the protection of people and businesses as they and their products travel around the globe. They also fail to address looming challenges such as global warming and the reduction of poverty and oppression in the developing countries that are the backyard of global business. The answer to our troubles with law, however, is not the one critics usually reach for--to have less of it. Recognizing that law provides critical infrastructure for the cooperation and collaboration on which economic growth is built is the first step, Hadfield argues, to building a legal environment that does more of what we need it to do and less of what we don't. Through a sweeping review of first the invention and then the evolution of law over thousands of years of human development and the ways in which rule systems have consistently adapted to higher levels of complexity, Hadfield stresses that the state-based legal systems governing us today are not the only way to build the planks of a legal platform. Going back to fundamentals, she shows how historically, law's primary purpose has been to help societies to cope with the essential issues of trust, commitment, risk-allocation, and distribution that we face in coordinating cooperative ventures. While nation-state laws will never disappear, the time has come for us to supplement our legal infrastructure with rules developed on the same global platform as our economy. Hadfield offers a model for a more market- and globally-oriented legal system that fosters greater participation of end-users, market actors, and other non-governmental entities. Combining an impressive grasp of the empirical details of economic globalization with an ambitious re-envisioning of our global legal system, Rules for a Flat World promises to be a crucial and influential intervention into the debates surrounding how best to manage the evolving global economy.","[{'authorId': '40051700', 'name': 'Gillian K.

The content of such claims is examined, and the results suggest that there is no coherent nontrivial notion of basic emotions as the elementary psychological primitives in terms of which other emotions can be explained. Thus, the view that there exist basic emotions out of which all other emotions are built, and in terms of which they can be explained, is questioned, raising the possibility that this position is an article of faith rather than an empirically or theoretically defensible basis for the conduct of emotion research. This suggests that perhaps the notion of basic emotions will not lead to significant progress in the field.

dfbc99264f55272937b6a3172086d7a48d791acb,"ABSTRACT Virtual environments (VEs) are now becoming a promising new technology to be used in the development of interactive learning environments for children. Perhaps triggered by the success of computer games, VEs are seen as an emergent and engaging new way by which children can learn experimental sciences and other disciplines. Inhabiting these IVEs can be agents or intelligent characters that are responsible for events that happen in the environment and make it not predictive or completely controlled. However, to build such environments, in particular, if populated by synthetic characters, one needs to carefully address the problem of how do the learners respond to the characters in the virtual environment. Do learners like the characters? Do learners identify themselves with characters in virtual environments? This relation between learners and characters in virtual environments can be studied in several perspectives. In this paper, we will focus primarily on the issue of empathy as one desirable aspect of the affective interaction between learners and synthetic characters. In particular, we will defend that in order for such affective relations to happen, characters should be created and designed taking into account what we call the proximity factor. This is based on the fact that children are found to respond more empathically to those that are perceived as similar to the self than those who are perceived as dissimilar (Barnett 1987). This appears to be the case when similarity is defined in terms of a shared characteristic, such as sex (Bryant 1982), race or in terms of shared personal experiences (Bryant 1982). Thus, designing characters aiming at pedagogical empathic interactions, we should carefully address how close the learner will feel with the synthetic characters developed in terms of situation, behavior or even physical appearance. In order to illustrate this factor in eliciting emotional reactions to synthetic characters, we will present a specific system called FearNot!. FearNot! was developed to address the difficult and often devastating problem of bullying in schools. By using role-playing and synthetic characters in a 3D environment, FearNot! allows children from age 8 to 12 to experience a virtual scenario where they can witness (in a third-person perspective) bullying situations. To build empathy into FearNot, we have considered the following components: agent's architecture, the characters' embodiment, the environment itself, and emotionally charged situations. All these elements were built to allow for a stronger proximity with the user and the system. In this paper, we will focus primarily on this problem and report some results achieved in the evaluation executed with 127 children and 95 adults on the system.","[{'authorId': '145136631', 'name': 'Ana Paiva'}, {'authorId': '2151066261', 'name': 'João Dias'}, {'authorId': '2082297527', 'name': 'Daniel Sobral'}, {'authorId': '1732377', 'name': 'R.

In the present study, we investigated personal space in children with persistent difficulties in the domain of social behavior, such as children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and in children with typical development (TD). The stop-distance paradigm was used to derive estimates of interpersonal distance, before and after a brief interaction with an unfamiliar adult confederate. The results showed that ASD children felt comfortable at a greater distance compared to TD children. Moreover, personal space shrunk after interaction with the confederate in TD children, but it failed to do so in ASD children.

It does this by way of parasympathetic innervation from postganglionic fibers that originate from neurons in the ciliary and pterygopalatine ganglia, and by way of sympathetic innervation from postganglionic fibers that originate from neurons in the superior cervical ganglion. Ciliary ganglion neurons project to the ciliary body and the sphincter pupillae muscle of the iris to control ocular accommodation and pupil constriction, respectively. Superior cervical ganglion neurons project to the dilator pupillae muscle of the iris to control pupil dilation. Ocular blood flow is controlled both via direct autonomic influences on the vasculature of the optic nerve, choroid, ciliary body, and iris, as well as via indirect influences on retinal blood flow. In mammals, this vasculature is innervated by vasodilatory fibers from the pterygopalatine ganglion, and by vasoconstrictive fibers from the superior cervical ganglion. Intraocular pressure is regulated primarily through the balance of aqueous humor formation and outflow. Autonomic regulation of ciliary body blood vessels and the ciliary epithelium is an important determinant of aqueous humor formation; autonomic regulation of the trabecular meshwork and episcleral blood vessels is an important determinant of aqueous humor outflow. These tissues are all innervated by fibers from the pterygopalatine and superior cervical ganglia.

Providing incentives tends to be costly, so it is important to find effective and efficient policies for the combined use of rewards and penalties. Most studies of cooperation, however, have addressed rewarding and punishing in isolation and have focused on peer-to-peer sanctioning as opposed to institutional sanctioning. Here, we demonstrate that an institutional sanctioning policy we call ‘first carrot, then stick’ is unexpectedly successful in promoting cooperation. The policy switches the incentive from rewarding to punishing when the frequency of cooperators exceeds a threshold. We find that this policy establishes and recovers full cooperation at lower cost and under a wider range of conditions than either rewards or penalties alone, in both well-mixed and spatial populations. In particular, the spatial dynamics of cooperation make it evident how punishment acts as a ‘booster stage’ that capitalizes on and amplifies the pro-social effects of rewarding. Together, our results show that the adaptive hybridization of incentives offers the ‘best of both worlds’ by combining the effectiveness of rewarding in establishing cooperation with the effectiveness of punishing in recovering it, thereby providing a surprisingly inexpensive and widely applicable method of promoting cooperation.","[{'authorId': '3187743', 'name': 'Xiaojie Chen'}, {'authorId': '2110618737', 'name': 'Tatsuya Sasaki'}, {'authorId': '2781829', 'name': 'Å.

These input channels can be further classified as subserving a sensory function of spatial and temporal localization, discrimination, and provision of essential information for controlling and guiding exploratory tactile behaviours, and an affective function that is widely recognized as providing the afferent neural input driving the subjective experience of pain, but not so widely recognized as also providing the subjective experience of affiliative or emotional somatic pleasure of touch. The discriminative properties of tactile sensation are mediated by a class of fast-conducting myelinated peripheral nerve fibres--A-beta fibres--whereas the rewarding, emotional properties of touch are hypothesized to be mediated by a class of unmyelinated peripheral nerve fibres--CT afferents (C tactile)--that have biophysical, electrophysiological, neurobiological, and anatomical properties that drive the temporally delayed emotional somatic system. CT afferents have not been found in the glabrous skin of the hand in spite of numerous electrophysiological explorations of this area.

The term virtual reality is credited to Jaron Lanier, founder of VPL Research; earlier experimenters, like Myron Krueger in the mid-1970s, used phrases like artificial reality. William Gibson coined cyberspace in his 1984 science fiction novel. Neuromancer. Few technologies in recent years have evoked such fiery discussions in the technical community, and fewer still have sparked such passionate involvement of the humanities and the cultural sector. Maybe the humanities community reacts because the VR interaction is so tightly coupled to the human senses. Perhaps the cultural sector clamours for a role in the evolution of VR because the technology is finally interfacing with the human, rather than the human interfacing with the technology. Whatever the reasons, VR is more a convergence of previously disparate disciplines than a whole new branch of technology. It simply takes a fresh look at human interaction. Evolving from user interface design, flight and visual simulation, and telepresence technologies, VR is unique in its emphasis on the experience of the human participant. VR focuses the user's attention on the experience while suspending disbelief about the method of creating it. We feel that neither the devices used nor the level of interactiveness or fidelity determine whether a system is VR. The quality of the experience is crucial.

e11a7b927e87ef118cecf693c74c0322715c1000,"In ambiguous situations, infants have the tendency to gather information from a social interaction partner to regulate their behavior [social referencing (SR)]. There are two main competing theories concerning SR’s function. According to social-cognitive information-seeking accounts, infants look at social interaction partners to gain information about the ambiguous situation. According to co-regulation accounts, infants look at social interaction partners to receive emotional support. This review provides an overview of the central developments in SR literature in the past years. We focus on the role of situational aspects such as familiarity of SR partners and situational threat, not only for SR (looking), but also for subsequent behavioral regulation (exploration, affect). As the competing accounts make different predictions concerning both contextual factors, this approach may reveal novel insights into the function of SR. Findings showed that a higher familiarity of SR partners consistently resulted in decreased looking (cf. social-cognitive accounts) and that higher threat remains largely understudied, but seemed to increase looking in the first few studies (cf. co-regulation accounts). Concerning behavioral regulation (exploration, affect) findings are mixed. We point out that moving toward a more complex situatedness may help to disentangle the heterogeneous results by considering the interaction between familiarity and threat rather than investigating the factors in isolation. From a general perspective, this review underlines the importance of situational factors and their interaction in eliciting a phenomenon, such as SR, but also in determining the nature of the phenomenon itself.","[{'authorId': '1396154277', 'name': 'Samantha Ehli'}, {'authorId': '1651553832', 'name': 'Julia Wolf'}, {'authorId': '2542300', 'name': 'A.

Individual differences research from mainstream psychology has identified a stable set of characteristics that would appear to offer potential application in the HCI arena. Furthermore, in its evolution over the last 100 years, research on individual differences has faced many of the problems of theoretical status and applicability that are common to HCI. In the present paper, the relationship between work in cognitive and differential psychology and current analyses of users in HCI is examined.

e227372d80f0d1853894d5eb452c74c8f78a95c2,"Ninety-eight college students were asked to indicate their emotional responses to five principle hues (i.e., red, yellow, green, blue, purple), five intermediate hues (i.e., yellow-red, green-yellow, blue-green, purple-blue, and red-purple), and three achromatic colors (white, gray, and black) and the reasons for their choices. The color stimuli were referenced from the Munsell Color System. The results revealed that the principle hues comprised the highest number of positive emotional responses, followed by the intermediate hues and the achromatic colors. The color green evoked mainly positive emotions such as relaxation and comfort because it reminded most of the respondents of nature. The color green-yellow had the lowest number of positive responses because it was associated with vomit and elicited the feelings of sickness and disgust. For the achromatic colors, white attained a large number of positive responses, followed by the colors black and gray. The reasons for the color-emotion associations are discussed and future research areas are suggested. Introduction Color is an inseparable part of our everyday lives and its presence is evident in everything that we perceive. It is widely recognized that colors have also a strong impact on our emotions and feelings (Hemphill, 1996; Lang, 1993; Mahnke, 1996). For instance, the color red has been associated with excitement, orange has been perceived as distressing and upsetting, purple as dignified and stately, yellow as cheerful, and blue has been associated with comfort and security (Ballast, 2002; Wexner, 1982). Moreover, some colors may be associated with several different emotions and some emotions are associated with more than one color (Linton, 1999, Saito, 1996). Red, symbolically known as a dominant and dynamic color, has an exciting and stimulating hue effect. It has both positive and negative impressions such as active, strong, passionate, warm, but on the other hand aggressive, bloody, raging and intense. Green has been found to have a retiring and relaxing effect. It too has both positive and negative impressions such as refreshment, quietness, naturalness, and conversely tiredness and guilt (Davey, 1998, Mahnke, 1996, Saito, 1996). The relationship between color and emotion is closely tied to color preferences. In particular, color preferences are associated with whether a color elicits positive or negative feelings. While particular colors have been found to be highly preferred regardless of age, racial group, or culture (Adams & Osgood, 1973, Eysenck, 1941), there is some evidence that color preference may be culturally-based. For example, Choungourian (1968) found that the colors red and blue were the most preferred colors among American subjects, but were less preferred in other cultures. In a comparision of Japanese and Korean subjects, Saito (1996) found unique color preference tendencies between the two countries, and also with respect to age, gender, and geographical region within the individual country. In an investigation of children's emotional associations with colors, Boyatzis and Varghese (1994) found that light colors (e.g., yellow, blue) are associated with positive emotions (e.g., happy, strong) and dark colors (e.g., black, gray) with negative emotions (e.g., sad, angry). In a study examining color-emotion associations among college students in Australia, Hemphill (1996) also found that bright colors elicited mainly positive emotional associations, while dark colors elicited negative emotional associations, confirming the results obtained by Boyatzis and Varghese (1994). However, Saito (1996) found that the color black elicited both negative and positive responses among Japanese subjects, and that black was often a preferred color among young people. Colors can also be described in temperature terms, such as ""warm"" or ""cool""as related to the dominant wavelength of the color. The cool colors (e. …","[{'authorId': '51927381', 'name': 'Naz Kaya'}, {'authorId': '33892088', 'name': 'H.

Both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems are investigated. The communication between agents is modelled by a directed signed graph, where the negative (positive) edges represent the antagonistic (cooperative) interactions among agents. Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)-based approach is used to derive the distributed protocol for the follower agent to achieve bipartite tracking of the leader. It is shown that solving the bipartite tracking problem over the structurally balanced signed graph is equivalent to solving the cooperative tracking problem over a corresponding graph with nonnegative edge weights. This bridges the gap between the newly raised bipartite tracking problem and the well-studied cooperative tracking problem. Three novel control protocols are proposed for both cooperative and bipartite output tracking of heterogeneous linear multi-agent systems. Numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of our control protocols.","[{'authorId': '48617414', 'name': 'Qiang Jiao'}, {'authorId': '2143636096', 'name': 'Hongwei Zhang'}, {'authorId': '35028307', 'name': 'Shengyuan Xu'}, {'authorId': '144441675', 'name': 'F.

The Brief Services psychotherapy paradigm has evolved to produce cost-effective and clinically significant outcomes in children's mental health. Though its clinical evaluation is still in its infancy, it has been utilized to a much lesser degree with autism spectrum disorders, which typically require a longer-term approach to psychotherapy treatment.


PURPOSE
The current paper introduces a novel, four-session intervention that aims to decrease anxiety experienced by clients presenting with high-functioning autism. Externalizing Metaphors Therapy is based upon the externalization of problems, transformation of metaphoric imagery, shifting of maladaptive emotional schemas, and the generalization of problems. A case study is utilized to visually aid in the understanding of this new treatment intervention.


SOURCE
A composite literature review was conducted with regards to significant works in Narrative Therapy, treatment interventions for anxiety and high functioning autism, evidence-based treatments for anxiety, and practice based approaches in psychotherapy. Works were selected based on their relevance to the research filed of anxiety and autism.


CONCLUSIONS
This clinical research challenges the children's mental health field in addressing anxiety and high-functioning autism from a brief framework. Further clinical research is needed to clinically evaluate the current model.","[{'authorId': '7151618', 'name': 'Everett McGuinty'}, {'authorId': '37401269', 'name': 'Brian M.

In particular, we describe the Empathic Companion, an animated interface agent that accompanies the user in the setting of a virtual job interview. This interface application takes physiological data (skin conductance and electromyography) of a user in realtime, interprets them as emotions, and addresses the user's affective states in the form of empathic feedback. The Empathic Companion is conceived as an educational agent that supports job seekers preparing for a job interview. We also present results from an exploratory study that aims to evaluate the impact of the Empathic Companion by measuring users' skin conductance and heart rate. While an overall positive effect of the Empathic Companion could not be shown, the outcome of the experiment suggests that empathic feedback has a positive effect on the interviewee's stress level while hearing the interviewer question.","[{'authorId': '2356111', 'name': 'H.

e3e5f4e91fec0ad446041912183471bf1b8d9cd6,"The present dissertation investigated the effect of individual variables on the perception of emotional nonverbal behaviors of an empathic virtual agent. Prior studies have reported the importance of implementing empathy in virtual agents regarding maximizing the quality of human–agent interactions. As studies in human–human interactions demonstrate, nonverbal behaviors play a significant role in the transfer of meanings and intentions between the interlocutors. Therefore, the aim of this dissertation was to examine how individual variables influence the perception of the nonverbal behaviors of an agent. The nonverbal behaviors were specifically created to express the empathizing intention of the virtual agent. In this regard, three empirical studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of users’ age (Study 1), users’ cultural background (Study 2), and users’ cultural stereotypes toward the agent (Study 3) on the perception of an empathic agent. 
The results of Study 1 provide important insights into the understanding of how users of varying ages perceive an agent’s emotional nonverbal responses. Older users observed to be more sensible to nonverbal behaviors of the agent since they perceived the agent as more empathic compared with younger adults. The higher perception of the older users was based on the agent’s displayed nonverbal behaviors, indicating the importance of implementing emotional nonverbal behaviors specifically for this target group. Moreover, there were differences between older and younger adults with respect to perceiving specific nonverbal behaviors as empathic. 
The culture of the users in Study 2 was also found to have an influence on users’ perception of an agent. Comparing Iranian and German users (as the examples of relatively collectivistic and individualistic cultures) showed differences regarding users’ perception of the agent’s nonverbal behaviors. While Iranian participants rated a wide array of nonverbal behaviors as empathic, their German peers perceived one specific nonverbal behavior only as the most empathic one. This is where the factor of culture becomes a matter of concern. In order for a virtual agent to look more emphatic, users’ culture should be considered while implementing nonverbal behaviors. 
And finally, in Study 3, it was observed that users do not show stereotypical attitudes toward the agent when they are aware that the agent is designed and produced in a different country. Users who were primed about the country of the agent did not show different ratings of empathic behaviors of the agent in the presence of emotional nonverbal behaviors. The findings of this study make valuable contributions to the research in the domain of bias toward the agent. It can be stated that as long as there are no cues in the appearance of the agent representing a different culture, users do not get biased toward its emotional responses. 
Taken together, this dissertation provides insight into understanding that user variables indeed matter and they can influence accurately perceiving the emotional nonverbal behaviors of virtual agents. Since the purpose of designing an empathic agent is to enhance users’ experiences and satisfaction, the factors that have the potential to impact their perception of an empathic agent should be considered when designing a virtual agent.","[{'authorId': '2135335482', 'name': 'Adineh Hosseinpanah Ghasabeh'}]",1.0,"{'name': '', 'volume': ''}",0.0,Investigating the Effect of User Variables on Perceiving the Emotional Nonverbal Behaviors of an Empathic Virtual Agent,2020.0

We examine whether conversational agents' response styles under varying abuse types influence those emotions found to mitigate peoples' aggressive behaviors, involving three verbal abuse types (Insult, Threat, Swearing) and three response styles (Avoidance, Empathy, Counterattacking). Ninety-eight participants were assigned to one of the abuse type conditions, interacted with the three spoken (voice-based) CAs in turn, and reported their feelings about guiltiness, anger, and shame after each session. The results show that the agent's response style has a significant effect on user emotions. Participants were less angry and more guilty with the empathy agent than the other two agents.

Based upon past findings on the effectiveness of four 10-minutes sessions, the research team used refined methods to examine the effects of these sessions on 102 secondary science teachers. Teachers who took part in the simulated activities significantly increased their targeted behaviors compared to colleagues who had not taken part in the simulation activities. These results of behavior changes that occurred in the simulation were found to transfer back to the real classroom settings for the experimental group (simulation use). Results from this study further validates the impact of simulation in teacher education, showing professional learning in virtual-reality simulated classrooms can positively impact targeted teaching practices in a concentrated amount of time.","[{'authorId': '21764819', 'name': 'L.

Also, most studies with SAD participants fail to evaluate social presence, although it may be a more appropriate indicator for virtual social stress scenarios than physical presence. Hence, for the first time, this study sets out to examine the link between social presence, physical presence, and emotional responses to phobogenic virtual social stimuli. A group of n = 12 participants with SAD and n = 12 healthy controls were exposed to three social tasks in an interactive virtual environment (VE). Self-report measures of physical and social presence as well as state anxiety were used alongside heart rate measures to evaluate the virtual experience. Results show significantly higher anxiety levels-both self-report and physiological-in SAD participants than in controls. Also, socially anxious subjects reported to experience more copresence and mutual attention as well as a higher sense of being in the VE than their healthy peers. In sum, social presence experiences may be more predicative of the anxiety response in SAD individuals than physical presence. Especially attentional processes seem to crucially shape the interplay between presence and affective responses.","[{'authorId': '2144008', 'name': 'A.

If the SPI personality traits are representative of the domain of non-Big Five personality traits, then the major source of the variance in the SPI traits would be expected to correlate strongly with the sixth factor of personality, Honesty-Humility. We tested this hypothesis using self-report measures (N = 200) of the SPI traits, of the Big Five, and of the new six-dimensional (""HEXACO"") structure. Results indicated that the first unrotated factor underlying the 10 SPI traits was heavily saturated with variance from Honesty-Humility (r = .65).

Hints may directly convey information or may point to information the student already possesses. Another tactic prompts the student in a step-by-step manner (in a directed line of reasoning) to an answer. Our tutors generated 315 hints and directed lines of reasoning in 30 hr of tutoring.

e5477563a138fa4dcceda35eab4f539408765276,"This paper presents a realistic visual speech synthesis based on the hybrid concatenation method. Unlike previous methods based on phoneme level unit selection or hidden Markov model (HMM), etc., the hybrid concatenation method uses a frame level-based unit selection method combined with a fused HMM, and is able to generate more expressive and stable facial animations. The fused HMM can be used to explicitly model the loose synchronization of tightly coupled streams, with much better results than a normal HMM for audiovisual mapping. After fused HMM is created, facial animation is generated via the unit selection method at the frame level by using the fused HMM output probabilities. To accelerate the computing efficiency of the unit selection on a large corpus, this paper also proposes a two-layer Viterbi search method in which only the subsets that have been selected in the first layer are further checked in the second layer. Using this idea, the system has been successfully integrated into real-time applications. Furthermore, the paper also proposes a mapping method to generate emotional facial expressions from neutral facial expressions based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). Final experiments prove that the method described can output synthesized facial parameters with high quality. Compared with other audiovisual mapping methods, our method has better performance with respect to expressiveness, stability, and system running speed.","[{'authorId': '37670752', 'name': 'J.

Total of 4872 participants from 31 provinces and autonomous regions were involved in the current study. Besides demographics and social media exposure (SME), depression was assessed by The Chinese version of WHO-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and anxiety was assessed by Chinese version of generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7). multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify associations between social media exposure with mental health problems after controlling for covariates. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and combination of depression and anxiety (CDA) was 48.3% (95%CI: 46.9%-49.7%), 22.6% (95%CI: 21.4%-23.8%) and 19.4% (95%CI: 18.3%-20.6%) during COVID-19 outbroke in Wuhan, China.

In general, older participants were found to be less accurate at recognizing emotions, with the most distinctive age difference pertaining to a certain group of negative emotions. Both modalities revealed an age-related decline in the recognition of sadness and -- to a lesser degree -- anger, starting at about 30 years of age. Although age-related differences in the recognition of expression of emotion were not mediated by personality traits, 2 of the Big 5 traits, openness and conscientiousness, made an independent contribution to emotion-recognition performance.

Estimating these costs and identifying their predictors is important for appropriate service planning. We aimed to measure use of health services in an adult population who had experienced war in the former-Yugoslavia on average 8 years previously, and to identify characteristics associated with the use and costs of healthcare. Method War-affected community samples in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, FYR Macedonia, and Serbia were recruited through a random walk technique. Refugees in Germany, Italy and the UK were contacted through registers, organisations and networking. Current service use was measured for the previous three months and combined with unit costs for each country for the year 2006/7. A two-part approach was used, to identify predictors of service use with a multiple logistic regression model and predictors of cost with a generalised linear regression model. Results 3,313 participants were interviewed in Balkan countries and 854 refugees in Western European countries. In the Balkan countries, traumatic events and mental health status were related to greater service use while in Western countries these associations were not found. Participants in Balkan countries with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) had costs that were 63% higher (p = 0.005) than those without PTSD. Distress experienced during the most traumatic war event was associated with higher costs (p = 0.013). In Western European countries costs were 76% higher if non-PTSD anxiety disorders were present (0.027) and 63% higher for mood disorders (p = 0.006). Conclusions War experiences and their effects on mental health are associated with increased health care costs even many years later, especially for those who stayed in the area of conflict. Focussing on the mental health impact of war is important for many reasons including those of an economic nature.","[{'authorId': '1398678313', 'name': 'R.

VR-based testing and training scenarios that would be difficult, if not impossible, to deliver using conventional neuropsychological methods are now being developed that take advantage of the assets available with VR technology. If empirical studies continue to demonstrate effectiveness, virtual environment applications could provide new options for targeting cognitive and functional impairments due to traumatic brain injury, neurological disorders, and learning disabilities. This article focuses on specifying the assets that are available with VR for neuropsychological applications along with discussion of current VR-based research that serves to illustrate each asset. VR allows for the precise presentation and control of dynamic multi-sensory 3D stimulus environments, as well as providing advanced methods for recording behavioural responses. This serves as the basis for a diverse set of VR assets for neuropsychological approaches that are detailed in this article. We take the position that when combining these assets within the context of functionally relevant, ecologically valid virtual environments, fundamental advancements can emerge in how human cognition and functional behaviour is assessed and rehabilitated.","[{'authorId': '29861580', 'name': 'A.

The aim of this study was to assess how the individual differences in self-reported emotion regulation strategy use relate to levels of both positive and negative psychological well-being. In total, 56 individuals with ASD aged 14–24 years (Mage = 18.15; SDage = 2.30) completed Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 Generalized Anxiety Disorder Dimensional Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale and Autism-Spectrum Quotient – Short. Individuals were grouped into four clusters based on their Emotion Regulation Questionnaire subscale scores. Individuals in the high suppression and low reappraisal group expressed higher depressive symptoms and lower positive well-being when compared with the low suppression and high reappraisal group. Interestingly, individuals who self-reported using both high suppression and reappraisal expressed relatively high positive well-being and low depression symptoms. We suggest that the maladaptive effect of habitual suppression usage may be buffered by the habitual use of reappraisal, and this interaction between adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation strategy use has clinical implications.","[{'authorId': '11450626', 'name': 'R.

In the real-time domain, there is also a need to deliver realistic virtual characters, with the increase in popularity of interactive drama video games (such as L.A. Noire™ or Heavy Rain™). There have been mixed reactions from audiences to lifelike characters used in movies and games, with some saying that the increased realism highlights subtle imperfections, which can be disturbing. Some developers opt for a stylized rendering (such as cartoon-shading) to avoid a negative reaction [Thompson 2004].

A paradigm that examines whether someone can perceive and benefit from regulatory efforts by another person, represented here by a virtual agent, would be highly relevant for experimental studies investigating social emotion regulation, as well as for interventions in the clinical and sub-clinical context. Virtual reality (VR) provides perhaps the ideal opportunity to test social interactions and difficulties with them, as it counters typical methodological problems of behavioral experiments, such as the trade-off between ecological validity and experimental control, as well as the difficulty of replicating social situations. The goal of the present methods paper is twofold: to provide a detailed description of the development of a novel paradigm consisting of two scenarios in VR designed to test the efficacy of social emotion regulation, and to present the anticipated results for the target populations of typically developing and autistic youth. Participants are presented with a virtual school environment and take part in two activities with a class of students and a teacher, all of whom are virtual agents. In both scenarios, participants experience a potentially stressful situation and are subsequently offered emotional support by a friendly student. Throughout the experiment, self-reports in the form of virtual smiley scales and psychophysiological measurements are collected as markers of the participants’ emotional states. Pilot results will be discussed in line with anticipated outcomes, to indicate that the experiment will be able to show the efficacy of social support by a virtual agent and provide insight into social emotion regulation for different populations.

ea8b33fab85c2bc5161956ce72c8990a5ad79075,"Abstract. Whether and when should we show data in 3D is an on-going debate in communities conducting visualization research. A strong opposition exists in the information visualization (Infovis) community, and seemingly unnecessary/unwarranted use of 3D, e.g., in plots, bar or pie charts, is heavily criticized. The scientific visualization (Scivis) community, on the other hand, is more supportive of the use of 3D as it allows ‘seeing’ invisible phenomena, or designing and printing things that are used in e.g., surgeries, educational settings etc. Geographic visualization (Geovis) stands between the Infovis and Scivis communities. In geographic information science, most visuo-spatial analyses have been sufficiently conducted in 2D or 2.5D, including analyses related to terrain and much of the urban phenomena. On the other hand, there has always been a strong interest in 3D, with similar motivations as in Scivis community. Among many types of 3D visualizations, a popular one that is exploited both for visual analysis and visualization is the highly realistic (geo)virtual environments. Such environments may be engaging and memorable for the viewers because they offer highly immersive experiences. However, it is not yet well-established if we should opt to show the data in 3D; and if yes, a) what type of 3D we should use, b) for what task types, and c) for whom. In this paper, we identify some of the central arguments for and against the use of 3D visualizations around these three considerations in a concise interdisciplinary literature review.","[{'authorId': '2535219', 'name': 'A.

eaa28a169132d2c25bdb7b0c99ab2e6df45ce1cb,"Virtually everything that man is and does is associated with space. Man's sense of space is a synthesis of many sensory inputs: visual, auditory, kinesthetic, olfactory, and thermal. Not only does each of these constitute a complex system (as for example, the dozen or more different ways of experiencing depth visually), but each is molded and patterned by culture. Hence people reared in different cultures live in different sensory worlds. What is more, they are generally unaware of the degree to which the worlds may differ. From the study of culture we learn that the patterning of perceptual worlds is a function not only of the specific culture but of the relationship, activity, and emotions present in a given situation. Therefore, when two people of different cultures interact, each uses different criteria to interpret the other's behavior, and each may easily misinterpret the relationship, the activity, or the emotions involved. The study of culture in the proxemic sense is the study of peoples' use of their perceptual apparatus in different emotional states during different activities, in different relationships, settings, and contexts. No single research technique is sufficient in scope to investigate this complex, multi-dimensional subject. The research technique is, therefore, a function of the particular facet under examination at the time and many call for the involvement of many disciplines. Like all basic studies of the communicative process, proxemics, as I think of it, is more concerned with how than why, and more concerned with structure than content. The work is admittedly detailed and is apt to be routine. It addresses itself to basic human situations in an area of culture that is ordinarily hidden from conscious awareness. For this reason, proxemics frequently leads to new insights about specific cultures, as well as to insights into the generalized concept of culture itself. In formulating my thinking concerning proxemics, I have maintained that culture is an extension of basic biological processes. While man's extensions as they evolve may mask the underlying relationships which maintain the equilibrium of biological systems, the relationships and systems are no less real by virtue of being hidden. In the words of Ian McHarg (1963): ...no species can exist without an environment, no species can exist in an environment of its exclusive creation, no species can survive, save as a nondisruptive member of an ecological community. Every member must adjust to other members of the community and to the environment in order to survive. Man is not excluded from this test.","[{'authorId': '1422357475', 'name': 'E.

eacf974e235add458efb815ada1e5b82a05878fa,"This paper describes a probabilistic framework for faithful reproduction of dynamic facial expressions on a synthetic face model with MPEG-4 facial animation parameters (FAPs) while achieving very low bitrate in data transmission. The framework consists of a coupled Bayesian network (BN) to unify the facial expression analysis and synthesis into one coherent structure. At the analysis end, we cast the FAPs and facial action coding system (FACS) into a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to account for uncertainties in FAP extraction and to model the dynamic evolution of facial expressions. At the synthesizer, a static BN reconstructs the FAPs and their intensity. The two BNs are connected statically through a data stream link. Using the coupled BN to analyze and synthesize the dynamic facial expressions is the major novelty of this work. The novelty brings about several benefits. First, very low bitrate (9 bytes per frame) in data transmission can be achieved. Second, a facial expression is inferred through both spatial and temporal inference so that the perceptual quality of animation is less affected by the misdetected FAPs. Third, more realistic looking facial expressions can be reproduced by modelling the dynamics of human expressions.","[{'authorId': '2108177161', 'name': 'Yongmian Zhang'}, {'authorId': '50426357', 'name': 'Q.

We aim to compare the efficacy of caudal block versus dorsal penile block (DPNB) under general anesthesia for children undergoing circumcision. Methods This study was performed between July 1, 2009 and October 16, 2009. Fifty male children American Society of Anesthesiolgists physical status classification I, aged between 3 and 12 were included in this randomized, prospective, comparative study. Anesthetic techniques were standardized for all children. Patients were randomized into 2 groups. Using 0.25% 0.5 ml/kg levobupivacain, we performed DPNB for Group 1 and caudal block for Group 2. Postoperative analgesia was evaluated for six hours with the Flacc Pain Scale for five categories; (F) Face, (L) Legs, (A) Activity, (C) Cry, and (C) Consolability. For every child, supplemental analgesic amounts, times, and probable local or systemic complications were recorded. Results No significant difference between the groups (P > 0.05) was found in mean age, body weight, anesthesia duration, FLACC pain, and sedation scores (P > 0.05). However, on subsequent measurements, a significant decrease of pain and sedation scores was noted in both the DPNB group and the caudal block group (P < 0.001). No major complication was found when using either technique. Conclusions DPNB and caudal block provided similar postoperative analgesic effects without major complications for children under general anesthesia.","[{'authorId': '2815671', 'name': 'S.

eb5583763621788b6a1c8dfe25091dc20a21e4b1,"Background A World Health Organization 2017 report stated that major depression affects almost 5% of the human population. Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short- and long-term positive outcomes. Objective This study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression. Methods In the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations. Results The average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre- and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging. Conclusions The real-world data evaluation findings on the effectiveness and engagement levels of Wysa app on users with self-reported symptoms of depression show promise. However, further work is required to validate these initial findings in much larger samples and across longer periods.","[{'authorId': '46691130', 'name': 'B.

ebb734ab78d7e755566c977997e39a3935878b92,"As the transformative potential of AI has become increasingly salient as a matter of public and political interest, there has been growing discussion about the need to ensure that AI broadly benefits humanity. This in turn has spurred debate on the social responsibilities of large technology companies to serve the interests of society at large. In response, ethical principles and codes of conduct have been proposed to meet the escalating demand for this responsibility to be taken seriously. As yet, however, few institutional innovations have been suggested to translate this responsibility into legal commitments which apply to companies positioned to reap large financial gains from the development and use of AI. This paper offers one potentially attractive tool for addressing such issues: the Windfall Clause, which is an ex ante commitment by AI firms to donate a significant amount of any eventual extremely large profits. By this we mean an early commitment that profits that a firm could not earn without achieving fundamental, economically transformative breakthroughs in AI capabilities will be donated to benefit humanity broadly, with particular attention towards mitigating any downsides from deployment of windfall-generating AI.","[{'authorId': '1435765036', 'name': ""Cullen O'Keefe""}, {'authorId': '119127731', 'name': 'P.

However, an effect size associated with the difference between the trajectories of the intervention and control groups that captures the treatment effect is rarely reported. This article first reviews 2 classes of formulas for effect sizes associated with classical repeated-measures designs that use the standard deviation of either change scores or raw scores for the denominator. It then broadens the scope to subsume GMA and demonstrates that the independent groups, within-subjects, pretest-posttest control-group, and GMA designs all estimate the same effect size when the standard deviation of raw scores is uniformly used. Finally, the article shows that the correct effect size for treatment efficacy in GMA--the difference between the estimated means of the 2 groups at end of study (determined from the coefficient for the slope difference and length of study) divided by the baseline standard deviation--is not reported in clinical trials.","[{'authorId': '49181099', 'name': 'A.

ebfa57a9c9ef9556a97087b3ad901702464467ac,"With each eye movement, stationary objects in the world change position on the retina, yet we perceive the world as stable. Spatial updating, or remapping, is one neural mechanism by which the brain compensates for shifts in the retinal image caused by voluntary eye movements. Remapping of a visual representation is believed to arise from a widespread neural circuit including parietal and frontal cortex. The current experiment tests the hypothesis that extrastriate visual areas in human cortex have access to remapped spatial information. We tested this hypothesis using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We first identified the borders of several occipital lobe visual areas using standard retinotopic techniques. We then tested subjects while they performed a single-step saccade task analogous to the task used in neurophysiological studies in monkeys, and two conditions that control for visual and motor effects. We analyzed the fMRI time series data with a nonlinear, fully Bayesian hierarchical statistical model. We identified remapping as activity in the single-step task that could not be attributed to purely visual or oculomotor effects. The strength of remapping was roughly monotonic with position in the visual hierarchy: remapped responses were largest in areas V3A and hV4 and smallest in V1 and V2. These results demonstrate that updated visual representations are present in cortical areas that are directly linked to visual perception.","[{'authorId': '2569921', 'name': 'E.

If this information is available, the prospects for inference depend critically on the population relationship between the variables defining reference groups and those directly affecting outcomes.

ecb4b28c5ef9be94e2c34a55f42b40a54ff500fb,"Naturalistic affective expressions change at a rate much slower than the typical rate at which video or audio is recorded. This increases the probability that consecutive recorded instants of expressions represent the same affective content. In this paper, we exploit such a relationship to improve the recognition performance of continuous naturalistic affective expressions. Using datasets of naturalistic affective expressions (AVEC 2011 audio and video dataset, PAINFUL video dataset) continuously labeled over time and over different dimensions, we analyze the transitions between levels of those dimensions (e.g., transitions in pain intensity level). We use an information theory approach to show that the transitions occur very slowly and hence suggest modeling them as first-order Markov models. The dimension levels are considered to be the hidden states in the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework. Their discrete transition and emission matrices are trained by using the labels provided with the training set. The recognition problem is converted into a best path-finding problem to obtain the best hidden states sequence in HMMs. This is a key difference from previous use of HMMs as classifiers. Modeling of the transitions between dimension levels is integrated in a multistage approach, where the first level performs a mapping between the affective expression features and a soft decision value (e.g., an affective dimension level), and further classification stages are modeled as HMMs that refine that mapping by taking into account the temporal relationships between the output decision labels. The experimental results for each of the unimodal datasets show overall performance to be significantly above that of a standard classification system that does not take into account temporal relationships. In particular, the results on the AVEC 2011 audio dataset outperform all other systems presented at the international competition.","[{'authorId': '37192632', 'name': 'H.

ee3569a2cf92992ebaab6a400a5fb0580c1253e6,"Most Interactive Storytelling systems developed to date have followed a task-based approach to story representation, using planning techniques to drive the story by generating a sequence of actions, which essentially “solve” the task to which the story is equated. One major limitation of this approach has been that it fails to incorporate characters’ psychology, and as a consequence important aesthetic aspects of the narrative cannot be easily captured by Interactive Storytelling. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to Interactive Storytelling which aims at reconciling narrative actions with the characters’ attributed psychology as stated in the narrative. Our long-term goal is to be able to explore Interactive Storytelling for those narrative genres which are based on the characters’ psychology rather than solely on their actions. We used as a starting point the formalisation by Flaubert himself of his novel Madame Bovary, which includes a detailed account of character’s desires and feelings. We describe a prototype in which characters’ behaviour is driven by a real-time searchbased planning system applying operators whose content is based on a specific inventory of feelings. Furthermore, the actual pattern of evolution of the character’s plan, as measured through the variation of the search heuristic, is used to confer a sense of awareness to the characters, which can be used to generate feelings about its overall situation, from feelings of boredom to hope, despair and helplessness.","[{'authorId': '1691265', 'name': 'D.

The study contains a literature survey of feedback in the language classroom, interviews with language teachers and their students about their attitudes towards pronunciation feedback, and observations of how feedback is given in their classrooms. The study was carried out using focus group meetings, individual semi-structured interviews and classroom observations. The feedback strategies that were advocated and observed in the study on pronunciation feedback from human teachers were implemented in a computer-animated language tutor giving articulation feedback. The virtual tutor was subsequently tested in a user trial and evaluated with a questionnaire.

If the virtual audience seems attentive, well-behaved, and interested, if they show positive facial expressions with complimentary actions such as clapping and nodding, does the speaker infer correspondingly positive evaluations of performance and show fewer signs of anxiety? On the other hand, if the audience seems hostile, disinterested, and visibly bored, if they have negative facial expressions and exhibit reactions such as head-shaking, loud yawning, turning away, falling asleep, and walking out, does the speaker infer correspondingly negative evaluations of performance and show more signs of anxiety? We set out to study this question during the summer of 1998. We designed a virtual public speaking scenario, followed by an experimental study. We wanted mainly to explore the effectiveness of virtual environments (VEs) in psychotherapy for social phobias. Rather than plunge straight in and design a virtual reality therapy tool, we first tackled the question of whether real people's emotional responses are appropriate to the behavior of the virtual people with whom they may interact. The project used DIVE (Distributive Interactive Virtual Environment) as the basis for constructing a working prototype of a virtual public speaking simulation. We constructed as a Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) model, a virtual seminar room that matched the actual seminar room in which subjects completed their various questionnaires and met with the experimenters.","[{'authorId': '144931212', 'name': 'M.

In our proposal, when the description of the current situation reveals that a moral value is 'at stake', the moral goal of re-establishing the threatened value is included among the active goals. The compliance with values generates positive emotions like pride and admiration, while the opposite brings to shame and self-reproach. 
 
During the deliberation phase, the agent appraises her plans in terms of the emotional reward they are expected to yield, given the trade off between moral and individual goals. In this phase, the emotional reward affects the agent's choices about her behavior. After the execution phase, one's and others' actions are appraised again in terms of the agent's values, giving rise to moral emotions. 
 
The paper shows how emotional appraisal can be coupled with the choice among possible lines of action, presenting a mapping between plans and emotions that integrates and extends preceding proposals.","[{'authorId': '2559167', 'name': 'C.

In this paper, we first propose and evaluate plug-and-play methods for controllable response generation, which does not require dialogue specific datasets and does not rely on fine-tuning a large model.

To overcome this, we introduce an approach that does not require further computation at decoding time, while also does not require any fine-tuning of a large language model.

It is increasingly being used to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions ranging from clinical therapy to national public health legislation. Whereas the design shares many properties of regression-based approaches in other epidemiological studies, there are a range of unique features of time series data that require additional methodological considerations. In this tutorial we use a worked example to demonstrate a robust approach to ITS analysis using segmented regression. We begin by describing the design and considering when ITS is an appropriate design choice. We then discuss the essential, yet often omitted, step of proposing the impact model a priori. Subsequently, we demonstrate the approach to statistical analysis including the main segmented regression model. Finally we describe the main methodological issues associated with ITS analysis: over-dispersion of time series data, autocorrelation, adjusting for seasonal trends and controlling for time-varying confounders, and we also outline some of the more complex design adaptations that can be used to strengthen the basic ITS design.","[{'authorId': '145533527', 'name': 'J.

Some people who find it hard to manage their emotions can be helped by a therapy called Dialectic Behaviour Therapy (DBT). Some studies show that DBT might help people with an intellectual disability. 
We ran a group to see if DBT helped people coming to the group to feel better and manage their difficult feelings more easily. Group members brought their support staff to the group. 
We asked people what they thought about the group and asked them to fill in some questionnaires to see whether they felt better. 
The group seemed to help people, even after the group ended. 
We think DBT might be a useful treatment for people with intellectual disabilities. 
 
 
AbstractBackground 
A growing body of evidence supports the use of Dialectic Behaviour Therapy with people with an intellectual disability. Various adaptation have been used in studies exploring the efficacy of this intervention. 
 
Method 
A Dialectic Behaviour Therapy DBT skills training group was attended by people with an intellectual disability and their support staff. Standardised measures of psychological well-being, overall functioning and psychological distress were taken before and after the group and at 4 months follow-up. Qualitative interviews were conducted and analysed using thematic analysis. 
 
Results 
Results suggested an improvement in all areas for three of the four participants, which were largely maintained at follow-up. 
 
Conclusions 
This study adds to the growing literature supporting the use of DBT with people with an intellectual disability. The role of support workers in supporting generalisation of skills is considered. Ideas for improving the quality of future studies are considered.","[{'authorId': '144582541', 'name': 'Tom Crossland'}, {'authorId': '5973374', 'name': 'O.

The combination of these cues in the analysis of social communication, however, has been a virtually neglected area of inquiry. Two studies were conducted to test the prediction that direct gaze would facilitate the processing of facially communicated approach-oriented emotions (e.g., anger and joy), whereas averted gaze would facilitate the processing of facially communicated avoidance-oriented emotions (e.g., fear and sadness). The results of both studies confirmed the central hypothesis and suggest that gaze direction and facial expression are combined in the processing of emotionally relevant facial information.","[{'authorId': '2075454382', 'name': 'R.

Eighty women in unacquainted groups of 4 completed round robin trait ratings and predictions about extraversion-related behaviors. Each S then had a 5-min videotaped 1-on-l interaction with each of the other group members. Behaviors corresponding to those predicted were coded from the videotapes. Significant consensus was obtained for ratings of Extraversion and for behavioral predictions. Cross-partner consistency emerged for all coded behaviors. Although predictions of behavior were not accurate at the dyadic level, significant generalized accuracy did emerge. Thus, if a person was consensually predicted to be talkative, for example, that person tended to be talkative across partners. Results are discussed in relation to the accuracy of interpersonal perception and Swann's (1984) theory of pragmatic accuracy. As social psychologists, we have long been amazed by how quickly human perceivers form judgments based on very limited information. We have taken advantage of this proclivity by giving subjects limited stimulus information and then examining the effect of that information on human judgment. This research often demonstrates the inadequacies of snap judgments. Some (e.g., Funder, 1987) have criticized this type of research because of its limited generalizability. Particularly relevant to the issue of generalizability is the accuracy of snap judgments. Many social psychologists believe that snap judgments are based on stereotypes and heuristics and are, therefore, not likely to be very accurate. Although common sense would seem to point to the view that perceptions based on limited information are likely to be quite erroneous, people not only make snap judgments but also use them as a primary basis for guiding future interaction. For example, individuals often base their decisions about who to get to know better and who to avoid in the future on snap judgments. Given that interpersonal perceptions based on minimal information can have dramatic effects on social outcomes, the accuracy of those initial perceptions is a critical question for research in interpersonal perception. Specifically, do initial perceptions provide a reasonable basis for inferring future behavior? The accuracy of snap judgments is the major focus of this article.","[{'authorId': '7526013', 'name': 'Maurice J. Levesque'}, {'authorId': '2060895', 'name': 'D.

f106e3afbdd01022962d7a73a847869d0534a036,In this contribution we introduce speech emotion recognition by use of continuous hidden Markov models. Two methods are propagated and compared throughout the paper. Within the first method a global statistics framework of an utterance is classified by Gaussian mixture models using derived features of the raw pitch and energy contour of the speech signal. A second method introduces increased temporal complexity applying continuous hidden Markov models considering several states using low-level instantaneous features instead of global statistics. The paper addresses the design of working recognition engines and results achieved with respect to the alluded alternatives. A speech corpus consisting of acted and spontaneous emotion samples in German and English language is described in detail. Both engines have been tested and trained using this equivalent speech corpus. Results in recognition of seven discrete emotions exceeded 86% recognition rate. As a basis of comparison the similar judgment of human deciders classifying the same corpus at 79.8% recognition rate was analyzed.,"[{'authorId': '145411696', 'name': 'Björn Schuller'}, {'authorId': '145512909', 'name': 'G.

f1089e7b0eefd6feee6c3edfdb3a17aacf1ddd2e,"We report on a study of affective states of learners in a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) and the interplay of Affect, Behavior and Cognition at various stages of the course. Affect is measured through a series of self-reports from learners at strategic time posts during the period of study. Behavior is characterized in terms of a learners' engagement, interactivity, impatience and reflectivity, which constitute a set of novel high-level features derived from the clickstream of learner interactions. Cognition is evaluated from the performance of learners on assessments that are part of the course. We discover that learners in the MOOC experience multiple as well as mixed emotions as they go through the course, which we handle using the psychological dimensions of arousal and valence. This results in a set of emotional quadrants, whose co-occurrence analysis reveals a strong association with cognition and specific behavioral characteristics demonstrated by the learner. These results advance our understanding of the experience of MOOC learners to a more holistic level across the key dimensions of affect, behavior and cognition. They also have important implications for the design of the next generation MOOCs that can potentially leverage affect and behavior-aware interventions to drive greater personalization and eventually, improved learning outcomes.","[{'authorId': '2099539780', 'name': 'S.

These ``forces'' are not directly exerted by the pedestrians' personal environment, but they are a measure for the internal motivations of the individuals to perform certain actions (movements). The corresponding force concept is discussed in more detail and can also be applied to the description of other behaviors. In the presented model of pedestrian behavior several force terms are essential: first, a term describing the acceleration towards the desired velocity of motion; second, terms reflecting that a pedestrian keeps a certain distance from other pedestrians and borders; and third, a term modeling attractive effects. The resulting equations of motion of nonlinearly coupled Langevin equations. Computer simulations of crowds of interacting pedestrians show that the social force model is capable of describing the self-organization of several observed collective effects of pedestrian behavior very realistically.","[{'authorId': '1768825', 'name': 'D.

As a Latin proverb states: ‘The face is the portrait of the mind; the eyes, its informers’. This presents a significant challenge for Computer Graphics researchers who generate artificial entities that aim to replicate the movement and appearance of the human eye, which is so important in human–human interactions. This review article provides an overview of the efforts made on tackling this demanding task. As with many topics in computer graphics, a cross‐disciplinary approach is required to fully understand the workings of the eye in the transmission of information to the user. We begin with a discussion of the movement of the eyeballs, eyelids and the head from a physiological perspective and how these movements can be modelled, rendered and animated in computer graphics applications. Furthermore, we present recent research from psychology and sociology that seeks to understand higher level behaviours, such as attention and eye gaze, during the expression of emotion or during conversation. We discuss how these findings are synthesized in computer graphics and can be utilized in the domains of Human–Robot Interaction and Human–Computer Interaction for allowing humans to interact with virtual agents and other artificial entities. We conclude with a summary of guidelines for animating the eye and head from the perspective of a character animator.","[{'authorId': '38592832', 'name': 'K.

f22a8ab1dd90eea10f797d4e9f4fd46f5d6f4876,"This article describes a procedure for the study of destructive obedience in the laboratory. It consists of ordering a naive S to administer increasingly more severe punishment to a victim in the context of a learning experiment. Punishment is administered by means of a shock generator with 30 graded switches ranging from Slight Shock to Danger: Severe Shock. The victim is a confederate of the E. The primary dependent variable is the maximum shock the S is willing to administer before he refuses to continue further. 26 Ss obeyed the experimental commands fully, and administered the highest shock on the generator. 14 Ss broke off the experiment at some point after the victim protested and refused to provide further answers. The procedure created extreme levels of nervous tension in some Ss. Profuse sweating, trembling, and stuttering were typical expressions of this emotional disturbance. One unexpected sign of tension — yet to be explained — was the regular occurrence of nervous laughter, which in some Ss developed into uncontrollable seizures. The variety of interesting behavioral dynamics observed in the experiment, the reality of the situation for the S, and the possibility of parametric variation within the framework of the procedure, point to the fruitfulness of further study.1 OBEDIENCE is as basic an element in the structure of social life as one can point to. Some system of authority is a requirement of all communal living, and it is only the man dwelling in isolation who is not forced to respond, through defiance or submission, to the commands of others. Obedience, as a determinant of behavior, is of particular relevance to our time. It has been reliably established that from 1933–45 millions of innocent persons were systematically slaughtered on command. Gas chambers were built, death camps were guarded; daily quotas of corpses were produced with the same efficiency as the manufacture of appliances. These inhumane policies may have originated in the mind of a single person, but they could only be carried out on a massive scale if a very large number of persons obeyed orders. Obedience is the psychological mechanism that links individual action to political purpose. It is the dispositional cement that binds men to systems of authority. Facts of recent history and observation in daily life suggest that for many persons obedience may be a deeply ingrained behavior tendency, indeed a prepotent impulse overriding training in ethics, sympathy, and moral conduct. C. P. Snow (1961) points to its importance when he writes: When you think of the long and gloomy history of man, you will find more hideous crimes have been committed in the name of obedience than have ever been committed in the name of rebellion. If you doubt that, read William Shirer’s Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. The German Officer Corps were brought up in the most rigorous code of obedience . . . in the name of obedience they were party to, and assisted in, the most wicked large scale actions in the history of the world [p. 24].","[{'authorId': '40457603', 'name': 'S.

In particular, we have developed a model of multimodal behaviours that includes dynamism and complex facial expressions. The first feature refers to the qualitative execution of behaviours. Our model is based on perceptual studies and encompasses several parameters that modulate multimodal behaviours. The second feature, the model of complex expressions, follows a componential approach where a new expression is obtained by combining facial areas of other expressions. Lately we have been working on adding temporal dynamism to expressions. So far they have been designed statically, typically at their apex. Only full-blown expressions could be modelled. To overcome this limitation, we have defined a representation scheme that describes the temporal evolution of the expression of an emotion. It is no longer represented by a static definition but by a temporally ordered sequence of multimodal signals.","[{'authorId': '2250548269', 'name': 'Catherine Pelachaud'}]",130.0,,77.0,Modelling multimodal expression of emotion in a virtual agent,2009.0

Second, the authors argue that the available evidence does not show an unambiguous causal relation to emotions, and appraisals appear as consequences of emotions as well as antecedents.

We conducted a single-session observational lab study with 22 five-to-ten-year-old children as a step toward understanding whether and how children might transfer a linguistic routine they learned from a CA to a conversation with another person. We found that 68% of children spontaneously used this routine in a conversation with their parent in the lab, and 55% continued to use it at home. When addressing parents, children infused the routine with warmth and playfulness that they did not use when addressing the CA, adapting it to suit their relationship with their parent. However, only 18% of children used it in conversation with an unfamiliar researcher, where they instead were more likely to follow conventional conversational norms. These findings suggest children are quick to learn linguistic routines from CAs but use social differentiation when they apply them. Children’s willingness to expand on and share the routine with their parent is consistent with the principles of the Joint Media Engagement (JME) framework and suggests CAs may be a productive medium for creating JME experiences.","[{'authorId': '2749233', 'name': 'Alexis Hiniker'}, {'authorId': '115587490', 'name': 'Amelia Wang'}, {'authorId': '2114944348', 'name': 'Jonathan A.

Here we manipulated the emotional context with which affectively neutral stimuli were associated during encoding, allowing us to examine neural activity associated with retrieval of emotional memories without confounding the emotional attributes of cue items and the retrieved context. Using a source memory procedure we were also able to compare how retrieval processing was modulated when the emotional encoding context was recollected or not. An interaction between emotional encoding context and accuracy of source memory revealed that successful retrieval of emotional context was associated with activity in left amygdala, and a left frontotemporal network including anterior insula, prefrontal cortex and cingulate. In contrast, when contextual retrieval was unsuccessful, items encoded in emotional contexts elicited enhanced activity in right amygdala and a right-lateralized network that included extrastriate visual areas. These findings indicate distinct effects of emotion on successful and unsuccessful retrieval of source information, including lateralization of amygdala responses.","[{'authorId': '2109352605', 'name': 'A.

f5052b263015e58a3afe95590eae62ea7ffce887,"ABSTRACT This article examines the phenomenon of Virtual Interpersonal Touch (VIT), people touching one another via force-feedback haptic devices. As collaborative virtual environments become utilized more effectively, it is only natural that interactants will have the ability to touch one another. In the work presented here, we used relatively basic devices to begin to explore the expression of emotion through VIT. In Experiment 1, participants utilized a 2 DOF force-feedback joystick to express seven emotions. We examined various dimensions of the forces generated and subjective ratings of the difficulty of expressing those emotions. In Experiment 2, a separate group of participants attempted to recognize the recordings of emotions generated in Experiment 1. In Experiment 3, pairs of participants attempted to communicate the seven emotions using physical handshakes. Results indicated that humans were above chance when recognizing emotions via VIT but not as accurate as people expressing emotions through nonmediated handshakes. We discuss a theoretical framework for understanding emotions expressed through touch as well as the implications of the current findings for the utilization of VIT in human-computer interaction.","[{'authorId': '1737161', 'name': 'J.

As a result, level of empathic response can be used to infer how much one values the welfare of a person in need. Four experiments were conducted to test these ideas. Experiments 1 and 2 revealed that a similarity manipulation led to increased valuing of a similar person's welfare and, in turn, to increased empathy when this person was in need. Experiments 3 and 4 revealed that direct manipulations of empathy (perspective-taking instructions, or false physiological arousal feedback) led to increased empathy and, in turn, to increased valuing of the welfare of the person in need.

f544761c20d3ec59d52441437f3e1d05e907f637,"The problem we have addressed in this dissertation is that of designing a pragmatic and rich computer representation of emotions that is at least congenial with psychological theory. Our solution has focused on implementing a platform for reasoning about emotions that supports the testing of such theories. 
In the platform we model a multi-agent world and give simple affective life to agents in the form of rudimentary emotions and emotion-induced actions. In addition the agents are able to reason about emotion episodes that take place in one another's lives. The implementation includes representations for twenty-four emotion types (based on the work Ortony et al., 1988) and 1400 emotion-induced actions. Agents have rudimentary personalities, including an interpretive component which causes them to construe the world in idiosyncratic ways leading to emotional states, and an expressive component which give agents a unique profile for manifesting their emotions. Agents keep internal models of the concerns of other agents which allow them to explain the emotional episodes of other agents by classifying them as instances in which one or more of the twenty-four emotion types arise. 
The implementation is simulation-based. It has been run with up to forty agents at a time. Situations arise in the modeled world, agents respond to some of these in their own unique, emotional, ways. Emotion-induced actions are generated which may be placed back in the simulation queue and further perturb the system. Other agents observe and explain the situations using both strong-theory reasoning based on a set of emotion rules, and weak-theory reasoning using a case-based heuristic classification system.","[{'authorId': '6053516', 'name': 'C.

Conversational agents (CAs) can potentially act as joint-reading partners by engaging children in story-related, scaffolded conversations. In this project, we develop a CA reading partner that incorporates components of effective conversational guidance (i.e., questions to stimulate thinking, specific feedback, and adaptive scaffolding) and examine children's interactions with this CA. We identify patterns in children's language production, flow maintenance, and affect when responding to the CA. We then lay out a set of affordances and challenges for developing CAs as conversation partners. We propose that, rather than attempting to develop CAs as an exact replicate of human conversational partners, we should treat child-agent interaction as a new genre of conversation and calibrate CAs based on children's actual communicative practices and needs.","[{'authorId': '1739182484', 'name': 'Ying Xu'}, {'authorId': '2996242', 'name': 'M.

f5e61ef588ad90ec1d6349d23c8af8d00eaf457a,"When individuals experience empathy, they often seek to bolster others' well-being. But what do empathizers want others to feel? Though psychologists have studied empathy and prosociality for decades, this question has yet to be clearly addressed. This is because virtually all existing research focuses on a model under which improving others' well-being also comprises heightening their positive affect or decreasing their negative affect and helping them reach their own emotional goals. In this review, I argue that real-life empathic goals encompass a broader range-including sometimes worsening targets' affect or contravening their wishes in order to improve their well-being-that can be productively integrated into the framework of interpersonal emotion regulation (IER). I review the empathic IER spectrum in a number of contexts, including close relationships, professional caregiving, and group-based emotions. Integrating empathy and IER provides a synthetic and generative way to ask new questions about how social emotions produce prosocial actions.

f5fd33af7c5be2af49ca4b8172e25cde136069fc,"The authors present the design and implementation of an exploratory virtual learning environment that assists children with autism (ASD) in learning science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) skills along with improving social-emotional and communication skills. The primary contribution of this exploratory research is how educational research informs technological advances in triggering a virtual AI companion (AIC) for children in need of social-emotional and communication skills development. The AIC adapts to students’ varying levels of needed support. This project began by using puppetry control (human-in-the-loop) of the AIC, assisting students with ASD in learning basic coding, practicing their social skills with the AIC, and attaining emotional recognition and regulation skills for effective communication and learning. The student is given the challenge to program a robot, Dash™, to move in a square. Based on observed behaviors, the puppeteer controls the virtual agent’s actions to support the student in coding the robot. The virtual agent’s actions that inform the development of the AIC include speech, facial expressions, gestures, respiration, and heart color changes coded to indicate emotional state. The paper provides exploratory findings of the first 2 years of this 5-year scaling-up research study. The outcomes discussed align with a common approach of research design used for students with disabilities, called single case study research. This type of design does not involve random control trial research; instead, the student acts as her or his own control subject. Students with ASD have substantial individual differences in their social skill deficits, behaviors, communications, and learning needs, which vary greatly from the norm and from other individuals identified with this disability. Therefore, findings are reported as changes within subjects instead of across subjects. While these exploratory observations serve as a basis for longer term research on a larger population, this paper focuses less on student learning and more on evolving technology in AIC and supporting students with ASD in STEM environments.","[{'authorId': '2056019735', 'name': 'Charles E.

f61b5b5b66670b1ae468743ec56b7f9e7b165320,"Background Mental health problems are common among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and difficulties with emotion regulation processes may underlie these issues. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is considered an efficacious treatment for anxiety in children with ASD. Additional research is needed to examine the efficacy of a transdiagnostic treatment approach, whereby the same treatment can be applied to multiple emotional problems, beyond solely anxiety. The purpose of the present study was to examine the efficacy of a manualized and individually delivered 10‐session, transdiagnostic CBT intervention, aimed at improving emotion regulation and mental health difficulties in children with ASD. Methods Sixty‐eight children (M age = 9.75, SD = 1.27) and their parents participated in the study, randomly allocated to either a treatment immediate (n = 35) or waitlist control condition (n = 33) (ISRCTN #67079741). Parent‐, child‐, and clinician‐reported measures of emotion regulation and mental health were administered at baseline, postintervention/postwaitlist, and at 10‐week follow‐up. Results Children in the treatment immediate condition demonstrated significant improvements on measures of emotion regulation (i.e., emotionality, emotion regulation abilities with social skills) and aspects of psychopathology (i.e., a composite measure of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, adaptive behaviors) compared to those in the waitlist control condition. Treatment gains were maintained at follow‐up. Conclusions This study is the first transdiagnostic CBT efficacy trial for children with ASD. Additional investigations are needed to further establish its relative efficacy compared to more traditional models of CBT for children with ASD and other neurodevelopmental conditions.","[{'authorId': '2150018495', 'name': 'J.

There are two main ways, verbal and non-verbal methods, which play an important role for one in perceiving personality of others. Extensive research was conducted in relating personality with verbal, paralinguistic and gestures cues. However, there are not much research, to our knowledge, that relates the appearance and perceived personality of robots. The main objective of this research is to relate individual design features with big five perceived personality of the robots. We used the results of rated perceptions across 100 pictorial images of robots and relate the results with the 40 individual design features using General Linear Model (GLM). The initial results of the GLM analysis showed that participants' rating of personality of robot fell along the dimension of perceived friendliness which is a common rotation of extroversion and agreeableness. Some relationships were found between humanlike design features and perceived friendliness of robots. Since participants are more familiar with humans, participants perceived robots with humanlike features friendlier than the others. Some other findings such as color and surface material were found related with participants' perceived friendliness as well. In the future, we will work on the analysis of the main and interaction effects of individual features on user's perceived friendliness.","[{'authorId': '36384910', 'name': 'Benedict Tay Tiong Chee'}, {'authorId': '14279580', 'name': 'Park Taezoon'}, {'authorId': '1786343', 'name': 'Qianli Xu'}, {'authorId': '1948849', 'name': 'Jamie Ng'}, {'authorId': '21743127', 'name': 'O.

This chapter from the Negotiator's Fieldbook explains why among multiple models of fairness, people tend to believe that the one that applies here is the one that happens to favor them. This often creates a bitter element in negotiation, as each party proceeds from the unexamined assumption that its standpoint is the truly fair one. For a negotiation to end well, it is imperative for both parties to assess the fairness of their own proposals from multiple points of view, not just their instinctive one – and to consider the fairness of their negotiation procedures as well as of their substantive proposals. Though the fairness of negotiation procedure appears to exercise greater influence upon some negotiators than others, perceptions of procedural fairness generally result in increased perceptions of substantive fairness, increased compliance with negotiated results, improved relations between the negotiators and perhaps even a reduced need to engage in the sort of face saving that can result in choices that are not in negotiators' economic self-interest.","[{'authorId': '69893149', 'name': 'N.

It is more problematic to apply modelbased methods to images of objects whose appearance can vary, though a number of approaches based on the use of flexible templates have been proposed. The problem with existing methods is that they sacrifice model specificity in order to accommodate variability, thereby compromising robustness during image interpretation. We argue that a model should only be able to deform in ways characteristic of the class of objects it represents. We describe a method for building models by learning patterns of variability from a training set of correctly annotated images. These models can be used for image search in an iterative refinement algorithm analogous to that employed by Active Contour Models (Snakes). The key difference is that our Active Shape Models can only deform to fit the data in ways consistent with the training set. We show several practical examples where we have built such models and used them to locate partially occluded objects in noisy, cluttered images.

It projects a positive and realistic approach to issues confronting disabled people and their families. The lives and aspirations of the disabled are discussed in an easily readable style, which includes such topics as: labeling, accessibility, institutionalization, relationships with the medical field, and representation in the media and technology. Special People is not written for the professional who requires extensive information on a specific topic or exceptionality. Rather, it is a short book (172 pages) that brings together knowledge and thought from several disciplines to deal with the everyday problems of coping. Doctors, clergymen, parents, older students, relatives, and the general reader will find Special People useful and informative. One of the strongest aspects of this book is the author's ability to relate her personal experiences and feelings. She is sensitive to the adjustment problems of the nonhandicapped and helps them to understand their own reactions by sharing hers. For example, after realizing that a particular child had Downs' Syndrome, Ms. Cohen relates, ""The shock stayed with me all afternoon. Even though I had known that this was a program for retarded infants, I hadn't been prepared. I was still plagued by my stereotypes"" (p. 117). There are pertinent references throughout the text to professional articles, books for adults, and some for children that expound upon the topics discussed. Regular classroom teachers may be interested in reading, ""Don't Feel Sorry for Paul,"" which describes the life of a physically handicapped child. Parents may chose to read, ""About Handicaps,"" to children who are afraid of ""catching handicap germs."" There are also several accounts of innovative programs, such as Sweden's consideration of blind, physically, and mentally handicapped persons when traffic patterns were changed. This was done because ""they are passengers ... they are pedestrians ... they are part of the world around the driver .... "" There are several excerpts from autobiographies of disabled people, transcripts of conversations with parents, and reactions of children. Helen Jones describes inconsistencies in the airlines' willingness to accept disabled passengers: her statement is especially piognant for those who organize service companies for the public. The parent of a physically handicapped child expresses appreciation for a sequence on the ""Mr. Rogers"" television show, which included disabled children. Shirley Cohen does not leave her reader uninvolved. One chapter, entitled ""And Now You,"" presents situations for selfinquiry as well as for discussion. While the general reader and the disabled themselves are asked to think about their own behaviors and feelings, the professional team member can re-examine his own beliefs regarding the equality and worthiness of the people he serves.

In this paper, we describe the categories of factors thought to have an impact on presence. Furthermore, we present an overview of various approaches taken to measuring presence, which can be divided into two general categories: subjective measures and objective corroborative measures. Since presence is a subjective experience, the most direct way of assessment is through users' subjective report. This approach has serious limitations however, and should be used judiciously. Objective measures, such as postural, physiological or social responses to media, can be used to corroborate subjective measures, thereby overcoming some of their limitations. At present, the most promising direction for presence measurement is to develop and use an aggregate measure of presence that is comprised of both subjective and objective components, tailored to the specific medium under study.","[{'authorId': '1679478', 'name': 'W.

A variety of behaviours have been identified as submissive (Buss & Craik, 1986). These are believed to be associated with vulnerability to psychopathology. This paper explores the construct and measurement of submissive behaviours and their association with psychopathology.


DESIGN
Two self-report scales were designed to measure the frequencies of (a) typical submissive behaviours (SBS) and (b) passive/withdrawal and affiliative strategies focused on conflict de-escalation (CDS). The association of these scales with psychopathology was explored in a series of questionnaire studies.


METHODS
Study 1 assessed the SBS using a student sample (N = 332) and a mixed clinical group (N = 136). Of these, 177 students and 66 patients also completed the SCL-90-R. In Studies 2 and 3, the CDS and its association with depressive symptoms were assessed using a student sample (N = 154) and a depressed patient group (N = 60).


RESULTS
The SBS and CDS appeared reliable. There was a positive relationship between the SBS and the SCL-90-R, including interpersonal sensitivity and unexpressed hostility. The passive/withdrawal subscale of the CDS was associated with depressive symptoms. Evidence was obtained for sex differences with the affiliative subscale.


CONCLUSIONS
Some forms of submissive behaviour, especially those associated with passive/withdrawal and inhibition, are associated with a wide range of psychological problems.","[{'authorId': '9722254', 'name': 'S.

f8aa92ba3efd9d1d0ea0ac64ab521947b9648a44,"Social facilitation has been researched for decades, but in the face of the development of virtual reality technology, new questions arise regarding the possibility of its occurrence in this environment —in the presence of computer-generated agents. Past research provided inconclusive answers: several experiments confirmed this possibility, but several others disagreed. On the other hand, previous studies have shown the important role of VR characteristics, such as realism or co-presence, in evoking other psychological phenomena. However, no study has investigated the interplay between the presence of computer-generated agents and perceived social realism in evoking social facilitation in virtual reality. To this end, the present randomized control study was conducted. The sample consisted of professional firefighters (N = 48), divided into an experimental group with virtual bystanders and a control group without them. Subjects were instructed to perform a rescue procedure in a virtual reality headset. The performance of participants was logged and they completed questionnaires regarding sense of presence in the virtual environment, perceived realism of the environment and perceived co-presence of virtual agents. The obtained results confirmed the role of social realism as a moderator of the occurrence of social facilitation in the presence of computer-generated agents. At the same time, the main effect of facilitation was not confirmed. These results support predictions that the subjective feeling of being in a realistic company of others may be more important in evoking social facilitation than objective facts. Furthermore, the results contribute to the debate regarding the mechanism of social facilitation, suggesting that simple augmentation of the environment with social distractors is not always enough, thus questioning the attentional explanation of the effect. Taken together, our results extend previous findings on social facilitation and open up new possibilities for designing effective virtual environments.","[{'authorId': '11243838', 'name': 'P.

To identifying both the design principles and mainstreamed-environment constraints, we adopted a participatory design. Preliminary results are presented relative to five children with ASD (and five control ones) who have used our system during three months in mainstreamed schools.

Yet, a shortage of qualified faculty and difficulty with aligning learners’ schedules often prevent sustainable and scalable IPE. A virtual IPE intervention was developed to circumvent these barriers and compared to a blended-learning IPE intervention. We used a pre-test and post-test design with two comparison interventions to test the effects of these IPE interventions on changes in teamwork knowledge, skills, and attitudes. The interventions were delivered to pre-licensure learners at a large, metropolitan medical and a nursing school. We used one-sample and independent-sample t-tests to analyze data from 220 learners who received the blended-learning intervention in 2011 and 540 learners who received the virtual learning intervention in 2012. The students in the blended-learning intervention did not significantly (p < 0.05) outperform the students in the virtual learning intervention for any of the measured outcomes, except for medical students’ attitudes around team value. Virtual IPE learning is an effective, scalable, and sustainable solution for imparting foundational teamwork knowledge in health profession students.","[{'authorId': '118730481', 'name': 'M.

For the case of undirected and connected communication graphs, we propose a distributed discontinuous nonlinear controller which can achieve the bipartite consensus. To cancel the chattering phenomenon of the discontinuous controller, a continuous one is designed by using the boundary layer technique, under which the bipartite consensus error is shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded and can exponentially converge to a small adjustable bounded set. Further, considering the case of a leader having a bounded control action, we present a continuous controller to guarantee the ultimate boundedness of the bipartite tracking error.","[{'authorId': '2144067262', 'name': 'Miao Liu'}, {'authorId': '40178940', 'name': 'Xiangke Wang'}, {'authorId': '1738217', 'name': 'Zhongkui Li'}]",59.0,,34.0,Robust Bipartite Consensus and Tracking Control of High-Order Multiagent Systems With Matching Uncertainties and Antagonistic Interactions,2020.0

However, what the added value is of client feedback specifically within cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), is not known. Therefore, the extent to which the outcome of CBT can be improved is investigated by providing feedback from clients to therapists using the Outcome Rating Scale (ORS) and Session Rating Scale (SRS). Method: Outpatients (n = 1006) of a Dutch mental health organization either participated in the “treatment as usual” (TAU) condition, or in Feedback condition of the study. Clients were invited to fill in the ORS and SRS and in the Feedback condition therapists were asked to frequently discuss client feedback. Results: Outcome on the SCL-90 was only improved specifically with mood disorders in the Feedback condition. Also, in the Feedback condition, in terms of process, the total number of required treatment sessions was on average two sessions fewer. Conclusion: Frequently asking feedback from clients using the ORS/SRS does not necessarily result in a better treatment outcome in CBT. However, for an equal treatment outcome significantly fewer sessions are needed within the Feedback condition, thus improving efficiency of CBT.","[{'authorId': '1817122280', 'name': 'P.

In the course of a computer-mediated negotiation, participants received information about the emotional state (anger, happiness, or none) of their opponent. Consistent with a strategic-choice perspective, Experiment 1 showed that participants conceded more to an angry opponent than to a happy one. Experiment 2 showed that this effect was caused by tracking--participants used the emotion information to infer the other's limit, and they adjusted their demands accordingly. However, this effect was absent when the other made large concessions. Experiment 3 examined the interplay between experienced and communicated emotion and showed that angry communications (unlike happy ones) induced fear and thereby mitigated the effect of the opponent's experienced emotion. These results suggest that negotiators are especially influenced by their opponent's emotions when they are motivated and able to consider them.","[{'authorId': '5980688', 'name': 'Gerben A. van Kleef'}, {'authorId': '8494133', 'name': 'C.

Despite this, the role of intention recognition in the emergence of cooperative actions remains elusive. Resorting to the tools of evolutionary game theory, herein we describe a computational model showing how intention recognition coevolves with cooperation in populations of self-regarding individuals. By equipping some individuals with the capacity of assessing the intentions of others in the course of a prototypical dilemma of cooperation—the repeated prisoner's dilemma—we show how intention recognition is favored by natural selection, opening a window of opportunity for cooperation to thrive. We introduce a new strategy (IR) that is able to assign an intention to the actions of opponents, on the basis of an acquired corpus consisting of possible plans achieving that intention, as well as to then make decisions on the basis of such recognized intentions. The success of IR is grounded on the free exploitation of unconditional cooperators while remaining robust against unconditional defectors. In addition, we show how intention recognizers do indeed prevail against the best-known successful strategies of iterated dilemmas of cooperation, even in the presence of errors and reduction of fitness associated with a small cognitive cost for performing intention recognition.","[{'authorId': '2928820', 'name': 'H.

It is timely to consolidate the evidence base and establish the prevalence and variance of anxiety in HF samples. Methods:A systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression were conducted to identify the prevalence, variance, and measurement of anxiety in patients with HF. Results:A total of 14,367 citations were identified, with 73 studies meeting inclusion criteria. A random effects pooled prevalence of 13.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.25%–16.86%) for anxiety disorders, 28.79% (95% CI, 23.30%–34.29) for probable clinically significant anxiety, and 55.5% (95% CI, 48.08%–62.83%) for elevated symptoms of anxiety was identified. Rates of anxiety were highest when measured using the Brief Symptom Scale-Anxiety scale (72.3%) and lowest when measured using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (6.3%). Conclusion:Many patients with HF would benefit if screened for anxiety and treated. The conceptualization and measurement of anxiety accounted for most variance in prevalence rates. The Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 or the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale appear to be the most appropriate instruments for this clinical population, with evidence to suggest they can discriminate between depression and anxiety, omit somatic items that may contaminate identification of anxiety in a population with physical comorbidities, and provide thresholds with which to differentiate patients and target treatments. Although there are limitations with the collation of diverse measurement methods, the current review provides researchers and clinicians with a more granular knowledge of prevalence estimates of anxiety in a population of HF patients.","[{'authorId': '46345337', 'name': 'K.

fcd377802681d9e70296eba90d520e170f2d3a0b,"Background Research in embodied artificial intelligence (AI) has increasing clinical relevance for therapeutic applications in mental health services. With innovations ranging from ‘virtual psychotherapists’ to social robots in dementia care and autism disorder, to robots for sexual disorders, artificially intelligent virtual and robotic agents are increasingly taking on high-level therapeutic interventions that used to be offered exclusively by highly trained, skilled health professionals. In order to enable responsible clinical implementation, ethical and social implications of the increasing use of embodied AI in mental health need to be identified and addressed. Objective This paper assesses the ethical and social implications of translating embodied AI applications into mental health care across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology and Psychotherapy. Building on this analysis, it develops a set of preliminary recommendations on how to address ethical and social challenges in current and future applications of embodied AI. Methods Based on a thematic literature search and established principles of medical ethics, an analysis of the ethical and social aspects of currently embodied AI applications was conducted across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, the analysis was structured around the following three steps: assessment of potential benefits; analysis of overarching ethical issues and concerns; discussion of specific ethical and social issues of the interventions. Results From an ethical perspective, important benefits of embodied AI applications in mental health include new modes of treatment, opportunities to engage hard-to-reach populations, better patient response, and freeing up time for physicians. Overarching ethical issues and concerns include: harm prevention and various questions of data ethics; a lack of guidance on development of AI applications, their clinical integration and training of health professionals; ‘gaps’ in ethical and regulatory frameworks; the potential for misuse including using the technologies to replace established services, thereby potentially exacerbating existing health inequalities. Specific challenges identified and discussed in the application of embodied AI include: matters of risk-assessment, referrals, and supervision; the need to respect and protect patient autonomy; the role of non-human therapy; transparency in the use of algorithms; and specific concerns regarding long-term effects of these applications on understandings of illness and the human condition. Conclusions We argue that embodied AI is a promising approach across the field of mental health; however, further research is needed to address the broader ethical and societal concerns of these technologies to negotiate best research and medical practices in innovative mental health care. We conclude by indicating areas of future research and developing recommendations for high-priority areas in need of concrete ethical guidance.","[{'authorId': '46217950', 'name': 'A.

Neural activity in two areas of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), paracingulate cortex, and rostromedial prefrontal cortex (RMPFC) was predictive of whether each individual would be ultimately pursued for a romantic relationship or rejected. Activity in these areas was attributable to two distinct components of romantic evaluation: either consensus judgments about physical beauty (paracingulate cortex) or individualized preferences based on a partner's perceived personality (RMPFC). These data identify novel computational roles for these regions of the DMPFC in even very rapid social evaluations. Even a first glance, then, can accurately predict romantic desire, but that glance involves a mix of physical and psychological judgments that depend on specific regions of DMPFC.","[{'authorId': '47511552', 'name': 'Jeffrey C.

A smaller proportion of these has specifically examined how individuals cope with trauma. Due to differences between researchers in how trauma is defined, a definitive number is difficult to determine. However, a search for the key words trauma and coping yielded 1,000 articles.

THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO COPING There are four basic theoretical and methodological approaches to coping. Psychoanalytic approaches focus on the use of defense mechanisms, while personality approaches focus on coping styles. Both of these assume that adaptation is primarily a function of personal characteristics. In contrast, the coping process approach draws upon cognitive behavioral models, and is more likely to emphasize environmental demands and influences on coping. Coping process approaches tie the coping strategies to a particular stressful episode. Finally, COPING AND HEALTH 3 daily coping processes use experience sampling techniques to examine how individuals cope throughout the course of the day with a wide variety of problems. Psychoanalytic Approaches Research on how individuals adapt grew out of early psychoanalytic studies of defense mechanisms, which are considered to be unconscious ways of warding off anxiety.

The most severe is adaptive or ""mature@ defense mechanisms include altruism, humor, and sublimation, as well as suppression. Cramer (2000) compared the similarities and differences between defense mechanisms and coping processes. Defense mechanisms are unconscious, nonintentional, dispositional, hierarchical, and associated with pathology, while coping processes are conscious, used intentionally, situationally determined, nonhierarchical, and associated with normality.

To assess emotional functioning in AS/HFA, 27 AS/HFA adults (16 women) and 27 age-, gender-, and education-matched typically developing (TD) participants completed a battery of measures of emotion experience, labeling, and regulation. With respect to emotion experience, individuals with AS/HFA reported higher levels of negative emotions, but similar levels of positive emotions, compared with TD individuals. With respect to emotion labeling, individuals with AS/HFA had greater difficulties identifying and describing their emotions, with approximately two-thirds exceeding the cutoff for alexithymia. With respect to emotion regulation, individuals with AS/HFA used reappraisal less frequently than TD individuals and reported lower levels of reappraisal self-efficacy. Although AS/HFA individuals used suppression more frequently than TD individuals, no difference in suppression self-efficacy was found.

In examining the way people experience empathy in their every-day lives, in the context of real, meaningful, present relationships, it seems that both cognitive and affective aspects of this experience play a significant role and may appear either together or separately. While it is rare for empathy to exist without any cognitive understanding, we also found that the experiences of empathy that contain emotional components reflect a fuller and more meaningful relational experience.

 The development of virtual enterprise is inseparable from the support of partners. Due to information asymmetry, the choice of virtual enterprise partners is blind, and simple matching formula is difficult to meet. At the same time, the psychology of the matching subject is based on the maximization of its own interests rather than the maximization of collective interests. There are interest contradictions and conflicts between subjects, and they may eventually fall into a “prisoner's dilemma”. Therefore, how to carry out the research on emotion regulation based on multi-agent heterogeneous game preference and bilateral partner preference is very important.
 
 
 
 Aiming at the contradictions and interest conflicts between subjects in the process of virtual enterprise partner matching, combined with the basic characteristics of subject language preference evaluation, the game idea is introduced into the process of virtual enterprise partner bilateral matching analysis, a bilateral matching game model of heterogeneous multi-attribute preference and subjects' psychological behavior is proposed, and the influence of the changes of subjects' psychological behavior on the evolution law of bilateral matching game system is analyzed, The Nash equilibrium strategy of bilateral matching is discussed. In order to verify the impact of the algorithm on emotion, this study uses relevant scales to investigate. (1) Positive emotion scale. The Panas emotion scale developed by Watson et al. Is widely used to measure emotion. The scale includes two dimensions: positive emotion and negative emotion. There are 6 questions in this dimension, and Likert scores 5 points (1 means “very inconsistent”, 5 means “very consistent”, the same below). The Cronbach coefficient of this questionnaire is 0.90. (2) Motivation. The problem of measuring motivation is mainly the motivation scale compiled by Phan, which has 8 questions and is scored with Likert 5 points. (3) Social support scale. The scale is adapted from the social support scale compiled by Ye Yuemei et al. It has eight questions, using Likert's five points scoring method. Clonbach α the coefficient of the scale is 0.87. (4) Behavioral propensity scale. Propensity dimension in intention measurement. The scale has 6 questions, and Likert scores 5 points. The clonbach coefficient of the scale is 0.95.
 
 
 
 The results of case analysis show that the model can make full use of the multi-attribute preference information of heterogeneous subjects, describe the mechanism of psychological behavior affecting the evolution of game system, and help virtual enterprises match business partners; This has important value and significance for the establishment of virtual enterprises and their industrial agglomeration effect. In the influence process of cooperative anxiety, emotional response plays an intermediary role, psychological elasticity plays a regulatory role, and emotional response to life events plays an intermediary role. That is, the higher the psychological elasticity, the higher the excessive coping style of the game, and vice versa.
 
 
 
 Various stable matching solutions can be obtained by solving the model, and the conclusion is more suitable for the matching decision-making process of both parties in the actual process, which makes the model can be applied to various scenarios, such as the selection of battery suppliers of new energy vehicles and smart phone screen suppliers, which has greater practical value and significance. It should be pointed out that there are some deficiencies in the setting conditions of the model method, mainly because some individuals in the group cooperate to form an alliance, so as to form a community of interests. In the process of game, the individual experience in the group is constrained by more conditions, which makes the results of the model deviate.

This technology, with its unique ability to simulate complex, real situations and contexts, offers researchers unprecedented opportunities to investigate human behavior in well controlled designs in the laboratory. One important application of VR is the investigation of pathological processes in mental disorders, especially anxiety disorders. Research on the processes underlying threat perception, fear, and exposure therapy has shed light on more general aspects of the relation between perception and emotion. Being by its nature virtual, i.e., simulation of reality, VR strongly relies on the adequate selection of specific perceptual cues to activate emotions. Emotional experiences in turn are related to presence, another important concept in VR, which describes the user’s sense of being in a VR environment. This paper summarizes current research into perception of fear cues, emotion, and presence, aiming at the identification of the most relevant aspects of emotional experience in VR and their mutual relations. A special focus lies on a series of recent experiments designed to test the relative contribution of perception and conceptual information on fear in VR. This strand of research capitalizes on the dissociation between perception (bottom–up input) and conceptual information (top-down input) that is possible in VR. Further, we review the factors that have so far been recognized to influence presence, with emotions (e.g., fear) being the most relevant in the context of clinical psychology. Recent research has highlighted the mutual influence of presence and fear in VR, but has also traced the limits of our current understanding of this relationship. In this paper, the crucial role of perception on eliciting emotional reactions is highlighted, and the role of arousal as a basic dimension of emotional experience is discussed.

FACS is an anatomically based system that delineates every facial muscle movement, or action unit (AU), relevant to the expression of anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. Over 20 years of research has demonstrated that certain AUs are reliably associated with each distinct emotion (see Ekman, 2003, for a review). On the basis of these findings, researchers have developed guidelines showing which AUs are associated with which emotions (e.g., Ekman & Friesen, 1978); these guidelines can be used to create standardized posed emotion expressions that accurately and reliably convey each emotion. Resultant expressions do not suffer from many of the problems associated with emotion expression stimuli developed without a standardized system (e.g., by asking expressers to pose according to their own intuitions or those of the researcher about the appearance of particular expressions). Expressions posed without a standardized system (e. 1999) may suffer from problems of validity—not accurately reflecting the intended emotion—and reliability—lacking consistency across perceivers or across different expressions presumed to reflect the same emotion. a valid and reliable set of posed emotion expressions that generate high recognition rates across cultures.
