The aim of this paper is to reveal the main nursing competencies for spiritual care, which emerged from data collecting from qualified nurses in Malta.


BACKGROUND
For nurses to deliver spiritual care, they must be competent to provide care on a physical, mental, social and spiritual level. As spiritual care may be influenced by culture, this study explored the competencies for spiritual care from the Maltese nurses' perspective.


METHODS
A descriptive exploratory study investigated nurses' competencies in the delivery of spiritual care to patients with myocardial infarction. Data were collected by means of an open-ended questionnaire on qualified nurses (n=77) followed by an in-depth interview on a stratified random sample (n=14) of nurses from the same respondents.


RESULTS
The four main nursing competencies identified were associated with the role of the nurse as a professional and as an individual person; delivery of spiritual care by the nursing process; nurses' communication with patients, inter-disciplinary team and clinical/educational organizations and safeguarding ethical issues in care.


CONCLUSION
This study demonstrated the complexity of spiritual care, which requires nurses to increase their awareness of the uniqueness of each individual patient with regard to the connection between mind, body and spirit; the assessment of the spiritual status of patients during illness and the implementation of holistic care as recommended by the Nursing Code of Ethics.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
These findings will enable nurses to consider the importance of spiritual care, which may allow them to help empower patients find meaning and purpose during times of illness. More emphasis should be put on spiritual care in the pre- and postregistration education. Further research to translate these main competencies into specific competencies will guide spiritual care.","[{'authorId': '21542189', 'name': 'Donia R.

00359faf7f5c130cf02b14203effe076651b3374,"This study assessed whether some of the correlates of learned helplessness-depression, low self-esteem, and a maladaptive attributional style-are long-term consequences of child abuse. In this study, 260 subjects were identified as physically abused, psychologically abused, both physically and psychologically abused, or nonabused, based on responses to the Child Abuse Questionnaire (CAQ). Subjects were tested for levels of nonclinical depression via the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), for levels of self-esteem via the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE), and for the adaptiveness of attributional style via the Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ). It was hypothesized that each of the three abuse groups would differ from the control group on the three dependent measures; differences among the three abuse groups were also explored. Three one-way analyses of variance indicated that (1) BDI scores reflected a greater tendency toward depression in subjects reporting both types of abuse than in nonabused subjects or in subjects reporting either psychological or physical abuse, (2) subjects reporting psychological abuse only or both psychological and physical abuse showed lower self-esteem than did nonabused subjects, and (3) abused subjects did not seem to exhibit a more maladaptive attributional style than that of nonabused subjects. In addition, multiple linear regression analyses pointed to psychological abuse as a critical variable in predicting levels of depression, self-esteem, and attributional style, when physical abuse effects were controlled. Controlling for the effects of psychological abuse, however, indicated that physical abuse did not significantly contribute to the variance in these variables. Implications for the learned helplessness model and for future research are discussed. VioLit summary: OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research by Gross and Keller was to determine if a number of the psychological problems associated with learned helplessness--depression, low self-esteem and maladaptive attributional style--were related to psychological and/or physical abuse as a child. METHODOLOGY: The researchers in this investigation employed a quasi-experimental cross-sectional design with a non-probability sample of 260 students in an introductory psychology course at Syracuse University, who had agreed to participate in return for course credit. Subjects were aged 18 to 22 years, and were similar with respect to number of siblings and family income levels. Measures were completed in large groups, in order to promote honest answers and to foster confidence in assurances of anonymity. The Child Abuse Questionnaire, measuring frequencies of actions ranging from spanking and showing disinterest in the child to intentional burning and threatening to kill the child, was administered to the subjects, who were subsequently divided into four groups - a Physical abuse group, a Psychological abuse group, a Combined group and a Control group. The Questionnaire pertained to events during childhood and adolescence, and was found to have satisfactory reliability. Attributional style was measured via use of the 12-item Attributional Style Questionnaire, which has previously established acceptable reliability and modest validity. Depression was examined with the Beck Depression Inventory - a self-report inventory of depression which has acceptable reliability and validity. The 10-item Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale was also involved in data collection, and has acceptable levels of reliability and validity. Analyses included ANOVA and the Tukey-Kramer procedure, as well as multiple linear regressions. FINDINGS/DISCUSSION: The researchers found that the Combined group exhibited higher levels of depression than the other three groups, which did not differ from each other. Both psychological and physical abuse combined accounted for 13% of the variance in depression, with psychological abuse accounting for most of this predictive power. Members of the Control group scored significantly higher than those of the Psychological or Combined groups on measures of self-esteem, although the Physical group did not show significantly lower levels of self-esteem than the Control group. Psychological and physical abuse combined was able to account for 16% of the variance in self-esteem, with psychological abuse again being the most powerful predictor. Attributional styles were not particularly maladaptive in this sample, and the Control group exhibited only slightly higher scores than the other three groups, with the ANOVA finding no significant difference between the four groups. Psychological and physical abuse combined could account for only 6% of the variance in attributional style, again with psychological abuse accounting for most of that prediction. For all measures, the Control group had fewest problems, with the Combined group exhibiting highest levels of maladjustment. The learned helplessness model was supported, in that people exhibiting high levels of depression also suffered from low self-esteem and displayed more maladaptive attributional style. The authors concluded that their results did not fully support the learned helplessness model as a useful way of understanding long-term consequences of child abuse. The findings did, however, suggest a tendency for abuse to be manifested in later years in depression and low self-esteem. Whilst psychologically abused subjects seemed to suffer from higher levels of depression and lower self-esteem than did physically abused individuals, the authors cited small sample sizes in the four groups, the self-report nature of the data and the need for long recall as possible alternative explanations of these findings. Also, the fact that the sample consisted of subjects who were functioning well enough to attend college might also have led to an attenuation of the relationships between abuse and the dependent variables. AUTHORS' RECOMMENDATIONS: The authors suggested that future research might address the issue of definition of key variables, as well as differentiating between those subjects who have been physically abused and those who have suffered psychological abuse. EVALUATION: This research represents an important step in understanding the consequences of child physical and emotional abuse. The study seemed to have good internal and external validity and good methodologies, and the authors provided important alternative explanations for their findings. More attention to the issue of problems of definition would have been interesting, and a more thorough discussion of implications of the findings would have been helpful. Nonetheless, the study is a valuable addition to research in the field of child abuse.

003724e426727301352e0ffc78522ea81a0c71d8,"&NA; Clinical theorists have suggested that disturbed attachments are central to borderline personality disorder (BPD) psychopathology. This article reviews 13 empirical studies that examine the types of attachment found in individuals with this disorder or with dimensional characteristics of BPD. Comparison among the 13 studies is handicapped by the variety of measures and attachment types that these studies have employed. Nevertheless, every study concludes that there is a strong association between BPD and insecure attachment. The types of attachment found to be most characteristic of BPD subjects are unresolved, preoccupied, and fearful. In each of these attachment types, individuals demonstrate a longing for intimacy and—at the same time—concern about dependency and rejection. The high prevalence and severity of insecure attachments found in these adult samples support the central role of disturbed interpersonal relationships in clinical theories of BPD. This review concludes that these types of insecure attachment may represent phenotypic markers of vulnerability to BPD, suggesting several directions for future research.","[{'authorId': '32821387', 'name': 'Hans R Agrawal'}, {'authorId': '1774591', 'name': 'J.

Results demonstrate that job resources, such as perceived organizational support and perceived customer participation, can positively influence an employee’s COA, which subsequently promotes deep over surface acting behaviors. Such positive relationships, however, are significantly and adversely affected by a job demand, perceived crowding, and a job stressor, perceived job insecurity. Specifically, contextual demands weaken the positive influence of job resources upon the development of a COA, also weakening the positive influence of a COA upon deep acting while promoting the occurrence of surface acting. From a managerial perspective, such findings highlight the importance of understanding the potentially negative influence of a stressful, demanding work environment, even upon employees who possess a very positive attitude toward helping customers.","[{'authorId': '2867735', 'name': 'Jaewon Yoo'}, {'authorId': '143725439', 'name': 'Todd J.

Although the robot is completely autonomous, a third party can optionally provide feedback to the robot through an additional UI to accelerate its learning of the user’s preferences. To validate the proposed methodology, we evaluated the impact of the robot on elementary school aged children in a long-term, multi-session interaction setting. Our findings show that using this methodology, the robot is able to learn the social profile of the users over a number of sessions, either with or without external feedback as well as maintain the user in a positive mood, as shown by the consistently positive rewards received by the robot using our proposed learning algorithm.","[{'authorId': '50606427', 'name': 'Edwinn Gamborino'}, {'authorId': '1753892', 'name': 'Hsiu-Ping Yueh'}, {'authorId': '9168051', 'name': 'Weijane Lin'}, {'authorId': '1793663', 'name': 'Su-Ling Yeh'}, {'authorId': '144906905', 'name': 'L.

 Perfect Information Monte Carlo (PIMC) search is a practical technique for playing imperfect information games that are too large to be optimally solved. Although PIMC search has been criticized in the past for its theoretical deficiencies, in practice it has often produced strong results in a variety of domains. In this paper, we set out to resolve this discrepancy. The contributions of the paper are twofold. First, we use synthetic game trees to identify game properties that result in strong or weak performance for PIMC search as compared to an optimal player. Second, we show how these properties can be detected in real games, and demonstrate that they do indeed appear to be good predictors of the strength of PIMC search. Thus, using the tools established in this paper, it should be possible to decide a priori whether PIMC search will be an effective approach to new and unexplored games.

We then conducted a simple experiment to observe whether the participants accepted or rejected the robot's suggestion in terms of the ASEs. The results showed that they accepted the robot's suggestion when the flat ASE was used, whereas they rejected it when the decreasing ASE was used.

01896a4b9dd569eb499b04906dd374e3e7812f8f,"Background: Cemeteries workers are deserving of attention because they are exposed to various psychosocial risks: these workers are subject to painful contacts and daily exposed to a work content linked to death experiences and the emotions associated with them. Secondary trauma develops from this continuous contact with others’ suffering; operators working with this type of traumatic content and dynamic could suffer from emotional disorders (Figley, 1995). Therefore, the secondary traumatic stress (STS) is seen as an occupational risk factor (Bride et al., 2004) and cemetery workers are subject to this risk. Studies on this topic have focused on the operators of emergencies, social, and health sectors; little attention has been given to cemetery workers. Aim: The present study considers the relations between the dimensions composing the STS and the psychological and physical symptoms, the perception of exhaustion, and the positive and negative emotions at work in a group of cemetery workers. Moreover, differences among occupational tasks are explored considering the different possibilities of contact with clients and trauma contagion. Methods: The study included a qualitative phase (interviews and focus groups) and subsequently a quantitative phase (self-report questionnaire) and involved 114 participants in a cemetery organization in northern Italy, divided into technicians employees (TE), technicians and specialists of decoration and garden (TS), gravediggers (GR) administrative and front office employees (AFO). Levels of secondary trauma and psychophysical symptoms were assessed, and correlations were calculated in the total sample and for the different job categories of employees. Results: AFO and TS showed the highest levels of STS and psychophysical symptoms, in particular for symptoms related to anxiety, sadness, insomnia, and gastric and musculoskeletal disorders. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of considering the STS among also this category of workers, since they are exposed daily not only with death, but also with suffering people; grief and emotional skills are important to cope with these job characteristics cemetery workers are not trained on this. It is important to monitor symptomatic levels not only to avoid chronicity, but also to provide employees with psychological support and training about secondary trauma and its consequences.","[{'authorId': '143752951', 'name': 'Lara Colombo'}, {'authorId': '4514963', 'name': 'Federica Emanuel'}, {'authorId': '37504585', 'name': 'M.

Based on a domain and literature study, we specified three support roles with corresponding bot behaviors: motivator, educator and buddy. These behaviors, such as showing attentiveness, could be implemented well in a physical character (the iCat robot), somewhat less well in a virtual character, and least well in a text interface. Twenty-eight to nine years old-children participated in a controlled experiment to evaluate the bots. They proved to value the support roles positively, in particular the buddy role. Objective and subjective data showed that they highly appreciated both the physical and virtual characters (more than the text interface). Furthermore, children proved to interact faster with the character than with the text interface. There is a clear added value of robots compared to conventional text interfaces.","[{'authorId': '1786270', 'name': 'R.

A small number of studies have explored children's perception of speakers’ voice quality and its possible influence on language comprehension. The aim of this explorative study was to investigate the relationship between the examiner's voice quality, the child's performance on a digital version of a language comprehension test, the Test for Reception of Grammar (TROG-2), and two measures of cognitive functioning. Method. The participants were (n = 86) mainstreamed 8-year old children with typical language development. Two groups of children (n = 41/45) were presented with the TROG-2 through recordings of one female speaker: one group was presented with a typical voice and the other with a simulated dysphonic voice. Result. Significant associations were found between executive functioning and language comprehension. The results also showed that children listening to the dysphonic voice achieved significantly lower scores for more difficult sentences (“the man but not the horse jumps”) and used more self-corrections on simpler sentences (“the girl is sitting”). Conclusion. Findings suggest that a dysphonic speaker's voice may force the child to allocate capacity to the processing of the voice signal at the expense of comprehension. The findings have implications for clinical and research settings where standardized language tests are used.","[{'authorId': '1402069552', 'name': 'Viveka Lyberg-Åhlander'}, {'authorId': '46971310', 'name': 'Magnus Haake'}, {'authorId': '11810127', 'name': 'Jonas K Brännström'}, {'authorId': '1749093', 'name': 'S.

02311988230fb47089e6577c6e35d6d44754d8ff,"Background A common challenge with existing psycho-social prevention interventions for children is the lack of effective, engaging, and scalable delivery mechanisms, especially beyond in-person therapeutic or school-based contexts. Although digital technology has the potential to address these issues, existing research on technology-enabled interventions for families remains limited. This paper focuses on emotion regulation (ER) as an example of a core protective factor that is commonly targeted by prevention interventions. Objective The aim of this pilot study was to provide an initial validation of the logic model and feasibility of in situ deployment for a new technology-enabled intervention, designed to support children’s in-the-moment ER efforts. The novelty of the proposed approach relies on delivering the intervention through an interactive object (a smart toy) sent home with the child, without any prior training necessary for either the child or their carer. This study examined (1) engagement and acceptability of the toy in the homes during 1-week deployments, and (2) qualitative indicators of ER effects, as reported by parents and children. In total, 10 families (altogether 11 children aged 6-10 years) were recruited from 3 predominantly underprivileged communities in the United Kingdom, as low SES populations have been shown to be particularly at risk for less developed ER competencies. Children were given the prototype, a discovery book, and a simple digital camera to keep at home for 7 to 8 days. Data were gathered through a number of channels: (1) semistructured interviews with parents and children prior to and right after the deployment, (2) photos children took during the deployment, and (3) touch interactions automatically logged by the prototype throughout the deployment. Results Across all families, parents and children reported that the smart toy was incorporated into the children’s ER practices and engaged with naturally in moments the children wanted to relax or calm down. Data suggested that the children interacted with the toy throughout the deployment, found the experience enjoyable, and all requested to keep the toy longer. Children’s emotional connection to the toy appears to have driven this strong engagement. Parents reported satisfaction with and acceptability of the toy. Conclusions This is the first known study on the use of technology-enabled intervention delivery to support ER in situ. The strong engagement, incorporation into children’s ER practices, and qualitative indications of effects are promising. Further efficacy research is needed to extend these indicative data by examining the psychological efficacy of the proposed intervention. More broadly, our findings argue for the potential of a technology-enabled shift in how future prevention interventions are designed and delivered: empowering children and parents through child-led, situated interventions, where participants learn through actionable support directly within family life, as opposed to didactic in-person workshops and a subsequent skills application.","[{'authorId': '113152411', 'name': 'Nikki Theofanopoulou'}, {'authorId': '1740889', 'name': 'K.

However, the viewpoints of older adults have not been deeply investigated. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the distinctive viewpoints of older adults by comparing them with those of younger adults. Thirty-one older and thirty-one younger adults participated in an eye-tracking experiment to investigate their impressions of a bear-like robot mockup. They also completed interviews and surveys to help us understand their viewpoints on the robot design. The gaze behaviors and the impressions of the two groups were significantly different. Older adults focused significantly more on the robot’s face and paid little attention to the rest of the body. In contrast, the younger adults gazed at more body parts and viewed the robot in more detail than the older adults. Furthermore, the older adults rated physical attractiveness and social likeability of the robot significantly higher than the younger adults. The specific gaze behavior of the younger adults was linked to considerable negative feedback on the robot design. Based on these empirical findings, we recommend that impressions of older adults be considered when designing companion robots.","[{'authorId': '152246451', 'name': 'Y.

Excerpt UVA-E-0278 Rev. Aug. 27, 2012 DECEPTION Competitive Intelligence A new associate at a consulting firm was given a project: analyzing the market position of one of the firm's premier clients. To do this, the associate must research and analyze the capabilities of the client's competitors. Because all the firms in the client's industry were privately held, very little information on its competitors existed in the public realm. Normal policy at the associate's consulting firm was to call the competitors and, in the course of a conversation, try to get them to reveal competitive intelligence on market positioning, revenue numbers, and profitability ratios. The consulting firm's ethics policy encouraged the associate to reveal his identity and his employer. After hours on the phone, the associate finally reached a marketing manager at one of the client's competitors. As per the firm's policy, the associate revealed his name and the name of his firm. The marketing manager willingly engaged in a conversation about his company and revealed some information that would be valuable to the client. The marketing manager had no idea that this information would be going to one of his competitors (the consulting firm's client). The associate never lied about his identity; he simply did not reveal who his client was because the marketing manager did not ask. . . .","[{'authorId': '1741071347', 'name': 'R.

Parents' and infant's affective states were coded in one-second frames, and synchrony was measured with time- series analysis. The orientation, intensity, and temporal pattern of infant positive arousal were assessed. Synchrony between same-gender parent-infant dyads was more optimal in terms of stronger lagged associations between parent and infant affect, more frequent mutual synchrony, and shorter lags to re- sponsiveness. Infants' arousal duringmother-infant interaction cycled between medium and low levels, and high positive affect appeared gradually and was embedded within a social episode. During father- child play, positive arousal was high, sudden, and organized in multiple peaks that appeared more fre- quently as play progressed. Mother-infant synchrony was linked to the partners' social orientation and was inversely related to maternal depression and infant negative emotionality. Father-child synchrony was related to the intensity of positive arousal and to father attachment security. Results contribute to research on the regulation of positive emotions and describe the unique modes of affective sharing that infants coconstruct with mother and father. RESUMEN: Para examinar la co-regulacion del afecto positivo durante las interacciones entre la madre y su hijo y el padre y su hijo, cien parejas y sus hijos primerizos fueron grabadas en video en sesiones de interacciones cara a cara. Los estados afectivos de los padres y de los infantes fueron codificados en marcos de un segundo, y la sincronia se midiopor medio de un analisis de tiempo en serie. Se evaluaron la orientacion, la intensidad, y el patron temporal del despertar positivo del infante. La sincronia entre las diadas del mismo sexo (madre-hija o padre-hijo) fue mas optima en terminos de mas fuertes asocia- ciones espaciadas del afecto entre padre/madre e infante, la mas frecuente mutua sincronia, y mas cortos espacios de sensibilidad.. El despertar de los ninos durante la interaccion entre la madre y su infante osciloentre los niveles medio y bajo, y el afecto positivo alto apareciogradualmente y se encontraba metido dentro de una situacion social. Durante el juego entre el padre y su infante, el despertar positivo fue alto, rapido y organizado en multiples puntos maximos que aparecieron con mayor frecuencia a medida que el juego progresaba. La sincronia entre la madre y su infante fue asociada con la orientacion social de los participantes y fue inversamente relacionada con la depresion maternal y la negativa emo- cionalidad del infante. La sincronia entre el padre y su infante fue relacionada con la intensidad del despertar positivo y con la seguridad de la afectividad paterna. Los resultados contribuyen a la investi- gacion sobre la regulacion de las emociones positivas y describen los modelos unicos de la afectividad compartida que los infantes co-construyen con la madre y el padre.","[{'authorId': '144708274', 'name': 'R.

The second aim was to investigate whether home resources and home demands have an additional influence on both processes over time. The hypotheses were tested with cross-lagged analyses based on two waves over a three-year period. The results supported both the motivational process and the health impairment process. Job resources influenced future work engagement, which, in turn, predicted organizational commitment, whereas job demands predicted burnout over time, which, in turn, predicted future depression. In addition, job resources had a weak negative impact on burnout. Home demands and home resources did not influence the motivational or health impairment process over time. The results support the central role of work characteristics for health and well-being. By integrating both human thriving and ill-health in the same model, the JD-R model may help to bridge the gap between “negative” and “positive” psychology.","[{'authorId': '1948113', 'name': 'J.

We conduct a field study to explore the effects of different strategies for providing breaks during tutoring. By comparing a fixed timing strategy with a reward strategy (break timing personalized to performance gains) and a refocus strategy (break timing personalized to performance drops), we show that the personalized strategies promote learning gains for children more effectively than the fixed strategy.

This new robot is used in psychomotor therapies for children with Down syndrome (contributing to improve their proprioception, postural balance, and gait) as well as in psychosocial and cognitive therapies for children with autism spectrum disorder. The robot uses, as a novelty, an embedded mini-video projector able to project Serious Games on the floor or tables to make already-established therapies funnier to these children, thus creating a motivating and facilitating effect for both children and therapists. The Serious Games were developed in Python through the library Pygame, considering theoretical bases of behavioral psychology for these children, which are integrated into the robot through the robot operating system (ROS). Encouraging results from the child–robot interaction are shown, according to outcomes obtained from the application of the Goal Attainment Scale. Regarding the Serious Games, they were considered suitable based on both the “Guidelines for Game Design of Serious Games for Children” and the “Evaluation of the Psychological Bases” used during the games’ development. Thus, this pilot study seeks to demonstrate that the use of a robot as a therapeutic tool together with the concept of Serious Games is an innovative and promising tool to help health professionals in conducting therapies with children with autistic spectrum disorder and Down syndrome. Due to health issues imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the sample of children was limited to eight children (one child with typical development, one with Trisomy 21, both female, and six children with ASD, one girl and five boys), from 4 to 9 years of age. For the non-typically developing children, the inclusion criterion was the existence of a conclusive diagnosis and fulfillment of at least 1 year of therapy. The protocol was carried out in an infant psychotherapy room with three video cameras, supervised by a group of researchers and a therapist. The experiments were separated into four steps: The first stage was composed of a robot introduction followed by an approximation between robot and child to establish eye contact and assess proxemics and interaction between child/robot. In the second stage, the robot projected Serious Games on the floor, and emitted verbal commands, seeking to evaluate the child’s susceptibility to perform the proposed tasks. In the third stage, the games were performed for a certain time, with the robot sending messages of positive reinforcement to encourage the child to accomplish the game. Finally, in the fourth stage, the robot finished the games and said goodbye to the child, using messages aiming to build a closer relationship with the child.","[{'authorId': '2146121492', 'name': 'João Antonio Campos Panceri'}, {'authorId': '2146124489', 'name': 'É.

Coping and emotion regulation theorists have proposed dynamic models in which these two factors, the person and the situation, interact over time to inform adaptation. In practice, however, researchers have tended to assume that particular regulatory strategies are consistently beneficial or maladaptive. We label this assumption the fallacy of uniform efficacy and contrast it with findings from a number of related literatures that have suggested the emergence of a broader but as yet poorly defined construct that we refer to as regulatory flexibility. In this review, we articulate this broader construct and define both its features and limitations. Specifically, we propose a heuristic individual differences framework and review research on three sequential components of flexibility for which propensities and abilities vary: sensitivity to context, availability of a diverse repertoire of regulatory strategies, and responsiveness to feedback. We consider the methodological limitations of research on each component, review questions that future research on flexibility might address, and consider how the components might relate to each other and to broader conceptualizations about stability and change across persons and situations.","[{'authorId': '5188130', 'name': 'G.

A central concern is the ability to detect whether others are trustworthy. Judgments of trustworthiness rely, in part, on assessments of nonverbal cues, which are affected by media representations. In this research, we compared trust formation on three media representations. We presented 24 participants with advisors represented by two of three alternate formats: video, avatar, or robot. Unknown to the participants, one was an expert and the other was a non-expert. We observed participants' advice seeking behaviour under risk as an indicator of their trust in the advisor. We found that most participants preferred seeking advice from the expert, but we also found a tendency for seeking robot or video advice. Avatar advice, in contrast, was more rarely sought. Users' self-reports support these findings. These results suggest that when users make trust assessments the physical presence of the robot representation might compensate for the lack of identity cues.","[{'authorId': '48815726', 'name': 'Ye Pan'}, {'authorId': '143903462', 'name': 'A.

Although there are theoretical and conceptual treatments of othering in the literature, researchers lack sufficient examples of othering practices that influence the interactions between patients and health care providers. The purpose of this study was to explore the interactions between health care providers and South Asian immigrant women to describe othering practices and their effects. Ethnographic methods were used involving in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. The analysis entailed identifying uses of othering and exploring the dynamics through which this process took place. Women shared stories of how discriminatory treatment was experienced. The interviews with health care professionals provided examples of how views of South Asian women shaped the way health care services were provided. Three forms of othering were found in informants' descriptions of their problematic health care encounters: essentializing explanations, culturalist explanations, and racializing explanations. Women's stories illustrated ways of coping and managing othering experiences. The analysis also revealed how individual interactions are influenced by the social and institutional contexts that create conditions for othering practices. To foster safe and effective health care interactions, those in power must continue to unmask othering practices and transform health care environments to support truly equitable health care.","[{'authorId': '144412515', 'name': 'Joy L.

053a76c1042d33ebf6eda91131468ed8cbbedb87,"Humans show large and reliable performance impairments when required to make more than one simple decision simultaneously. Such multitasking costs are thought to largely reflect capacity limits in response selection (Welford, 1952; Pashler, 1984, 1994), the information processing stage at which sensory input is mapped to a motor response. Neuroimaging has implicated the left posterior lateral prefrontal cortex (pLPFC) as a key neural substrate of response selection (Dux et al., 2006, 2009; Ivanoff et al., 2009). For example, activity in left pLPFC tracks improvements in response selection efficiency typically observed following training (Dux et al., 2009). To date, however, there has been no causal evidence that pLPFC contributes directly to sensory-motor training effects, or the operations through which training occurs. Moreover, the left hemisphere lateralization of this operation remains controversial (Jiang and Kanwisher, 2003; Sigman and Dehaene, 2008; Verbruggen et al., 2010). We used anodal (excitatory), cathodal (inhibitory), and sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to left and right pLPFC and measured participants' performance on high and low response selection load tasks after different amounts of training. Both anodal and cathodal stimulation of the left pLPFC disrupted training effects for the high load condition relative to sham. No disruption was found for the low load and right pLPFC stimulation conditions. The findings implicate the left pLPFC in both response selection and training effects. They also suggest that training improves response selection efficiency by fine-tuning activity in pLPFC relating to sensory-motor translations.","[{'authorId': '5636392', 'name': 'H.

The associations among these constructs across time were examined with structural equation modeling. The results supported a model in which adolescents' reputations as victims of peer harassment influenced both their subsequent metaperceptions of social preference and their self-concept. Additionally, bi-directional influences were found between adolescents' self-concepts and their metaperceptions of social preference over time.

More specifically, we study whether robots can induce prosocial behavior in humans through a 1x2 between-subjects user study (N = 30) in which a confederate abused a robot. Through this study, we investigated whether the emotional reactions of a group of bystander robots could motivate a human to intervene in response to robot abuse. Our results show that participants were more likely to prosocially intervene when the bystander robots expressed sadness in response to the abuse as opposed to when they ignored these events, despite participants reporting similar perception of robot mistreatment and levels of empathy for the abused robot. Our findings demonstrate possible effects of group social influence through emotional cues by robots in human-robot interaction. They reveal a need for further research regarding human prosocial behavior within HRI.

In the present study, we used a sample of 12,658 words and included many lexical and semantic control factors to determine the precise nature of the effects of arousal and valence on word recognition. Converging empirical patterns observed in word-level and trial-level data from lexical decision and naming indicate that valence and arousal exert independent monotonic effects: Negative words are recognized more slowly than positive words, and arousing words are recognized more slowly than calming words. Valence explained about 2% of the variance in word recognition latencies, whereas the effect of arousal was smaller. Valence and arousal do not interact, but both interact with word frequency, such that valence and arousal exert larger effects among low-frequency words than among high-frequency words. These results necessitate a new model of affective word processing whereby the degree of negativity monotonically and independently predicts the speed of responding. This research also demonstrates that incorporating emotional factors, especially valence, improves the performance of models of word recognition.","[{'authorId': '2431685', 'name': 'V.

This capability is particularly relevant for situations that involve collaboration among agents or detection of situations that can pose a threat. In this paper, we propose an approach that allows a robot to detect intentions of others based on experience acquired through its own sensory-motor capabilities, then using this experience while taking the perspective of the agent whose intent should be recognized. Our method uses a novel formulation of Hidden Markov Models designed to model a robot's experience and interaction with the world. The robot's capability to observe and analyze the current scene employs a novel vision-based technique for target detection and tracking, using a non-parametric recursive modeling approach. We validate this architecture with a physically embedded robot, detecting the intent of several people performing various activities.","[{'authorId': '145566573', 'name': 'Richard Kelley'}, {'authorId': '144391600', 'name': 'A.

The AMRM was formulated by adapting two popular conventional approaches, namely, model-rival method and label-training procedure. In our validation trials, we used a semi-autonomous parrot-inspired robot, called KiliRo, to simulate a set of autonomous behaviors. A proposed robot-assisted therapy using AMRM was pilot tested with nine children with autism spectrum disorder for five consecutive days in a clinical setting. We analyzed the facial expressions of children when they interacted with KiliRo using an automated emotion recognition and classification system, Oxford emotion API (Application Programming Interface). Results provided some indication that the children with autism spectrum disorder appeared attracted and happy to interact with the parrot-inspired robot. Short qualitative interviews with the children’s parents, the pediatrician, and the child psychologist who participated in this pilot study, also acknowledged that the proposed parrot-inspired robot and the AMRM may have some merit in aiding in improving learning and social interaction abilities of children with autism spectrum disorder.","[{'authorId': '3419480', 'name': 'Jaishankar Bharatharaj'}, {'authorId': '98206491', 'name': 'Loulin Huang'}, {'authorId': '1779417', 'name': 'R.

To examine the effects of maternal depression on infant social engagement, fear regulation, and cortisol reactivity as compared with maternal anxiety disorders and controls and to assess the role of maternal sensitivity in moderating the relations between maternal depression and infant outcome.


METHOD
Using an extreme-case design, 971 women reported symptoms of anxiety and depression after childbirth and 215 of those at the high and low ends were reevaluated at 6 months. At 9 months, mothers diagnosed with a major depressive disorder (n = 22) and anxiety disorders (n = 19) and matched controls reporting no symptoms across the postpartum year (n = 59) were visited at home. Infant social engagement was observed during mother-infant interaction, emotion regulation was microcoded from a fear paradigm, and mother's and infant's cortisol were sampled at baseline, reactivity, and recovery.


RESULTS
The infants of depressed mothers scored the poorest on all three outcomes at 9 months-lowest social engagement, less mature regulatory behaviors and more negative emotionality, and highest cortisol reactivity-with anxious dyads scoring less optimally than the controls on maternal sensitivity and infant social engagement. Fear regulation among the children of anxious mothers was similar to that of the controls and their stress reactivity to infants of depressed mothers. Effect of major depressive disorder on social engagement was moderated by maternal sensitivity, whereas two separate effects of maternal disorder and mother sensitivity emerged for stress reactivity.


CONCLUSIONS
Pathways leading from maternal depression to infant outcome are specific to developmental achievement. Better understanding of such task-specific mechanisms may help devise more specifically targeted interventions.","[{'authorId': '144708274', 'name': 'R. Feldman'}, {'authorId': '7254626', 'name': 'A.

These laws result from the operation of emotion mechanisms that are accessible to intentional control to only a limited extent. The law of situational meaning, the law of concern, the law of reality, the laws of change, habituation and comparative feeling, and the law of hedonic asymmetry are proposed to describe emo- tion elicitation; the law of conservation of emotional mo- mentum formulates emotion persistence,"" the law of closure expresses the modularity of emotion; and the laws of care for consequence, of lightest load, and of greatest gain per- tain to emotion regulation. For a long time, emotion was an underprivileged area in psychology. It was not regarded as a major area of sci- entific psychological endeavor that seemed to deserve concerted research efforts or receive them. Things have changed over the last 10 or so years. Emotion has become an important domain with a co- herent body of theory and data. It has developed to such an extent that its phenomena can be described in terms of a set of laws, the laws of emotion, that I venture to describe here. Formulating a set of laws of emotion implies not only that the study of emotion has developed sufficiently to do so but also that emotional phenomena are indeed lawful. It implies that emotions emerge, wax, and wane according to rules in strictly determined fashion. To argue this is a secondary objective of this article. Emotions are lawful. When experiencing emotions, people are subject to laws. When filled by emotions, they are manifesting the workings of laws. There is a place for obvious a priori reservations here. Emotions and feelings are often considered the most idiosyncratic of psychological phenomena, and they sug- gest human freedom at its clearest. The mysticism of ineffability and freedom that surrounds emotions may be one reason why the psychology of emotion and feeling has advanced so slowly over the last 100 years. This mys- ticism is largely unfounded, and the freedom of feeling is an illusion. For one thing, the notion of freedom of feeling runs counter to the traditional wisdom that human beings are enslaved by their passions. For another, the laws of emotion may help us to discern that simple, universal, moving forces operate behind the complex, idiosyncratic movements of feeling, in the same way that the erratic path of an ant, to borrow Simon's (1973) well-known parable, manifests the simple structure of a simple ani- mal's mind. The word law may give rise to misunderstanding. When formulating ""'laws"" in this article, I am discussing what are primarily empirical regularities. These regular- ities--or putative regularities--are, however, assumed to rest on underlying Causal mechanisms that generate them. I am suggesting that the laws of emotion are grounded in mechanisms that are not of a voluntary nature and that are only partially under voluntary control. Not only emotions obey the laws; we obey them. We are subject to our emotions, and we cannot engender emotions at will. The laws of emotion that I will discuss are not all equally well established. Not all of them originate in solid evidence, nor are all equally supported by it. To a large extent, in fact, to list the laws of emotion is to list a pro- gram of research. However, the laws provide a coherent picture of emotional responding, which suggests that such a research program might be worthwhile.","[{'authorId': '49584958', 'name': 'N.

We hypothesized that the promotion focus inclination is to insure hits and insure against errors of omission, whereas the prevention focus inclination is to insure correct rejections and insure against errors of commission. This hypothesis yielded three predictions: (a) when individuals work on a difficult task or have just experienced failure, those in a promotion focus should perform better, and those in a prevention focus should quit more readily; (b) when individuals work on a task where generating any number of alternatives is correct, those in a promotion focus should generate more distinct alternatives, and those in a prevention focus should be more repetitive; and (c) when individuals work on a signal detection task that requires them to decide whether they did or did not detect a signal, those in a promotion focus should have a ""risky"" response bias, and those in a prevention focus should have a ""conservative"" response bias and take more time to respond.

Emotional eating in children has been related to the consumption of energy-dense foods and obesity, but the development of emotional eating in young children is poorly understood.


OBJECTIVES
We evaluated whether emotional eating can be induced in 5-7-y-old children in the laboratory and assessed whether parental use of overly controlling feeding practices at 3-5 y of age predicts a greater subsequent tendency for children to eat under conditions of mild stress at ages 5-7 y.


DESIGN
Forty-one parent-child dyads were recruited to participate in this longitudinal study, which involved parents and children being observed consuming a standard lunch, completing questionnaire measures of parental feeding practices, participating in a research procedure to induce child emotion (or a control procedure), and observing children's consumption of snack foods.


RESULTS
Children at ages 5-7 y who were exposed to a mild emotional stressor consumed significantly more calories from snack foods in the absence of hunger than did children in a control group. Parents who reported the use of more food as a reward and restriction of food for health reasons with their children at ages 3-5 y were more likely to have children who ate more under conditions of negative emotion at ages 5-7 y.


CONCLUSIONS
Parents who overly control children's food intake may unintentionally teach children to rely on palatable foods to cope with negative emotions. Additional research is needed to evaluate the implications of these findings for children's food intake and weight outside of the laboratory setting. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01122290.","[{'authorId': '38776733', 'name': 'C. Farrow'}, {'authorId': '5294478', 'name': 'E. Haycraft'}, {'authorId': '48672003', 'name': 'J.

We contrast the effects against those of individual factors, such as gender.

The robot has an internal arousal and valence value, which are influenced by the emotional state of its interaction partner and emotional occurrences such as winning a game. It expresses these emotions through its voice, posture, whole body poses, eye colour and gestures. An experiment with 18 children (mean age 9) and two Nao robots was conducted to study the influence of adaptive emotion expression on the interaction behaviour and opinions of children. In a within-subjects design the children played a quiz with both an affective robot using the model for adaptive emotion expression and a non-affective robot without this model. The affective robot reacted to the emotions of the child using the implementation of the model, the emotions of the child were interpreted by a Wizard of Oz. The dependent variables, namely the behaviour and opinions of the children, were measured through video analysis and questionnaires. The results show that children react more expressively and more positively to a robot which adaptively expresses itself than to a robot which does not. The feedback of the children in the questionnaires further suggests that showing emotion through movement is considered a very positive trait for a robot. From their positive reactions we can conclude that children enjoy interacting with a robot which adaptively expresses itself through emotion and gesture more than with a robot which does not do this.

07aa39a553e20789a2beac5ae777b452359c1cbb,"This study compared the social—emotional implications of academic achievement for students with and without learning disabilities (LD) and identified predictors of effort investment. Students with LD showed lower levels of achievement, effort investment, academic self-efficacy, sense of coherence, positive mood, and hope, and higher levels of loneliness and negative mood. When compared to peers without LD (n = 447) at four different academic achievement levels, students with LD showed higher achievement than the low-average group, but their social—emotional profiles were similar to the low and low-average groups. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that achievement, academic self-efficacy, negative mood, and hope predicted effort investment for students with LD. These results demonstrated the importance of hope in understanding the functioning of students with LD.","[{'authorId': '12995338', 'name': 'Timothy D. Lackaye'}, {'authorId': '20941287', 'name': 'M.

07ac515f443f59aaeb36b6a8e0f91d9b7ea8f9e3,"Human-robot interaction (HRI) research to date has been dominated by laboratory studies, largely examining a single human interacting with a single robot. This research has helped establish a fundamental understanding about people as they interact with robots, how specific design choices affect interactions with robots, and how novel mechanisms or computational tools can be used to improve HRI. The predominant focus of this growing body of work, however, stands in stark contrast to the complex social contexts in which robots are increasingly placed. Developments in machine learning and tele-robotics, as well as compliant and social robotics, have occasioned more robots in closer proximity and even direct contact with people. Robots, especially mobile autonomous robots, are now deployed across work contexts and “sociable robots” such as Jibo, Cozmo, Kuri, and M.A.X. are increasingly becoming staples of household technology. These robots interact with people in everyday contexts across a wide range of tasks and situations, yet our research reflects a time when studies of HRI were possible almost exclusively only in laboratory settings. As a result, we have a limited understanding of how people will respond to robots in complex social settings and how robots will affect social dynamics in situ. In particular, our theories reflect an oversimplified view of HRI. The time is ripe for studies that tackle HRI in these complex settings and build generalizable theories about what to expect of HRI in the wild. Although there is much to be learned in controlled laboratory settings and they should continue to be a mainstay of HRI studies, we argue that more HRI researchers need to venture into the","[{'authorId': '8240331', 'name': 'Malte F.

The infant continuously faces a climate of negative affect that disrupts the interactive experience of the infant and the mother. This article presents findings on the impact of maternal depression on the infant affective state and the specific interactive patterns associated with infant affect regulation. Mother-infant interactions were studied using microanalytic, second-by-second methods in the laboratory and also by using naturalistic home observations. The empirical findings highlight the impact of maternal depression on the infant affective state and on the capacity for repairing states of miscoordination. The impact is seen not only in severely and acutely depressed mothers, but in mothers who have only high levels of depressive symptoms. These infants develop negative affective states that bias their interactions with others and exacerbate their affective problems. Further findings with regard to gender-specific effects show that male infants are more vulnerable than female infants to maternal depression. The findings point out the need for therapeutic interventions that focus on the mother-infant dyad and infant affective state in the treatment of maternal depression.","[{'authorId': '83022844', 'name': 'E.

Tai Chi and Yoga (Tai Chi/Yoga), as the most widely practiced mind–body exercises, have shown positive outcomes of mental health. To date, no systematic review regarding the long-lasting effects of Tai Chi/Yoga on HRV parameters and perceived stress has been conducted. Objective: To critically evaluate the existing literature on this topic. Methods: Five electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, SportDiscus and Cochrane Library) were searched from the start of the research project to July 2018. Study selection, data extraction, and study quality assessment were independently carried out by two reviewers. The potentially identified randomized controlled trials (RCT) reported the useful quantitative data that were included only for meta-analysis. Results: meta-analysis of 17 medium-to-high quality RCTs showed significantly beneficial effects on HRV parameters (normalized low-frequency, Hedge’s g = −0.39, 95% CI −0.39 to −0.56, p < 0.001, I2 = 11.62%; normalized high-frequency, Hedge’s g = 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to −0.52, p < 0.001, I2 = 0%; low-frequency to high-frequency ratio, Hedge’s g = −0.58, 95% CI −0.81 to −0.35, p < 0.001, I2 = 53.78%) and stress level (Hedge’s g = −0.80, 95% CI −1.17 to −0.44, p < 0.001, I2 = 68.54%). Conclusions: Stress reduction may be attributed to sympathetic-vagal balance modulated by mind–body exercises. Tai Chi/Yoga could be an alternative method for stress reduction for people who live under high stress or negative emotions.","[{'authorId': '145721986', 'name': 'L.

For example, anger can be expressed through a scowl, narrowed eyes, a long stare, or many other expressions. This complexity is problematic when attempting to recognize a human's expression in a human-robot interaction: categorical emotion models used in HRI typically use only a few prototypical classes, and do not cover the wide array of expressions in the wild. We propose a data-driven method towards increasing the number of known emotion classes present in human-robot interactions, to 28 classes or more. The method includes the use of automatic segmentation of video streams into short (<10s) videos, and annotation using the large set of widely-understood emojis as categories. In this work, we showcase our initial results using a large in-the-wild HRI dataset (UE-HRI), with 61 clips randomly sampled from the dataset, labeled with 28 different emojis. In particular, our results showed that the ""skeptical"" emoji was a common expression in our dataset, which is not often considered in typical emotion taxonomies. This is the first step in developing a rich taxonomy of emotional expressions that can be used in the future as labels for training machine learning models, towards more accurate perception of humans by robots.","[{'authorId': '2053839168', 'name': 'Ghazal Saheb Jam'}, {'authorId': '2321290', 'name': 'Jimin Rhim'}, {'authorId': '46261444', 'name': 'Angelica Lim'}]",6.0,{'name': 'Companion of the 2021 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction'},46.0,Developing a Data-Driven Categorical Taxonomy of Emotional Expressions in Real World Human Robot Interactions,2021.0

This study explored perspectives of older adults with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their caregivers on robots that provide stepwise prompting to complete activities in the home. Methods: Ten dyads participated: Older adults with mild-to-moderate AD and difficulty completing activity steps, and their family caregivers. Older adults were prompted by a tele-operated robot to wash their hands in the bathroom and make a cup of tea in the kitchen. Caregivers observed interactions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted individually. Transcribed interviews were thematically analyzed. Results: Three themes summarized responses to robot interactions: contemplating a future with assistive robots, considering opportunities with assistive robots, and reflecting on implications for social relationships. Older adults expressed opportunities for robots to help in daily activities, were open to the idea of robotic assistance, but did not want a robot. Caregivers identified numerous opportunities and were more open to robots. Several wanted a robot, if available. Positive consequences of robots in caregiving scenarios could include decreased frustration, stress, and relationship strain, and increased social interaction via the robot. A negative consequence could be decreased interaction with caregivers. Conclusions: Few studies have investigated in-depth perspectives of older adults with dementia and their caregivers following direct interaction with an assistive prompting robot. To fulfill the potential of robots, continued dialogue between users and developers, and consideration of robot design and caregiving relationship factors are necessary.","[{'authorId': '24706518', 'name': 'Rosalie H.

The purpose of this study was to determine if the programme could increase retrieval of information and reduce anxiety prior to ENT surgery. After ethical committee approval, 160 children and their parents were included. Eighty children (group 1) received conventional verbal information from an ENT nurse, and another 80 children (group 2) received specific information, including role‐play, from a nurse anaesthetist at a preadmission visit. Children’s and parents’ experience of premedication, operation theatre (OR), i.v.‐needle insertion and induction of anaesthesia were evaluated from a self‐rating questionnaire. The questionnaire included ratings for anxiety and satisfaction with information and care. The results indicate a clear improvement of the preoperative acquisition of knowledge in all age groups. When it comes to alleviation of fear, a positive effect of the preparation programme was noticed, especially among the younger children (< 5 years), while preoperative anxiety overall was a significantly smaller problem among the older children. The effects of the programme were also related to previous experience of anaesthesia and most beneficial among young children with such experience. Overall, the most negative procedure reported by the children was the i.m. injection for premedication (a routine which was abandoned as a result of the study), followed by the insertion of the i.v.‐needle. The parents experienced watching their child fall asleep during induction of anaesthesia as most negative, followed by the insertion of the i.v.‐needle. Parents also reported more satisfaction and less anxiety after having received specific information and preparation preoperatively. It was concluded that this preoperative preparation programme is useful in all age groups with regard to information, while alleviation of anxiety and fear was seen mainly among the younger children with previous experience of anaesthesia.","[{'authorId': '14219391', 'name': 'Pirkko Hatava'}, {'authorId': '39193014', 'name': 'G.

Seventy three male youth sport footballers (Mean age = 11.66 ± 1.62) completed a multisection questionnaire assessing their perceptions of the social environment created in youth sport (autonomy supportive and controlling) and motivation towards their football participation (autonomous and controlled). Intensity of PA during youth sport was measured using accelerometers (GT3X, ActiGraph). Results supported a model in which perceptions of autonomy support significantly and positively predicted autonomous motivation towards football, which in turn significantly and positively predicted youth sport MVPA (% time). A significant indirect effect was observed for perceptions of autonomy support on youth sport %MVPA via autonomous motivation. Results have implications for optimising MVPA engagement during youth sport and increasing daily MVPA towards recommended and health-enhancing levels on youth sport days.","[{'authorId': '6338957', 'name': 'S.

08ef3511fcc32419f970f075c54c966eab2f69e9,"BACKGROUND
Heart rate, measured as beat-to-beat intervals, is not constant and varies in time. This property is known as heart rate variability (HRV) and it has been investigated in several diseases, including myocardial infarction (MI). The main hypothesis is that HRV embed some physiological processes that are characteristics of regulatory systems acting on cardiovascular system. It is possible to quantify such a complex behaviour starting from RR intervals properties itself with the idea that any event affecting the cardiac regulatory system significantly will disrupt and change HRV. In this article, we first review different methodologies previously published to calculate HRV indexes. We then searched literature for studies published on HRV and MI and we derive a metanalysis where published data allow calculation of composite outcomes.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Articles considered eligible for metanalysis were original retrospective/prospective studies investigating HRV after myocardial infarction, reporting follow up for mortality or significant cardiac complications. Random effect model was used to assessed for homogeneity and calculate composite outcome and its 95% confidence interval (CI).


RESULTS
21 studies were identified as eligible for subsequent analysis. Among these studies 5 large trials were eligible for metanalysis: ""they included 3489 total post-MI patient with an overall mortality of 125/577 (21.7%) in patients with standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN) less than 70 msec compared to 235/2912 (8.1%) in patients with SDNN > 70 msec"". Metanalysis demonstrates that, after a MI, patients with SDNN below 70 msec on 24 hours ECG recording have almost 4 times more chance to die in the next 3 years.


CONCLUSION
Results from metanalysis and other studies considered (but not included in the analysis) are consistent with the final finding, that a disrupted HRV dynamic (low SDNN) is associated with higher adverse outcome. In this perspective, although data are strongly positive for a direct relationship between SDNN and mortality after MI, SDNN value must be considered carefully on a single patient. The primary purpose of the metanalysis was to address whether studies conducted on HRV and MI were consistent rather than established a cut-off for SDNN.

In this article, Wesley Becker discusses the distinctive features of this model—its underlying assumptions and basic teaching components. He then explores the implications of teaching reading and language skills to economically disadvantaged children and advocates that immediate steps be taken to teach vocabulary systematically throughout the school years.

The investigators examined the frequency of religious coping among older medical inpatients, the characteristics of those who use it, and the relation between this behavior and depression.


METHOD
The subjects were 850 men aged 65 years and over, without psychiatric diagnoses, who were consecutively admitted to the medical or neurological services of a southern Veterans Administration medical center. Religious coping was assessed with a three-item index. Depressive symptoms were assessed by self-rating (the Geriatric Depression Scale) and observer rating (the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression).


RESULTS
One out of every five patients reported that religious thought and/or activity was the most important strategy used to cope with illness. Variables that were associated with religious coping included black race, older age, being retired, religious affiliation, high level of social support, infrequent alcohol use, a prior history of psychiatric problems, and higher cognitive functioning. Depressive symptoms were inversely related to religious coping, an association which persisted after other sociodemographic and health correlates were controlled. When 202 men were reevaluated during their subsequent hospital admissions an average of 6 months later, religious coping was the only baseline variable that predicted lower depression scores at follow-up.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest that religious coping is a common behavior that is inversely related to depression in hospitalized elderly men.","[{'authorId': '144971229', 'name': 'H.

Using Hochschild's 1983 classification of jobs requiring emotional labor, this study examines the effects of emotional labor on workers employed in the banking and hospital industries. The results suggest that performance of emotional labor does not have uniformly negative consequences for workers, as some accounts imply. Instead, the effects of emotional labor are conditioned by workers' level of job autonomy and job involvement, and their self-monitoring abilities.

09c81ba13d9d38b9b529b22dfd81ec622fd27566,"The feeling of being excluded from a social interaction triggers social pain, a sensation as intense as actual physical pain. Little is known about the neurophysiological underpinnings of social pain. We addressed this issue using intracranial electroencephalography in 15 patients performing a ball game where inclusion and exclusion blocks were alternated. Time-frequency analyses showed an increase in power of theta-band oscillations during exclusion in the anterior insula (AI) and posterior insula, the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sACC), and the fusiform ""face area"" (FFA). Interestingly, the AI showed an initial fast response to exclusion but the signal rapidly faded out. Activity in the sACC gradually increased and remained significant thereafter. This suggests that the AI may signal social pain by detecting emotional distress caused by the exclusion, whereas the sACC may be linked to the learning aspects of social pain. Theta activity in the FFA was time-locked to the observation of a player poised to exclude the participant, suggesting that the FFA encodes the social value of faces. Taken together, our findings suggest that theta activity represents the neural signature of social pain. The time course of this signal varies across regions important for processing emotional features linked to social information.","[{'authorId': '5476684', 'name': 'Irene Cristofori'}, {'authorId': '46979318', 'name': 'L.

We investigated the frequency of participants’ interactions among each other and assessed any changes in interaction using social network analysis. Interactions were assessed through manual observation before and after exposure to the robot. Urinary and salivary tests were performed to obtain protein and α-amylase levels, respectively, to report the physiological changes in participating children with autism spectrum disorder before and after interacting with the robot. This is a pioneering human–robot interaction study to investigate changes in stress levels using salivary samples. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and arterial oxygen saturation level in blood were also monitored to investigate the physiological changes in participating children before, during, and after interacting with our parrot-inspired robot, KiliRo. The results show that the robot can help increase social interaction among children with autism spectrum disorder and assist in learning tasks. Furthermore, the clinical biochemistry test report using urinary and salivary samples indicates that the stress levels of children with autism reduced notably after interacting with the robot.

Consequently, examining individual differences in the habitual use of emotion-regulation strategies has considerable potential to inform models of this debilitating disorder. The aim of the current study was to identify cognitive processes that may be associated with the use of emotion-regulation strategies and to elucidate their relation to depression. Depression has been found to be associated with difficulties in cognitive control and, more specifically, with difficulties inhibiting the processing of negative material. We used a negative affective priming task to assess the relations among inhibition and individual differences in the habitual use of rumination, reappraisal, and expressive suppression in clinically depressed, formerly depressed, and never-depressed participants. We found that depressed participants exhibited the predicted lack of inhibition when processing negative material. Moreover, within the group of depressed participants, reduced inhibition of negative material was associated with greater rumination. Across the entire sample, reduced inhibition of negative material was related to less use of reappraisal and more use of expressive suppression. Finally, within the formerly depressed group, less use of reappraisal, more use of rumination, and greater expressive suppression were related to higher levels of depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that individual differences in the use of emotion-regulation strategies play an important role in depression, and that deficits in cognitive control are related to the use of maladaptive emotion-regulation strategies in this disorder.","[{'authorId': '3123613', 'name': 'J.

When this ratio reaches a point where social value and social burden are approaching equivalence, the individual is in danger of exclusion from social contexts that, over the course of evolution, have been critical to fitness. Many features of depressed states can be understood in relation to mechanisms that reduce social risk in such circumstances, including (a) hyper-sensitivity to signals of social threat from others, (b) sending signals to others that reduce social risks, and (c) inhibiting risk-seeking (e.g., confident, acquisitive) behaviors.

Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the dynamic impacts of OCB on the performance of megaprojects with the assistance of a system dynamic model. Four causal feedback loops and a stock-flow diagram were developed to illustrate the dynamic influencing mechanism, and three distinct policies quantitatively simulated the possible impacts arising from the changes of OCB on the whole system and, specifically, on the performance megaproject. The results show that an increase in the AIRPP (actual increasing rate of potential promotion) exerts significant influence on the improvement in OCB and the performance of megaprojects. The higher the AIRPP in the multi-policy scenario, the higher the OCB and the performance.

WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Standardized patient (SP) simulation is an internationally recognized learning strategy that has proven effective in enhancing nursing students' competencies necessary for mental health practice. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: A deeper exploration of the process from the perspective of SPs and more particularly drama students, revealed the complexity they need to navigate and the personal vulnerability they are exposed to when creating an authentic learning opportunity for nursing students. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Their vulnerability justifies deeper consideration of support, as well as research on the ethical implications of SP simulation. Nursing students need to be well grounded in therapeutic communication before engaging with mental health users. This should include opportunities to question personal frames of reference that could hinder therapeutic engagement with diverse others. In future, the drama students can be involved in scenario development to enhance the authenticity of simulations.


ABSTRACT
Introduction The effectiveness of Standardized patient (SP) simulation in enhancing students' mental health nursing competencies is well published. Nevertheless, the believable and accurate portrayal of a patient with a mental health issue during SP simulation is complex. Though vital to the creation of safe authentic learning experiences, the perspectives of SPs and particularly of drama students involved in SP simulation are unknown. Aim The aim of this paper is therefore to explore and describe the experiences of 11 drama students engaged in mental health simulations for nursing students. Method A qualitative approach was taken and data were gathered using various techniques. Findings The content analysis revealed that these SPs negotiated three roles during this interdisciplinary learning experience, namely of a facilitator of learning, a drama student and the person within. Discussion The study provided valuable insight into the world of an SP, including the complexities they navigate and the vulnerability they experience. Implications for Practice Nurse educators are alerted to SP's need for support and the necessity of establishing good interpersonal skills before nursing students enter the practice setting. Involvement of SPs in scenario development could enhance the authenticity of future simulations. The ethical implications of SP simulation requires further exploration.","[{'authorId': '81752128', 'name': 'A. C. Jacobs'}, {'authorId': '7615873', 'name': 'D.

One of the tES techniques leading this increased interest is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Significant research efforts have been devoted to determining the clinical potential of tDCS in humans. Despite the promising results obtained with tDCS in basic and clinical neuroscience, further progress has been impeded by a lack of clarity on international regulatory pathways. Therefore, a group of research and clinician experts on tDCS were convened to review the research and clinical use of tDCS. This report reviews the regulatory status of tDCS and summarizes the results according to research, off-label, and compassionate use of tDCS in the following countries: Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, India, Iran, Italy, Portugal, South Korea, Taiwan, and the US. Research use, off label treatment, and compassionate use of tDCS are employed in most of the countries reviewed in this study. It is critical that a global or local effort is organized to pursue definite evidence to either approve and regulate or restrict the use of tDCS in clinical practice on the basis of adequate randomized controlled treatment trials.","[{'authorId': '1762504', 'name': 'F.

High level of negative effects ubiquitous for people with borderline personality disorder (BPD), who suffer from intense insecurity, bad self-image, and impulsivity related to risky behaviors. However, the pathogeny and coping process of these negative emotions in BPD patients are discussed discretely and inadequately. Thus, our review aims to fill the gap and explain the importance of emotional processing and regulation in BPD. We first defined emotional processing and regulation along with their correlates in BPD according to their historical and theoretical contexts. Then, the corresponding special characteristics are summarized based on previous clinical studies from the perspectives of the Polyvagal Theory, Attachment Theory, and neuroscience. It is found that BPD patients have a negative bias and delay on emotional processing, while afterwards their poor coping strategies to those negative emotions may lead to out-of-control behaviors. On the other hand, evidence from neural correlates explained BPD patients' neural dysfunction resulting in different emotional processing and regulation from that of normal people. Given the light of those discoveries, we suggested that future studies should focus on developing measurements of dynamic emotions, combining neuro-image with sociability performance. Clinicians should also be aware of the internal variation in BPD group by identifying BPD symptoms from “risk” to “chronic”, i.e., intervene BPD patients at a specific time to prevent them forming problematic interpersonal relationships.","[{'authorId': '2110465011', 'name': 'Yufei Li'}, {'authorId': '2119043985', 'name': 'Kun Wang'}, {'authorId': '2155239517', 'name': 'Yumeng Wang'}]",0.0,"{'name': 'Proceedings of the 2021 5th International Seminar on Education, Management and Social Sciences (ISEMSS 2021)'}",38.0,Emotional Processing and Regulation in Borderline Personality Disorder,2021.0

The authors investigated the conditions under which manual actions became prepotent in a go/no-go task. Children had to open boxes that contained stickers on go trials and leave shut boxes that were empty on no-go trials. In Experiment 1 (n = 40, mean age = 3.6 years), the authors obtained evidence consistent with this task requiring inhibitory control. Results of Experiment 2 (n = 40, mean age = 3.7 years) suggested that box opening was prepotent because (a) opening is the habitual action associated with boxes and (b) children planned to open boxes on go trials of the task. Experiment 3 (n = 96, mean age = 3.5 years) showed that even empty boxes elicited the same errors and that delaying responding reduced errors even though the delay occurred before the cue that indicated the correct response (contrary to a rule reflection account). Because the delay occurred after box presentation, performance was consistent with a transient activation account. Delay training might benefit children with weak inhibition.","[{'authorId': '2047309', 'name': 'Andrew Simpson'}, {'authorId': '1905575', 'name': 'Kevin J.

In the context of therapy for children with socio-emotional impairments, for example autism spectrum conditions, the first approaches have already been successfully evaluated in research. In this context, the robot can be seen as a tool for therapists to foster interaction with the children. To ensure a successful integration of social robots into therapy sessions, an intuitive and comprehensive interface for the therapist is needed to guarantee save and appropriate human-robot interaction. This publication addresses the development of a graphical user interface for robot-assisted therapy to train socio-emotional skills in children on the autism spectrum. The software follows a generic and modular approach. Furthermore, a robotic middleware is used to control the robot and the user interface is based on a local web application. During therapy sessions, the therapist interface is used to control the robot’s reactions and provides additional information from emotion and arousal recognition software. The approach is implemented with the humanoid robot Pepper (Softbank Robotics). A pilot study is carried out with four experts from a child and youth psychiatry to evaluate the feasibility and user experience of the therapist interface. In sum, the user experience and usefulness can be rated positively.","[{'authorId': '3363295', 'name': 'J. Sessner'}, {'authorId': '2186557604', 'name': 'A.

Increasing children’s skills early on could improve their success in middle and high school. To this end, I examined the potential of a sociable robotic learning/teaching companion in supplementing children's early language education. The robot was designed as a social character, engaging children as a peer, not as a teacher, within a relational, dialogic context. The robot targeted the social, interactive nature of language learning through a storytelling game, mediated by a tablet, that the robot and child played together. During the game, the robot introduced new vocabulary words and modeled good story narration skills. In a microgenetic study, 17 children played the storytelling game with the robot eight times each over a two month period. With half the children, the robot adapted its level of language to the child's level – so that, as children improved their storytelling skills, so did the robot. The other half played with a robot that did not adapt. I evaluated whether this adaptation influenced (i) whether children learned new words from the robot, (ii) the complexity and style of stories children told, and (iii) the similarity of children’s stories to the robot’s stories. I expected that children would learn more from a robot that adapted, and that they would copy its stories and narration style more than they would with a robot that did not adapt. Children's language use was tracked across sessions. I found that children in the adaptive condition maintained or increased the amount and diversity of the language they used during interactions with the robot. While children in all conditions learned new vocabulary words, created new stories during the game, and enjoyed playing with the robot, children who played with the adaptive robot improved more than children who played with the non-adaptive robot. Understanding how the robot influences children's language, and how a robot could support language development will inform the design of future learning/teaching companions that engage children as peers in educational play.

As such, interoception is critical for our sense of embodiment, motivation, and well-being. And yet, despite its importance, interoception remains poorly understood within modern science. This paper reviews interdisciplinary perspectives on interoception, with the goal of presenting a unified perspective from diverse fields such as neuroscience, clinical practice, and contemplative studies. It is hoped that this integrative effort will advance our understanding of how interoception determines well-being, and identify the central challenges to such understanding. To this end, we introduce an expanded taxonomy of interoceptive processes, arguing that many of these processes can be understood through an emerging predictive coding model for mind–body integration. The model, which describes the tension between expected and felt body sensation, parallels contemplative theories, and implicates interoception in a variety of affective and psychosomatic disorders. We conclude that maladaptive construal of bodily sensations may lie at the heart of many contemporary maladies, and that contemplative practices may attenuate these interpretative biases, restoring a person’s sense of presence and agency in the world.","[{'authorId': '6388953', 'name': 'N.

Different interaction styles may be simulated through the use of verbal and non-verbal features that may not be easily recognized by the user as intended by the designer. For this reason, this study aimed to evaluate how three different robot interaction styles (i.e., Friendly, Neutral, and Authoritarian) were perceived by humans in the context of a robot carrying out cognitive tests. The Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) was proposed to measure the perceived Valence, Arousal, and Dominance. We expected that a Neutral behavior is characterized by low Arousal, a Friendly by high Valence, and an Authoritarian by high Dominance. Moreover, the perception of a Socially Assistive Robot’s behavior is closely linked to trust, which is a key component to the success of any care-provider/user relationship. Hence, a Trust Perception Scale was used to explore the effect of the interaction style on trust. The results confirmed our hypothesis and showed a significant difference between each value with the others. Furthermore, we expected to obtain a higher value of trust with the Authoritarian since the performance of the users who interacted with the Authoritarian was better than the others.

This study examined the role of cool and hot EF in teacher reported aggression, differentiating between reactive and proactive as well as physical and relational aggression. Children (N = 106) completed laboratory tasks measuring cool (inhibition, planning, working memory) and hot EF (affective decision-making, delay of gratification). Cool, but not hot, EF significantly contributed to understanding of childhood aggression. Inhibition was a central predictor of childhood aggression. Planning and working memory, in contrast, were significant independent predictors of proactive relational aggression only. Added to this, prosocial behaviour moderated the relationship between working memory and reactive relational aggression.

Grey literature was also searched using PsycExtra, OpenGrey, British Library EThOS, and the British Library Catalogue. Databases were searched from inception until April (6th) 2021. Synthesis methods Searches undertaken across seven databases yielded 2145 articles. Forty studies met our review inclusion criteria of which 17 were randomized control trials. The methodological quality of studies was conducted with the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. A narrative synthesis summarised the findings. A meta-analysis was conducted with 12 RCTs. Results Most interventions used humanoid (67%) robotic platforms, were predominantly based in clinics (37%) followed home, schools and laboratory (17% respectively) environments and targeted at improving social and communication skills (77%). Focusing on the most common outcomes, a random effects meta-analysis of RCTs showed that robot-mediated interventions significantly improved social functioning (g = 0.35 [95%CI 0.09 to 0.61; k = 7). By contrast, robots did not improve emotional (g = 0.63 [95%CI -1.43 to 2.69]; k = 2) or motor outcomes (g = -0.10 [95%CI -1.08 to 0.89]; k = 3), but the numbers of trials were very small. Meta-regression revealed that age accounted for almost one-third of the variance in effect sizes, with greater benefits being found in younger children. Conclusions Overall, our findings support the use of robot-mediated interventions for autistic children and youth, and we propose several recommendations for future research to aid learning and enhance implementation in everyday settings. PROSPERO registration Our methods were preregistered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42019148981).","[{'authorId': '117608078', 'name': 'A. Kouroupa'}, {'authorId': '1859664', 'name': 'K.

The present study used growth modeling to examine the change over time and the final status in children's abilities to self-regulate, in a sample of 2,441 low-income children aged 14 to 36 months. Positive growth in their self-regulation occurred between 14 and 36 months, but individual variation was observed in both the growth rates and final status. Children who showed high degrees of negativity at 14, 24 and 36 months grew at slower rates than other children. Boys and children high in negativity had lower scores in self-regulation at 36 months than girls and children with low negativity, whereas higher quality mother–child interactions at 14 and 24 months were associated with better self-regulation at 36 months. The results suggest that some children may be at risk for developing problems in regulation because of mother–child interaction patterns and child characteristics such as high negativity.","[{'authorId': '2235003', 'name': 'H.

We further identify research gaps in order to support fellow researchers in the development of trustworthy robots. Studying trust repair in HRI has only recently been given more interest and we propose a taxonomy of potential trust violations and suitable repair strategies to support researchers during the development of interaction scenarios. The taxonomy distinguishes four failure types: Design, System, Expectation, and User failures and outlines potential mitigation strategies. Based on these failures, strategies for autonomous failure detection and repair are presented, employing explanation, verification and validation techniques. Finally, a research agenda for HRI is outlined, discussing identified gaps related to the relation of failures and HR-trust.

0e2e37ee083026dd0cb0637ca3b887afb7862932,"ABSTRACT Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide increasingly recognized for its role in bonding, socialization, and stress relief. Previous research has demonstrated participants' OT levels increased after interacting with or petting a dog, suggesting OT is at least partially responsible for the calm, relaxing feeling that participants experienced during this intervention. The purpose of our study was to more closely examine changes in oxytocin levels in men and women in response to interaction with their own dog after being separated from the dog while at work all day. This condition was compared with a reading control condition, without the presence of the dog. Because the workplace is a common stressor, participants were examined after work to evaluate how interacting with a pet may help decrease stress, as evidenced by increases in serum oxytocin levels. Ten men and ten women participated in the study. Serum oxytocin levels were obtained before the participants had contact with their dogs and then again after 25 minutes of interaction with their dog. The same protocol was followed for the reading condition except that instead of interacting with their dog, participants read nonfiction materials selected by the researchers. Serum oxytocin levels increased statistically more for women who interacted with their dog when compared with women in the reading condition (p = 0.003). There was no significant increase in oxytocin level in men after interaction with the bonded dog compared with the reading condition; in fact, male oxytocin levels decreased after both the dog and reading conditions. These results suggest that men and women may have different hormonal responses to interaction with their dogs. It is unclear to what degree OT reactivity was affected by hormones, personality traits, or interpersonal relationships; factors which warrant further research.","[{'authorId': '40555954', 'name': 'Suzanne C.

However, the limits to and potential of robotic analogues of living animals as social and therapeutic partners remain unclear. Do children and adults view robotic pets as “animal-like,”“machine-like,” or some combination of both? How do social behaviors differ toward a robotic versus living dog? To address these issues, we synthesized data from three studies of the robotic dog AIBO: (1) a content analysis of 6,438 Internet postings by 182 adult AIBO owners; (2) observations and interviews with 80 preschoolers during play periods with AIBO and with a stuffed dog; and (3) observations and interviews with 72 children, aged 7–15 years, who played with AIBO and a living dog. Overall, the studies revealed that “hybrid” cognitions and behaviors about AIBO emerged: the robotic dog was treated as a technological artifact that also embodied attributes of living animals, such as having mental states, being a social other, and having moral standing (although this latter finding remained difficult to interpret). Implications for use of robotic pets as companions and in interventions or therapy are explored.","[{'authorId': '2964133', 'name': 'G. F. Melson'}, {'authorId': '144674612', 'name': 'P.

0e37bf583e94349fc1ed9969335616e4220985f2,"Introduction Classrooms are complex societies where students and teachers live and interact with each other. Teachers are the leaders of these societies and the way they exercise their leadership abilities greatly affect the quality of interactions that take place between teachers and students as well as the interactions that take place between and among the students themselves. These interactions, both social and instructional, have a great impact on the academic and social growth of the students assigned to a given teacher's classroom. Educational scholars have suggested for decades that the group dynamics of a classroom needs to be analyzed in order to fully understand how teachers best function in their role and how students best learn (Bracey, 2009a; Pianta, 2006; Eisner, 1984; Schlechty, 1976; Lortie, 1975; Jackson, 1968; Waller, 1961). Bracey (2009b) noted that educational research should focus on the way teachers and students interact and how teachers structure learning environments to promote these interactions. Research that focuses on how the average student or average teacher functions on an isolated task misses the significance of understanding how teachers and students interact in the learning environment and how the internal relationships in a classroom impact both student and teacher behavior. The purpose of this study was to conduct a comparative analysis in order to determine what life is like for students and teachers in classrooms where teachers have been categorized as strong by their principals vis-a-vis those classrooms where teachers have been categorized as needs improvement by the same principals. Specifically, the relationship existing between student and teacher interactions and student and teacher time-on-task was analyzed. The reported findings have significant implications for teacher educators who are guiding pre-service and in-service teachers in their development of productive learning environments. Review of Literature Teachers have varied opinions regarding what they believe are effective techniques for managing children's behavior in a classroom setting. In fact, classroom management may be the most discussed topic among teachers at all grade levels and career stages. A number of studies suggest that a direct link exists between teachers' ability to manage classroom behavior and their students' learning. For example, Baugous and Bendery (2000) suggested students are on task more in classrooms that have fewer management problems; it has been reported that such management problems tend to distract both teachers and students making it difficult for either to focus on learning experiences (Clough, Smassal, & Clough, 1994). Prater (1992) reported, the optimal teaching and learning environment is one where the teacher puts an emphasis on preventing management disruptions because such an environment will likely increase student time-on-task and, of course, learning. Finally, Rimm-Kaufmann, La Paro, Downer, and Pianta (2005) found that high classroom quality was most consistently related to a low number of management problems. Additionally, management problems can affect the amount and quality of interactions in the classroom. It has been reported that teachers are less apt to have positive interactions with behaviorally challenging students and even avoid contact with these students as stress levels increase (Abidin & Kmetz, 1997). Schlechty's classic work (1976) described a similar type of teacher behavior as retreating; that is, the teacher failed to react when students' violated previously written or stated rules for conduct. The Research Project Recently, the authors conducted a study to examine life in two distinctly different types of classrooms: those with teachers categorized as strong and those categorized as needs improvement. It is important to note that, during the data collection phase of this project, the researchers had no knowledge as to how the teachers had been categorized. …","[{'authorId': '113851474', 'name': 'Nancy J.

Our conceptual model proposes that the determinants of behavioral symptoms derive from three sources, the patient, the caregiver, and the environment.

This paper describes the development of a social interactive healthcare robot named Charles, capable of measuring blood pressure. Using blood pressure monitoring as the service scenario, a user study was conducted to investigate the differences between two age groups (40 to 65 years and over 65 years) in attitudes and reactions before and after their interactions with Charles. The results showed few differences between the two age groups. A significant gender effect was found, with males having a more positive attitude toward robots in healthcare than females. This study reveals the importance of considering gender issues in the design of healthcare robots for older people.

Over the last few decades, its prevalence showed dramatic rise; an observation that encouraged many researchers across the globe to try to explore all its aspects from etiology to diagnosis and treatment. Although autistic caregivers as well as physicians and researchers would like to know the exact cause of ASD and find a definitive cure for it, this goal still seems to be distant. Accordingly, the realistic achievable goal in dealing with ASD is to try to direct all the available resources to help its sufferers to improve their skills and functioning and get the utmost benefits of their strengths aiming at improving their quality of life.

Furthermore, emotions are inherently interpersonal. We learn what to feel from others, especially when we are children. We “catch” other people’s emotions just by being around them. We get caught in escalating response–counterresponse emotional sequences. This all takes place in time, generating complex patterns of interpersonal emotional dynamics. This review summarizes theory, empirical findings, and key challenges for future research regarding three processes that contribute to interpersonal affective dynamics: (a) Convergence of social partners’ emotional responses to the external world, (b) emotional reactivity of social partners to each other, and (c) interpersonal emotion regulation.","[{'authorId': '34687440', 'name': 'Emily Butler'}]",138.0,,46.0,Interpersonal Affect Dynamics: It Takes Two (and Time) to Tango,2015.0
0f57af8d69a3dd2a756d139199eda91d0d81ad72,"In both biology and the human sciences, social groups are sometimes treated as adaptive units whose organization cannot be reduced to individual interactions. This group-level view is opposed by a more individualistic one that treats social organization as a byproduct of self-interest. According to biologists, group-level adaptations can evolve only by a process of natural selection at the group level. Most biologists rejected group selection as an important evolutionary force during the 1960s and 1970s but a positive literature began to grow during the 1970s and is rapidly expanding today. We review this recent literature and its implications for human evolutionary biology. We show that the rejection of group selection was based on a misplaced emphasis on genes as “replicators” which is in fact irrelevant to the question of whether groups can be like individuals in their functional organization. The fundamental question is whether social groups and other higher-level entities can be “vehicles” of selection. When this elementary fact is recognized, group selection emerges as an important force in nature and what seem to be competing theories, such as kin selection and reciprocity, reappear as special cases of group selection. The result is a unified theory of natural selection that operates on a nested hierarchy of units. The vehicle-based theory makes it clear that group selection is an important force to consider in human evolution. Humans can facultatively span the full range from self-interested individuals to “organs” of group-level “organisms.” Human behavior not only reflects the balance between levels of selection but it can also alter the balance through the construction of social structures that have the effect of reducing fitness differences within groups, concentrating natural selection (and functional organization) at the group level. These social structures and the cognitive abilities that produce them allow group selection to be important even among large groups of unrelated individuals.","[{'authorId': '40652121', 'name': 'D.

0f656d9d03c069f88ca429c99e49e91cdb601b83,"Prior research with preschool children has established that dialogic or active book reading is an effective method for expanding young children’s vocabulary. In this exploratory study, we asked whether similar benefits are observed when a robot engages in dialogic reading with preschoolers. Given the established effectiveness of active reading, we also asked whether this effectiveness was critically dependent on the expressive characteristics of the robot. For approximately half the children, the robot’s active reading was expressive; the robot’s voice included a wide range of intonation and emotion (Expressive). For the remaining children, the robot read and conversed with a flat voice, which sounded similar to a classic text-to-speech engine and had little dynamic range (Flat). The robot’s movements were kept constant across conditions. We performed a verification study using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to confirm that the Expressive robot was viewed as significantly more expressive, more emotional, and less passive than the Flat robot. We invited 45 preschoolers with an average age of 5 years who were either English Language Learners (ELL), bilingual, or native English speakers to engage in the reading task with the robot. The robot narrated a story from a picture book, using active reading techniques and including a set of target vocabulary words in the narration. Children were post-tested on the vocabulary words and were also asked to retell the story to a puppet. A subset of 34 children performed a second story retelling 4–6 weeks later. Children reported liking and learning from the robot a similar amount in the Expressive and Flat conditions. However, as compared to children in the Flat condition, children in the Expressive condition were more concentrated and engaged as indexed by their facial expressions; they emulated the robot’s story more in their story retells; and they told longer stories during their delayed retelling. Furthermore, children who responded to the robot’s active reading questions were more likely to correctly identify the target vocabulary words in the Expressive condition than in the Flat condition. Taken together, these results suggest that children may benefit more from the expressive robot than from the flat robot.","[{'authorId': '19226999', 'name': 'Jacqueline M.

This is especially true when the target users are older adults with dementia since this usually requires hours of interactions and puts quite a lot of workload on the user. This paper addresses the problem of importing the Personas technique from HRI to create fictional patients’ profiles. We propose a Persona-Behaviour Simulator tool that provides, with high-level abstraction, user’s actions during an HRI task, and we apply it to cognitive training exercises for older adults with dementia. It consists of a Persona Definition that characterizes a patient along four dimensions and a Task Engine that provides information regarding the task complexity. We build a simulated environment where the high-level user’s actions are provided by the simulator and the robot initial policy is learned using a Q-learning algorithm. The results show that the current simulator provides a reasonable initial policy for a defined Persona profile. Moreover, the learned robot assistance has proved to be robust to potential changes in the user’s behaviour. In this way, we can speed up the fine-tuning of the rough policy during the real interactions to tailor the assistance to the given user. We believe the presented approach can be easily extended to account for other types of HRI tasks; for example, when input data is required to train a learning algorithm, but data collection is very expensive or unfeasible. We advocate that simulation is a convenient tool in these cases.","[{'authorId': '51115548', 'name': 'Antonio Andriella'}, {'authorId': '1735976', 'name': 'C.

Given this, we made specific modifications to the simulated RL robot to incorporate guidance. We then analyze and evaluate its learning performance in a second user study, and we report significant improvements on several measures.

We used a behavioral adaptation paradigm to investigate whether the previously noted perceptual similarities between trustworthiness and emotional expressions of anger and happiness extend to their underlying neural representations. We found that adapting to angry or happy facial expressions causes trustworthiness evaluations of subsequently rated neutral faces to increase or decrease, respectively. Further, we found no such modulation of trustworthiness evaluations after participants were adapted to fearful expressions, suggesting that this effect is specific to angry and happy expressions. We conclude that, in line with the overgeneralization hypothesis, a common neural system is engaged during the evaluation of facial trustworthiness and expressions of anger and happiness.","[{'authorId': '2204167', 'name': 'Andrew D.

Pet therapy has been known to be emotionally beneficial for many years. Robotic pets have been shown to have similar positive effects without the negative aspects of traditional pets. Robotic pet therapy offers an alternative to traditional pet therapy. Objective: The study rigorously assesses the effectiveness of the PARO robotic pet, an FDA approved biofeedback device, in treating dementia-related symptoms. Methods: A randomized block design with repeated measurements guided the study. Before and after measures included reliable, valid tools such as: RAID, CSDD, GDS, pulse rate, pulse oximetry, and GSR. Participants interacted with the PARO robotic pet, and the control group received standard activity programs. Five urban secure dementia units comprised the setting. Results: 61 patients, with 77% females, average 83.4 years in age, were randomized into control and treatment groups. Compared to the control group, RAID, CSDD, GSR, and pulse oximetry were increased in the treatment group, while pulse rate, pain medication, and psychoactive medication use were decreased. The changes in GSR, pulse oximetry, and pulse rate over time were plotted for both groups. The difference between groups was consistent throughout the 12-week study for pulse oximetry and pulse rate, while GSR had several weeks when changes were similar between groups. Conclusions: Treatment with the PARO robot decreased stress and anxiety in the treatment group and resulted in reductions in the use of psychoactive medications and pain medications in elderly clients with dementia.","[{'authorId': '2059921467', 'name': 'Sandra Petersen'}, {'authorId': '2068773524', 'name': 'Susan Houston'}, {'authorId': '144021765', 'name': 'Huanying Qin'}, {'authorId': '7504006', 'name': 'C.

There were two groups of elderly people: one was with mild/moderate dementia (M-group) that consisted with 19 elderly residents in the general ward, and the other was with severe dementia (S-group) that consisted with 11 elderly residents in the dementia ward. Method: Each elderly resident in both groups interacted with either PARO or a control (stuffed lion toy: Lion) brought by a staff at each resident’s private room. Their responses were recorded on video. Behavioral analysis of the initial 6 min of the interaction was conducted using a time sampling method. Results: In both groups, subjects talked more frequently to PARO than to Lion, showed more positive changes in emotional expression with PARO than with Lion, and laughed more frequently with PARO than with Lion. Subjects in M-group even showed more negative emotional expressions with Lion than with PARO. Furthermore, subjects in S-group showed neutral expression more frequently with Lion than with PARO, suggesting more active interaction with PARO. For subjects in M-group, frequencies of touching and stroking, frequencies of talking to staff member, and frequencies of talking initiated by staff member were significantly higher with Lion than with PARO. Conclusion: The elderly people both with mild/moderate dementia and with severe dementia showed greater interest in PARO than in Lion. The results suggest that introducing PARO may increase willingness of the staff members to communicate and work with elderly people with dementia, especially those with mild/moderate dementia who express their demand of communication more than those with severe dementia.","[{'authorId': '49998692', 'name': 'K.

The present case study was done on an adult learner of German and analyzed her accounts of experiencing boredom throughout a whole semester, 13 sessions in length. The trajectory of boredom throughout the course showed that the beginning of the course was the most boring though the learner continued to experience boredom until the end of the semester. Among the theoretical explanations of boredom, under-stimulation, low perceived control over tasks and attention deficit were found to be the most dominant until the end of the course. Among the nontheoretical explanations of boredom, user-unfriendly requirements of online learning prevailed mostly in the beginning of the course until the middle but they were found to be less influential in the end of the course. The process tracing approach showed to be effective in unpacking the black box of the causal mechanisms involved in the boredom experienced in the online L3 learning. Suggestions were made on how to make an online language course less boring and more communicative, which seems essential today due to the unrivaled use of online education during the pandemic.","[{'authorId': '70075457', 'name': 'Elham Yazdanmehr'}, {'authorId': '147457295', 'name': 'Majid Elahi Shirvan'}, {'authorId': '118495682', 'name': 'Khatereh Saghafi'}]",29.0,,55.0,A process tracing study of the dynamic patterns of boredom in an online L3 course of German during COVID‐19 pandemic,2021.0

New research on emotion and cognition has shown that attractive things really do work better, a fact fans of Don Norman's classic The Design of Everyday Things cannot afford to ignore.In recent years, the design community has focused on making products easier to use. But as Norman amply demonstrates in this fascinating and important new book, design experts have vastly underestimated the role of emotion on our experience of everyday objects. Emotional Design analyzes the profound influence of this deceptively simple idea, from our willingness to spend thousands of dollars on Gucci bags and Rolex watches to the impact of emotion on the everyday objects of tomorrow. In the future, will inanimate objects respond to human emotions? Is it possible to create emotional robots?Norman addresses these provocative questions--drawing on a wealth of examples and the latest scientific insights--in this bold exploration of the objects in our everyday world.","[{'authorId': '1728478', 'name': 'D.

As we increasingly create spaces where robotic technology interacts with humans, this inclination raises ethical questions around use and policy. A human-robot-interaction experiment conducted in our lab indicates that framing robots through anthropomorphic language (like a personified name or story) can impact how people perceive and treat a robot. This chapter explores the effects of encouraging or discouraging people to anthropomorphize robots through framing. I discuss concerns about anthropomorphizing robotic technology in certain contexts, but argue that there are also cases where encouraging anthropomorphism is desirable. Because people respond to framing, framing could help to separate these cases.","[{'authorId': '48891226', 'name': 'K. Darling'}]",171.0,,33.0,"'Who's Johnny?'

The integration of social robots to support learners has already shown promise to benefit the learning process in this area. In this paper, we focus on the applicability of an adaptive robotic tutor in a university setting. To this end, we conducted a long-term field study implementing an adaptive robotic tutor to support students with exam preparation over three sessions during one semester. In a mixed design, we compared the effect of an adaptive tutor to a control condition across all learning sessions. With the aim to benefit not only motivation but also academic success and the learning experience in general, we draw from research in adaptive tutoring, social robots in education, as well as our own prior work in this field. Our results show that opting in for the robotic tutoring is beneficial for students. We found significant subjective knowledge gain and increases in intrinsic motivation regarding the content of the course in general. Finally, participation resulted in a significantly better exam grade compared to students not participating. However, the extended adaptivity of the robotic tutor in the experimental condition did not seem to enhance learning, as we found no significant differences compared to a non-adaptive version of the robot.","[{'authorId': '151110885', 'name': 'Melissa Donnermann'}, {'authorId': '11715171', 'name': 'Philipp Schaper'}, {'authorId': '2117313647', 'name': 'Birgit Lugrin'}]",7.0,,37.0,Social Robots in Applied Settings: A Long-Term Study on Adaptive Robotic Tutors in Higher Education,2022.0

The purpose of this study was to explore care staff perceptions of Paro and a look-alike non-robotic animal, including benefits and limitations in dementia care. Methods: The study assumed a descriptive qualitative approach, nested within a large cluster-randomised controlled trial. We interviewed a subsample of 20 facility care staff, from nine long-term care facilities in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Thematic analysis of the data, which was inductive and data-driven, was undertaken with the assistance of the qualitative software, ATLAS.ti®. Results: The findings refer to four categories: increasing excitement for Paro and decreasing enthusiasm for Plush Toy; value and function of Paro; opportunities for engagement; and alternatives vs. robustness. Conclusion: Staff caring for people with dementia preferred Paro compared to a look-alike Plush Toy. Staff identified that Paro had the potential to improve quality of life for people with dementia, whereas the Plush Toy had limitations when compared to Paro. However, participants expressed concern that the cost of Paro could reduce opportunities for use within aged care.","[{'authorId': '3481695', 'name': 'W. Moyle'}, {'authorId': '46806533', 'name': 'M.

However, previous studies on these relationships have not highlighted their dynamic properties of these relationships. In addition, although the effects of surface and deep acting on emotional exhaustion have been investigated in emotional-labor research, empirical studies on these relationships still report mixed results. Thus, we suggest that moderators may affect the relationship between emotional labor and emotional exhaustion. Also, this study examines the relationship between emotional labor and emotional exhaustion within individuals by repeated measurements, and verifies the mediating effect of a negative affect state. Finally, our study confirms the moderating effects that affective commitment has on the relationship between emotional labor and emotional exhaustion. Data was collected from tellers who had a high degree of interaction with clients at banks based in South Korea. A total of 56 tellers participated in the survey and responded for five working days. A total of 616 data entries were collected from the 56 respondents. We used a hierarchical linear model (HLM) to examine our hypothesis. The results showed that surface-acting emotional labor increases emotional exhaustion; furthermore, the relationship between surface acting emotional labor and emotional exhaustion is mediated by a negative affect state within individuals. In addition, this study verified that affective commitment buffers the negative effects that surface acting emotional labor has on emotional exhaustion. These results suggest that emotional labor is a dynamic process within individuals, and that emotional exhaustion caused by emotional labor differs among individuals, and is dependent upon factors such as the individual’s level of affective commitment.","[{'authorId': '117513617', 'name': 'H.

In this article we propose that angels in the nursery-care-receiving experiences characterized by intense shared affect between parent and child in which the child feels nearly perfectly understood, accepted, and loved-provide the child with a core sense of security and self-worth that can be drawn upon when the child becomes a parent to interrupt the cycle of maltreatment. We argue that uncovering angels as growth-promoting forces in the lives of traumatized parents is as vital to the work of psychotherapy as is the interpretation and exorcizing of ghosts. Using clinical case material, we demonstrate the ways in which early benevolent experiences with caregivers can protect against even overwhelming trauma, and examine the reemergence of these benevolent figures in consciousness as an instrument of therapeutic change.

Although progress has been made in elucidating the mechanisms underlying CR, the role of attention remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of attention in CR by tracking participants' gazes during the presentation of videos depicting people in negative moods. Participants were asked to attend naturally or to use reappraisal to increase or decrease their emotions while viewing the videos. After each video, they rated their negative emotion experience. Results showed that participants spent more time looking at the emotional regions in the target's face (eyes and mouth) when asked to up-regulate their emotions, compared with when they simply attended to the videos. The reverse pattern was found for down-regulation of emotions. In addition, the effects of cognitive reappraisal on negative emotion experience were mediated by the time spent looking at the emotional regions, with a stronger effect for the down-regulation instruction. Finally, direct effects of regulation instruction on negative emotion were observed even when controlling for time spent viewing emotional regions, which suggests that attention and CR are distinct components that uniquely influence negative emotions. These results complement and extend previous findings on the role of attention in CR, and highlight the importance of taking attentional mechanisms into account when designing CR training.","[{'authorId': '4192721', 'name': 'V.

Furthermore, two ways of fabricating a multiple DOF robot are explored: casting the complete robot as a whole and casting single degree of freedom (DOF) segments with subsequent concatenation. We experimentally validate each soft actuator morphology and fabrication process by creating multiple physical soft robot prototypes.","[{'authorId': '3217801', 'name': 'A.

Social robots are currently a form of assistive technology for the elderly, healthy, or with cognitive impairment, helping to maintain their independence and improve their well-being.


OBJECTIVE
The main aim of this article is to present a review of the existing research in the literature, referring to the use of social robots for people with dementia and/or aging.


METHODS
Academic databases that were used to perform the searches are IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar, taking into account as date of publication the last 10 years, from 2007 to the present. Several search criteria were established such as ""robot"" AND ""dementia,"" ""robot"" AND ""cognitive impairment,"" ""robot"" AND ""social"" AND ""aging,"" and so on., selecting the articles of greatest interest regarding the use of social robots in elderly people with or without dementia.


RESULTS
This search found a total of 96 articles on social robots in healthy people and with dementia, of which 38 have been identified as relevant work. Many of the articles show the acceptance of older people toward social robots.


CONCLUSION
From the review of the research articles analyzed, it can be said that use of social robots in elderly people without cognitive impairment and with dementia, help in a positive way to work independently in basic activities and mobility, provide security, and reduce stress.","[{'authorId': '1394599004', 'name': 'Susel Góngora Alonso'}, {'authorId': '3047996', 'name': 'Sofiane Hamrioui'}, {'authorId': '29836747', 'name': 'Isabel de la Torre Díez'}, {'authorId': '30699563', 'name': 'E.

To answer this question, we conducted a between-subjects experiment in the laboratory with n = 48 students who encountered a humanoid robot (Softbank Robotics’ NAO) that either did or did not touch their hand in a non-functional manner during a counseling conversation. The analyses of participants’ behavior revealed that they mostly reacted by smiling and laughing. Furthermore, participants who were touched by the robot complied significantly more frequently with a request posed by the robot during conversation, and reported better feelings compared to those who were not touched. However, there were no effects of robot touch on subjective evaluations of the robot or on the interaction experience.","[{'authorId': '3689632', 'name': 'Laura Hoffmann'}, {'authorId': '1750852', 'name': 'N.

Using partial least squares, we sought to specify interrelations among all theory-based components of social–emotional learning (SEL), and their ability to predict later classroom adjustment and academic readiness in a modelling context. Consequently, self-regulation, emotion knowledge, social problem solving, and social–emotional behaviour were assessed via direct assessment and observation for 101 preschoolers; teachers provided information on classroom adjustment through kindergarten and academic readiness in kindergarten. Our final outer (measurement) model showed robust latent variables for SEL components. Regarding the inner (structural) model, latent variables showed expected predictive relations among SEL components, and with later classroom adjustment and academic readiness: preschoolers’ executive control predicted aspects of their social cognition (i.e., emotion knowledge and social problem solving) and emotionally negative/aggressive behaviour, and emotion knowledge predicted their emotionally regulated/prosocial behaviour. Further, most SEL components directly and/or indirectly predicted teachers’ evaluations of later classroom adjustment and kindergarten academic readiness. Our findings extend our understanding of SEL during preschool, suggesting that early assessment and monitoring is possible using these instruments, and potentially aiding the development of programmes to maximize children’ sS EL in the service of early school success.

ICR is a somewhat controversial topic in the qualitative research community, with some arguing that it is an inappropriate or unnecessary step within the goals of qualitative analysis. Yet ICR assessment can yield numerous benefits for qualitative studies, which include improving the systematicity, communicability, and transparency of the coding process; promoting reflexivity and dialogue within research teams; and helping convince diverse audiences of the trustworthiness of the analysis. Few guidelines exist to help researchers negotiate the assessment of ICR in qualitative analysis. The current article explains what ICR is, reviews common arguments for and against its incorporation in qualitative analysis and offers guidance on the practical elements of performing an ICR assessment.","[{'authorId': '1402671929', 'name': 'C.

The central hypothesis is that for both kinds of textiles, there will be differences depending on whether the study participants experience the textiles via vision alone or via both vision and touch. If designers could begin to understand the nature of what various textile expressions communicated, and what computational textiles communicated in transformation then it would be possible to more clearly understand the role that texture of a computational textile plays in communicating emotion through a computational object.","[{'authorId': '145442167', 'name': 'Felecia Davis'}]",18.0,,43.0,The Textility of Emotion: A Study Relating Computational Textile Textural Expression to Emotion,2015.0

These effects are grounded in our earliest intimate experiences: being held by our loving caregivers. These findings provide reasons to incorporate warmth in devices for distant affective communication, which could simulate one's body heat. An experiment was carried out to gain a better understanding of the implications of physical warmth for mediated social interaction. Moreover, we aimed at disentangling effects of social warmth (body temperature) from effects of non-social warmth (artificial heat sources and ambient temperature). Except for an increase in perceptions of metaphorical warmth as a consequence of higher ambient temperature, no effects were found. We use our study to pinpoint the caveats and challenges that research into warmth in affective mediated interaction faces.","[{'authorId': '23824995', 'name': 'Christian J. A. M.

This study explores three elements that contribute to responsiveness—emotional labor, job engagement, and ethical leadership. Three findings emerge: First, in terms of workers and their expression of work-related emotion, authentic emotive expression relates positively with job engagement while pretending to feel the emotion being displayed has a negative relationship. Second, ethical leadership moderates the relationship between pretending and job engagement, in that higher levels of ethical leadership lessen the negative influence of pretense in emotive expression. This means that when employees must mask how they feel, ethical leadership compensates for the deleterious effect of expressing an emotion other than what one is feeling. This, in turn, helps to prevent decreased job engagement. Third, ethical leadership does not affect the relationship between authentic emotive expression and job engagement.

To examine the reliability and validity of the 42-item Brief Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (BITSEA), a screener for social-emotional/behavioral problems and delays in competence.


METHOD
Parents in a representative healthy birth cohort of 1,237 infants aged 12 to 36 months completed the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA)/BITSEA, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)/1.5-5, the MacArthur Communication Developmental Inventory vocabulary checklist, and worry questions. In a subsample, independent evaluators rated infant-toddler behavior.


RESULTS
Test-retest reliability was excellent and interrater agreement (mother/father and parent/child-care provider) was good. Supporting validity, BITSEA problems correlated with concurrent evaluator problem ratings and CBCL/1.5-5 scores and also predicted CBCL/1.5-5 and ITSEA problem scores one year later. BITSEA measures of competence correlated with concurrent observed competence and predicted later ITSEA competence measures. Supporting discriminant validity, only 23% of high BITSEA problem scorers had delayed vocabulary. Moreover, the combined BITSEA problem/competence cutpoints identified 85% of subclinical/clinical CBCL/1.5-5 scores, while maintaining acceptable specificity (75%).


CONCLUSIONS
Findings support the BITSEA as a screener for social-emotional/behavioral problems and delays in social-emotional competence.","[{'authorId': '1398059729', 'name': 'Margaret J.

Although there has been a considerable amount of research on automatic emotion recognition in adults, emotion recognition in children has been understudied. This problem is more challenging as children tend to fidget and move around more than adults, leading to more self-occlusions and non-frontal head poses. Also, the lack of publicly available datasets for children with annotated emotion labels leads most researchers to focus on adults. In this paper, we introduce a newly collected multimodal emotion dataset of children between the ages of four and fourteen years old. The dataset contains 1102 audio-visual clips annotated for 17 different emotional states: six basic emotions, neutral, valence and nine complex emotions including curiosity, uncertainty and frustration. Our experiments compare unimodal and multimodal emotion recognition baseline models to enable future research on this topic. Finally, we present a detailed analysis of the most indicative behavioral cues for emotion recognition in children.","[{'authorId': '2974242', 'name': 'Behnaz Nojavanasghari'}, {'authorId': '1756344', 'name': 'T.

Participants were 4-year-old children (n = 510) attending preschools in South Australia. Children's level of self-regulation was assessed using the parent-completed Devereux Early Childhood Assessment when children were aged 4, 5, and 6. Children's level of behavioral problems was assessed using total, internalizing, and externalizing scores on parent- and teacher-rated Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQs) when children were 6 years old. Random effects regression was used to describe the changes to children's self-regulation between 4 and 6 years. Linear regression models were then used to determine the strength of the association between the extent of self-regulation improvement and level of behavioral problems. Greater improvement in self-regulation, adjusted for family characteristics and baseline self-regulation scores, was associated with lower levels of parent- (B = -3.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-4.49, -2.65]) and teacher-rated SDQ total difficulties scores at 6 years (B = -2.42, 95% CI [-3.50, -1.34]). These effects remained after adjustment for level of parent-rated behavioral problems at 4 years. Similar effects were found for internalizing and externalizing scores at age 6 years. The results highlight the importance of improvements in self-regulation from 4-6 years for childhood behavioral problems during the early school years. Children with lower levels of improvement in self-regulation early in life are at risk for higher levels of behavioral problems both at home and at school.","[{'authorId': '145298468', 'name': 'A.

Parallel to this, children’s creative levels show a decline related to different factors, including the standardized teaching and learning dynamics present in traditional school systems. This work aims to investigate if the activities with robots already present in schools affect children’s creativity levels. To study this, we compared creative levels of children across three study conditions: (1) Experimental condition 1: Children performed STEM activities in school by learning how to program robots; (2) Experimental condition 2: Children performed STEAM activities by learning how to design robots; (3) Control condition: Children engaged in a music class. We applied the Test for Creative Thinking-Drawing Production (TCT-DP), a validated test that measures creative potential, before and after the intervention. Our results showed that the creativity levels of children increased from pre- to post-testing, revealing the effect of all intervention groups in potentiating creativity. Additionally, results showed that creative levels were significantly higher in the control condition. This result was expected since this condition consisted of an artistic musical intervention where creativity is foreseen to be stimulated. When analyzing the effects of the interventions on the two dimensions of TCT-DP (i.e., adaptiveness and innovativeness), results showed that both the control and the programming condition stimulated innovativeness. This result seems to show that STEM activities can stimulate non-conventional ways of thinking, similarly to creative activities such as a music class. While much has been studied about how STEM activities influence the knowledge of children, little is known if STEM also contributes to the stimulation of their creativity. This study promotes investigation in this topic and shows the potential of using robots to unlock creative potentials in children.","[{'authorId': '1401670338', 'name': 'Patrícia Alves-Oliveira'}, {'authorId': '39176756', 'name': 'Patrícia Arriaga'}, {'authorId': '115401246', 'name': 'Sara Ibérico Nogueira'}, {'authorId': '115420343', 'name': 'A.

Rotation of head away from the side of the contracting sternocleidomastoid muscle. 2. Tilting of the head toward the contracting sterno-cleidomastoid muscle. 3. Flexion of the neck by both sternocleidomastoid muscles . 4. Elevation of the shoulder by the trapezius. 5. Drawing the head back so the face is upward by the trapezius muscles. With weakness or paralysis these functions are decreased or absent. When the lesion is nuclear or infranuclear, there is associated muscle atrophy and fasciculations. Technique Observe the volume and contour of the sternocleidomastoid muscles as the patient looks ahead. Test the right sterno-cleidomastoid muscle by facing the patient and placing your right palm laterally on the patient's left cheek. Ask the patient to turn the head to the left, resisting the pressure you are exerting in the opposite direction. At the same time, observe and palpate the right sternocleidomastoid with your left hand. Then reverse the procedure to test the left ster-nocleidomastoid. Continue to test the sternocleidomastoid by placing your hand on the patient's forehead and pushing backward as the patient pushes forward. Observe and palpate the ster-nocleidomastoid muscles. Now test the trapezius. Ask the patient to face away from you and observe the shoulder contour for hollowing, displacement , or winging of the scapula. Observe for drooping of the shoulder. Place your hands on the patient's shoulders and press down as the patient elevates or shrugs the shoulders and then retracts the shoulders. Basic Science The eleventh nerve has two parts. The smaller cranial part arises from cells in the nucleus ambiguus and ultimately is distributed with the vagus nerve. This portion innervates the pharyngeal muscles. The main part, the spinal portion, arises from a long column of nuclei situated in the ventral part of the medulla and extending to the fifth cervical segment or lower. Supranuclear innervation is not well known. It has been characterized by authors as being ipsilateral, contralateral, or bilateral. It begins in the precentral gyri and descends in the corticobulbar tract. As the fibers leave the cord they join together and ascend through the foramen magnum, then leave through the jugular foramen with the vagus nerve. The nerve descends in the neck near the jug-ular vein and supplies the sternocleidomastoid and trape-zius muscles, joined by motor or sensory contributions from the upper cervical nerves. …","[{'authorId': '144140625', 'name': 'H.

A number of recent critical reflections are reviewed and the 'disciplinary anxieties', which this approach to HCI has aroused, are discussed. Drawing on Feyerabend's philosophical scepticism over methods and contributions to the Sociology of Science, it is suggested that design research might build its own 'limited rationality' rather than be brought in line with supposed norms for good research or criteria for rigour and relevance of unfamiliar provenance. To this end, a concept of 'annotated portfolio' is advanced, and detailed, as a means for capturing the family resemblances that exist in a collection of artefacts, simultaneously respecting the particularity of specific designs and engaging with broader concerns. The concept is demonstrated through annotating nine well-known pieces created by the Goldsmiths Interaction Research Studio. Treating this collection as an annotated portfolio highlights, formulates and collates interaction design issues in this work in a novel manner. On this basis, annotated portfolios are proposed as a viable means for communicating design thinking in HCI in a descriptive yet generative and inspirational fashion, without having recourse to standards of 'theory' which fit design practice uncomfortably.","[{'authorId': '118892592', 'name': 'Jo A.

Confirmatory factor analysis with a sample of 234 preschoolers was used to determine if tasks designed to measure EC were best described by hot (affectively salient) and cool (affectively neutral) dimensions or by a single factor. Analyses revealed that EC is best described by a single factor, even when variance associated with children's language skills was removed.

In this paper, we propose an incremental learning model for selecting the user's representative or habitual emotional behaviors which place emphasis on individual users' cultural traits identified through long term interaction. Furthermore, a transformation model is proposed to convert the obtained emotional behaviors into a specific robot's motion space. To validate the proposed approach, the models were evaluated by two example scenarios of interaction. The experimental results confirmed that the proposed approach endows a social robot with the capability to learn emotional behaviors from individual users, and to generate its emotional bodily expressions. It was also verified that the imitated robot motions are rated emotionally acceptable by the demonstrator and recognizable by the subjects from the same cultural background with the demonstrator.","[{'authorId': '2000282527', 'name': 'Nguyen Tan Viet Tuyen'}, {'authorId': '1756680', 'name': 'Sungmoon Jeong'}, {'authorId': '1771640', 'name': 'N.

 This paper describes a social robotic game player that is able to successfully play a team card game called Sueca. The question we will address in this paper is: how can we build a social robot player that is able to balance its ability to play the card game with natural and social behaviours towards its partner and its opponents. The first challenge we faced concerned the development of a competent artificial player for a hidden information game, whose time constraint is the average human decision time. To accomplish this requirement, the Perfect Information Monte Carlo (PIMC) algorithm was used. Further, we have performed an analysis of this algorithm's possible parametrizations for games trees that cannot be fully explored in a reasonable amount of time with a MinMax search. Additionally, given the nature of the Sueca game, such robotic player must master the social interactions both as a partner and as an opponent. To do that, an emotional agent framework (FAtiMA) was used to build the emotional and social behaviours of the robot. At each moment, the robot not only plays competitively but also appraises the situation and responds emotionally in a natural manner. To test the approach, we conducted a user study and compared the levels of trust participants attributed to the robots and to human partners. Results have shown that the robot team exhibited a winning rate of 60%. Concerning the social aspects, the results also showed that human players increased their trust in the robot as their game partners (similar to the way to the trust levels change towards human partners).

153669d8fe6ff51a4a41ed05af6e327e4517ad77,"Background: The ongoing curricular changes in nursing programs have resulted in a marked increase in the stress experience of nursing students. Lifestyle behaviors are recognized as essential components of stress reduction and wellbeing. These behaviors include consuming a healthy diet, engaging in exercise, and seeking social support. Emotional intelligence (EI) was also included because of its positive effects on subjective well-being and its mitigating effects on stress. The purpose of this study was to examine the link among stress perception, lifestyle behaviors, and EI. Methods: Sixty-three undergraduate nursing students with a mean age of 22 years, electronically completed tools that addressed stress perception, diet, exercise, social support, EI, and demographic characteristics. Descriptive statistics, correlational analysis, and ANOVA were used to analyze data. Results: Students reported a tendency toward perceiving a high level of stress, scored high on EI, sought social support, reported friends as the more frequent social support providers, tended to consume healthy diet, and were more likely to exercise. EI was correlated with the consumption of healthy diet, emotional social support, and instrumental social support. Consumption of a healthy diet was also correlated with exercise participation. The social support constructs of emotional, instrumental, and venting of emotions were correlated with each other. Conclusion: The study results indicate this sample of nursing students participated in a healthy lifestyle and reported high EI. Assessing stress perception needs to be focused on stress-related nursing issues.","[{'authorId': '13271061', 'name': 'N. Ali'}, {'authorId': '47985321', 'name': 'O.

Earlier work demonstrated that people perceived a robot as more emotionally capable than a computer. This led to different perceptions of aggressive behavior (as mistreatment for a robot, but not so for a computer). This study is a follow-up to that work studying how much the morphology of a robot is responsible for changes in perceived emotional capability. We collected data from 80 participants. Participants interacted with a robot and a confederate who either acted aggressively or neutrally towards the robot. We hypothesized that a large robot would not be perceived as emotionally capable as a small robot, and that the large robot would not be seen as mistreated. The participants showed no significant perception of mistreatment toward the large robot. Participants also felt the large robot was less emotionally capable. We found that when verbal abuse was directed at a larger robot, participants would not consider such behavior mistreatment, but they would when similar abuse was directed at a child-size robot.","[{'authorId': '36322186', 'name': 'Houston Lucas'}, {'authorId': '49604183', 'name': 'Jamie Poston'}, {'authorId': '1403014207', 'name': 'Nathan Yocum'}, {'authorId': '1855062', 'name': 'Zachary Carlson'}, {'authorId': '1390033049', 'name': 'David Feil-Seifer'}]",17.0,,13.0,Too big to be mistreated?

This study sought to elicit the views and preferences of UK autism community members – autistic people, parents and their broader support network – about the terms they use to describe autism. In all, 3470 UK residents responded to an online survey on their preferred ways of describing autism and their rationale for such preferences. The results clearly show that people use many terms to describe autism. The most highly endorsed terms were ‘autism’ and ‘on the autism spectrum’, and to a lesser extent, ‘autism spectrum disorder’, for which there was consensus across community groups. The groups disagreed, however, on the use of several terms. The term ‘autistic’ was endorsed by a large percentage of autistic adults, family members/friends and parents but by considerably fewer professionals; ‘person with autism’ was endorsed by almost half of professionals but by fewer autistic adults and parents. Qualitative analysis of an open-ended question revealed the reasons underlying respondents’ preferences. These findings demonstrate that there is no single way of describing autism that is universally accepted and preferred by the UK’s autism community and that some disagreements appear deeply entrenched.","[{'authorId': '5550913', 'name': 'Lorcan Kenny'}, {'authorId': '6075053', 'name': 'C.

The recognition of emotion among physically abused and physically neglected preschoolers was assessed in order to examine the effects of atypical experience on emotional development. In Experiment 1, children matched a facial expression to an emotional situation. Neglected children had more difficulty discriminating emotional expressions than did control or physically abused children. Physically abused children displayed a response bias for angry facial expressions. In Experiment 2, children rated the similarity of facial expressions. Control children viewed discrete emotions as dissimilar, neglected children saw fewer distinctions between emotions, and physically abused children showed the most variance across emotions. These results suggest that to the extent that children's experience with the world varies, so too will their interpretation and understanding of emotional signals.","[{'authorId': '39473669', 'name': 'S.

The system utilizes demonstrations provided by the user to auto-populate the knowledge base through natural interaction methods, encodes cases based on the feature structure provided by the user, and uses an adaptive-weighting technique to design a retrieval metric with linear regression in the feature-distance space. Through a tablet environment, the user teaches a task to the robot in a shared workspace and intuitively monitors the robot's behavior and progress in real time.

Neuroimaging studies suggest that this social pain is associated with activation of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), with further regulation of social pain being reflected in activation of the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (rVLPFC). The present study focused on factors that influence activation of the rVLPFC during social exclusion. We conducted a near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) experiment to investigate whether two psychosocial resources (general trust and trait self-esteem) increase rVLPFC activity during social exclusion, thereby buffering against social pain. Thirty-seven undergraduates participated in an NIRS session in which they were socially rejected during an online ball-tossing game. Levels of general trust and trait self-esteem were negatively correlated with self-reported social pain in the exclusion conditions. Furthermore, general trust was positively correlated with rVLPFC activity, although there was no such relationship with self-esteem. rVLPFC activity mediated the relationship between general trust levels and social pain. The rVLPFC appears to be critical for the regulation of social pain. Taken together, these findings suggest that general trust and trait self-esteem probably have different impacts at different times over the course of a series of adaptive processes, all geared toward the modulation of social pain.","[{'authorId': '4798811', 'name': 'K.

This research proposes that the Geneva Emotion Wheel (GEW), a self-report instrument for measuring emotional reactions, has strong potential for use as a tool for evaluating the expression of affective content by robots. Factors that make the GEW advantageous over existing evaluation methods include: ease of administration, reduction in the importance of word labels, and coverage of ‘no emotion’ states. Statistical analyses of the GEW are proposed, isolating quantitative metrics of emotion distinctness. An experiment requiring participants to rate the perceived emotion of a social robot was conducted, employing the proposed methods. Analysis using the GEW revealed significant differences in the reliability of different expressions to clearly convey emotional states. The GEW provided a repeatable, systematic framework for estimating perceived affect of robot expression. Thus, the results suggest the GEW offers a powerful tool for design purposes as well as analysis. To support future research using the GEW, the software used for the analysis has been packaged and made available as an open-source resource to the community.

According to Cohen's (1988) conventional criteria, the association is moderately strong. It is concluded that in normal settings sensitivity is an important but not exclusive condition of attachment security. Several other dimensions of parenting are identified as playing an equally important role. In attachment theory, a move to the contextual level is required to interpret the complex transactions between context and sensitivity in less stable and more stressful settings, and to pay more attention to nonshared environmental influences.","[{'authorId': '5375093', 'name': 'M.

Low levels of trust in human–robot interaction can reduce overall performance and prevent full robot utilization. We investigated the potential benefits of using emotional musical prosody (EMP) to allow the robot to respond emotionally to the user’s actions. We define EMP as musical phrases inspired by speech-based prosody used to display emotion. We tested participants’ responses to interacting with a virtual robot arm and a virtual humanoid that acted as a decision agent, helping participants select the next number in a sequence. We compared results from three versions of the application in a between-group experiment, where the robot presented different emotional reactions to the user’s input depending on whether the user agreed with the robot and whether the user’s choice was correct. One version used EMP audio phrases selected from our dataset of singer improvisations, the second version used audio consisting of a single pitch randomly assigned to each emotion, and the final version used no audio, only gestures. In each version, the robot reacted with emotional gestures. Participants completed a trust survey following the interaction, and we found that the reported trust ratings of the EMP group were significantly higher than both the single-pitch and no audio groups for the robotic arm. We found that our audio system made no significant difference in any metric when used on a humanoid robot implying audio needs to be separately designed for each platform.","[{'authorId': '81708571', 'name': 'Richard J.

Depression is associated with interpersonal difficulties related to abnormalities in affective facial processing.


OBJECTIVES
To map brain systems activated by sad facial affect processing in patients with depression and to identify brain functional correlates of antidepressant treatment and symptomatic response.


DESIGN
Two groups underwent scanning twice using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an 8-week period. The event-related fMRI paradigm entailed incidental affect recognition of facial stimuli morphed to express discriminable intensities of sadness.


SETTING
Participants were recruited by advertisement from the local population; depressed subjects were treated as outpatients.


PATIENTS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS
We matched 19 medication-free, acutely symptomatic patients satisfying DSM-IV criteria for unipolar major depressive disorder by age, sex, and IQ with 19 healthy volunteers. Intervention After the baseline assessment, patients received fluoxetine hydrochloride, 20 mg/d, for 8 weeks.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Average activation (capacity) and differential response to variable affective intensity (dynamic range) were estimated in each fMRI time series. We used analysis of variance to identify brain regions that demonstrated a main effect of group (depressed vs healthy subjects) and a group x time interaction (attributable to antidepressant treatment). Change in brain activation associated with reduction of depressive symptoms in the patient group was identified by means of regression analysis. Permutation tests were used for inference.


RESULTS
Over time, depressed subjects showed reduced capacity for activation in the left amygdala, ventral striatum, and frontoparietal cortex and a negatively correlated increase of dynamic range in the prefrontal cortex. Symptomatic improvement was associated with reduction of dynamic range in the pregenual cingulate cortex, ventral striatum, and cerebellum.


CONCLUSIONS
Antidepressant treatment reduces left limbic, subcortical, and neocortical capacity for activation in depressed subjects and increases the dynamic range of the left prefrontal cortex. Changes in anterior cingulate function associated with symptomatic improvement indicate that fMRI may be a useful surrogate marker of antidepressant treatment response.","[{'authorId': '144525653', 'name': 'C.

But such libraries require powerful automated tools, and the development of systems for automatic prediction of musical emotion presents a myriad challenges. The perceptual nature of musical emotion necessitates the collection of data from human subjects. The interpretation of emotion varies between listeners thus each clip needs to be annotated by a distribution of subjects. In addition, the sharing of large music content libraries for the development of such systems, even for academic research, presents complicated legal issues which vary by country. This work presents a new publicly available dataset for music emotion recognition research and a baseline system. In addressing the difficulties of emotion annotation we have turned to crowdsourcing, using Amazon Mechanical Turk, and have developed a two-stage procedure for filtering out poor quality workers. The dataset consists entirely of creative commons music from the Free Music Archive, which as the name suggests, can be shared freely without penalty. The final dataset contains 1000 songs, each annotated by a minimum of 10 subjects, which is larger than many currently available music emotion dataset.","[{'authorId': '152714397', 'name': 'M.

A systematic search of the literature identified 306 experimental comparisons of different emotion regulation (ER) strategies. ER instructions were coded according to a new taxonomy, and meta-analysis was used to evaluate the effectiveness of each strategy across studies. The findings revealed differences in effectiveness between ER processes: Attentional deployment had no effect on emotional outcomes (d(+) = 0.00), response modulation had a small effect (d(+) = 0.16), and cognitive change had a small-to-medium effect (d(+) = 0.36). There were also important within-process differences. We identified 7 types of attentional deployment, 4 types of cognitive change, and 4 types of response modulation, and these distinctions had a substantial influence on effectiveness. Whereas distraction was an effective way to regulate emotions (d(+) = 0.27), concentration was not (d(+) = -0.26). Similarly, suppressing the expression of emotion proved effective (d(+) = 0.32), but suppressing the experience of emotion or suppressing thoughts of the emotion-eliciting event did not (d(+) = -0.04 and -0.12, respectively). Finally, reappraising the emotional response proved less effective (d(+) = 0.23) than reappraising the emotional stimulus (d(+) = 0.36) or using perspective taking (d(+) = 0.45). The review also identified several moderators of strategy effectiveness including factors related to the (a) to-be-regulated emotion, (b) frequency of use and intended purpose of the ER strategy, (c) study design, and (d) study characteristics.","[{'authorId': '3525287', 'name': 'Thomas Llewelyn Webb'}, {'authorId': '38594552', 'name': 'E.

1993bd174ebcffaff036724b1182627afdfff129,"BACKGROUND
Self-regulation (SR) is central to developmental psychopathology, but progress has been impeded by varying terminology and meanings across fields and literatures.


METHODS
The present review attempts to move that discussion forward by noting key sources of prior confusion such as measurement-concept confounding, and then arguing the following major points.


RESULTS
First, the field needs a domain-general construct of SR that encompasses SR of action, emotion, and cognition and involves both top-down and bottom-up regulatory processes. This does not assume a shared core process across emotion, action, and cognition, but is intended to provide clarity on the extent of various claims about kinds of SR. Second, top-down aspects of SR need to be integrated. These include (a) basic processes that develop early and address immediate conflict signals, such as cognitive control and effortful control (EC), and (b) complex cognition and strategies for addressing future conflict, represented by the regulatory application of complex aspects of executive functioning. Executive function (EF) and cognitive control are not identical to SR because they can be used for other activities, but account for top-down aspects of SR at the cognitive level. Third, impulsivity, risk-taking, and disinhibition are distinct although overlapping; a taxonomy of the kinds of breakdowns of SR associated with psychopathology requires their differentiation. Fourth, different aspects of the SR universe can be organized hierarchically in relation to granularity, development, and time. Low-level components assemble into high-level components. This hierarchical perspective is consistent across literatures.


CONCLUSIONS
It is hoped that the framework outlined here will facilitate integration and cross-talk among investigators working from different perspectives, and facilitate individual differences research on how SR relates to developmental psychopathology.","[{'authorId': '2456142', 'name': 'J.

The present research aims to assess the feasibility of conducting an RCT evaluating the effectiveness of a social skills intervention using Kinesics and Synchronisation in Personal Assistant Robotics (Kaspar) with children with ASD. Methods and analysis Forty children will be recruited. Inclusion criteria are the following: aged 5–10 years, confirmed ASD diagnosis, IQ over 70, English-language comprehension, a carer who can complete questionnaires in English and no current participation in a private social communication intervention. Children will be randomised to receive an intervention with a therapist and Kaspar, or with the therapist only. They will receive two familiarisation sessions and six treatment sessions for 8 weeks. They will be assessed at baseline, and at 10 and 22 weeks after baseline. The primary outcome of this study is to evaluate whether the predetermined feasibility criteria for a full-scale trial are met. The potential primary outcome measures for a full-scale trial are the Social Communication Questionnaire and the Social Skills Improvement System. We will conduct a preliminary economic analysis. After the study has ended, a sample of 20 participants and their families will be invited to participate in semistructured interviews to explore the feasibility and acceptability of the study’s methods and intervention. Ethics and dissemination Parents/carers will provide informed consent, and children will give assent, where appropriate. Care will be taken to avoid pressure or coercion to participate. Aftercare is available from the recruiting NHS Trust, and a phased withdrawal protocol will be followed if children become excessively attached to the robot. The results of the study will be disseminated to academic audiences and non-academic stakeholders, for example, families of children with ASD, support groups, clinicians and charities.

Eating in response to negative affect contributes towards obesity, however, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Evidence that visceral afferent signals contribute towards the experience of emotion is accumulating rapidly, with the emergence of new influential models of ‘active inference’. No longer viewed as a ‘bottom up’ process, new interoceptive facets based on ‘top down’ predictions have been proposed, although at present it is unclear which aspects of interoception contribute to aberrant eating behaviour and obesity. Study one examined the link between eating behaviour, body mass index and the novel interoceptive indices; interoceptive metacognitive awareness (IAw) and interoceptive prediction error (IPE), as well as the traditional measures; interoceptive accuracy (IAc) and interoceptive sensibility (IS). The dissociation between these interoceptive indices was confirmed. Emotional eaters were characterised by a heightened interoceptive signal but reduced meta-cognitive awareness of their interoceptive abilities. In addition, emotional eating correlated with IPE; effects that could not be accounted for by differences in anxiety and depression. Study two confirmed the positive association between interoceptive accuracy and emotional eating using a novel unbiased heartbeat discrimination task based on the method of constant stimuli.

In an initial study conducted with healthy young adults, we utilized behavioral and self-report measures to demonstrate associations between smartphone usage habits (assessed both subjectively and objectively) and individual differences in intertemporal preference and reward sensitivity. In a follow-up neuroimaging study, we used probabilistic tractography of diffusion-weighted images to determine how these individual difference characteristics might relate to variation in white matter connectivity, focusing on two dissociable pathways—one connecting the ventral striatum (vSTR) with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the other connecting the vSTR with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Regression analyses revealed opposing patterns of association, with stronger vSTR–vmPFC connectivity corresponding to increased mobile technology engagement but stronger vSTR–dlPFC connectivity corresponding to decreased engagement. Taken together, the results of these two studies provide important foundational evidence for both neural and cognitive factors that can be linked to how individuals engage with mobile technology.","[{'authorId': '8250096', 'name': 'Henry H.

This contrasts with HRI research, design, engineering and deployment, which have focused on robots’ instrumental value – namely how designing and interacting with them may produce more or less productivity. Drawing on a multiyear ethnography of a “failed” robotic telepresence deployment in a teaching hospital, this paper shows that robots’ signaling value can significantly outweigh – and even contravene – any practical utility that they may provide through use. This analysis further suggests that – unlike nontechnological organizational signals – robots’ signaling value is highly contingent on the observability of their use. Considering robots’ signaling value in complex social systems such as organizations promises improved robotic systems development and deployment techniques and improved prediction regarding human-robot interaction.

Although this pain can trigger various interpersonal difficulties (e.g., aggression, depression), it is still unclear which psychological approach might best help to regulate social pain. However, recent work suggests that temporal distance helps to facilitate adaptive coping and self-control. The present study measured ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) activity during social exclusion, using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to examine the functional relationship between “temporal distance approach,” or thinking about the distant future, and the social pain regulation process. Participants that imagined the distant future, next year, and beyond, felt less social pain and showed increased right (r)VLPFC activity during social exclusion, as compared to imagining events in the near future, such as tonight and tomorrow. Furthermore, rVLPFC activity mediated the relationship between temporal distance and social pain. On the basis of these findings, the effect of temporal distance on the process of adaptation after social exclusion is discussed. It is suggested that temporal distance moderates the process of regulating the impact of social exclusion.","[{'authorId': '4798811', 'name': 'K.

Previous studies typically focused on a small set of emotions and a single channel to express them. We developed an emotion expression model that modulates motion, poses and LED features parametrically, using valence and arousal values. This model does not interrupt the task or gesture being performed and hence can be used in combination with functional behavioural expressions. Even though our model is relatively simple, it is just as capable of expressing emotions as other more complicated models that have been proposed in the literature. We systematically explored the expressivity of our model and found that a parametric model using 5 key motion and pose features can be used to effectively express emotions in the two quadrants where valence and arousal have the same sign. As paradigmatic examples, we tested for happy, excited, sad and tired. By adding a second channel (eye LEDs), the model is also able to express high arousal (anger) and low arousal (relaxed) emotions in the two other quadrants. Our work supports other findings that it remains hard to express moderate arousal emotions in these quadrants for both negative (fear) and positive (content) valence.","[{'authorId': '122538234', 'name': 'Pooja Prajod'}, {'authorId': '1751831', 'name': 'K.

This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore whether individual differences in RS are mediated by differential recruitment of brain regions involved in emotional appraisal and/or cognitive control. High and low RS participants were scanned while viewing either representational paintings depicting themes of rejection and acceptance or nonrepresentational control paintings matched for positive or negative valence, arousal and interest level. Across all participants, rejection versus acceptance images activated regions of the brain involved in processing affective stimuli (posterior cingulate, insula), and cognitive control (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; medial frontal cortex). Low and high RS individuals' responses to rejection versus acceptance images were not, however, identical. Low RS individuals displayed significantly more activity in left inferior and right dorsal frontal regions, and activity in these areas correlated negatively with participants' self-report distress ratings. In addition, control analyses revealed no effect of viewing negative versus positive images in any of the areas described above, suggesting that the aforementioned activations were involved in rejection-relevant processing rather than processing negatively valenced stimuli per se. Taken together, these findings suggest that responses in regions traditionally implicated in emotional processing and cognitive control are sensitive to rejection stimuli irrespective of RS, but that low RS individuals may activate prefrontal structures to regulate distress associated with viewing such images.","[{'authorId': '2334455', 'name': 'E.

While maternal depression is known to carry long-term negative consequences for offspring, very few studies followed children longitudinally to address markers of resilience in the context of maternal depression. We focused on oxytocin (OT) and mother-child synchrony - the biological and behavioral arms of the neurobiology of affiliation - as correlates of resilience among children of depressed mothers.


METHOD
A community birth-cohort was recruited on the second postbirth day and repeatedly assessed for maternal depression across the first year. At 6 and 10 years, mothers and children underwent psychiatric diagnosis, mother-child interactions were coded for maternal sensitivity, child social engagement, and mother-child synchrony, children's OT assayed, and externalizing and internalizing problems reported.


RESULTS
Exposure to maternal depression markedly increased child propensity to develop Axis-I disorder at 6 and 10 years. Child OT showed main effects for both maternal depression and child psychiatric disorder at 6 and 10 years, with maternal or child psychopathology attenuating OT response. In contrast, maternal depression decreased synchrony at 6 years but by 10 years synchrony showed only child disorder effect, highlighting the shift from direct to indirect effects as children grow older. Path analysis linking maternal depression to child externalizing and internalizing problems at 10 years controlling for 6-year variables indicated that depression linked with decreased maternal sensitivity and child OT, which predicted reduced child engagement and synchrony, leading to higher externalizing and internalizing problems. OT and synchrony mediated the effects of maternal depression on child behavior problems and an alternative model without these resilience components provided less adequate fit.


CONCLUSIONS
Maternal depression continues to play a role in children's development beyond infancy. The mediating effects of OT and synchronous, mutually regulated interactions underscore the role of plasticity in resilience. Results emphasize the need to follow children of depressed mothers across middle childhood and construct interventions that bolster age-appropriate synchrony.","[{'authorId': '35388070', 'name': 'Avital Priel'}, {'authorId': '8594026', 'name': 'Amir Djalovski'}, {'authorId': '1397662899', 'name': 'O.

Latent change models were used to estimate level and change of each variable. Results: Results showed that the levels of maternal rejection, maladaptive ER and emotional eating were related. The indirect effect of the level of maternal rejection on the level of emotional eating through the level of maladaptive ER was marginally significant. On average, maternal rejection showed no change over time, whereas the other variables decreased. The changes in the variables were not related.

The analysis of the data revealed an interesting set of findings: (a) attachment anxiety was a stronger indicator of whether people use adaptive or maladaptive emotion regulation strategies than was attachment avoidance; (b) self efficacy, and not cognitive inability to suppress unwanted thoughts, partially mediated the relationship between attachment anxiety and adaptive emotion regulation strategies; and (c) cognitive inability to suppress unwanted thoughts, and not self efficacy beliefs, partially mediated the relationship between attachment anxiety and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies. Overall, the findings provided substantial support for the PMER, and also have important implications for clinical interventions aimed at effective emotion regulation.

We can read the emotions depicted in its gestures, yet might utilize different neural processes than those used for reading the emotions in human agents. Methodology Here, fMRI was used to assess how brain areas activated by the perception of human basic emotions (facial expression of Anger, Joy, Disgust) and silent speech respond to a humanoid robot impersonating the same emotions, while participants were instructed to attend either to the emotion or to the motion depicted. Principal Findings Increased responses to robot compared to human stimuli in the occipital and posterior temporal cortices suggest additional visual processing when perceiving a mechanical anthropomorphic agent. In contrast, activity in cortical areas endowed with mirror properties, like left Broca's area for the perception of speech, and in the processing of emotions like the left anterior insula for the perception of disgust and the orbitofrontal cortex for the perception of anger, is reduced for robot stimuli, suggesting lesser resonance with the mechanical agent. Finally, instructions to explicitly attend to the emotion significantly increased response to robot, but not human facial expressions in the anterior part of the left inferior frontal gyrus, a neural marker of motor resonance. Conclusions Motor resonance towards a humanoid robot, but not a human, display of facial emotion is increased when attention is directed towards judging emotions. Significance Artificial agents can be used to assess how factors like anthropomorphism affect neural response to the perception of human actions.","[{'authorId': '1728769', 'name': 'T.

Previous studies have focused on the perceived needs of professional caregivers or family members whilst the voices of patients with dementia in acute hospitals have not been extensively reported. This may have contributed to the under-recognition of the needs of persons living with dementia. The aim of this study was to categorise the perceived and observed needs of persons with dementia admitted in acute medical wards and to explore whether these needs are being or have been met. Thirteen people with dementia in three medical wards, who could verbally communicate with the researcher, were purposively selected as research participants. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to elicit each participant’s experiences of their hospital stay and whether their needs were perceived to have been/are being met. Moreover, routine care with the same participants was observed using Dementia Care Mapping. Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs was used as a framework to categorise care needs. Our findings demonstrate that basic needs such as toileting, feeding, drinking, continence and comfort were not always met. Moreover, the largest gap between met and unmet needs was found in patients who were either under constant observation or unable to communicate. Too much emphasis was perceived and observed to be given on what staff considered as safety needs at the expense of other needs. The patients’ need for social contact and self-esteem such as dignity and respect were often ignored and this led to patients feeling devalued. Hospital staff have to be more aware of the holistic needs of patients with dementia in acute settings and the way care is delivered in order to make up for these unmet needs, thus facilitating person-centred care.","[{'authorId': '145464114', 'name': 'A.

Although studies investigate children's perceptions of social robots, there is a need to better understand how hopes and fears influence children's views of the future. In this paper, we present the outcomes of a study in which we explored 60 children's (aged 8-14) perceptions of social robots using ten fictional scenarios. From data analysis, we elicited four major themes that become the pillars of a model that represent children's perception of social robots (agency, comprehension, socioemotional features, and physicality). The model shows the complex and often paradoxical nature of children's acceptance (hope) and rejection (fear) of social robots in their lives. Our outcome provides the foundations of a new responsible approach in analyzing and designing social robots for children using hopes and fear as a lens.","[{'authorId': '1797180', 'name': 'Elisa Rubegni'}, {'authorId': '1908716', 'name': 'Laura Malinverni'}, {'authorId': '145964520', 'name': 'Jason C.

Here, we examined neural responses to a different type of threatening facial expression that primarily signifies a threat to social connection, namely a “disapproving” facial expression. We hypothesized that neural responses to disapproving facial expressions would be moderated by individual differences in rejection sensitivity. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we scanned participants while they viewed brief video clips of facial expressions depicting disapproval, anger, and disgust. As expected, all three expressions yielded bilateral amygdala activation relative to a resting baseline. Additionally, individuals who scored higher on a measure of rejection sensitivity exhibited greater dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activity in response to disapproving facial expressions, but not in response to anger or disgust facial expressions. Results suggest that, at the neural level, individuals high in rejection sensitivity may be more sensitive to facial expressions signaling potential rejection, but not to threatening facial expressions in general. Results also suggest that disapproving facial expressions convey a distinct type of threat and should be considered in future studies of socially threatening facial expressions.","[{'authorId': '3235312', 'name': 'Lisa Burklund'}, {'authorId': '3070384', 'name': 'N.

Human-interactive robots, used to improve the quality of life, are becoming increasingly common. Their purposes and functions vary depending on their use, such as assistance, therapy, guide, entertainment, and education. Robot therapy, which uses robots as a substitution for animals in “animal therapy,” is a new robot application in the fields of welfare and patient care. The seal robot PARO began development for robot therapy in 1993. PARO was commercialized in Japan in 2005, and in Europe and the United States in 2009, and it has been used in hospitals and care facilities in approximately 30 countries. Recent research has revealed that robot therapy has a similar effect on patients as animal therapy. In 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) certified PARO as a “biofeedback medical device.” While PARO can be used in various kinds of therapy similar to that where real animals are used, this study focuses on its use with elderly dementia patients because explicit differences can be easily observed before and after interacting with PARO. First, this paper explains the purposes and functions of PARO. Second, because there are several observational studies on the therapeutic effects of the elderly with dementia interacting with PARO, some typical cases and interesting special cases are introduced. These cases include recovery from depression, reduction of agitation, and recovery from speech disorders. Finally, this paper discusses why PARO has the potential to change moods and behaviors of the elderly with dementia as a nonpharmacological approach.","[{'authorId': '40528071', 'name': 'T.

The arm has an inflated outer cover which encloses the arm's underlying mechanisms and force sensing modules. An internal projector projects a display on the inside of the cover which is visible from the outside. On the end of the arm is a 3D printed hand with air-filled, force sensing fingertips. We validate the efficacy of the outer cover design by bending the arm to reach out and grasp an object. The outer cover performs as intended, providing enough volume and range of motion for the arm to move, and stretching at the elastic relief features in the cover. We also validate the hand design by implementing a grasping algorithm in which the fingers follow a closing trajectory, make contact, then maintain a given range of fingertip pressure. Using this algorithm, the hand is able to gently grasp a soft object.","[{'authorId': '2980876', 'name': 'A.

Similarly, teams of human and artificial agents require common ground to successfully participate in joint activities. Indeed, without appropriate information being shared, using agent autonomy to reduce the workload on humans may actually increase workload as the humans seek to understand why the agents are behaving as they are. While many researchers have identified the importance of common ground in artificial intelligence, there is no precise definition of common ground on which to build the foundational aspects of multi-agent collaboration. In this paper, building on previously-defined modal logics of belief, we present logic definitions for four different types of common ground. We define modal logics for three existing notions of common ground and introduce a new notion of common ground, called salient common ground. Salient common ground captures the common ground of a group participating in an activity and is based on the common ground that arises from that activity as well as on the common ground they shared prior to the activity. We show that the four definitions share some properties, and our analysis suggests possible refinements of the existing informal and semi-formal definitions.","[{'authorId': '49866015', 'name': 'Tim Miller'}, {'authorId': '3316684', 'name': 'J.

Choosing appropriate outfits to wear is important, as clothes protect a person from elements in the environment, and act as a barrier against harsh surfaces [1]. Studies have shown strong correlation between clothing choices and perceptions of sociability, emotional stability, and impression formation (e.g., [2]). This activity, however, can be difficult for some individuals, as they may lack the required reasoning and judgement required [3].

Signals from 23 participants were recorded along with the participants self-assessment of their affective state after each stimuli, in terms of valence, arousal, and dominance. All the signals were captured using portable, wearable, wireless, low-cost, and off-the-shelf equipment that has the potential to allow the use of affective computing methods in everyday applications. A baseline for participant-wise affect recognition using EEG and ECG-based features, as well as their fusion, was established through supervised classification experiments using support vector machines (SVMs). The self-assessment of the participants was evaluated through comparison with the self-assessments from another study using the same audio-visual stimuli. Classification results for valence, arousal, and dominance of the proposed database are comparable to the ones achieved for other databases that use nonportable, expensive, medical grade devices. These results indicate the prospects of using low-cost devices for affect recognition applications.

In this article I review the methodological and conceptual advances in recent moderator variable research. I then report the results of a number of empirical analyses of three newly proposed idiographic moderator variables: scalability, metatraits, and construct similarity, as well as the ipsatized variance index. The results of these analyses indicate that moderator effect sizes in personality can be expected to correspond to a correlation of about .10. I then consider two recent prescriptions, (a) aggregating trait-specific moderators into general ones, and (b) evaluating joint (e.g., triple interaction) moderator effects. Following these prescriptions did not increase the size of the moderator effects in these data. I conclude that moderator effects in personality will be small, and will thus be most reliably detected in very large samples with predictors that are strongly related to the criteria. Even small moderator effects can be important and interesting in the context of theory disconfirmation. However, moderator variables generally will not serve to transform weak relations among personality variables into strong ones.","[{'authorId': '2163170814', 'name': 'William F.

Effective training will therefore require the social signals produced by a robot to be contingent with people's knowledge and expectations of social cognition and behaviour. Designing recognisable facial expressions is an important part of this challenge; ensuring interactions are more believable and motivating. This design process requires - amongst other factors - consideration of how culture and native language affects social signal processing. In this experiment participants offered a full-bodied robot (named 'Alyx') food items to which Alyx reacted autonomously, producing either an approving or disapproving expression. Participant's responded to these expressions (i.e. the robots social signals) by indicating whether Alyx liked or disliked the food. Task performance was examined both quantitatively (response time and accuracy) and qualitatively (participant's reactionary expressions). The results revealed significant cultural differences, as non-native English speakers were less accurate at interpreting expressions, but also a similar response trend between these groups. Qualitative analysis supported the notion that Alyx's expressions were not universally understood.

1df7aebbd4907348d6cf4f6d401ceff733474d5b,"There are an estimated 35 million people with dementia across the world, of whom 50% experience regular pain. Despite this, current assessment and treatment of pain in this patient group are inadequate. In addition to the discomfort and distress caused by pain, it is frequently the underlying cause of behavioral symptoms, which can lead to inappropriate treatment with antipsychotic medications. Pain also contributes to further complications in treatment and care. This review explores four key perspectives of pain management in dementia and makes recommendations for practice and research. The first perspective discussed is the considerable uncertainty within the literature on the impact of dementia neuropathology on pain perception and processing in Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, where white matter lesions and brain atrophy appear to influence the neurobiology of pain. The second perspective considers the assessment of pain in dementia. This is challenging, particularly because of the limited capacity of self-report by these individuals, which means that assessment relies in large part on observational methods. A number of tools are available but the psychometric quality and clinical utility of these are uncertain. The evidence for efficient treatment (the third perspective) with analgesics is also limited, with few statistically well-powered trials. The most promising evidence supports the use of stepped treatment approaches, and indicates the benefit of pain and behavioral interventions on both these important symptoms. The fourth perspective debates further difficulties in pain management due to the lack of sufficient training and education for health care professionals at all levels, where evidence-based guidance is urgently needed. To address the current inadequate management of pain in dementia, a comprehensive approach is needed. This would include an accurate, validated assessment tool that is sensitive to different types of pain and therapeutic effects, supported by better training and support for care staff across all settings.","[{'authorId': '4277402', 'name': 'W.

Under certain conditions, emotion regulation may develop dysregulatory aspects that can become a characteristic of an individual's coping style. This style may then jeopardize or impair functioning and become associated with symptomatic, disordered functioning. Emotional development provides a critical vantage point from which to study the development of symptomatology and psychopathology, particularly given the prevalence of emotional symptoms in various forms of psychopathology. Dimensions of emotionality that can be used to characterize dysregulation include access to the range of emotions, flexible modulation of intensity, duration, and transitions between emotions, acquisition and use of cultural display rules, and the ability to reflect on the complexity and value of one's own emotions in a self-supporting manner. Developmental psychopathology provides a framework within which to examine how emotions are regulatory, how their regulation changes over time, and under what conditions an adaptive emotion process can develop into a pattern of dysregulation that then becomes, or sustains, some symptoms of mental disorders. Such research requires samples that include children with and without risk or presence of particular mental health problems, paradigms that allow the examination of dimensions of emotionality in context and provide multiple assessments that include observations of children's reactions beyond what they themselves can report, and analyses that extend beyond simple global aggregates such as positive and negative emotion. We believe that it is particularly important to study children and their families in situations that challenge their emotional adaptation. The developmental tasks of emotional life evolve in exchanges between the child and the world of events and relationships. The emotional conditions of early childhood appear to be very important in optimizing or interfering with how the child's emotionality regulates his or her interpersonal and intrapsychic functioning and how the child learns to regulate emotion. The experiences that accrue around emotional events influence the stable aspects of the developing personality and become trait-like aspects of the person (Malatesta & Wilson, 1988). Dysregulation occurs when an emotional reaction loses breadth and flexibility. If a dysregulatory pattern becomes stabilized and part of the emotional repertoire, it is likely that this pattern is a symptom and supports other symptoms. When development and adaptation are compromised, the dysregulation has evolved into a form of psychopathology. The line between normative variations and clinical conditions is not clearly drawn.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","[{'authorId': '34935701', 'name': 'P.

In this contribution we address the topic of healthcare robots and privacy. We use actor network theory (ANT) to shed light on the privacy implications of healthcare robots from a specific theoretical point of view. ANT is a descriptive, constructivist approach that takes into account the agency of objects, concepts and ideas as well as the relationality of technology and the social. It has been applied to complex technological innovations, such as ehealth systems. We use some of the main concepts of ANT—actants, translations, tokens/quasiobjects, punctualization, obligatory passage point—to “map” the privacy ecosystem in robotic healthcare technology, thereby analyzing the complex interplay of robots and humans in that context. Altogether, our contribution shows that ANT is a fruitful lens through which to study the interaction between humans and (social) robots because of its richness of useful concepts, its balanced perspective which evades both technology-determinism and social-determinism, and its openness towards new connected technology.","[{'authorId': '6889723', 'name': 'C.

Research has demonstrated that among professional caregivers, compassion satisfaction (CS), burnout (BO), and compassion fatigue (CF) are important factors contributing to professional quality of life. The current research aims to provide normative information regarding the factors contributing to professional quality of life among those who interact with survivors of trauma. The Professional Quality of Life (ProQOL) Scale is a widely used measure of CS, BO, and CF. The most recent iteration of the ProQOL manual provides normative data to assist in the interpretation of scores. However, a review of the literature reporting raw scores on the ProQOL suggests that mean scores and cutoff scores for the 25th and 75th percentiles may be misleading. Method: A review of 30 studies (total sample size of 5,612) was conducted and normative values are presented. Results: The mean (standard deviation) level of CS, CF, and BO were 37.7 (6.5), 16.7 (5.7), and 22.8 (5.4), respectively. Conclusions: Values gathered from the literature review tend to align well with one another and suggest that within a given sample, CS scores tend to be higher than BO scores, and BO scores tend to be slightly higher than CF scores.","[{'authorId': '39351416', 'name': 'Gabriel M.

However, older adults are less likely to adopt new technology unless they see benefits to themselves. This study assessed the perceptions of 30 older adults in the Midwest concerning technology via three separate focus groups (i.e., independent apartment complex, a rural community, exercise program participants), which addressed a need in the literature (i.e., inclusion of oldest-old and rural individuals). The focus group questions included items such as what technology older adults currently used, desired improvements in technology, and the greatest challenges participants were facing or would face in the future. Overall, older adults were enthusiastic about learning new forms of technology that could help them maintain their independence and quality of life. Five themes emerged from all three focus groups: (a) Frustrations, Limitations, and Usability Concerns; (b) Transportation; (c) Help and Assistance; (d) Self-Monitoring; and (e) Gaming.

In order to successfully coexist with humans, robots should also adapt their behavior to the culture, customs and manners of the persons they interact with. In this paper, we deal with an important ingredient of cultural adaptation: how to generate robot plans that respect given cultural preferences, and how to execute them in a way that is sensitive to those preferences.

1eb5fa5f399ca0a3a7c98b109fc8d3388618e06b,"Echeneid fish, limpets and octopi use suction cups for underwater adhesion. When echeneid fish use suckers to ‘hitch a ride’ on sharks (which have riblet-patterned skins), the apparent absence of any pump or plumbing may be an advantage over biorobotic suction cups. An intriguing question is: How do they achieve seemingly persistent leak-free contact at low energy cost over rough surfaces? The design features of their suckers are explored in a biorobotic context of adhesion in water over rough surfaces. We have carried out experiments to compare the release force and tenacity of man-made suction cups with those reported for limpets and echeneid fish. Applied tensile and shear release forces were monotonically increased until release. The effects of cup size and type, host surface roughness, curvature and liquid surface tension have been examined. The flow of water in the sharkskin-like host surface roughness has been characterized. The average tenacity is 5.28 N cm−2 (σ = 0.53 N cm−2, N = 37) in the sub-ambient pressure range of 14.6–49.0 kPa, in man-made cups for monotonically increasing applied release force. The tenacity is lower for harmonically oscillating release forces. The dynamic structural interactions between the suction cup and the oscillating applied forcing are discussed. Inspired by the matching of sharkskin riblet topology in echeneid fish suckers, it was found that biorobotic sealed contact over rough surfaces is also feasible when the suction cup makes a negative copy of the rough host surface. However, for protracted, persistent contact, the negative topology would have to be maintained by active means. Energy has to be spent to maintain the negative host roughness topology to minute detail, and protracted hitch-riding on sharks for feeding may not be free for echeneid fish. Further work is needed on the mechanism and efficiency of the densely populated tiny actuators in the fish suckers that maintain leak-proof contact with minimal energy cost and the feasibility of their biorobotic replication.","[{'authorId': '87419493', 'name': 'P.

Facial features of the child are captured and processed, determining their emotional reaction to a behavior performed by the robot. Then, these emotions are classified as affective states in a multi-dimensional model. Leveraging the expertise of a human trainer, the action-planning module interactively learns those actions that are the most appropriate to perform when the child subject is in a specific affective state. To validate the usefulness of the proposed methodology, we evaluated the impact of the robot on elementary school aged children.

It is growing in its professionalization, recognition and utilization with a demonstrated commitment to setting practice standards, educational and accreditation standards, and promoting research to support its efficacy for various populations and conditions. However, heterogeneity of practice, poor reporting standards, and lack of a broadly accepted understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms involved in yoga therapy limits the structuring of testable hypotheses and clinical applications. Current proposed frameworks of yoga-based practices focus on the integration of bottom-up neurophysiological and top-down neurocognitive mechanisms. In addition, it has been proposed that phenomenology and first person ethical inquiry can provide a lens through which yoga therapy is viewed as a process that contributes towards eudaimonic well-being in the experience of pain, illness or disability. In this article we build on these frameworks, and propose a model of yoga therapy that converges with Polyvagal Theory (PVT). PVT links the evolution of the autonomic nervous system to the emergence of prosocial behaviors and posits that the neural platforms supporting social behavior are involved in maintaining health, growth and restoration. This explanatory model which connects neurophysiological patterns of autonomic regulation and expression of emotional and social behavior, is increasingly utilized as a framework for understanding human behavior, stress and illness. Specifically, we describe how PVT can be conceptualized as a neurophysiological counterpart to the yogic concept of the gunas, or qualities of nature. Similar to the neural platforms described in PVT, the gunas provide the foundation from which behavioral, emotional and physical attributes emerge. We describe how these two different yet analogous frameworks—one based in neurophysiology and the other in an ancient wisdom tradition—highlight yoga therapy’s promotion of physical, mental and social wellbeing for self-regulation and resilience. This parallel between the neural platforms of PVT and the gunas of yoga is instrumental in creating a translational framework for yoga therapy to align with its philosophical foundations. Consequently, yoga therapy can operate as a distinct practice rather than fitting into an outside model for its utilization in research and clinical contexts.","[{'authorId': '11045269', 'name': 'Marlysa B.

If one of these is disturbed, compensatory changes may occur along the other dimensions. Experiments are reported which suggest that people move towards an equilibrium distance, and adopt a particular level of eye-contact.

One such principle is regulatory focus, which distinguishes self-regulation with a promotion focus (accomplishments and aspirations) from self-regulation with a prevention focus (safety and responsibilities). This principle is used to reconsider the fundamental nature of approach-avoidance, expectancy-value relations, and emotional and evaluative sensitivities. Both types of regulatory focus are applied to phenomena that have been treated in terms of either promotion (e.g., well-being) or prevention (e.g., cognitive dissonance).

Emotional labour, or the process of regulating one's emotions in line with organisational display rules during service encounters, has been associated with burnout. Using a sample of 136 HR managers, we further explore the emotion labour-burnout relationship and whether the Big Five personality traits moderate this relationship. Results indicate that surface acting, but not deep acting, was a significant direct predictor of personal and work-related burnout. The Big Five personality dimensions exhibited differential direct effects on the three dimensions of burnout. In terms of moderating effects, extraversion had a reverse buffering effect on the relationship between surface acting and personal and work-related burnout, but a buffering effect on deep acting and client-related burnout. Conscientiousness was found to buffer the relationship between deep acting and work-related burnout and emotional stability buffered the relationship between deep acting and personal burnout. Our findings make timely and important contributions to the emotion regulation and personality literature in general, and more specifically, the literature on HR managers.","[{'authorId': '82889068', 'name': 'M.

A growing body of research focuses on the development and correlates of emotion dysregulation, or deficits in the ability to regulate intense and shifting emotional states. Current models of psychopathology have incorporated the construct of emotion dysregulation, suggesting its unique and interactive contributions, along with childhood disruptive experiences and negative affect, in producing symptomatic distress. Some researchers have suggested that emotion dysregulation is simply a variant of high negative affect. The aim of this study was to assess the construct and incremental validity of self-reported emotion dysregulation over and above childhood trauma and negative affect in predicting a range of psychopathology.


METHOD
Five hundred thirty individuals aged 18 to 77 years (62% female) were recruited from the waiting areas of the general medical and obstetric/gynecologic clinics in an urban public hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. Participants completed a battery of self-report measures obtained by interview, including the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and the Emotion Dysregulation Scale. Regression analyses examined the unique and incremental associations of these self-report measurements of childhood traumatic experiences, negative affect, and emotion dysregulation with concurrent structured interview-based measurements of psychiatric distress and history of self-destructive behaviors. These measures included the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, the Short Drug Abuse Screening Test, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Global Adaptive Functioning Scale from the Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation. The presented data were collected between 2005 and 2009.


RESULTS
Regression models including age, gender, childhood trauma, negative affect, and emotion dysregulation were significantly (P ≤ .001) associated with each of the study's criterion variables, accounting for large portions of the variance in posttraumatic stress symptoms (R² = 0.21), alcohol and drug abuse (R² = 0.28 and 0.21, respectively), depression (R² = 0.55), adaptive functioning (R² = 0.14), and suicide history (omnibus χ² = 74.80, P < .001). Emotion dysregulation added statistically significant (P < .01) incremental validity to each regression model (β = 0.25, 0.34, 0.35, 0.34, and -0.18, and Wald = 24.43, respectively).


CONCLUSIONS
Results support the conceptualization of emotion dysregulation as a distinct and clinically meaningful construct associated with psychiatric distress that is not reducible to negative affect. Emotion dysregulation is a key component in a range of psychiatric symptoms and disorders and a core target for psychopharmacologic and psychosocial treatment interventions.","[{'authorId': '3178718', 'name': 'B.

Method: The sample included 622 three-year-old children from the general population. Multi-informant reports from parents and teachers were analyzed. Results: Structural Equation Modeling showed that the associations between SES, EF, parenting style and ODD levels differed by children's gender: (a) for girls, the association of low SES and high ODD scores was partially mediated by difficulties in EF inhibition, and parenting practices defined by corporal punishment and inconsistent discipline obtained a quasi-significant indirect effect into the association between SES and ODD; (b) for boys, SES and EF (inhibition and emotional control) had a direct effect on ODD with no mediation. Conclusion: SES seems a good indicator to identify children at high-risk for prevention and intervention programs for ODD. Girls with ODD in families of low SES may particularly benefit from parent training practices and training in inhibition control.","[{'authorId': '2395388', 'name': 'Roser Granero'}, {'authorId': '4736870', 'name': 'Leonie Louwaars'}, {'authorId': '5365955', 'name': 'L.

Although mobile phones and web-based communication are ubiquitous, touch—a communication modality that conveys powerful messages—is inexistent in modern communications media. This paper describes a tele-touch device that transfers affective touch to another person through the internet. Commands for vibration, warmth, and tickle were sent over the internet to a haptic device at the subjects’ forearm. With a heart rate (HR) monitor and a galvanic skin response (GSR) sensor, the physiological effect of the tele-touch device was evaluated as the subjects watched an emotionally-laden movie. We compared these to one group of subjects who were touched by their spouse or girlfriend and to subjects of a control group where no touch was provided. Results show that the HR of the subjects with the tele-touch device was not significantly different from those subjects who were touched by their loved ones. These results were in contrast to the subjects who were not provided with any form of touch. On the other hand, the GSR results revealed that all the three touch conditions were different from one another.","[{'authorId': '3154763', 'name': 'J.

Assessment exclusively based on behavioral observation sessions requires a lot of time for the diagnosis. In recent years, there is a growing need to make assessment processes more motivating and capable to provide objective measures of the disorder. New evidence showed that motor abnormalities may underpin the disorder and provide a computational marker to enhance assessment and diagnostic processes. Thus, a measure of motor patterns could provide a means to assess young children with autism and a new starting point for rehabilitation treatments. In this study, we propose to use a software tool that through a smart tablet device and touch screen sensor technologies could be able to capture detailed information about children’s motor patterns. We compared movement trajectories of autistic children and typically developing children, with the aim to identify autism motor signatures analyzing their coordinates of movements. We used a smart tablet device to record coordinates of dragging movements carried out by 60 children (30 autistic children and 30 typically developing children) during a cognitive task. Machine learning analysis of children’s motor patterns identified autism with 93% accuracy, demonstrating that autism can be computationally identified. The analysis of the features that most affect the prediction reveals and describes the differences between the groups, confirming that motor abnormalities are a core feature of autism.","[{'authorId': '117771125', 'name': 'Roberta Simeoli'}, {'authorId': '32302973', 'name': 'Nicola Milano'}, {'authorId': '34838813', 'name': 'Angelo Rega'}, {'authorId': '1716365', 'name': 'D.

Children learn creative expressions and behaviors through social interactions with others during playful and collaborative tasks, and socially emulate their peers’ and teachers’ creativity. Social robots have a unique ability to engage in social and emotional interactions with children that can be leveraged to foster creative expression. We focus on two types of social interactions: creativity demonstration, where the robot exhibits creative behaviors, and creativity scaffolding, where the robot poses challenges, suggests ideas, provides positive reinforcement, and asks questions to scaffold children’s creativity. We situate our research in three playful and collaborative tasks - the Droodle Creativity game (that affords verbal creativity), the MagicDraw game (that affords figural creativity), and the WeDo construction task (that affords constructional creativity), that children play with Jibo, a social robot. To evaluate the efficacy of the robot’s social behaviors in enhancing creative behavior and expression in children, we ran three randomized controlled trials with 169 children in the 5–10 yr old age group. In the first two tasks, the robot exhibited creativity demonstration behaviors. We found that children who interacted with the robot exhibiting high verbal creativity in the Droodle game and high figural creativity in the MagicDraw game also exhibited significantly higher creativity than a control group of participants who interacted with a robot that did not express creativity (p < 0.05*). In the WeDo construction task, children who interacted with the robot that expressed creative scaffolding behaviors (asking reflective questions, generating ideas and challenges, and providing positive reinforcement) demonstrated higher creativity than participants in the control group by expressing a greater number of ideas, more original ideas, and more varied use of available materials (p < 0.05*). We found that both creativity demonstration and creativity scaffolding can be leveraged as social mechanisms for eliciting creativity in children using a social robot.

Results from Experiment 1 indicated that the face's internal features (eyes, nose, and mouth) provide information that is more useful for social inferences than the external features (hair, face shape, ears, and chin), especially when judging traits such as approachability and trustworthiness. Experiment 2 investigated how judgement agreement was affected when the upper head, eye, nose, or mouth regions were presented in isolation or when these regions were obscured. A different pattern of results emerged for different characteristics, indicating that different types of facial information are used in the various judgements.

One family of such cues is called “nonverbal leakage.” In this paper, we explore whether people can read nonverbal leakage cues-particularly gaze cues-in humanlike robots and make inferences on robots' intentions, and whether the physical design of the robot affects these inferences. We designed a gaze cue for Geminoid-a highly humanlike android-and Robovie-a robot with stylized, abstract humanlike features-that allowed the robots to “leak” information on what they might have in mind. In a controlled laboratory experiment, we asked participants to play a game of guessing with either of the robots and evaluated how the gaze cue affected participants' task performance. We found that the gaze cue did, in fact, lead to better performance, from which we infer that the cue led to attributions of mental states and intentionality. Our results have implications for robot design, particularly for designing expression of intentionality, and for our understanding of how people respond to human social cues when they are enacted by robots.","[{'authorId': '145656551', 'name': 'Bilge Mutlu'}, {'authorId': '3095694', 'name': 'F.

For expressions based on Body Movement and other signals than facial expressions, like Sound, no common grounds have been established so far. Based on psychological research on human expression of emotions and perception of emotional stimuli we created eight different expressional designs for the emotions Anger, Sadness, Fear and Joy, consisting of Body Movements, Sounds and Eye Colors. In a large pre-test we evaluated the recognition ratios for the different expressional designs. In our main experiment we separated the expressional designs into their single cues (Body Movement, Sound, Eye Color) and evaluated their expressivity. The detailed view at the perception of our expressional cues, allowed us to evaluate the appropriateness of the stimuli, check our implementations for flaws and build a basis for systematical revision. Our analysis revealed that almost all Body Movements were appropriate for their target emotion and that some of our Sounds need a revision.

In addition, no study of which we are aware has examined the relative impact of these forms of victimization on the presence of negative versus positive automatic thoughts in adulthood. Given this, we tested the hypothesis that negative and positive automatic thoughts would mediate the link between childhood emotional maltreatment and verbal victimization and young adults' current depressive symptoms. This hypothesis was supported. In addition, both emotional maltreatment and verbal victimization were independently related to the presence of negative automatic thoughts and both were significantly more strongly related to levels of negative thoughts than positive thoughts.","[{'authorId': '21836231', 'name': 'B.

While impaired vagal function, indicated by reductions in heart rate variability (HRV), may be one mechanism linking anxiety disorders to CVD, prior studies have reported inconsistent findings highlighting the need for meta-analysis. Method: Studies comparing resting-state HRV recordings in patients with an anxiety disorder as a primary diagnosis and healthy controls were considered for meta-analysis. Results: Meta-analyses were based on 36 articles, including 2086 patients with an anxiety disorder and 2294 controls. Overall, anxiety disorders were characterized by lower HRV [high frequency (HF): Hedges’ g = −0.29. 95% CI: −0.41 to −0.17, p < 0.001; time domain: Hedges’ g = −0.45, 95% CI: −0.57 to −0.33, p < 0.001] than controls. Panic disorder (n = 447), post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 192), generalized anxiety disorder (n = 68), and social anxiety disorder (n = 90), but not obsessive–compulsive disorder (n = 40), displayed reductions in HF HRV relative to controls (all ps < 0.001). Conclusion: Anxiety disorders are associated with reduced HRV, findings associated with a small-to-moderate effect size. Findings have important implications for future physical health and well-being of patients, highlighting a need for comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction.","[{'authorId': '2054101064', 'name': 'J.

In this paper we challenge the conventional view, which argues that emotions are innately programmed in subcortical circuits, and propose instead that emotions are higher-order states instantiated in cortical circuits. What differs in emotional and nonemotional experiences, we argue, is not that one originates subcortically and the other cortically, but instead the kinds of inputs processed by the cortical network. We offer modifications of higher-order theory, a leading theory of consciousness, to allow higher-order theory to account for self-awareness, and then extend this model to account for conscious emotional experiences. Emotional states of consciousness, or what are typically called emotional feelings, are traditionally viewed as being innately programmed in subcortical areas of the brain, and are often treated as different from cognitive states of consciousness, such as those related to the perception of external stimuli. We argue that conscious experiences, regardless of their content, arise from one system in the brain. In this view, what differs in emotional and nonemotional states are the kinds of inputs that are processed by a general cortical network of cognition, a network essential for conscious experiences. Although subcortical circuits are not directly responsible for conscious feelings, they provide nonconscious inputs that coalesce with other kinds of neural signals in the cognitive assembly of conscious emotional experiences. In building the case for this proposal, we defend a modified version of what is known as the higher-order theory of consciousness.","[{'authorId': '2332694', 'name': 'Joseph E LeDoux'}, {'authorId': '2047534762', 'name': 'Richard Brown'}]",353.0,,207.0,A higher-order theory of emotional consciousness,2017.0

However, further research is needed.For example, although powerful tests of the attributional diath-esis-stress component have been conducted, no one has exam-ined the cognitive diatheses of inferring negative consequencesor characteristics about the self or whether the cognitive stylediathesis-stress interaction predicts clinically significant de-pression. Moreover, it is crucial to determine if this interactionpredicts the development of the hypothesized symptoms ofhopelessness depression. More generally, an important short-coming of the prior work is that it has not focused on the symp-toms of hopelessness depression in particular and, instead, sim-ply has examined the symptoms of depression in general. Fu-ture investigators need to test more fine-grained predictionsabout the hypothesized symptoms of hopelessness depression.The issue of the stability of the cognitive diatheses has not beenresolved satisfactorily. We have only begun, in a preliminaryway, to investigate the issues of specific vulnerability and media-tional processes. Finally, further tests of the predictions aboutcourse, cure, and prevention are needed. We eagerly await thisresearch.Difficult methodological issues may arise in the search forhopelessness depression, however. For example, the hopeless-ness theory is silent about the time lag between formation ofhopelessness and onset of the symptoms of hopelessness depres-sion. If it is very short, then a major challenge will be to developmethods with sufficient temporal resolving power to determineif hopelessness indeed precedes the occurrence of the hypothe-sized symptoms of hopelessness depression (see Alloy, Hartlage,et al., 1988, for proposed methods for testing the hopelessnesstheory). The results of work to test the hopelessness theory willdetermine if the concept of hopelessness depression needs tobe revised. For example, perhaps the statement of the causalpathway is correc t bu culminate n a differen se f symp-toms than those currently hypothesized to compose hopeless-ness depression. In this case, the symptom—but not thecause—component of the hopelessness theory would need to bemodified.In discussing how to search for hopelessness depression, wenote the possibility that future work may not corroborate theexistence of hopelessness depression as a bona fide subtype withcharacteristic cause, symptoms, course, treatment, and preven-tion. Instead, the etiological chain featured in the hopelessnesstheory may be one of many pathways to a final common out-come of depression. In this case, it would be more compellingto speak of a hopelessness cause, as opposed to a hopelessnesssubtype, of depression.","[{'authorId': '2294629', 'name': 'L.

Emotions provide a biological solution to certain problems of transition between plans, in systems with multiple goals. Their function is to accomplish and maintain these transitions, and to communicate them to ourselves and others. Transitions occur at significant junctures of plans when the evaluation of success in a plan changes. Complex emotions are derived from a small number of basic emotions and arise at junctures of social plans.","[{'authorId': '2297721', 'name': 'K. Oatley'}, {'authorId': '1384194899', 'name': 'P.

Short-range coordination of ciliary beats can occur by biophysical mechanisms. Long-range coordination across large or disjointed ciliated fields often requires nervous system control and innervation of ciliated cells by ciliomotor neurons. The neuronal control of cilia is best understood in invertebrate ciliated microswimmers, but similar mechanisms may operate in the vertebrate body. Here, we review how the study of aquatic invertebrates contributed to our understanding of the neuronal control of cilia. We summarize the anatomy of ciliomotor systems and the physiological mechanisms that can alter ciliary activity. We also discuss the most well-characterized ciliomotor system, that of the larval annelid Platynereis. Here, pacemaker neurons drive the rhythmic activation of cholinergic and serotonergic ciliomotor neurons to induce ciliary arrests and beating. The Platynereis ciliomotor neurons form a distinct part of the larval nervous system. Similar ciliomotor systems likely operate in other ciliated larvae, such as mollusc veligers. We discuss the possible ancestry and conservation of ciliomotor circuits and highlight how comparative experimental approaches could contribute to a better understanding of the evolution and function of ciliary systems.

Background: To date, reviews of trust in HRI have been qualitative or descriptive. Our quantitative review provides a fundamental empirical foundation to advance both theory and practice. Method: Meta-analytic methods were applied to the available literature on trust and HRI. A total of 29 empirical studies were collected, of which 10 met the selection criteria for correlational analysis and 11 for experimental analysis. These studies provided 69 correlational and 47 experimental effect sizes. Results: The overall correlational effect size for trust was r̄ = +0.26, with an experimental effect size of d̄ = +0.71. The effects of human, robot, and environmental characteristics were examined with an especial evaluation of the robot dimensions of performance and attribute-based factors. The robot performance and attributes were the largest contributors to the development of trust in HRI. Environmental factors played only a moderate role. Conclusion: Factors related to the robot itself, specifically, its performance, had the greatest current association with trust, and environmental factors were moderately associated. There was little evidence for effects of human-related factors. Application: The findings provide quantitative estimates of human, robot, and environmental factors influencing HRI trust. Specifically, the current summary provides effect size estimates that are useful in establishing design and training guidelines with reference to robot-related factors of HRI trust. Furthermore, results indicate that improper trust calibration may be mitigated by the manipulation of robot design.

The current paper investigates whether aggressive behaviour directed towards robots is influenced by the same social processes that guide human bullying behaviour. More specifically, it measured the effects of dehumanisation primes and anthropomorphic qualities of the robot on participants’ verbal abuse of a virtual robotic agents. Contrary to previous findings in human-human interaction, priming participants with power did not result in less mind attribution. However, evidence for dehumanisation was still found, as the less mind participants attributed to the robot, the more aggressive responses they gave. In the main study this effect was moderated by the manipulations of power and robot anthropomorphism; the low anthropomorphic robot in the power prime condition endured significantly less abuse, and mind attribution remained a significant predictor for verbal aggression in all conditions save the low anthropomorphic robot with no prime. It is concluded that dehumanisation occurs in human-robot interaction and that like in human-human interaction, it is linked to aggressive behaviour. Moreover, it is argued that this dehumanisation is different from anthropomorphism as well as human-human dehumanisation, since anthropomorphism itself did not predict aggressive behaviour and dehumanisation of robots was not influenced by primes that have been established in human-human dehumanisation research.","[{'authorId': '36128286', 'name': 'M.

To clarify and compare results across this growing body of literature, a quantitative review was developed, along with a theoretically derived path diagram of key emotional labor constructs. Evidence from our structural meta-analytic model based on 116 primary studies demonstrates that examining affective dispositions and emotional labor constructs and the pattern of positive and negative results helps to clarify and add specificity to the literature.

Validation of the scenarios was done through direct observation of 10 typically developing children playing with and without a robot with conventional toys and unstructured materials. A play coding system was used to classify the levels of play (no play, functional play or pretend play). Analysis showed that the scenarios could elicit play as expected (young children did more functional play and older children did more pretend play). However, children presented less pretend play with the robot than they did without the robot. This could be because typically developing children are accustomed to manipulating toys directly and the robot posed a higher level of cognitive difficulty. Next steps will be to address the effect of the robot, and trial the scenarios with children with disabilities.","[{'authorId': '116246037', 'name': 'Paola Esquivel'}, {'authorId': '31520489', 'name': 'Adriana Rios'}, {'authorId': '144455694', 'name': 'Lina Becerra'}, {'authorId': '144966378', 'name': 'K.

Additionally, the relationships of surface acting during meetings and perceived meeting effectiveness with time-lagged reports of intention to quit and emotional exhaustion 3 months later were investigated. Structural equation modelling of data from 178 working adults revealed negative relationships between surface acting and perceptions of meeting effectiveness. Perceived meeting effectiveness partially mediated the relationship between surface acting and both intention to quit and emotional exhaustion 3 months later. These findings expand both the limited research on perceived meeting effectiveness and the surface acting nomological network to include a consideration that expressing inauthentic emotions in meetings (surface acting) may relate to the perceived effectiveness of the meeting. As well, both surface acting during meetings and perceived meeting effectiveness may relate to how emotionally exhausted employees feel and their intentions to seek other employment.

To understand the role of patients' attributions under the attribution theory framework (locus, controllability, stability) in nurses' performance of surface or deep acting, as they unfold in interactions with different patients.


BACKGROUND
Regulation of emotions at work, or emotional labour, has been conceptualized in terms of two main strategies: surface acting and deep acting. Most prior research tested for between-subject variation in the search for the factors evoking these strategies in nurses, assuming them to be trait-like characteristics. Only scant research has examined how nurses modify their emotional labour strategies in different patient-nurse encounters.


DESIGN
A nested cross-sectional design (patients within nurses).


METHODS
Data were collected during 2011-2012 through validated questionnaires from the nursing staff (N = 41) of two paediatric hospital wards and their randomly selected patients (N = 239). Questionnaires were administered to nurses multiple times after encounters with different patients. Analyses were conducted using mixed effects models.


RESULTS
In accordance with attribution theory, different combinations of locus, controllability and stability attributions were related to the choice of surface or deep acting. Nurses' perceptions of patients' controllability were associated positively with surface acting and negatively with deep acting. Interaction terms of stability and locus and of controllability and stability, were distinctively associated with deep and surface acting.


CONCLUSIONS
Findings innovatively introduce the attribution process as an explanatory perspective to nurses' emotional labour and highlight its situational nature, providing a potential tool for emotional labour strategy prediction. Raising nurses' awareness of how they perceive patients may increase control of the strategies employed.","[{'authorId': '3230100', 'name': 'Nadya Golfenshtein'}, {'authorId': '102102860', 'name': 'A.

Specifically, the robot either intervened by repairing a task-directed or personal attack by a confederate or did not intervene. Contrary to our expectations, we found that the robot’s repair interventions increased the groups’ awareness of conflict after the occurrence of a personal attack thereby acting against the groups’ tendency to suppress the conflict.

This said, the book’s critique of early intervention practice may go too far in ignoring the potential benefits that can accrue from timely support and intervention. The authors’ definition of “early intervention”, in this context, is age-based, limited to early years. It would be interesting to see this defined more broadly, for example, as in the provision of rapid (early) support for families when there is a specific identified need or concern. While well researched, some of the book’s assertions are based on broad, sweeping empirical claims that are not supported by independent sources for verification. It’s possible that some of these claims are “common knowledge” in the UK context, but they may not be known elsewhere. The book has an activist flavour and in many cases uses emotive language to convey its arguments, which may appeal to some readers but not to others. Overall, the writing style is very readable and the book provides a critical lens to an area of practice that often goes unquestioned. The book would especially appeal to professionals working in family support services, social policy makers, and teachers and students of social policy.

We describe an active learning approach that helped us efficiently acquire and hand-label hundreds of thousands of non-neutral spontaneous and natural expressions from thousands of different individuals. With the increased numbers of training samples a classic RBF SVM classifier, widely used in facial expression recognition, starts to become computationally limiting for training and real-time performance. We propose combining two techniques: 1) smart selection of a subset of the training data and 2) the Nystrom kernel approximation method to train a classifier that performs at high-speed (300fps). We compare performance (accuracy and classification time) with respect to the size of the training dataset and the SVM kernel, using either an RBF kernel, a linear kernel or the Nystrom approximation method. We present facial action unit classifiers that perform extremely well on spontaneous and naturalistic webcam videos from around the world recorded over the Internet. When evaluated on a large public dataset (AM-FED) our method performed better than the previously published baseline.

The vagal tank theory, building on neurophysiological, cognitive and social psychology approaches, will introduce a physiological indicator for self-regulation that has mainly been ignored from cognitive and social psychology, cardiac vagal control (also referred to as cardiac vagal activity). Cardiac vagal control reflects the contribution of the vagus nerve, the main nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system, to cardiac regulation. We propose cardiac vagal control to be an indicator of how efficiently self-regulatory resources are mobilized and used. Three systematic levels of cardiac vagal control analysis are suggested: resting, reactivity, and recovery. Based on this physiological indicator we derive the metaphor of the vagal tank, which can get depleted and replenished. Overall, the vagal tank theory will enable to integrate previous findings from different disciplines and to stimulate new research questions, predictions, and designs regarding self-regulation.","[{'authorId': '143602110', 'name': 'S.

Recent years have seen social robotic pets introduced as a means of treating behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and many show promising potential. In this study, we sought to explore family members' perceptions of the Japanese-developed baby harp seal, Paro (version 9), and a look-alike, nonrobotic Plush Toy, when used by their relative with dementia for 15 min, 3 afternoons per week for 10 weeks.


Research Design and Method
The study employed a descriptive qualitative approach, which was nested within a larger cluster randomized controlled trial. A convenience sample of 20 family members (n = 10 each from the Paro and Plush Toy conditions) with relatives in 9 long-term care facilities in Queensland, Australia, completed individual semi-structured interviews (telephone or face-to-face). Inductive, data-driven thematic analysis of the data was undertaken with the assistance of the qualitative management software, ATLAS.ti®.


Results
Family members of long-term care residents with dementia expressed positive perceptions of the Paro, perceiving that it improved mood, reduced agitation, and provided opportunity for communication for their relative. Negative perceptions of the Plush Toy were given by family members, primarily because of its lack of movement and engagement.


Conclusion
Family members were keen for their older relative with dementia to use a social robot that moved and engaged with them, and Plush Toys that were static and unresponsive were perceived as being unimportant in improving quality of life. However, the current cost of Paro was identified by family members as a major limitation to use.","[{'authorId': '3481695', 'name': 'W. Moyle'}, {'authorId': '46806533', 'name': 'M.

In the short term, SEL programs can enhance children's confidence in themselves; increase their engagement in school, along with their test scores and grades; and reduce conduct problems while promoting desirable behaviors. In the long term, children with greater social-emotional competence are more likely to be ready for college, succeed in their careers, have positive relationships and better mental health, and become engaged citizens.Those benefits make SEL programs an ideal foundation for a public health approach to education—that is, an approach that seeks to improve the general population's wellbeing. In this article, Mark Greenberg, Celene Domitrovich, Roger Weissberg, and Joseph Durlak argue that SEL can support a public health approach to education for three reasons. First, schools are ideal sites for interventions with children. Second, school-based SEL programs can improve students' competence, enhance their academic achievement, and make them less likely to experience future behavioral and emotional problems. Third, evidence-based SEL interventions in all schools—that is, universal interventions—could substantially affect public health.The authors begin by defining social and emotional learning and summarizing research that shows why SEL is important for positive outcomes, both while students are in school and as they grow into adults. Then they describe what a public health approach to education would involve. In doing so, they present the prevention paradox—""a large number of people exposed to a small risk may generate many more cases [of an undesirable outcome] than a small number exposed to a high risk""—to explain why universal approaches that target an entire population are essential. Finally, they outline an effective, school-based public health approach to SEL that would maximize positive outcomes for our nation's children.","[{'authorId': '2106077514', 'name': 'M.

Human–human interaction and human–computer interaction research findings are relevant, but often limited because robots are different from both humans and computers. Therefore, new human–robot interaction (HRI) research methods can inform the design of robots suitable for inexperienced users. A video-based HRI (VHRI) methodology was here used to carry out a multi-national HRI user study for the prototype domestic robot BIRON (BIelefeld RObot companioN). Previously, the VHRI methodology was used in constrained HRI situations, while in this study HRIs involved a series of events as part of a 'hometour' scenario. Thus, the present work is the first study of this methodology in extended HRI contexts with a multi-national approach. Participants watched videos of the robot interacting with a human actor and rated two robot behaviors (Extrovert and Introvert). Participants' perceptions and ratings of the robot's behaviors differed with regard to both verbal interactions and person following by the robot. The study also confirms that the VHRI methodology provides a valuable means to obtain early user feedback, even before fully working prototypes are available. This can usefully guide the future design work on robots, and associated verbal and non-verbal behaviors.","[{'authorId': '1847981', 'name': 'M. Walters'}, {'authorId': '34797879', 'name': 'M.

Undergraduate women (N = 141) completed self-report instruments assessing perceptions of criticism in the family of origin, avoidant coping, experiential avoidance, and psychological distress. The mediational model was tested using procedures outlined by Baron and Kenny (1986). Support was found for the hypothesized model: (a) Higher perceived criticism was associated with higher avoidance, (b) higher avoidance was associated with greater distress, (c) higher perceived criticism was associated with greater distress, and (d) the relationship between perceived criticism and distress was non-significant when adding avoidance into the model. Results suggest that avoidance may be an emotion regulation strategy associated with perceived criticism in the family of origin that exacerbates psychological problems in adulthood.","[{'authorId': '2251762267', 'name': 'M.

To examine whether changes in cognitive reappraisal self-efficacy (CR-SE) mediate the effects of individually administered cognitive-behavioral therapy (I-CBT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD) on severity of social anxiety symptoms.


METHOD
A randomized controlled trial in which 75 adult patients (21-55 years of age; 53% male; 57% Caucasian) with a principal diagnosis of generalized SAD were randomly assigned to 16 sessions of I-CBT (n = 38) or a wait-list control (WL) group (n = 37). All patients completed self-report inventories measuring CR-SE and social anxiety symptoms at baseline and post-I-CBT/post-WL, and I-CBT completers were also assessed at 1-year posttreatment.


RESULTS
Compared with WL, I-CBT resulted in greater increases in CR-SE and greater decreases in social anxiety. Increases in CR-SE during I-CBT mediated the effect of I-CBT on social anxiety. Gains achieved by patients receiving I-CBT were maintained 1-year posttreatment, and I-CBT-related increases in CR-SE were also associated with reduction in social anxiety at the 1-year follow-up.


CONCLUSIONS
Increasing CR-SE may be an important mechanism by which I-CBT for SAD produces both immediate and long-term reductions in social anxiety.","[{'authorId': '1810531', 'name': 'P.

Increasingly, SROs have been called upon to deal with school discipline issues, which has inadvertently increased the likelihood of student contact with the juvenile justice system, and promoted the school-to-prison pipeline. This has impacted minorities and students with disabilities, especially those with emotional behavioral disorders, who are disproportionately at risk of exposure to adjudication.

More important, suppression is a transactional process, creating stress and disrupting interactions for the suppressor and those in social interactions with individuals who are suppressing emotion. However, no research has examined the behavioral consequences of emotion suppression in close relationships. We examine the possibility that emotion suppression will predict eating behaviors as a secondary emotion regulatory strategy among 1,556 parent–adolescent dyads (N = 3,112), consistent with evidence suggesting that suppression influences eating at the individual-level. Actor-partner interdependence models and structural equation modeling demonstrate that one’s own emotion suppression was associated with emotional eating; greater consumption of hedonic—low nutrient, high energy dense—foods; and lower consumption of fruits and vegetables (actor effects). One’s partner’s emotion suppression was also independently associated with one’s own emotional eating; lower consumption of fruits and vegetables; and greater consumption of hedonic foods (partner effects), although this association was most consistent for adolescents’ suppression and parents’ eating (compared with the converse). These analyses suggest that dyadic emotion regulatory processes have implications on eating behavior. Moreover, analyses suggest that emotion suppression has potential implications on eating behaviors of others within close relationships with a suppressor, consistent with the notion that emotion regulation is a transactional process. These findings suggest that interventions to improve eating habits of parents and their adolescent children should consider dyadic emotion regulatory processes.","[{'authorId': '3059168', 'name': 'R.

There are a growing number of applications for robots that people can engage as capable creatures or as partners rather than tools, yet little is understood about how to best design robots that interact with people in this way. The related field of human-computer interaction (HCI) offers important insights, however autonomous robots are a very different technology from desktop computers. In this paper, we look at the field of HRI from an HCI perspective, pointing out important similarities yet significant differences that may ultimately make HRI a distinct area of inquiry.

The article provides a case study evaluation of segments of trials where three children with autism, who usually do not interact with other people in their day to day activity, interacted with the robot and with co-present adults. A preliminary observational analysis was undertaken which applied, in abbreviated form, certain principles from conversation analysis - notably attention to the context in which the target behaviour occurred. The analysis was conducted by a social psychologist with expertise in using conversation analysis to understand interactions involving persons with an ASD. The analysis emphasises aspects of embodiment and interaction kinesics and revealed unexpected competencies on the part of the children.

They spoke bad words, repeatedly obstructed the robot's path, and sometimes even kicked and punched the robot. To investigate why they abused it, we conducted a field study, in which we let visiting children freely interact with the robot, and interviewed when they engaged in a serious abusive behavior including physical contacts. In total, we obtained valid interviews from twenty-three children over 13 days of observations. They are aged between five and nine. Adults and older children were rarely involved. We interviewed them to know whether they perceived the robot as human-like others, why they abused it, and whether they thought that the robot would suffer from their abusive behavior. We found that 1) the majority of the children abused because they were curious about the robot's reactions or enjoyed abusing it while considering it as human-like, and 2) about half of the children believed in the capability of the robot to perceive their abusive behaviors.","[{'authorId': '1768404', 'name': 'T.

How do they learn the meanings of verbs like ""think,"" adjectives like ""good,"" and words for abstract entities such as ""mortgage"" and ""story""? The acquisition of word meaning is one of the fundamental issues in the study of mind. According to Paul Bloom, children learn words through sophisticated cognitive abilities that exist for other purposes. These include the ability to infer others' intentions, the ability to acquire concepts, an appreciation of syntactic structure, and certain general learning and memory abilities. Although other researchers have associated word learning with some of these capacities, Bloom is the first to show how a complete explanation requires all of them. The acquisition of even simple nouns requires rich conceptual, social, and linguistic capacities interacting in complex ways. This book requires no background in psychology or linguistics and is written in a clear, engaging style. Topics include the effects of language on spatial reasoning, the origin of essentialist beliefs, and the young child's understanding of representational art.

270a40cf4ee645957399429c235ced2e559f1598,"California State University, FullertonFollowing recent developments in the measurement of individual differences in nonverbal socialskills, we proposed a conceptual framework for defining and assessing basic social skills. Preliminarytesting resulted in the development of a 105-item, pencil-and-paper measure of seven basic dimen-sions of social skills, called the Social Skills Inventory (SSI). In a series of validation studies usingundergraduate students, the SSI demonstrated convergent and discriminant validity in relation toother measures of nonverbal social skill and traditional personality scales. Scores on the SSI alsopredicted some social group memberships, typical social behaviors, and the depth of social networks.This evidence suggests that the SSI could prove to be a valuable tool for research in personality andsocial psychology and for work in applied settings.In recent years there has been increased attention to denningand assessing individual differences in social abilities and inter-personal skills. Work in this area is progressing on severalfronts. Psychologists have become increasingly concerned withthe assessment and development of social skills for assistingclinical populations (see Curran & Monti, 1982; Trower, Bry-ant, & Argyle, 1978; Wine & Smye, 1981). Personality and so-cial psychologists have developed standardized instruments thatassess dimensions related to interpersonal skill and social effec-tiveness, for example, measures of constructs such as empathy(Hogan, 1969; Mehrabian & Epstein, 1972), shyness, sociabil-ity, (Cheek & Buss, 1981), and self-monitoring (Snyder, 1974,1979). Communication researchers have concerned themselveswith the assessment of communicative competence (Diez,1984;Wiemann, 1977;WiemannB E. L. Thorndike, 1920;R. L. Thorndike, 1936; R. L. Thorndike & Stein, 1937). How-ever, difficulties in assessing social intelligence, particularly theinability to discriminate social intelligence from general intelli-gence, led to the demise of this line of research. It was manyyears later that research on the measurement of social abilitieswas revived with the work of Ouilford and his colleagues onbehavioral intelligence (Guilford, 1967) and the development ofscales to assess empathy (Dymond, 1949; Hogan, 1969).

There is perhaps no adequate single definition ofsocial skills. The variety and assortment of dimensions labeledas social skills is enormous. Yet there are certain consistenciesin the varying theoretical perspectives. Many social skill re-searchers agree that the basic sending and receiving of informa-tion represent key social skills. Indeed, Hall (1979) divided so-cial communication skills into two broad classes of sending andreceiving. Additional social skills involve cognitive abilitiessuch as interpersonal problem-solving skills and role-playingabilities (Meichenbaum, Butler, & Gruson, 1981).Many existing measures of social skills focus on a single, spe-cific type of skill, skill deficit, or skill-related construct such asassertiveness (Rathus, 1973), nonverbal sensitivity (Rosenthal,Hall, DiMatteo, Rogers, & Archer, 1979), fear of negative evalu-ation (Watson & Friend, 1969), or communication apprehen-sion (McCroskey, 1977). Some instruments that purport tomeasure singular dimensions of social skill may, in fact, be as-sessing constructs that are truly multidimensional; that is, com-prised of more basic independent social skills. Such appears tobe the case with Snyder's Self-Monitoring Scale (SMS, Snyder,1974), which may be composed of three more basic social skills(Briggs , Cheek & Buss 1980 ; Riggio Friedman 1982 seealso Lennox & Wolfe, 1984). Similar multidimensionality mayunderly the constructs of empathy (Davis, 1983) and assertive-ness (Galassi, Galassi, & Vedder, 1981).The presen t study is an attemp to develop general frame-work for several basic dimensions of social skill and to reporton the construction of a self-report assessment tool to measurethese basic skill dimensions. This framework is derived frommultidisciplinary research on social and interpersonal skills,but it springs most directly from the attempts of social personal-ity psychologists to measure individual differences in nonverbalcommunication skills. Most notable of these attempts are thework of Rosenthal and his colleagues (Rosenthal et al., 1979)and Buck (1984) on measuring nonverbal sensitivity, Friedman","[{'authorId': '39641777', 'name': 'R.

278b3a14c615c066a4860b89d22fc30fcb6e54a9,"Current methodology has made popular the pragmatic randomized trial (Foster & Little, 2012) and has led to an acknowledged growth of high-quality research in the ‘new generation’ of psychosocial interventions in dementia care (Orrell, 2012). However, many trials of psychosocial interventions in dementia lack impact. It is not clear whether this reflects a genuine ineffectiveness, since the methodology used in dementia care research is at present weak in addressing the important distinction between genuine ineffectiveness and an implementation error. Therefore, potentially effective dementia care interventions that may have a positive impact on patient experience can fail to show effectiveness, thereby reducing treatment options and wasting research money. Methodological discussions about the success and failure of interventions in dementia care within the European INTERDEM group of multi-professional researchers on psychosocial dementia care (www.interdem.org/) led to a critical analysis of the suitability of the current methodology. This has often relied on the Medical Research Council’s (MRC) Framework for complex interventions and its iterations (Campbell et al., 2000; Craig et al., 2008; Craig & Petticrew, 2013). Foster and Little (2012) pinpoint an important obstacle to improving clinical practice as the legacy of ‘simple’ drug therapy evaluations which are engrained in the design and conduct of the pragmatic trial, a view that can also be extended more generally to the interpretation and conduct of the MRC framework for complex interventions and its methodologies. The advantage of pragmatic trials is their proximity to daily practice in routine health care settings. This has particular implications for the design and conduct of psychosocial intervention research in dementia, where the important distinction between poor attention to implementation and genuine ineffectiveness is often overlooked. Furthermore, better attention to the implications of this proximity in the design and conduct of psychosocial intervention research trials may reduce the need for a separate large-scale implementation study phase in the way that this is currently conceived within the MRC approach to complex interventions (Craig et al., 2008; Craig & Petticrew, 2013). This is an urgent issue for psychosocial intervention research in dementia care as today 35.6 million people and families worldwide live with dementia (Prince et al., 2013), whilst major pharmaceutical advances in prevention and cure remain elusive (Miller, 2012). The predicted future growth of dementia cases over the next decade will undoubtedly raise the already high costs of care, estimated at US$ 604 billion in 2010 (Wimo et al., 2013), in an illness that is most feared people over the age of 55 years (Le Couteur, Doust, Creasey, & Brayne, 2013), since it can undermine core human capacities resulting in decline in quality of life (Selkoe, 2012). Although cure for dementia is not available for dementia patients, we are not empty handed. Psychosocial intervention research has emerged as today’s forerunner, given its aim to improve daily practice among professionals who provide support to people and families living with dementia. Psychosocial interventions in dementia involve interactions between people to improve psychological and social functioning (Moniz-Cook, Vernooij-Dassen, Woods, & Orrell, 2011; Rabins et al., 2007), such as cognitive stimulation therapy (Woods, Aguirre, Spector, & Orrell, 2012), occupational therapy (Graff et al., 2006) and support programmes for family carers (Vernooij-Dassen, Draskovic, McCleery, & Downs, 2011). This paper outlines the rationale for a paradigm shift in the design and methodology for evaluation of complex interventions in applied dementia care research. We use psychosocial intervention research as an exemplar of how researchers and their funders may achieve better value for money.","[{'authorId': '1391038676', 'name': 'M.

The main idea is to trigger increased helpfulness by proactively creating similarity through dynamic emotional adaption of the robot to the mood of the human. This is achieved in an explicit and implicit way: Explicitly, by a similarity-statement of the robot of being in the same mood as the user, and implicitly by controlling the affective parameters of facial and verbal expressions of a robot head in an interaction scenario such that the current values of the human mood in the dimensions of pleasure, arousal, and dominance (PAD) are matched. In a first step, this is accomplished by an initial self-assessment by the human participant to be extended by automatic emotion recognition modules in a later stage.

Prior studies have investigated the neural basis of negative social feedback, but the underlying neural mechanisms of aggression regulation following negative social feedback remain largely undiscovered. In the current study, participants viewed pictures of peers with feedback (positive, neutral or negative) to the participant's personal profile. Next, participants responded to the peer feedback by pressing a button, thereby producing a loud noise toward the peer, as an index of aggression. Behavioral analyses showed that negative feedback led to more aggression (longer noise blasts). Conjunction neuroimaging analyses revealed that both positive and negative feedback were associated with increased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and bilateral insula. In addition, more activation in the right dorsal lateral PFC (dlPFC) during negative feedback vs neutral feedback was associated with shorter noise blasts in response to negative social feedback, suggesting a potential role of dlPFC in aggression regulation, or top-down control over affective impulsive actions. This study demonstrates a role of the dlPFC in the regulation of aggressive social behavior.","[{'authorId': '5491920', 'name': 'M. Achterberg'}, {'authorId': '2032269', 'name': 'A.

282d20badd5c304d18e3efadbf9d7b171c4f3c47,"Several creatures including insects, spiders and lizards have developed a unique clinging ability that utilizes dry adhesion. Geckos, in particular, have developed the most complex adhesive structures capable of smart adhesion — the ability to cling to different smooth and rough surfaces as well as detach at will. These animals make use of about three million microscale hairs (setae) (about 14 000/mm2) that branch off into hundreds of nanoscale spatulae (about a billion spatulae). Van der Waals forces are the primary mechanism utilized to adhere to surfaces, and capillary forces are a secondary effect that can further increase adhesion force. The hierarchical surface construction gives the gecko the adaptability to create a large real area of contact with surfaces. Modeling of the gecko attachment system as a hierarchical spring model has provided insight into adhesion enhancement generated by this system. It is shown that a multi-level hierarchical structure produces adhesion enhancement, and this enhancement increases with an increase in applied load and a decrease in the stiffness of springs. A significant adhesion enhancement occurs when the maximum spring deformation is greater than two to three times the root mean square amplitude of surface roughness. Although a gecko is capable of producing on the order of 20 N of adhesion force, it retains the ability to remove its feet from an attachment surface at will. Adhesion design databases for biomimetic attachment systems are presented. These adhesion design databases are useful for understanding biological systems and for guiding the fabrication of biomimetic attachment systems. A man-made fibrillar structure capable of replicating gecko adhesion has the potential for use in dry, superadhesive tapes that would be of use in a wide range of applications. These adhesives could be created using micro/nanofabrication techniques or self-assembly.","[{'authorId': '144907852', 'name': 'B.

Its use and cleaning followed protocols developed by the study team, which incorporated hand hygiene and standard precaution policies. Its cleanliness was determined using an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) luminometer, with a benchmark of 50 relative light units (RLU). A reading of ATP below 50RLU is the level of cleanliness recommended for social areas in hospital settings. Throughout the study period, monitoring showed that all swab zones on PARO were within the benchmark of the 50RLU threshold for cleanliness. PARO has an emerging evidence base as a useful therapeutic device. However, introducing such devices into clinical practice may encounter barriers or concerns from an infection prevention and control (IPC) perspective. This study of PARO in clinical practice aims to address the IPC concerns raised and offers cleaning and testing protocols and results.","[{'authorId': '2091916471', 'name': 'P.

Most research to date has focused on explicit (effortful) forms of emotion regulation. However, there is growing research interest in implicit (automatic) forms of emotion regulation. To organise emerging findings, we present a dual-process framework that integrates explicit and implicit forms of emotion regulation, and argue that both forms of regulation are necessary for well-being. In the first section of this review, we provide a broad overview of the construct of emotion regulation, with an emphasis on explicit and implicit processes. In the second section, we focus on explicit emotion regulation, considering both neural mechanisms that are associated with these processes and their experiential and physiological consequences. In the third section, we turn to several forms of implicit emotion regulation, and integrate the burgeoning literature in this area. We conclude by outlining open questions and areas for future research.","[{'authorId': '6307176', 'name': 'Anett Gyurak'}, {'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

We describe the conceptual framework and development of the program and present data on feasibility and preliminary efficacy from a pilot trial. The Emotional Awareness and Skills Enhancement manual was developed using a participatory action framework, based on emotion regulation research specific to autism spectrum disorder and input from individuals with autism spectrum disorder, therapists, and parents of children with autism spectrum disorder. Emotional Awareness and Skills Enhancement was piloted in a two-site open trial with 20 participants with autism spectrum disorder (12–17 years old, confirmed autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, IQ > 80).Outcome data support program feasibility and acceptability to participants, as well as significant improvement in emotion regulation impairments and related concerns.Findings offer preliminary support for both the feasibility and clinical effectiveness of the Emotional Awareness and Skills Enhancement program.","[{'authorId': '34976956', 'name': 'Caitlin M.

The interpretation lead to three classes of applications for social robots according to the degree of social interaction: (1) Specialized Applications where the robot has to perform clearly defined tasks which are delegated by a user, (2) Public Applications which are directed to the communication with many users, and (3) Individual Applications with the need of a highly elaborated social model to maintain a variety of situations with few people.","[{'authorId': '2065189', 'name': 'F.

In contrast to the majority of robots that use gestures and facial movements to express internal states, we developed an emotionally expressive robot that communicates using dynamically changing skin textures. The robot's shell is covered in actuated goosebumps and spikes, with programmable frequency and amplitude patterns. In a controlled study ($n=139$) we presented eight texture patterns to participants in three interaction modes: online video viewing, in person observation, and touching the texture. For most of the explored texture patterns, participants consistently perceived them as expressing specific emotions, with similar distributions across all three modes. This indicates that a texture changing skin can be a useful new tool for robot designers. Based on the specific texture-to-emotion mappings, we provide actionable design implications, recommending using the shape of a texture to communicate emotional valence, and the frequency of texture movement to convey emotional arousal. Given that participants were most sensitive to valence when touching the texture, and were also most confident in their ratings using that mode, we conclude that touch is a promising design channel for human-robot communication.","[{'authorId': '49994805', 'name': 'Yuhan Hu'}, {'authorId': '145666784', 'name': 'Guy Hoffman'}]",34.0,,41.0,Using Skin Texture Change to Design Emotion Expression in Social Robots,2019.0

BPD is not only common in psychiatric populations but also more prevalent in the general community than previously thought, and thus represents an important public health issue. In contrast to most psychiatric disorders, some symptoms associated with BPD may improve over time, even without therapy, though impaired social functioning and interpersonal disturbances in close relationships often persist. Another counterintuitive and insufficiently resolved question is why depressive symptoms and risk-taking behaviors can occur simultaneously in the same individual. Moreover, there is an ongoing debate about the nosological position of BPD, which impacts on research regarding sex differences in clinical presentation and patterns of comorbidity.In this review, it is argued that many features of BPD may be conceptualized within an evolutionary framework, namely behavioral ecology. According to Life History Theory, BPD reflects a pathological extreme or distortion of a behavioral 'strategy' which unconsciously aims at immediate exploitation of resources, both interpersonal and material, based on predictions shaped by early developmental experiences. Such a view is consistent with standard medical conceptualizations of BPD, but goes beyond classic 'deficit'-oriented models, which may have profound implications for therapeutic approaches.","[{'authorId': '50161801', 'name': 'M.

Obtaining assent and respecting dissent are widely adopted safeguards when conducting dementia research involving individuals who lack consent capacity, but there is no consensus on how assent and dissent should be defined or what procedures should be used regarding them. Our objective was to provide recommendations on these issues based on the opinions of knowledgeable key informants.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional qualitative research.


SETTING
University research institutions.


PARTICIPANTS
Forty informants, including 1) nationally known experts on dementia and research ethics, 2) dementia researchers, and 3) dementia caregivers and advocates.


MEASUREMENTS
Semistructured individual and focus group interviews, audio recorded, and transcribed for content analysis.


RESULTS
Assent and dissent should be defined broadly and based on an assessment of how adults who lack consent capacity can express or indicate their preferences verbally, behaviorally, or emotionally. Assent requires the ability to indicate a meaningful choice and at least a minimal level of understanding. Assent should be required whenever an individual has the ability to assent, and dissent should be binding if it is unequivocal or sustained after an effort to relieve concerns and/or distress. Standards for seeking assent and respecting dissent should not be linked to the risks or potential benefits of a study. Lacking the ability to assent and/or dissent should not automatically preclude research participation.


CONCLUSIONS
Obtaining assent and respecting dissent from individuals who lack consent capacity for dementia research allows them to participate, to the extent possible, in the consent process. Assent and dissent are important independent ethical constructs.","[{'authorId': '3702415', 'name': 'B. Black'}, {'authorId': '50628389', 'name': 'P. Rabins'}, {'authorId': '2265434', 'name': 'J.

Narratives were coded for the sophistication of meaning-making reported, the event type in the narrative, and the emotional tone of the narrative. Meaning-making was defined as connecting the turning point to some aspect of or understanding of oneself. Results showed that less sophisticated meaning was associated particularly with the less advanced diffusion and foreclosure statuses, and that more sophisticated meaning was associated with an overall identity maturity index. Meaning was also positively associated with generativity and optimism at age 23, with stories focused on mortality experiences, and with a redemptive story sequence. Meaning was negatively associated with achievement stories.

This model stands in contrast to theories of basic emotions, which posit that a discrete and independent neural system subserves every emotion. We propose that basic emotion theories no longer explain adequately the vast number of empirical observations from studies in affective neuroscience, and we suggest that a conceptual shift is needed in the empirical approaches taken to the study of emotion and affective psychopathologies. The circumplex model of affect is more consistent with many recent findings from behavioral, cognitive neuroscience, neuroimaging, and developmental studies of affect. Moreover, the model offers new theoretical and empirical approaches to studying the development of affective disorders as well as the genetic and cognitive underpinnings of affective processing within the central nervous system.This work was supported in part by NIMH Grants MH01232, MH59139, MH36197, MHK02-74677, and MH068318; a grant from the National Alliance for Research in Schizophrenia and Affective Disorders (NARSAD); NSF Grant BSC-0421702; and funding from the Thomas D.

One such path- way may relate to the behavioral responses of the elderly when interacting with a dog. The present study compared the immediate behavioral responses of nursing home residents to bi-weekly visits from a person accompanied by either a dog, a robot seal (PARO®), or a soft toy cat, using a randomized controlled design. A total of 100 nursing home residents com- pleted the study. Each participant received a total of 12 visits, during which their behaviors, including interactions between the visitor and the accom- panying animal (real or artificial), were recorded. Also, data on cognitive im- pairment, presence of depressive symptoms, age, time lived in the nursing home, dementia diagnoses, and gender were collected. We found that the immediate responses to, and interaction with, the visiting animal depended on the type of animal that was brought along. The dog and the interactive robot seal triggered the most interaction, in the form of physical contact (F(2,103) = 7.50, p < 0.001), eye contact (F(4,151) = 6.26, p < 0.001), and verbal communication (F(4,195) = 2.87, p < 0.05). As well, the cognitive impairment level of the residents affected with whom they interacted. The higher the cognitive impairment level, the more interaction was directed toward the animal and less toward humans, regardless of visit type (F(2,101) = 4.10, p < 0.05). The dogs and the robot seal stimulated the residents to more in- teraction, compared with the toy cat, but the robot seal failed to maintain the attention at the same level over time. The cognitive functioning of the residents correlated with the level of interaction, and this needs to be studied further.","[{'authorId': '6595713', 'name': 'K.

It focuses on relations between the development of cognitive aspects of regulation-referred to as executive functions and defined as abilities used to regulate information and to organize thinking in goal-directed activities-and the development of reactivity and regulation in stimulus-driven emotion, attention, and physiological stress response systems. It examines a bidirectional model of cognition-emotion interaction in the development of self-regulation in which top-down executive control of thought and behavior develops in reciprocal and interactive relation to bottom-up influences of emotion and stress reactivity. The bidirectional model is examined within the context of innovative preschool interventions designed to promote school readiness by promoting the development of self-regulation.","[{'authorId': '6520193', 'name': 'A.

In the United States, the current system in place is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), whereas worldwide, the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) serves as a general medical system. This review will examine the differences in neurodevelopmental disorders between these two systems. First, we will review the important revisions made from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) to the DSM-5, with respect to ASD and ADHD. Next, we will cover the similarities and differences between ASD and ADHD classification in the DSM-5 and the ICD-10, and how these differences may have an effect on neurodevelopmental disorder diagnostics and classification. By examining the changes made for the DSM-5 in 2013, and critiquing the current ICD-10 system, we can help to anticipate and advise on the upcoming ICD-11, due to come online in 2017. Overall, this review serves to highlight the importance of progress towards complementary diagnostic classification systems, keeping in mind the difference in tradition and purpose of the DSM and the ICD, and that these systems are dynamic and changing as more is learned about neurodevelopmental disorders and their underlying etiology. Finally this review will discuss alternative diagnostic approaches, such as the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative, which links symptom domains to underlying biological and neurological mechanisms. The incorporation of new diagnostic directions could have a great effect on treatment development and insurance coverage for neurodevelopmental disorders worldwide.","[{'authorId': '4475995', 'name': 'Ellen A.

In order to accurately detect user affect during HRIs, affect elicitation techniques need to be developed to create and train appropriate affect detection models. In this paper, we present such a novel affect elicitation and detection method for social robots in HRIs. Non-verbal emotional behaviors of the social robot were designed to elicit user affect, which was directly measured through electroencephalography (EEG) signals. HRI experiments with both younger and older adults were conducted to evaluate our affect elicitation technique and compare the two types of affect detection models we developed and trained utilizing multilayer perceptron neural networks (NNs) and support vector machines (SVMs). The results showed that; on average, the self-reported valence and arousal were consistent with the intended elicited affect.

First, how do different personality characteristics-self-monitoring and the Big Five personality traits-relate to indegree centrality and brokerage, the two most studied structurally advantageous positions in organizational networks? Second, how do indegree centrality and brokerage compare in explaining job performance and career success? Third, how do these personality variables and network positions relate to work outcomes? Our results show that self-monitoring predicted indegree centrality across expressive and instrumental networks and brokerage in expressive networks after controlling for the Big Five traits. Self-monitoring, therefore, was especially relevant for understanding why people differ in their acquisition of advantageous positions in social networks. But the total variance explained by personality ranged between 3% and 5%. Surprisingly, we found that indegree centrality was more strongly related to job performance and career success than brokerage. We also found that personality predicted job performance and career success above and beyond network position and that network position partially mediated the effects of certain personality variables on work outcomes. This paper provides an integrated view of how an individual's personality and network position combine to influence job performance and career success.","[{'authorId': '37396967', 'name': 'Ruolian Fang'}, {'authorId': '145616972', 'name': 'B.

Several fabric electrodes are dispersed over the shape, and a small electronic circuit measures the resistance between each possible pair of electrodes. As the shape is deformed as a result of a squeeze gesture, the resistance patterns between electrode pairs change. A machine learning algorithm allows to differentiate between the different shape deformations. In addition, user-friendly open source software allows defining and recording squeeze gestures. Consequently, Skweezees enable rich gestural squeeze interaction for the DIY community.

This article reviews the current definitions, proposes a theoretical clarification of the concept, and describes its relevance for the field of developmental psychopathology. We conceptualize psychological maltreatment as the interaction between maltreating parent behaviors and the special vulnerabilities of a child, particularly his or her developmental level. Also, we restrict the definition of psychological maltreatment to verbal and nonverbal parent communication; parental acts that involve physical or sexual contact are excluded. This effort strives to minimize the redundancy with the definitions of other forms of maltreatment and facilitate research into the effects of all forms of victimization.","[{'authorId': '39406917', 'name': 'R.

2cb003b287cb9775d9b00acb89ede1c6c41c0cfb,"Background: The increasing incidence of people affected by overweight or obesity is a significant health problem. The knowledge of the factors which influences the inappropriate eating behaviors causing excessive body fat is an essential goal for the research. Overweight and obesity are significant risk factors for many health diseases, such as cardiovascular problems, diabetes. Recently, many studies have focused on the relationship between body weight and cognitive processes. Objectives: This systematic review is aimed to investigate the existence and the nature of the relationship between excessive body weight (overweight/obesity) and executive functions, analyzing cross-sectional, and longitudinal studies in order to verify the evidence of a possible causality between these variables. Methods: The review was carried out according to the PRISMA-Statement, through systematic searches in the scientific databases PubMed, Medline, PsychInfo, and PsycArticles. The studies selected examined performance on executive tasks by participants with overweight or obesity, aged between 5 and 70 years. Studies examining eating disorders or obesity resulting from other medical problems were excluded. Furthermore, the results of studies using a cross-sectional design and those using a longitudinal one were separately investigated. Results: Sixty-three cross-sectional studies and twenty-eight longitudinal studies that met our inclusion and exclusion criteria were analyzed. The results confirmed the presence of a relation between executive functions and overweight/obesity, although the directionality of this relation was not clear; nor did any single executive function emerge as being more involved than others in this relation. Despite this, there was evidence of a reciprocal influence between executive functions and overweight/obesity. Conclusions: This systematic review underlines the presence of a relationship between executive functions and overweight/obesity. Moreover, it seems to suggest a bidirectional trend in this relationship that could be the cause of the failure of interventions for weight reduction. The results of this review highlight the importance of a theoretical model able to consider all the main variables of interest, with the aim to structuring integrated approaches to solve the overweight/obesity problems.","[{'authorId': '67123587', 'name': 'F.

We compare the permeabilities of gap junctions comprised of different connexins to iontophoretically injected tracer molecules. Our results show that Lucifer yellow can pass through all connexin channels analyzed. On the other hand, propidium iodide and ethidium bromide penetrate very poorly or not at all through Cx31 and Cx32 channels, respectively, but pass through channels of other connexins. 4,6 Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) dihydrochloride shows less transfer among Cx31 or Cx43 transfectants. Neurobiotin is weakly transferred among Cx31 transfectants. Total junctional conductance in Cx31 or Cx45 transfected cells is only about half as high as in other connexin transfectants analyzed and does not correlate exactly with any of the tracer permeabilities. Permeability through different connexin channels appears to be dependent on the molecular structure of each tracer, i.e. size, charge and possibly rigidity. This supports the hypothesis that different connexin channels show different permeabilities to second messenger molecules as well as metabolites and may fulfill in this way their specific role in growth control and differentiation of cell types. In addition, we have investigated the function of heterotypic gap junctions after co-cultivation of two different connexin transfectants, one of which had been prelabeled with fluorescent dextran beads. Analysis of Lucifer yellow transfer reveals that HeLa cells expressing Cx31 (beta-type connexin) do not communicate with any other connexin transfectant tested but only with themselves. Two other beta-type connexin transfectants, HeLa-Cx26 and -Cx32, do not transmit Lucifer yellow to any of the alpha-type connexins analyzed. Among alpha- type connexins, Cx40 does not communicate with Cx43. Thus, connexins differ in their ability to form functional heterotypic gap junctions among mammalian cells.","[{'authorId': '6784172', 'name': 'C.

Abnormalities are usually reported in multiple sensory processing domains, showing a higher prevalence of unusual responses, particularly to tactile, auditory and visual stimuli. This paper discusses a novel robot-based framework designed to target sensory difficulties faced by children with ASD in a controlled setting. The setup consists of a number of sensory stations, together with robotic agents that navigate the stations and interact with the stimuli as they are presented. These stimuli are designed to resemble real world scenarios that form a common part of one's everyday experiences. Given the strong interest of children with ASD in technology in general and robots in particular, we attempt to utilize our robotic platform to demonstrate socially acceptable responses to the stimuli in an interactive, pedagogical setting that encourages the child's social, motor and vocal skills, while providing a diverse sensory experience.

Largely, this increase in attention is fuelled by speculated effects on human motivation and cognition. However, empirical investigations on the effect of animated agents are still small in number and differ with regard to the measured effects. Our aim is two-fold. First, we provide a comprehensive and systematic overview of the empirical studies conducted so far in order to investigate effects of animated agents on the user's experience, behaviour and performance. Second, by discussing both implications and limitations of the existing studies, we identify some general requirements and suggestions for future studies.","[{'authorId': '40375607', 'name': 'D.

Posttreatment assessments indicated that all 3 treatment conditions had resulted in significant improvements in comparison with controls. Comparisons of the 3 treatment conditions indicated that CT and CT + PT children showed significant improvements in problem solving as well as conflict management skills, as measured by observations of their interactions with a best friend; differences among treatment conditions on these measures consistently favored the CT condition over the PT condition. As for parent and child behavior at home, PT and CT + PT parents and children had significantly more positive interactions, compared with CT parents and children. One-year follow-up assessments indicated that all the significant changes noted immediately posttreatment had been maintained over time. Moreover, child conduct problems at home had significantly lessened over time. Analyses of the clinical significance of the results suggested that the combined CT + PT condition produced the most significant improvements in child behavior at 1-year follow-up.","[{'authorId': '1401771574', 'name': 'C.

– Based on the trust theory, the purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the role of trustworthiness and trust in users’ intentions to continue using internet banking. Further, the authors position the trust beliefs of competence, benevolence, integrity, and shared values as key antecedents of trustworthiness and trust. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
– A questionnaire survey was used to collect responses from 227 actual users of internet banking in Malaysian context. A PLS analysis was conducted to explore the relationships between trusting beliefs, trustworthiness, trust, and internet banking use. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
– Empirical findings show that trusting beliefs of consistency, integrity, and shared values determine the trustworthiness and trust in internet banking. Moreover, trust was found to mediate the relationship between trustworthiness and internet banking use. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
– The study findings help managers understand the factors that determine Malaysia users trust and trustworthiness perceptions in internet banking. With reports indicated increase in internet banking use in Malaysia, the study findings provide important insights into enhancing users’ trust in internet banking for future transactions. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
– Unlike previous studies that have largely focussed on technology factors, this study based on trust theory proposes that trust is important for users to continue using internet banking services. In developing this trust, the authors propose that trustworthiness is of vital importance. Further, the authors propose and show that trusting beliefs of competence, integrity and shared values influence user trustworthiness and trust in internet banking use. Thus, this study extends the understanding of the internet banking use in Malaysian context.","[{'authorId': '2114104993', 'name': 'Pay Ling Yu'}, {'authorId': '145003117', 'name': 'M.

2f2c615d118dc73667a68357d34df5612a48e97d,"Introduction When someone asks, "" How do you feel? "" , your answer includes your bodily feelings as well as your emotional feelings. Influential models of emotion view the embodiment of emotions as fundamental; that is, many observers believe that interoceptive awareness has a crucial role in emotional awareness (Barrett et al. The neuroanatomical findings described in this chapter address the organization of pathways in the brain that engender feelings from the body, and they support the view that the neural substrates responsible for subjective awareness of your emotional state are based on the neural representation of your physiological state. These data show that there is a phylogenetically novel homeostatic sensory afferent pathway in primates, especially in humanoid primates, that provides the basis for a sense of the physiological condition of the body ("" the material me "") in posterior insular cortex (Craig, 2002). A posterior-to-anterior progression of increasingly complex re-representations in the human insula provides a foundation for the sequential integration of your homeostatic condition with your sensory environment, with your motivational condition and with your social condition. Based on considerable evidence, I propose that this integration generates a unified penultimate meta-representation of the global emotional moment at the junction of the anterior insula and the frontal operculum (Craig, 2004a, 2005). Convergent functional imaging findings reveal that the anterior insula and the anterior cingulate cortices are conjointly activated during all human emotions (e.g., Murphy et al., 2003), which in my view indicates that the limbic sensory representation of subjective "" feelings "" (in the anterior insula) and the limbic motor representation of volitional agency (in the anterior cingulate) together form the fundamental neuroanatomical basis for all human emotions (Craig, 2002), consistent with the definition of an emotion in humans as both a feeling and a motivation with concomitant autonomic sequelae (Rolls, 1999). In this view, emotions are not simply occasional events, but rather are ongoing and continuous, and in this view emotional behaviors can occur without subjective feelings (as they do constantly in animals other than humanoid primates, or in unconscious human emotional acts). Thus, I concur with the idea that emotional behaviors evolved as energy-efficient means of producing goal-directed actions that fulfill homeostatic and social needs (Darwin, 1872), and I believe that our capacity for awareness of our emotional behaviors (that is, our subjective feelings) evolved because it enabled an enormous enhancement in the efficiency and complexity of …","[{'authorId': '2231771915', 'name': 'Haviland-Jones Lewis'}, {'authorId': '2231771646', 'name': 'Barrett'}, {'authorId': '48614533', 'name': 'A.

To curb the resulting complexity of models, Axelrod promoted the KISS principle: ‘Keep It Simple, Stupid’. But the community is divided and a new principle appeared: KIDS, ‘Keep It Descriptive, Stupid’. Richer models were thus developed for a variety of phenomena, while agent cognition still tends to be modelled with simple reactive particle-like agents. This is not always appropriate, in particular in the social sciences trying to account for the complexity of human behaviour. One solution is to model humans as belief, desire and intention (BDI) agents, an expressive paradigm using concepts from folk psychology, making it easier for modellers and users to understand the simulation. This paper provides a methodological guide to the use of BDI agents in social simulations, and an overview of existing methodologies and tools for using them.","[{'authorId': '2236335', 'name': 'C.

Incidence data, available through 2014, were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data, available through 2015, were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2018, 1,735,350 new cancer cases and 609,640 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Over the past decade of data, the cancer incidence rate (2005‐2014) was stable in women and declined by approximately 2% annually in men, while the cancer death rate (2006‐2015) declined by about 1.5% annually in both men and women. The combined cancer death rate dropped continuously from 1991 to 2015 by a total of 26%, translating to approximately 2,378,600 fewer cancer deaths than would have been expected if death rates had remained at their peak. Of the 10 leading causes of death, only cancer declined from 2014 to 2015. In 2015, the cancer death rate was 14% higher in non‐Hispanic blacks (NHBs) than non‐Hispanic whites (NHWs) overall (death rate ratio [DRR], 1.14; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.13‐1.15), but the racial disparity was much larger for individuals aged <65 years (DRR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.29‐1.32) compared with those aged ≥65 years (DRR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.06‐1.09) and varied substantially by state. For example, the cancer death rate was lower in NHBs than NHWs in Massachusetts for all ages and in New York for individuals aged ≥65 years, whereas for those aged <65 years, it was 3 times higher in NHBs in the District of Columbia (DRR, 2.89; 95% CI, 2.16‐3.91) and about 50% higher in Wisconsin (DRR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.56‐2.02), Kansas (DRR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.25‐1.81), Louisiana (DRR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.38‐1.60), Illinois (DRR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.39‐1.57), and California (DRR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.38‐1.54).

The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study is a prospective cohort study with a 21-year follow-up. At baseline, detailed quantitative information on subjects' food consumption was obtained using a 48 h dietary recall method (n 1768, aged 3–18 years). The interviews were repeated after 6 and 21 years (n 1200 and n 1037, respectively). We conducted a principal component analysis to identify major dietary patterns at each study point. A set of two similar patterns was recognised throughout the study. Pattern 1 was positively correlated with consumption of traditional Finnish foods, such as rye, potatoes, milk, butter, sausages and coffee, and negatively correlated with fruit, berries and dairy products other than milk. Pattern 1 type of diet was more common among male subjects, smokers and those living in rural areas. Pattern 2, predominant among female subjects, non-smokers and in urban areas, was characterised by more health-conscious food choices such as vegetables, legumes and nuts, tea, rye, cheese and other dairy products, and also by consumption of alcoholic beverages. Tracking of the pattern scores was observed, particularly among subjects who were adolescents at baseline.

The aim of this study was to investigate effects of robot-assisted group activity with Paro on quality of life in older people with dementia.


BACKGROUND
Nursing home residents with severe dementia often experience social withdrawal and lower quality of life, which are suggested to be enhanced by non-pharmacological interventions.


DESIGN
A cluster-randomized controlled trial. Ten nursing home units were randomized to robot-assisted intervention or control group (treatment as usual).


METHODS
Data were collected between March 2013-September 2014. 27 participants participated in group activity for 30 minutes twice a week over 12 weeks, 26 participated in the control group. Change in quality of life was assessed by local nurses through the Quality of Life in Late-Stage Dementia scale at baseline, after end of intervention and at 3 months follow-up. The scale and regular psychotropic medication were analysed stratified by dementia severity. Analysis using mixed model, one-way anova and linear regression were performed.


RESULTS
An effect was found among participants with severe dementia from baseline to follow-up showing stable quality of life in the intervention group compared with a decrease in the control group. The intervention explained most of the variance in change in the total scale and in the subscales describing Tension and Well-being for the group with severe dementia. The intervention group used significantly less psychotropic medication compared with the control group after end of intervention.


CONCLUSION
Pleasant and engaging activities facilitated by nursing staff, such as group activity with Paro, could improve quality of life in people with severe dementia. The trial is in adherence with the CONSORT statement and is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (study ID number: NCT01998490) [corrected].","[{'authorId': '1421958011', 'name': 'N.

We designed a between-subjects study where 48 participants took part in a memorization task and observed a confederate mistreating a robot both verbally and physically. The robot was either empathetic towards the participant’s performance in the task or indifferent. When the robot was mistreated, it ignored the abuse, shut down in response to it, or reacted emotionally. We found that the majority of the participants intervened to help the robot after it was abused. Interventions happened for a wide range of reasons. Interestingly, the empathetic robot increased the proportion of participants that self-reported intervening in comparison to the indifferent robot, but more participants moved the robot as a response to abuse in the latter case. The participants also perceived the robot being verbally mistreated more and reported higher levels of personal distress when the robot briefly shut down after abuse in comparison to when it reacted emotionally or did not react at all.","[{'authorId': '32646792', 'name': 'Xiang Zhi Tan'}, {'authorId': '144168587', 'name': 'Marynel Vázquez'}, {'authorId': '32134175', 'name': 'E.

Clearly, negotiations represent motivated performance situations to interested partners. And, experimental negotiation tasks are no exception, including those involving real human players (Van Kleef, De Dreu, & Manstead, 2004) and digital agents (i.e., player representations driven by computer algorithms, de Melo, Carnevale, & Gratch, 2011). The current work examines individuals’ motivational responses, using physiological indexes, to emotionally expressive virtual characters in a multi-issue negotiation task. Specifically, we focus on the question of how situational context affects emotion perception from facial expressions. In person-to-agent negotiation tasks, experimenters often insert communicative cues such as agent facial expressions intended to strategically manipulate user’s emotions. Agents that show emotion have now been used in several domains such as education, entertainment, training, therapy and commerce (for a review see Beale & Creed, 2009). In a multi-issue negotiation task, de Melo and colleagues (2011) reported that participants made more concessions to a virtual human that displayed an angry facial expression compared to a happy facial expression. Most research on the effects of virtual characters’ emotional facial expressions has relied on subjective responses from participants (e.g., Beale & Creed, 2009). However, given the evidence that emotion is processed via non-conscious pathways, perhaps more so than conscious pathways (Tamietto & De Gelder, 2010), validated physiological measures related to affect should provide confirmation of the operation of non-conscious emotional processes involved in motivated performance tasks such as negotiation (Blascovich & Mendes, 2010). Abstract Affect is important in motivated performance situations such as negotiation. Longstanding theories of emotion suggest that facial expressions provide enough information to perceive another person’s internal affective state. Alternatively, the contextual emotion hypothesis posits that situational factors bias the perception of emotion in others’ facial displays. This hypothesis predicts that individuals will have different perceptions of the same facial expression depending upon the context in which the expression is displayed. In this study, cardiovascular indexes of motivational states (i.e., challenge vs. threat) were recorded while players engaged in a multi- issue negotiation where the opposing negotiator (confederate) displayed emotional facial expressions (angry vs. happy); the confederate’s negotiation strategy (cooperative vs. competitive) was factorially crossed with his facial expression. During the game, participants’ eye fixations and cardiovascular responses, indexing task engagement and challenge/threat motivation, were recorded. Results indicated that participants playing confederates with incongruent facial expressions (e.g., cooperative strategy, angry face) exhibited a greater threat response, which arises due to increased uncertainty. Eye fixations also suggest that participants look at the face more in order to acquire information to reconcile their uncertainty in the incongruent condition. Taken together, these results suggest that context matters in the perception of emotion. Keywords: facial expressions, negotiation, context in emotion Introduction Negotiation is relatively common in personal and professional settings. A child might ask a parent whether she can leave the dinner table. The parent might sternly command the child to finish her vegetables and the child could make a counter offer to finish the peas but not the broccoli. This could ensue into a strategic and emotionally charged social interaction.

However, whether parasympathetic flexibility (vagal withdrawal to emotional or environmental challenges such as sadness, and vagal augmentation during recovery from sadness) could facilitate the effectiveness of adaptive affect regulation strategies is not known. In a study of 178 undergraduate students, we evaluated whether parasympathetic flexibility in response to a sad film involving loss would enhance the effectiveness of regulatory strategies (reappraisal, distraction, and suppression) spontaneously employed to reduce negative affect during a 2-min uninstructed recovery period following the induction. Parasympathetic reactivity and recovery were indexed by fluctuations in respiratory sinus arrhythmia and high-frequency heart rate variability. Cognitive reappraisal and distraction were more effective in attenuating negative affect among individuals with more parasympathetic flexibility, particularly greater vagal augmentation during recovery, relative to individuals with less parasympathetic flexibility. In contrast, suppression was associated with less attenuation of negative affect, but only among individuals who also had less vagal withdrawal during the sad film. Alternative models provided partial support for reversed directionality, with reappraisal predicting greater parasympathetic recovery, but only when individuals also experienced greater reductions in negative affect. These results suggest that contextually appropriate parasympathetic reactivity and recovery may facilitate the success of affect regulation. Impairments in parasympathetic flexibility could confer risk for affective disorders due to attenuated capacity for effective self-regulation.","[{'authorId': '4826701', 'name': 'J.

Postpartum depression (PPD) is considered a major public health problem that conveys risk to mothers and offspring. Yet PPD typically occurs in the context of a lifelong episodic illness, and its putative effects might derive from the child's exposure to other episodes, in pregnancy or later childhood. The aim of the study is to test two hypotheses: (1) that the effects of PPD on adolescent outcomes are partly explained by antepartum depression (APD) and (2) that the effects of APD and PPD are both explained by later exposure to the mother's depression.


METHOD
A random sample of 178 antenatal patients was drawn from two general medical practices in South London; 171 gave birth to live infants, and 150 (88%) were assessed at 3 months post partum, with 121 of their offspring (81%) assessed for emotional disorders (ED), disruptive behaviour disorders (DBD) and IQ, at 11 and 16 years of age.


RESULTS
When APD and subsequent episodes of depression were taken into account, PPD had a significant effect on adolescent IQ, especially for boys, but did not predict psychopathology. ED and DBD in adolescence were predicted by the extent of exposure to maternal depression after 3 months post partum; a significant effect of APD on ED in girls was accounted for by later exposure to the mother's illness. Mothers' symptoms of anxiety, smoking and alcohol use in pregnancy did not predict adolescent outcomes, once maternal depression was taken into account.


CONCLUSIONS
Some effects attributed to mothers' mental health problems in pregnancy or post partum may be mediated by cumulative exposure to maternal illness, probably reflecting genetic influence and gene-environment correlation. However, PPD has a direct effect on cognition. Clinicians should endeavour to identify women with depression in pregnancy (31% of this sample) and help them to manage their lifelong illness.","[{'authorId': '19070179', 'name': 'D.

The current meta-analysis aimed to provide a thorough, quantitative examination of the associations between PTS and several aspects of ER. A search of the PsychINFO database resulted in 2557 titles, of which 57 met full inclusion criteria (the cross-sectional association between PTS symptoms and ER was reported, participants were 18 years or older, the article was written in English, and sufficient information was reported to calculate effect sizes). From the 57 studies that were included, 74 effect sizes were obtained. All studies were independently coded by two of the study authors for the following: citation, sample type, total N size (and group n's if applicable), mean age of participants, type of traumatic event, study design, PTS measure(s), ER measure(s), and effect size information. Eight random effects models were conducted: seven for individual ER strategies (e.g., rumination) and one for general emotion dysregulation. The largest effects were observed for general emotion dysregulation (r = 0.53; k = 13), rumination (r = 0.51; k = 5), thought suppression (r = 0.47; k = 13), and experiential avoidance (r = 0.40; k = 20). Medium effects were observed for expressive suppression (r = 0.29; k = 3) and worry (r = 0.28; k = 6). Significant effects were not observed for acceptance or reappraisal. Moderator analyses (sample and trauma type) were conducted for general emotion dysregulation, experiential avoidance, and thought suppression; no significant differences were observed.

But which specific movement(s) should one use in order to enhance each emotion? This study aimed to identify, using Laban Movement Analysis (LMA), the Laban motor elements (motor characteristics) that characterize movements whose execution enhances each of the basic emotions: anger, fear, happiness, and sadness. LMA provides a system of symbols describing its motor elements, which gives a written instruction (motif) for the execution of a movement or movement-sequence over time. Six senior LMA experts analyzed a validated set of video clips showing whole body dynamic expressions of anger, fear, happiness and sadness, and identified the motor elements that were common to (appeared in) all clips expressing the same emotion. For each emotion, we created motifs of different combinations of the motor elements common to all clips of the same emotion. Eighty subjects from around the world read and moved those motifs, to identify the emotion evoked when moving each motif and to rate the intensity of the evoked emotion. All subjects together moved and rated 1241 motifs, which were produced from 29 different motor elements. Using logistic regression, we found a set of motor elements associated with each emotion which, when moved, predicted the feeling of that emotion. Each emotion was predicted by a unique set of motor elements and each motor element predicted only one emotion. Knowledge of which specific motor elements enhance specific emotions can enable emotional self-regulation through adding some desired motor qualities to one's personal everyday movements (rather than mimicking others' specific movements) and through decreasing motor behaviors which include elements that enhance negative emotions.","[{'authorId': '3424994', 'name': 'T.

Further research is needed, however, to better assess the breadth, interaction effects with effective intervention, and sustainability of SWPBS implementation and outcomes.

Coming from a clinical perspective, Aaron Beck (1967), a psychiatrist, had abandoned the psychoanalytic account of depression and had begun to develop a cognitive theory that emphasized the negative ""automatic thoughts"" that seemed to trigger depressive symptoms among his patients. At the same time, Martin Seligman (1975), an experimental psychologist, had begun to formulate his theory of learned helplessness and depression, based on laboratory research about the deleterious effects of uncontrollable, aversive events. Similar to Beck, Seligman emphasized that maladaptive cognitions such as pervasive expectancies of no control over events could precipitate depressive symptoms. These two cognitive theories ignited a veritable explosion o research on depression. Although it is difficult to reconstruct the forces that fueled cognitive approaches to depression, Dykman and Abramson (1990) listed a few whose impact appears likely. First, th rise of information-processing approaches in general (e.g., Neisser, 1967) and the study o social cognition in particular (e.g., Nisbett & Ross, 1980) provided a basic science foundation for a cognitive approach to depression.

In particular, peer interaction, especially with more advanced peers, can enhance preschool children's language growth. In this paper, we explore one factor that may modulate children's language learning with a peer-like social robot: rapport. We explore connections between preschool children's learning, rapport, and emulation of the robot's language during a storytelling intervention. We performed a long-term field study in a preschool with 17 children aged 4–6 years. Children played a storytelling game with a social robot for 8 sessions over two months. For some children, the robot matched the level of its stories to the children's language ability, acting as a slightly more advanced peer (Matched condition); for the others, the robot did not match the story level (Unmatched condition). We examined children's use of target vocabulary words and key phrases used by the robot, children's emulation of the robot's stories during their own storytelling, and children's language style matching (LSM—a measure of overlap in function word use and speaking style associated with rapport and relationship) to see whether they mirrored the robot more over time. We found that not only did children emulate the robot more over time, but also, children who emulated more of the robot's phrases during storytelling scored higher on the vocabulary posttest. Children with higher LSM scores were more likely to emulate the robot's content words in their stories. Furthermore, the robot's personalization in the Matched condition led to increases in both children's emulation and their LSM scores. Together, these results suggest first, that interacting with a more advanced peer is beneficial for children, and second, that children's emulation of the robot's language may be related to their rapport and their learning. This is the first study to empirically support that rapport may be a modulating factor in children's peer learning, and furthermore, that a social robot can serve as an effective intervention for language development by leveraging this insight.","[{'authorId': '2716110', 'name': 'J.

When social work students are mindful in the classroom, meaning they are present without internal or external filters, they are better able to regulate emotions and are more open to diverse perspectives. Teaching social work students to become mindful can improve self-care and is also the first step toward developing empathy. As such, mindful practice can help enhance practice skills, especially those related to tuning in to clients. This paper describes the elements of a mindful classroom, introduces a framework for teaching mindful practice, and presents the results of a research study that examined learning outcomes associated with this framework. Graduate students participated in a 16-week course that focused on enhancing self-care and professional development via the use of formal and informal mindful practice strategies. The Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Scale was administered before and after the course to assess changes in students' use of mindfulness skills. Four skill areas were tested: acting with awareness, observing, accepting without judgment, and describing; results indicate that students significantly increased their use of mindfulness in the first three areas.","[{'authorId': '118359581', 'name': 'Maria Napoli'}, {'authorId': '4622327', 'name': 'R.

Specifically, we propose that observers’ treatment of target men based on the targets’ fWHR subsequently affects behavior, leading the targets to behave in ways that are consistent with the observers’ expectations (i.e., a self-fulfilling prophecy). Results from four studies demonstrate that individuals behave more selfishly when interacting with men with greater fWHRs, and this selfish behavior, in turn, elicits selfish behavior in others.","[{'authorId': '1957890', 'name': 'Michael P.

Using LEGO Mindstorms EV3, a robot was built and programmed to teach the basic concept of place value in mathematics. Eight children with ASD, specifically, four females and four males, participated in the single case study, and six special education teachers took part in the interviews. The children participated in both traditional and robotic intervention lessons and were assessed at the end of each session. The results indicate a positive increase in content knowledge and an improved disposition toward learning, thus demonstrating the potential utilization of robots as AT tools for harnessing classroom learning. Data from the interviews with teachers highlighted four valuable learning experiences that occurred in the classrooms as a result of the robotic interventions; namely, with respect to young children with ASD, the AT (1) promoted interest and engagement, (2) increased attention and focus, (3) triggered interactions and communication, and (4) created a happy and fun learning environment.","[{'authorId': '2157312', 'name': 'N.

Moreover, we hypothesized that the distinction between lack of pleasurable engagement and painful disconnection would emerge in confirmatory factor analyses, in the pattern of relations of each facet to social impairment, in differential risk for the development of depressive disorders, and in differential rates of recovery from depressive disorders. Data from the Oregon Adolescent Depression Project were used to address these issues. Adolescents from high schools in urban and rural Oregon completed interviews and questionnaires on psychiatric status, loneliness, social functioning, and so forth, at one point in time and then again at a second session approximately a year later. Consistent with predictions, we found that the proposed bidimensional structure of loneliness represented a good fit to the covariance structure of loneliness items; the relation of lack of pleasurable engagement to social impairment exceeded that between painful disconnection and social impairment; and lack of pleasurable engagement, but not painful disconnection, was significantly related (in the expected directions) to onset of and recovery from depressive disorders.

Here, we show that human participants spontaneously match facial expressions of an android physically present in the room with them. This mimicry occurs even though these participants find the android unsettling and are fully aware that it lacks intentionality. Interestingly, a video of that same android elicits weaker mimicry reactions, occurring only in participants who find the android “humanlike.” These findings suggest that spontaneous mimicry depends on the salience of humanlike features highlighted by face-to-face contact, emphasizing the role of presence in human-robot interaction. Further, the findings suggest that mimicry of androids can dissociate from knowledge of artificiality and experienced emotional unease. These findings have implications for theoretical debates about the mechanisms of imitation.

Secondly, our model is optimised using a novel Non-uniform Regularised Landmark Mean-Shift optimisation technique, which takes into account the reliabilities of each patch expert.

365b760165172be6193baf9bca1c9366b1de5329,"Patients with dementia as co-morbidity find hospital stays challenging, because the focus is primarily on the somatic cause for the admission, with less emphasis on the needs pertaining to dementia-related support and care. This results in poorer holistic outcomes, compared to patients without dementia, and an increased cost for the healthcare sector and, society as a whole. The quest is to make hospitals a dementia-friendly context, because this is likely to lead to better patient outcomes for people with dementia generally; however, further research is required to understand where gains may be made in this regard. This study conducted participant observation research strategies to follow patient journeys with Alzheimer’s disease admitted to orthopaedic wards, to learn about their experiences as patients. Longitudinal data were gathered by following patients on both day and evening shifts within a specialist orthopaedic hospital ward, commencing at patient admission and concluding at time of discharge. The data were interpreted from a phenomenological-hermeneutic perspective, inspired by Ricoeur’s interpretation theory. The study revealed a communication style among nurses who failed to take into account the comprehensive needs of patients with dementia, in terms of timely information exchange and clinical relevance. Patients expressed the desire to be more fully engaged in the care decision-making, together with indicating their appreciation of the work of the health professionals who cared for them. The data revealed that the process of getting to know the patient at the beginning of every shift left little room to alleviate patients’ experienced distress, caused by being in hospital. This resulted in patients who were less involved in the caring situation, or, if a patient took the initiative to act, intentions ended up being misinterpreted as disruptive behaviour. The findings have relevance for staff and ward management who are interested to strive to enhance the patient journey as a dementia-friendly hospital.","[{'authorId': '31440641', 'name': 'A. M.

Previous studies have suggested that consumers might perceive the fronts of cars similarly to how they perceive human faces, but how consumers respond on an affective level to evolutionarily significant features when they are part of artifacts such as product designs has not been thoroughly studied. Therefore, we studied affective responses to features of an important stimulus that is known to elicit affect and approach behavior: the baby schema. We tested whether the affective responses to this stimulus were generalized to product designs, and how stable these generalized responses were over repeated exposures. We manipulated car fronts - and faces as controls - in accordance with the baby schema (e.g., by enlarging the headlights/eyes). Combining facial electromyography with cuteness ratings to assess innate affective responses, we found that our participants (n = 57) showed more positive affective responses to the babyfaced car fronts than to the original stimuli, and that the effect of the baby-schema features on positive affect was stable over two repeated exposures, thus did not show effects of fast habituation. These results confirm that consumers' affective responses to visual product designs are affected by evolutionarily-implemented features.","[{'authorId': '3045849', 'name': 'Linda Miesler'}, {'authorId': '145845293', 'name': 'H.

This will generate interactions between humans and robots that may have positive or negative effects on the users. In order to minimize the negative effects and increase robot persuasiveness, robots should behave in an appropriate manner by adapting to their users. How to achieve this adaptation remains a challenge. We propose the usage of the Regulatory Focus Theory, user physiological state, and game-performance information in order to detect user stress and adapt the behavior of the robot. We present a longitudinal experiment conducted with 35 participants in a game-like scenario. The robot was trained for adapting to the regulatory focus of the users and decreasing their stress while they were playing the game. For this reason, we trained the robot with 12 participants with Chronic Promotion State and with 12 participants with Chronic Prevention State. We used a Q-Learning algorithm based on the Regulatory Focus of the participants, user stress, and task performance. The model obtained was tested with 2 groups (6 and 5 participants, respectively) according to their Chronic Regulatory Focus. Results show that our system was able to generate a robot behavior capable of increasing robot persuasiveness and reducing user stress, which is of great importance for social robots.","[{'authorId': '1405177298', 'name': 'Arturo Cruz-Maya'}, {'authorId': '1738469', 'name': 'A.

DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Sociofile for English-language articles published from 1980 through March 2004, conducted hand searches of bibliographies, and consulted with experts. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: We included cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control studies from developed countries that assessed women for depression during pregnancy or the first year postpartum with a structured clinical interview. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Of the 109 articles reviewed, 28 met our inclusion criteria. For major and minor depression (major depression alone), the combined point prevalence estimates from meta-analyses ranged from 6.5% to 12.9% (1.0-5.6%) at different trimesters of pregnancy and months in the first postpartum year. The combined period prevalence shows that as many as 19.2% (7.1%) of women have a depressive episode (major depressive episode) during the first 3 months postpartum; most of these episodes have onset following delivery. All estimates have wide 95% confidence intervals, showing significant uncertainty in their true levels. No conclusions could be made regarding the relative incidence of depression among pregnant and postpartum women compared with women at nonchildbearing times.

Unfortunately, a survey of contemporary uses revealed that the vocabulary of lighting expression in popular use today is small, fairly unimaginative, and generally ambiguous in meaning. In this paper, we work through a structured design process that points the way towards a much richer set of expressive forms and more effective communication for this very simple medium. In this process, we make use of five different data gathering and evaluation components to leverage the knowledge, opinions and expertise of people outside our team. Our work starts by considering what information is typically conveyed in this medium. We go on to consider potential expressive forms -- how information might be conveyed. We iteratively refine and expand these sets, concluding with ideas gathered from a panel of designers. Our final step was to make use of thousands of human judgments, gathered in a crowd-sourced fashion (265 participants), to measure the suitability of different expressive forms for conveying different information content. This results in a set of recommended light behaviors that mobile devices, such as smartphones, could readily employ.","[{'authorId': '145078227', 'name': 'Chris Harrison'}, {'authorId': '113428003', 'name': 'Johannes Horstman'}, {'authorId': '1786841', 'name': 'Gary Hsieh'}, {'authorId': '1749296', 'name': 'S.

For this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, 16 married women were subjected to the threat of electric shock while holding their husband's hand, the hand of an anonymous male experimenter, or no hand at all. Results indicated a pervasive attenuation of activation in the neural systems supporting emotional and behavioral threat responses when the women held their husband's hand. A more limited attenuation of activation in these systems occurred when they held the hand of a stranger. Most strikingly, the effects of spousal hand-holding on neural threat responses varied as a function of marital quality, with higher marital quality predicting less threat-related neural activation in the right anterior insula, superior frontal gyrus, and hypothalamus during spousal, but not stranger, hand-holding.","[{'authorId': '2461693', 'name': 'J.

This study proposes an emotion recognition system for a humanoid robot. The robot is equipped with a camera to capture users’ facial images, and it uses this system to recognize users’ emotions and responds appropriately. The emotion recognition system, based on a deep neural network, learns six basic emotions: happiness, anger, disgust, fear, sadness, and surprise. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract visual features by learning on a large number of static images. Second, a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is used to determine the relationship between the transformation of facial expressions in image sequences and the six basic emotions. Third, CNN and LSTM are combined to exploit their advantages in the proposed model. Finally, the performance of the emotion recognition system is improved by using transfer learning, that is, by transferring knowledge of related but different problems. The performance of the proposed system is verified through leave-one-out cross-validation and compared with that of other models. The system is applied to a humanoid robot to demonstrate its practicability for improving the HRI.","[{'authorId': '35038273', 'name': 'Tzuu-Hseng S.

38ad6079803832ec00ccd79c5704672a05fb775b,"Robots interacting with humans in public spaces often need to collect users’ private information in order to provide the required services. Current privacy legislation in major jurisdictions requires organisations to disclose information about their data collection process and obtain user’s consent prior to collecting privacy sensitive information. In this study, we consider a privacy-sensitive design of a data collection system for face identification. We deployed a face enrolment system on a humanoid robot with human-like gesturing and speech. We compared it with an equivalent system, in terms of capability and interactive process, on a screen-based interactive kiosk. In our previous contribution, we investigated the effects that embodiment has on users’ privacy considerations. We found that an embodied humanoid robot is capable of collecting more private information from users in comparison to a disembodied interactive kiosk. However, this effect was statistically significant only when the two compared systems were using a transparent interface, i.e. an interface communicating to users the privacy policies for data processing and storage. Thus, in this work, we aim to further investigate the effects of transparency on users’ privacy considerations and their experience with robot applications. We found that when comparing a non-transparent vs. transparent interface within the same system (i.e. on an embodied robot or on a disembodied kiosk) transparency does not lead to significant effects on users’ privacy considerations. However, we found that transparency leads to a significantly better user experience for both systems. Therefore, our overall analyses suggest that both the interactive robot and the interactive kiosk are capable of enhancing the user experience by providing transparent information to users, which is required by privacy legislation. However, an interactive kiosk providing transparent information elicits significantly more privacy concerns in users as compared to the robot supplying the very same transparent information. This exploratory study provides conclusions that provide valuable insights for designing robot applications dealing with users privacy and it discusses the related legal implications, concluding with recommendations for privacy policymakers.","[{'authorId': '50407019', 'name': 'Jonathan Vitale'}, {'authorId': '28950433', 'name': 'Meg Tonkin'}, {'authorId': '36177753', 'name': 'S.

If and how these findings relate to human-robot interaction (HRI) is not well understood, even though such knowledge is crucial when pursuing long-term interactions. In our work, we investigate the persistence of first impressions by asking 49 participants to play a geography game with a robot. We measure how their perception of the robot changes over three sessions with three to ten days of zero exposure in between. Our results show that different perceptual dimensions stabilize within different time frames, with the robot’s competence being the fastest to stabilize and perceived threat the most fluctuating over time. We also found evidence that perceptual differences between robots with varying levels of humanlikeness persist across repeated interactions. This study has important implications for HRI design as it sheds new light on the influence of robots’ embodiment and interaction abilities. Moreover, it also impacts HRI theory as it presents novel findings contributing to research on the uncanny valley and robot perception in general.

This study explored the relationship between adolescents' emotional intelligence and the tendency to develop an eating disorder.


METHODS
Senior high school students in Taiwan were recruited for the study. A 3- part anonymous questionnaire measured demographic information, body weight satisfaction, and expectation of body weight. Students also completed the Adolescent Emotional Intelligence Scale and the Eating Disorders Attitude- 26 Test (EAT-26). Height and weight were also measured.


RESULTS
The mean of EAT-26 score was 8.66 ± 7.36, and 8.6% students were at high risk to develop eating disorders. Gender, body weight, body dissatisfaction and the expected body shape were significantly related to disturbed eating attitudes and behaviours. Scores of EAT-26 were positively correlated with emotional perception, emotional expression, and emotional application.


CONCLUSIONS
Disturbed eating behaviours exist among adolescents in Taiwan, and these behaviours may be related to emotional intelligence. However further studies with larger samples are needed.","[{'authorId': '33028922', 'name': 'Y.

However, objects are sentiment neutral which hinders the expected gain of transfer learning for such tasks. In this work, we propose to overcome this problem by learning a novel sentiment-aligned image embedding that is better suited for subsequent visual sentiment analysis. Our embedding leverages the intricate relation between emojis and images in large-scale and readily available data from social media. Emojis are language-agnostic, consistent, and carry a clear sentiment signal which make them an excellent proxy to learn a sentiment aligned embedding. Hence, we construct a novel dataset of 4 million images collected from Twitter with their associated emojis. We train a deep neural model for image embedding using emoji prediction task as a proxy. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed embedding outperforms the popular object-based counterpart consistently across several sentiment analysis benchmarks. Furthermore, without bell and whistles, our compact, effective and simple embedding outperforms the more elaborate and customized state-of-the-art deep models on these public benchmarks. Additionally, we introduce a novel emoji representation based on their visual emotional response which support a deeper understanding of the emoji modality and their usage on social media.","[{'authorId': '1390024605', 'name': 'Ziad Al-Halah'}, {'authorId': '49931957', 'name': 'Andrew P.

We present the process of content creation and co‐design of LEGO therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders performed by a humanoid robot. The co‐creation takes place across the disciplines of autism therapy, and behavioural robotics, and applies methods from design and human–robot interaction, in order to connect state‐of‐the‐art developments in these disciplines. We designed, carried out and analyzed a pilot and final experiment, in which a robot mediated LEGO therapy between pairs of children was mediated by a robot over the course of 10 to 12 sessions. The impact of the training on the children was then analysed from a clinical and human–robot interaction perspective. Our major findings are as follows: first, game‐based robot scenarios in which the game continues over the sessions opened possibilities for long‐term interventions using robots and led to a significant increase in social initiations during the intervention in natural settings; and second, including dyadic interactions between robot and child within triadic games with robots has positive effects on the children's engagement and on creating learning moments that comply with the chosen therapy framework.","[{'authorId': '145741020', 'name': 'E.

Residents of countries characterized by high ancestral diversity display emotion expressions that are easier to decode by observers, endorse norms of higher emotion expressivity, and smile more in response to certain stimuli than residents of countries that lack ancestral diversity. We build on the extant findings and investigate historical heterogeneity as a predictor of daily smiling, laughter, and positive emotion across the world’s countries and the states of the United States. Study 1 finds that historical heterogeneity is positively associated with self-reports of smiling, laughter, and positive emotions in the Gallup World Poll when controlling for GDP and current present-day population diversity. Study 2 extends the findings to effects of long-history migration within the United States. We estimated the average percentage of foreign-born citizens in each state between 1850 and 2010 based on US Census information as an indicator of historical heterogeneity. Consistent with the world findings of Study 1, historical heterogeneity predicted smiling, laughter, and positive, but not negative, emotion. The relationships remained significant when controlling for per capita income and present-day diversity of population of each state. Together, the findings further demonstrate the important role of long-history migration in shaping emotion cultures of countries and states, which persist beyond the original socio-ecological conditions, and open promising avenues for cross-cultural research.","[{'authorId': '1986858', 'name': 'P.

In this work, two existing approaches to quantification of Laban Effort components (Weight, Time, Space, and Flow) based on measurable movement features (position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk) are adapted for hand and arm movements, and a new approach for quantifying Shape Directional based on the average trajectory curvature is proposed.

Prior studies have focused mainly on typicality’s influence on attractiveness, although recent studies have cast doubt on its importance for attractiveness judgments. Here, we argue that face typicality is an important factor for social perception because it affects trustworthiness judgments, which approximate the basic evaluation of faces. This effect has been overlooked because trustworthiness and attractiveness judgments have a high level of shared variance for most face samples. We show that for a continuum of faces that vary on a typicality-attractiveness dimension, trustworthiness judgments peak around the typical face. In contrast, perceived attractiveness increases monotonically past the typical face, as faces become more like the most attractive face. These findings suggest that face typicality is an important determinant of face evaluation.","[{'authorId': '52578663', 'name': 'Carmel Sofer'}, {'authorId': '2365875', 'name': 'R.

Design: Prospective observational study with follow up of 21 years and repeat screening of half the cohort 5 years from baseline. Measures included perceived psychological stress, coronary risk factors, self reported angina, and ischaemia detected by electrocardiography. Setting: 27 workplaces in Scotland. Participants: 5606 men (mean age 48 years) at first screening and 2623 men at second screening with complete data on all measures Main outcome measures: Prevalence of angina and ischaemia at baseline, odds ratio for incident angina and ischaemia at second screening, rate ratios for cause specific hospital admission, and hazard ratios for cause specific mortality. Results: Both prevalence and incidence of angina increased with increasing perceived stress (fully adjusted odds ratio for incident angina, high versus low stress 2.66, 95% confidence interval 1.61 to 4.41; P for trend <0.001). Prevalence and incidence of ischaemia showed weak trends in the opposite direction. High stress was associated with a higher rate of admissions to hospital generally and for admissions related to cardiovascular disease and psychiatric disorders (fully adjusted rate ratios for any general hospital admission 1.13, 1.01 to 1.27, cardiovascular disease 1.20, 1.00 to 1.45, and psychiatric disorders 2.34, 1.41 to 3.91). High stress was not associated with increased admission for coronary heart disease (1.00, 0.76-1.32) and showed an inverse relation with all cause mortality, mortality from cardiovascular disease, and mortality from coronary heart disease, that was attenuated by adjustment for occupational class (fully adjusted hazard ratio for all cause mortality 0.94, 0.81 to 1.11, cardiovascular mortality 0.91, 0.78 to 1.06, and mortality from coronary heart disease 0.98, 0.75 to 1.27). Conclusions: The relation between higher stress, angina, and some categories of hospital admissions probably resulted from the tendency of participants reporting higher stress to also report more symptoms. The lack of a corresponding relation with objective indices of heart disease suggests that these symptoms did not reflect physical disease. The data suggest that associations between psychosocial measures and disease outcomes reported from some other studies may be spurious. What is already known on this topic Higher psychological stress has predicted coronary heart disease in several observational studies Exposure to stress and heart disease outcomes were often based on self report so that a general tendency to negative perceptions may have generated a spurious association between higher perceived stress and heart disease symptoms What this study adds Perceived stress was strongly related to subjective symptoms of heart disease, including those leading to hospital admission However, stress showed a weakly inverse relation to all objective indices of heart disease: socially advantaged men perceived themselves to be most stressed, and the “protective” effect of stress was probably attributable to residual confounding Suggestions that psychological stress is an important determinant of heart disease may be premature","[{'authorId': '145727796', 'name': 'J.

A factor analysis (N = 388), using a validated criterion for assessing the number of factors to be extracted, confirmed that the UMACL measures dimensions of energetic arousal, tense arousal and hedonic tone. Psychometric properties of UMACL scales were satisfactory. Discriminant validity was established by showing that correlations between UMACL scales and demographic and personality variables were small in magnitude, though of theoretical importance. Significant correlations between the arousal scales and psychophysiological measures of autonomic arousal demonstrate concurrent validity. A series of studies shows that the UMACL scales are sensitive to external ‘stressors’. Specific influences on each of the three principal scales have been found. Certain stressors appear to evoke a more general stress syndrome associated with reduced energetic arousal and hedonic tone, and increased tense arousal.","[{'authorId': '144727303', 'name': 'G.

Although many AC researchers have traditionally attempted to remain agnostic to the different emotion theories proposed by psychologists, the affective technologies being developed are rife with theoretical assumptions that impact their effectiveness. Hence, an informed and integrated examination of emotion theories from multiple areas will need to become part of computing practice if truly effective real-world systems are to be achieved. This survey discusses theoretical perspectives that view emotions as expressions, embodiments, outcomes of cognitive appraisal, social constructs, products of neural circuitry, and psychological interpretations of basic feelings. It provides meta-analyses on existing reviews of affect detection systems that focus on traditional affect detection modalities like physiology, face, and voice, and also reviews emerging research on more novel channels such as text, body language, and complex multimodal systems. This survey explicitly explores the multidisciplinary foundation that underlies all AC applications by describing how AC researchers have incorporated psychological theories of emotion and how these theories affect research questions, methods, results, and their interpretations. In this way, models and methods can be compared, and emerging insights from various disciplines can be more expertly integrated.","[{'authorId': '144792845', 'name': 'R.

Structural equation modeling was used to test a social causation model (deficits in social support increase the likelihood of depression), interpersonal theories of depression (depression leads to social erosion), and a reciprocal influence model. Depression influenced peer support significantly and negatively. By contrast, the social causation model was not supported. These results held for males and females.

A computer-based game (Cyberball) has been used to explore the effects of social exclusion in adolescents and adults. The current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study used Cyberball to extend prior work to the cross-sectional study of younger children and adolescents (7 to 17 years), identifying age-related changes in the neural correlates of social exclusion across the important transition from middle childhood into adolescence. Additionally, a control task illustrated the specificity of these age-related changes for social exclusion as distinct from expectancy violation more generally. During exclusion, activation in and functional connectivity between ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and ventral anterior cingulate cortex increased with age. These effects were specific to social exclusion and did not exist for expectancy violation. Our results illustrate developmental changes from middle childhood through adolescence in both affective and regulatory brain regions during social exclusion.","[{'authorId': '2341214', 'name': 'Danielle Z.

We report a quantitative meta-analysis of 212 studies (N = 80,850 participants) that measured the associations between coping and emotion regulation with symptoms of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Within the meta-analysis we address the association of broad domains of coping and emotion regulation (e.g., total coping, emotion regulation), intermediate factors of coping and emotion regulation (e.g., primary control coping, secondary control coping), and specific coping and emotion regulation strategies (e.g., emotional expression, cognitive reappraisal) with internalizing and externalizing symptoms. For cross-sectional studies, which made up the majority of studies included, we examine 3 potential moderators: age, measure quality, and single versus multiple informants. Finally, we separately consider findings from longitudinal studies as these provide stronger tests of the effects. After accounting for publication bias, findings indicate that the broad domain of emotion regulation and adaptive coping and the factors of primary control coping and secondary control coping are related to lower levels of symptoms of psychopathology. Further, the domain of maladaptive coping, the factor of disengagement coping, and the strategies of emotional suppression, avoidance, and denial are related to higher levels of symptoms of psychopathology. Finally, we offer a critique of the current state of the field and outline an agenda for future research.","[{'authorId': '6442334', 'name': 'B. Compas'}, {'authorId': '5286318', 'name': 'S.

3d15bf7bca1992ac0e97736b77727fb08ee613e2,"The perception of gaze plays a crucial role in human-human interaction. Gaze has been shown to matter for a number of aspects of communication and dialogue, especially for managing the flow of the dialogue and participant attention, for deictic referencing, and for the communication of attitude. When developing embodied conversational agents (ECAs) and talking heads, modeling and delivering accurate gaze targets is crucial. Traditionally, systems communicating through talking heads have been displayed to the human conversant using 2D displays, such as flat monitors. This approach introduces severe limitations for an accurate communication of gaze since 2D displays are associated with several powerful effects and illusions, most importantly the Mona Lisa gaze effect, where the gaze of the projected head appears to follow the observer regardless of viewing angle. We describe the Mona Lisa gaze effect and its consequences in the interaction loop, and propose a new approach for displaying talking heads using a 3D projection surface (a physical model of a human head) as an alternative to the traditional flat surface projection. We investigate and compare the accuracy of the perception of gaze direction and the Mona Lisa gaze effect in 2D and 3D projection surfaces in a five subject gaze perception experiment. The experiment confirms that a 3D projection surface completely eliminates the Mona Lisa gaze effect and delivers very accurate gaze direction that is independent of the observer's viewing angle. Based on the data collected in this experiment, we rephrase the formulation of the Mona Lisa gaze effect. The data, when reinterpreted, confirms the predictions of the new model for both 2D and 3D projection surfaces. Finally, we discuss the requirements on different spatially interactive systems in terms of gaze direction, and propose new applications and experiments for interaction in a human-ECA and a human-robot settings made possible by this technology.","[{'authorId': '32201536', 'name': 'S.

One was fostered by Adam Smith and is carried forward today by neoclassical economists and rational-choice theorists in political science. It views humans as “economic men,” that is, as motivated by egoistic material concerns. The other tradition has its roots in the work of the French sociologist Emile Durkheim, provides the basis for much contemporary sociology and has adherents among political scientists, particularly political culture theorists such as Eckstein (1988). It views humans as social creatures, having duty-based and other obligations to their fellows. “Sociological man’s” activity is thus constrained by shared social (cultural) norms. Elster is skeptical that these cultural norms generally realize individual self-interest as this is understood in the rational-choice tradition. Indeed, elsewhere he distinguishes “economic man” rationality and “nonra-tional” cultural norms even more sharply than he does in this chapter (Elster 1989b). Overall, Elster holds that, for the most part, cultural norms neither arise from rationality, as neoclassical economists understand it, nor do they serve it.","[{'authorId': '2529014', 'name': 'J.

Views of self-regulated learning that do not include this core self-referential system have difficulty explaining human failures to self-regulate, especially when such efforts are known metacognitively to be helpful. To explain students' self-regulation failures as well as their successes in naturalistic settings, educational psychologists need to expand their views of self-regulation beyond metacognitive trait, ability, or stage formulations and begin treating it as a complex interactive process involving social, motivational, and behavioral components.

Research from social psychology indicates that people interact differently with individuals than with groups. We therefore hypothesize that group effects might similarly occur when people face multiple robots. Further, group effects might vary for robots of different types. In this exploratory study, we used videos to expose participants in a between-subjects experiment to robots varying in Number (Single or Group) and Type (anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, or mechanomorphic). We then measured participants’ general attitudes, emotions, and stereotypes toward robots with a combination of measures from HRI (e.g., Godspeed Questionnaire, NARS) and social psychology (e.g., Big Five, Social Threat, Emotions). Results suggest that Number and Type of observed robots had an interaction effect on responses toward robots in general, leading to more positive responses for groups for some robot types, but more negative responses for others.

Many aspects can make any particular interoceptive sensation unique and distinct from any other interoceptive sensation. This can range from the sense of agency, to the physical cause of a sensation, the ontogenetic origin, the efferent innervation, and afferent pathways of the tissue involved amongst others. In its overarching meaning, interoception primarily is a product of the central nervous system, a construct based on an integration of various sources, not per se including afferent information.

Under high levels of perceived anxiety, both accuracy and directional bias were generally low, independent of the dyad type. In contrast, when perceived anxiety was relatively low, Whites and minorities in cross-race dyads and Whites in same-race dyads showed a positive directional bias in their evaluations; Whites in cross-race relationships also achieved tracking accuracy.

We find that a variety of factors influence parental expectations, of which parents’ assessment of their children’s academic performance is the strongest. Factors known to impact upon actual higher education participation, such as parental education and remoteness, are already evident in parental expectations, but with limited evidence of expectations being shaped by financial constraints. We also find evidence of a ‘same gender’ effect, with mothers exhibiting higher expectations for higher education for their daughters. This may be in part due to significantly lower expectations held by fathers with sub-bachelor qualifications. These factors contribute to higher expectations overall for girls entering university. The research points to the importance of interventions commencing in early childhood, and accounting for key household background characteristics when designing, implementing and evaluating programmes for widening participation in higher education.","[{'authorId': '98125552', 'name': 'Paul Koshy'}, {'authorId': '9649312', 'name': 'A.

To compare the effects of two pediatric venipuncture distress-management distraction strategies that differed in the degree to which they required children's interaction.


METHODS
Eighty-eight 1- to 7-year-old children receiving venipuncture were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions: interactive toy distraction, passive movie distraction, or standard care. Distress was examined via parent, nurse, self-report (children over 4 years), and observational coding. Engagement in distraction was assessed via observational coding.


RESULTS
Children in the passive condition were more distracted and less distressed than children in the interactive condition. Although children in the interactive condition were more distracted than standard care children, there were no differences in distress between these groups.


CONCLUSIONS
Despite literature that suggests that interactive distraction should lower distress more than passive distraction, results indicate that a passive strategy might be most effective for children's venipuncture. It is possible that children's distress interfered with their ability to interact with the distractor.","[{'authorId': '6963983', 'name': 'J. Maclaren'}, {'authorId': '3663280', 'name': 'L.

In this regard, it is important that robots’ behavioural skills are developed and researched so that people have appropriate and comfortable interactions. Smiling and use of first name are two more important social communication skills used during human interactions. While smiling and use of first name are often employed by robots in human interactions, the effect of these behaviours on perceptions of receptionist robots has not yet been experimentally investigated. This study explored the effects of robot smiling and robot use of the participant’s first name on perceptions of robot friendliness, mind, and personality, as well as attitudes and smiling behaviour. Forty participants interacted with a medical receptionist robot four times, in a two by two repeated measures design. Both smiling and use of first name had significant positive effects on participants’ perceptions of robot personality. Robot smiling also showed significant effects on participants’ overall attitudes towards robots, ratings of robot friendliness, and perceptions of the robot’s mind, and increased the frequency of participants’ own smiling. There were no significant interaction effects. Robot smiling in particular can enhance user perceptions of robots and increase reciprocal smiling.","[{'authorId': '22779942', 'name': 'D.

Older children were faster and more accurate than younger children, with most of the improvement occurring by the age of 6. All children tested demonstrated understanding of the instructions during the pretest, and most started out performing well, but younger subjects could not sustain this. Over the 16 trials, percentage of correct responses decreased, especially among younger subjects. Performance here was compared with performance on the day-night Stroop-like task. The most common error on both tasks was to comply with only one of the two rules. Other errors included tapping many times regardless of what the experimenter did and doing the same thing as the experimenter, rather than the opposite. It is suggested that the tapping task requires both the ability to hold two rules in mind and the ability to inhibit a strong response tendency, that these abilities improve between 3-6 years of age, and that this improvement may reflect important changes within frontal cortex during this period of life.","[{'authorId': '31934380', 'name': 'A.

To develop a comprehensive model of nursing turnover intention by examining the effects of job demands, job resources, personal demands and personal resources on burnout and work engagement and subsequently on the intention to leave the organization and profession.


BACKGROUND
The ageing population and a growing prevalence of multimorbidity are placing increasing strain on an ageing nursing workforce. Solutions that address the anticipated nursing shortage should focus on reducing burnout and enhancing the engagement of Registered Nurses (RNs) to improve retention.


DESIGN
A cross-sectional survey design.


METHOD
Data were collected in 2014-2015 via an e-survey from 2,876 RNs working in New Zealand. Data were analysed with structural equation modelling.


RESULTS
Higher engagement results in lower intention to leave the organization and profession. Burnout has significant effects on intentions to leave through lower engagement. While most of the demands and resources' variables (except professional development) have effects on intentions to leave, greater workload and greater work-life interference result in higher burnout and are the strongest predictors of intentions to leave. Greater emotional demands (challenges) and greater self-efficacy also have strong effects in lowering intentions to leave through higher engagement.


CONCLUSIONS
Employee burnout and work engagement play an important role in transmitting the impacts of job demands, job resources, personal demands and personal resources into RN intention to leave the organization and profession. Work-life interference and high workloads are major threats to nursing retention while challenge demands and higher levels of self-efficacy support better retention.","[{'authorId': '46968265', 'name': 'Willoughby Moloney'}, {'authorId': '144642451', 'name': 'P.

Participants were 1,153 infants and their mothers at the 10 sites of the NICHD Study of Early Child Care. Mother were interviewed, given questionnairies, and observed in play and in the home when their infants were from 1 to 15 months of age; infants were observed in child care at 6 and 15 months and in the Strange Situation at 15 months. Infants with extensive Child Care experience did not differ from infants without child-care in the distress they exhibited during separations from mother in the Strange situation or in the confidence with which trained coders assigned them attachment classifications. There were no significant main effects of Child Care experience (quality, amount, age of entry, stability, or type of care) on attachment security or avoidance. There were, however, significant man effects of maternal sensitivity and responsiveness. Significant interaction effects revealed that infants were less likely to be secure when low maternal sensitivity/responsiveness was combined with poor quality child care, more than minimal amounts of child care, or more than one care arrangement. In addition, boys experiencing many hours in care and girls in minimal amounts of care were somewhat less likely to be securely attachment.","[{'authorId': '66177736', 'name': 'Nichd Eccrn'}, {'authorId': '66658820', 'name': 'Bonnie Knoke'}]",512.0,,37.0,The Effects of Infant Child Care on Infant-Mother Attachment Security: Results of the NICHD Study of Early Child Care NICHD Early Child Care Research Network.,1997.0

However, the emotional bonds between humans and SR can raise an SR accessing/inferring profoundly private information, e.g., emotional states. Therefore, in what concerns privacy, SR may be a liability. Clarifying the ownership of data collected by robots is an issue of concern in the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires ’privacy-by-design’. The paper presents BlockRobot – a Blockchain (BC)-based software design model for developing privacy-by-design application in Human-Robot Interactions (HRI). Based on this design model, users can access the private data generated in their HRI. This paper’s contributions are the design and validation of a model to develop privacy-by-design applications for HRI. This model integrates BC technology with robots to audit robotic events such as Red, Green, Blue, Depth (RGB-D) images, and RFID tags. Smart contracts and crypto-wallets accomplish identity management.

Participants judged the un/happiness or un/trustworthiness of people with dynamic expressions in which the eyes and/or the mouth unfolded from neutral to happy or vice versa. Faces with an unfolding smile looked more trustworthy and happier than faces with a neutral mouth, regardless of the eye expression. Unfolding happy eyes increased both trustworthiness and happiness only in the presence of a congruent unfolding smiling mouth. Nevertheless, the contribution of the mouth was greater for happiness than for trustworthiness; and the mouth was especially visually salient for expressions favouring happiness more than trustworthiness. We conclude that the categorisation of facial happiness is more automatically driven by the visual saliency of a single feature, that is, the smiling mouth, while perception of trustworthiness is more strategic, with the eyes being necessarily incorporated into a configural face representation.","[{'authorId': '144866673', 'name': 'M.

The purpose of such a revision is to recognize that some seizure types can have either a focal or generalized onset, to allow classification when the onset is unobserved, to include some missing seizure types, and to adopt more transparent names. Because current knowledge is insufficient to form a scientifically based classification, the 2017 Classification is operational (practical) and based on the 1981 Classification, extended in 2010. Changes include the following: (1) “partial” becomes “focal”; (2) awareness is used as a classifier of focal seizures; (3) the terms dyscognitive, simple partial, complex partial, psychic, and secondarily generalized are eliminated; (4) new focal seizure types include automatisms, behavior arrest, hyperkinetic, autonomic, cognitive, and emotional; (5) atonic, clonic, epileptic spasms, myoclonic, and tonic seizures can be of either focal or generalized onset; (6) focal to bilateral tonic–clonic seizure replaces secondarily generalized seizure; (7) new generalized seizure types are absence with eyelid myoclonia, myoclonic absence, myoclonic–atonic, myoclonic–tonic–clonic; and (8) seizures of unknown onset may have features that can still be classified. The new classification does not represent a fundamental change, but allows greater flexibility and transparency in naming seizure types.","[{'authorId': '144184955', 'name': 'R.

Findings revealed increased pupil dilation, an index of increased activity in cognitive and affective processing regions of the brain, to rejection compared to acceptance trials, which was greater for older youth. Data from a cell-phone Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) protocol completed following the task indicated that increased pupillary reactivity to rejection trials was associated with lower feelings of social connectedness with peers in daily life. Eyetracking analyses revealed attentional biases toward acceptance feedback and away from rejection feedback. Biases toward acceptance feedback were stronger for older youth. Avoidance of rejection feedback was strongest among youth with increased pupillary reactivity to rejection, even in the seconds leading up to and following rejection feedback.

A significant body of research has demonstrated an association between mental health and both individual and interpersonal emotion regulation. Yet, this association has not been studied during the perinatal period. The aim of this study was to explore the association between emotion regulation, maternal mental health, and interpersonal emotion regulation during the transition to motherhood in a sample of Chilean women. Methods Women in their third trimester of pregnancy (n = 253) provided self-reports of emotion regulation and symptoms of depression and anxiety during pregnancy and three months postpartum. Additional self-reports of interpersonal emotion regulation were obtained from individuals who were identified as social support persons by these women. Results: Maternal emotion regulation contributed to maternal symptoms of depression and anxiety during pregnancy and after childbirth. The association between emotion regulation and maternal mental health was moderated by specific interpersonal emotion regulation strategies reported by the participant’s social support persons. Strategies including modulating the emotional response, situation modification, attentional deployment and cognitive change, modified the association between poor regulation strategies and anxiety symptoms. Also, an infrequent use of these interpersonal emotion regulation strategies strengthened the association between these maternal emotional regulation difficulties and anxiety symptoms. Conclusion Our findings suggest that interpersonal emotional regulation strategies impact the association of maternal emotional regulation strategies and maternal emotional wellbeing.","[{'authorId': '48011382', 'name': 'Soledad Coo'}, {'authorId': '151487959', 'name': 'María I García'}, {'authorId': '114353995', 'name': 'Fernanda Prieto'}, {'authorId': '2052785967', 'name': 'Franco Medina'}]",9.0,"{'name': 'Journal of Reproductive and Infant Psychology', 'pages': '3 - 21', 'volume': '40'}",47.0,The role of interpersonal emotional regulation on maternal mental health,2020.0

It was our aim to explore if participants rate the faulty robot different from an error-free robot and which reactions people show in interaction with a faulty robot. The study was based on our previous research on robot errors where we detected typical error situations and the resulting social signals of our participants during social human-robot interaction. In contrast to our previous work, where we studied video material in which robot errors occurred unintentionally, in the herein reported user study, we purposefully elicited robot errors to further explore the human interaction partners' social signals following a robot error. Our participants interacted with a human-like NAO, and the robot either performed faulty or free from error. First, the robot asked the participants a set of predefined questions and then it asked them to complete a couple of LEGO building tasks. After the interaction, we asked the participants to rate the robot's anthropomorphism, likability, and perceived intelligence. We also interviewed the participants on their opinion about the interaction. Additionally, we video-coded the social signals participants showed during their interaction with the robot as well as the answers they provided the robot with. Our results show that participants liked the faulty robot significantly better than the robot that interacted flawlessly. We did not find significant differences in people's rating of the robot's anthropomorphism and perceived intelligence. The qualitative data confirmed the questionnaire results in showing that although the participants recognized the robot's mistakes, they did not necessarily reject the erroneous robot. The annotations of the video data further showed that gaze shifts (e.g., from and object to the robot or vice versa) and laughter are typical reactions to unexpected robot behavior. In contrast to existing research, we assess dimensions of user experience that have not been considered so far and we analyze the reactions users express when a robot makes a mistake. Our results show that decoding a human's social signals can help the robot understand that there is an error and subsequently react accordingly.","[{'authorId': '2907626', 'name': 'Nicole Mirnig'}, {'authorId': '2307228', 'name': 'Gerald Stollnberger'}, {'authorId': '8806235', 'name': 'Markus Miksch'}, {'authorId': '2066590258', 'name': 'Susanne Stadler'}, {'authorId': '9936335', 'name': 'M.

Forty-five co-teachers and 58 students with disabilities (N = 103), all of whom were new to co-taught classrooms during the 2004 through 2005 school year, participated in this study. Data were collected from surveys, observations, and records review. Significant differences in student academic and behavioral performances were found in comparisons between the year before co-teaching and the year of co-teaching. Students with disabilities and their teachers also reported positive perspectives about co-teaching. Based on these preliminary results, co-teaching appears to be an effective instructional delivery option for meeting the needs of students with disabilities in general education classrooms.","[{'authorId': '121345294', 'name': 'Qilei Hang'}, {'authorId': '14797337', 'name': 'Karen Rabren'}]",166.0,,30.0,An Examination of Co-Teaching,2009.0

As a multimodal phenomenon, previous research argued that a mismatch in the expressive channels provides evidence of joint audio-video emotional processing. However, while previous work studied this from the point of view of emotion recognition and processing, not much is known about what effect a multimodal agent would have on a human-agent interaction task. Also, agent appearance could influence this interaction too. Here we manipulated the agent’s multimodal emotional expression (”smiling face” and ”smiling voice”, or both) and agent type (photorealistic or cartoon-like virtual human) and assessed people’s trust toward this agent. We measured trust using a mixed-methods approach, combining behavioural data from a survival task, questionnaire ratings and qualitative comments. These methods gave different results: while people commented on the importance of emotional expressivity in the agent’s voice, this factor had limited influence on trusting behaviours; while people rated the cartoon-like agent on several traits higher than the photorealistic one, the agent’s style also was not the most influential feature on people’s trusting behaviour. These results highlight the contribution of a mixed-methods approach in human-machine interaction, as both explicit and implicit perception and behaviour will contribute to the success of the interaction.","[{'authorId': '1996210170', 'name': 'Ilaria Torre'}, {'authorId': '3493587', 'name': 'E.

SFUs are an auditory interaction means for machines that allow emotion and intent expression, which are composed of vocalizations and sounds without semantic content or language dependence. Currently, SFUs are most commonly utilized in animation movies (e.g., R2-D2, WALL-E, Despicable Me), cartoons (e.g., “Teletubbies,” “Morph,” “La Linea”), and computer games (e.g., The Sims) and hold significant potential for applications in HRI. SFUs are categorized under four general types: Gibberish Speech (GS), Non-Linguistic Utterances (NLUs), Musical Utterances (MU), and Paralinguistic Utterances (PU). By introducing the concept of SFUs and bringing multiple sets of studies in social HRI that have never been analyzed jointly before, this article addresses the need for a comprehensive study of the existing literature for SFUs. It outlines the current grand challenges, open questions, and provides guidelines for future researchers considering to utilize SFU in social HRI.","[{'authorId': '1914965', 'name': 'S.

One way of assessing this is to compare the means of recorded values of each variable between groups defined by whether other variables in the data set are missing or not. Although informative, this procedure yields potentially many correlated statistics for testing MCAR, resulting in multiple-comparison problems. This article proposes a single global test statistic for MCAR that uses all of the available data. The asymptotic null distribution is given, and the small-sample null distribution is derived for multivariate normal data with a monotone pattern of missing data. The test reduces to a standard t test when the data are bivariate with missing data confined to a single variable.

In Experiment 1, subjects rated the pleasure and arousal elicited when listening to each of 60 sounds, followed by an incidental free recall task. The shape of the two-dimensional affective space defined by the mean ratings for each sound was similar to that previously obtained for pictures, and, like memory for pictures, free recall was highest for emotionally arousing stimuli. In Experiment 2, autonomic and facial electromyographic (EMG) activity were recorded while a new group of subjects listened to the same set of sounds; the startle reflex was measured using visual probes. Listening to unpleasant sounds resulted in larger startle reflexes, more corrugator EMG activity, and larger heart rate deceleration compared with listening to pleasant sounds. Electrodermal reactions were larger for emotionally arousing than for neutral materials. Taken together, the data suggest that acoustic cues activate the appetitive and defensive motivational circuits underlying emotional expression in ways similar to pictures.","[{'authorId': '2007419', 'name': 'M.

Recent claims that the LIFG is involved in selecting among semantic alternatives have been challenged on the grounds that the manipulation of selection demands may have been confounded with controlled retrieval. The current study used an event-related functional magnetic resonance paradigm to re-examine the possibility that LIFG activation is involved in selection processes. In order to minimize potential confounding effects of controlled retrieval, we used an automatic retrieval task (picture naming) and held retrieval demands constant, while varying selection demands by way of competitor priming from earlier semantically related trials. We found significant activation in LIFG as a function of increased selection demands; activation centred on two peaks, one in anterior LIFG and a second more superior and posterior region.

Trait PA is also associated with increased longevity among older community-dwelling individuals. The literature on PA and surviving serious illness is inconsistent. Experimentally inducing intense bouts of activated state PA triggers short-term rises in physiological arousal and associated (potentially harmful) effects on immune, cardiovascular, and pulmonary function.

When asked to make real charitable donations in the presence or absence of an observer, matched healthy controls donated significantly more in the observer's presence than absence, replicating prior work. By contrast, people with high-functioning autism were not influenced by the presence of an observer at all in this task. However, both groups performed significantly better on a continuous performance task in the presence of an observer, suggesting intact general social facilitation in autism.

However, RAT using humanoid robots is still a novel practice for which the adhesion mechanisms, indications and benefits remain unclear. Also, little is known about how the robot's behavioral and affective style might promote engagement of persons with dementia (PwD) in RAT. The present study sought to investigate the use of a humanoid robot in a psychomotor therapy for PwD. We examined the robot's potential to engage participants in the intervention and its effect on their emotional state. A brief psychomotor therapy program involving the robot as the therapist's assistant was created. For this purpose, a corpus of social and physical behaviors for the robot and a “control software” for customizing the program and operating the robot were also designed. Particular attention was given to components of the RAT that could promote participant's engagement (robot's interaction style, personalization of contents). In the pilot assessment of the intervention nine PwD (7 women and 2 men, M age = 86 y/o) hospitalized in a geriatrics unit participated in four individual therapy sessions: one classic therapy (CT) session (patient- therapist) and three RAT sessions (patient-therapist-robot). Outcome criteria for the evaluation of the intervention included: participant's engagement, emotional state and well-being; satisfaction of the intervention, appreciation of the robot, and empathy-related behaviors in human-robot interaction (HRI). Results showed a high constructive engagement in both CT and RAT sessions. More positive emotional responses in participants were observed in RAT compared to CT. RAT sessions were better appreciated than CT sessions. The use of a social robot as a mediating tool appeared to promote the involvement of PwD in the therapeutic intervention increasing their immediate wellbeing and satisfaction.","[{'authorId': '19560809', 'name': 'Natacha Rouaix'}, {'authorId': '1422471008', 'name': 'Laure Retru-Chavastel'}, {'authorId': '2012138', 'name': 'A.

The book opens with a brief overview of the design process relative to general problem solving approaches and specific ANSI design standards. A condensed but informative overview of statics and failure theories is provided, followed by separate chapters for the design of shafts, springs, screws and transmission elements such as belts, clutches, brakes, chains, bearings, and the most common types of gears. Using a phenomenological approach, each type of machine element and its associated variants are described with respect to function, form, and constraints. The provided performance and failure analysis is accessible, with most mathematical derivations given in full detail to increase the usefulness and adaptability of the provided information. Educators and practitioners currently utilizing the 7 edition will appreciate the important changes to the 8 edition. While the organization of the two books is virtually identical through Chapter 14, a structured approach has been applied to all the design examples. This structured approach includes the enumeration of the problem statement, given information, assumptions, solution method, and solution details. While quite standard, this structured approach does facilitate an understanding of the engineering approach and may assist the development of critical thinking skills.

However, music is an ecologically valid and complex stimulus that conveys certain emotions to listeners through compositions of musical elements. Using solely EEG signals to distinguish emotions remained challenging. This study aimed to assess the applicability of a multimodal approach by leveraging the EEG dynamics and acoustic characteristics of musical contents for the classification of emotional valence and arousal. To this end, this study adopted machine-learning methods to systematically elucidate the roles of the EEG and music modalities in the emotion modeling. The empirical results suggested that when whole-head EEG signals were available, the inclusion of musical contents did not improve the classification performance. The obtained performance of 74~76% using solely EEG modality was statistically comparable to that using the multimodality approach. However, if EEG dynamics were only available from a small set of electrodes (likely the case in real-life applications), the music modality would play a complementary role and augment the EEG results from around 61–67% in valence classification and from around 58–67% in arousal classification. The musical timber appeared to replace less-discriminative EEG features and led to improvements in both valence and arousal classification, whereas musical loudness was contributed specifically to the arousal classification. The present study not only provided principles for constructing an EEG-based multimodal approach, but also revealed the fundamental insights into the interplay of the brain activity and musical contents in emotion modeling.","[{'authorId': '47904249', 'name': 'Yuan-Pin Lin'}, {'authorId': '145142378', 'name': 'Yi-Hsuan Yang'}, {'authorId': '144437435', 'name': 'T.

Cynthia Breazeal here presents her vision of the sociable robot of the future, a synthetic creature and not merely a sophisticated tool. A sociable robot will be able to understand us, to communicate and interact with us, to learn from us and grow with us. It will be socially intelligent in a humanlike way. Eventually sociable robots will assist us in our daily lives, as collaborators and companions. Because the most successful sociable robots will share our social characteristics, the effort to make sociable robots is also a means for exploring human social intelligence and even what it means to be human. 
Breazeal defines the key components of social intelligence for these machines and offers a framework and set of design issues for their realization. Much of the book focuses on a nascent sociable robot she designed named Kismet. Breazeal offers a concrete implementation for Kismet, incorporating insights from the scientific study of animals and people, as well as from artistic disciplines such as classical animation. This blending of science, engineering, and art creates a lifelike quality that encourages people to treat Kismet as a social creature rather than just a machine. The book includes a CD-ROM that shows Kismet in action.","[{'authorId': '1711777', 'name': 'C. Breazeal'}]",1619.0,,96.0,Designing sociable robots,2002.0

The articles in different ways challenge the idea of bodies as discrete entities, clearly bounded and differentiated such that we know what is inside and what is outside, what is self and what is other, what is natural and what is cultural, and what is ‘pure experience’ and what is mediated. The articles consider the forms of embodiment that are lived and produced through the circuits of exchange, transfer, extension and incorporation made possible by transplantation (specifically organs such as the kidney and increasingly ‘body-parts’ such as the hand); the history of the development of prosthetics in Weimar Germany, which can be read alongside a first-person account of leg amputation and the incorporation of a prosthetic limb; and phenomena such as microchimerism that show evidence of bi-directional maternal–fetal cell transfer and traffic.

While facial expressions can be a voluntary reaction, the change of temperature in the body is often not. Thus, a facial expression may not always be consistent with the emotional state that is expressed by the body temperature. This article aims to study the human perception of the emotional expression and the emotional state of a robot that simultaneously uses its face and body temperature. To this end, a robot, named TherMoody, which has the capability to change its body temperature from 10–55℃, was used. Then, 25 combinations (5x5: one facial expression and one thermal expression for anger, joy, fear, sadness, and neutral state) were evaluated by 15 participants. Thermal expressions were designed based on the metaphors of emotions related to temperature. The results show people tend to base their judgment of the robot’s emotional expression exclusively in its facial expression, regardless of the change of its body temperature. However, there are combinations where the thermal expression predominates over the facial expression when judging the robot’s emotional state. Thus, these combinations may produce the perception that the robot’s emotional expression is, in fact, genuine, simulated, masked, or neutralized.","[{'authorId': '36840494', 'name': 'Denis Peña'}, {'authorId': '2820127', 'name': 'F.

While many studies have explored the effect of robot appearance, relatively little is known about how the texture and stiffness of the surface material, or what may be referred to as 'robot-skin', influences how the robot is perceived. Gaining improved understanding in this area may have direct and actionable consequences on robot design, since at present nearly all commercially available service robots have similar exterior surfaces composed of smooth, stiff materials, usually plastic. This study is framed around systematically investigating the type of textures that may be better suited for these robots. First, experiments were undertaken to classify the textural characteristics of 27 distinct materials which could potentially be used as a robot-skin. A representative subset of these materials was then selected for a second experiment that explored how the stiffness and tactile properties of the material influenced its perceived suitability for use on a service robot. The research found that people strongly preferred surface textures that were soft, rather than stiff. The most suitable material stiffness was found to be context dependent; soft options were preferred in the blind test condition, but for cases where participants were presented with the 3D image of a service robot in an immersive virtual reality environment, medium stiffness materials were preferred. In the final part of the study, we identified a range of textural properties that seem to correlate with high and low suitability for use on service robots. It is hoped that these findings are useful to help inform the design of future HRI systems, and motivate further investigation into the social roles of robot-skin.","[{'authorId': '40035527', 'name': 'C.

Surprisingly, however, little attention has been directed toward identifying processes in emotional development that differ in maltreated and nonmaltreated children. From a developmental psychopathology perspective, the present study examined emotion management skills (i.e., emotional understanding, emotion regulation) in 21 sexually maltreated girls and their nonmaltreated peers to determine how the experience of sexual maltreatment may interfere with normative emotional development. Findings indicated that sexually maltreated girls, in comparison to their nonmaltreated peers, demonstrate lower emotional understanding and decreased ability to regulate their emotions in accordance with cultural expectations. Further, maltreated girls expected less emotional support and more relational conflict from parents in response to sadness displays and from parents and peers in response to anger displays. These findings will be discussed from the functionalist approach to emotional development, emphasizing the importance of social context (e.g., maltreating, nonmaltreating) in the development of children's emotion management skills.","[{'authorId': '6924992', 'name': 'Kimberly L Shipman'}, {'authorId': '144677487', 'name': 'J.

The results reported herein propound otherwise, suggesting that a larger number of categories is used by humans. Understanding the different categories of facial expressions of emotion regularly used by us is essential to gain insights into human cognition and affect as well as for the design of computational models and perceptual interfaces. Past research on facial expressions of emotion has focused on the study of six basic categories—happiness, surprise, anger, sadness, fear, and disgust. However, many more facial expressions of emotion exist and are used regularly by humans. This paper describes an important group of expressions, which we call compound emotion categories. Compound emotions are those that can be constructed by combining basic component categories to create new ones. For instance, happily surprised and angrily surprised are two distinct compound emotion categories. The present work defines 21 distinct emotion categories. Sample images of their facial expressions were collected from 230 human subjects. A Facial Action Coding System analysis shows the production of these 21 categories is different but consistent with the subordinate categories they represent (e.g., a happily surprised expression combines muscle movements observed in happiness and surprised). We show that these differences are sufficient to distinguish between the 21 defined categories. We then use a computational model of face perception to demonstrate that most of these categories are also visually discriminable from one another.","[{'authorId': '2323717', 'name': 'Shichuan Du'}, {'authorId': '2105710649', 'name': 'Yong Tao'}, {'authorId': '1384255355', 'name': 'Aleix M.

Social robots can offer tremendous possibilities for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) interventions. To date, most studies with this population have used short, isolated encounters in controlled laboratory settings. Our study focused on a 1-month, home-based intervention for increasing social communication skills of 12 children with ASD between 6 and 12 years old using an autonomous social robot. The children engaged in a triadic interaction with a caregiver and the robot for 30 min every day to complete activities on emotional storytelling, perspective-taking, and sequencing. The robot encouraged engagement, adapted the difficulty of the activities to the child’s past performance, and modeled positive social skills. The system maintained engagement over the 1-month deployment, and children showed improvement on joint attention skills with adults when not in the presence of the robot. These results were also consistent with caregiver questionnaires. Caregivers reported less prompting over time and overall increased communication.","[{'authorId': '1792053', 'name': 'B.

Fields of medicine: Primary care and specialities. Format: Hardcover book. Audience: Clinicians treating older people. Selected chapters may be worthwhile for ethicists, lawyers, and clergy. Purpose: To review what is currently known, both clinical and scientific, about behavioral and psychological dysfunction in older people, and to foster continued advocacy for the new field of geriatric psychiatry. Content: Forty-three chapters cover such topics as forensics, palliative care, spirituality, ethics, sex, intellectual disabilities, and pain. The 104 authors include well-known leaders in the field, respected academics, and experienced clinicians. Highlights: The best parts of this book include the helpful, illustrative, real-life case examples in every chapter, the tables and figures, and the extensive listing of resources for patients, families, and caregivers. Chapters are relatively short, and it is easy to look things up or find a specific topic. The forensics chapter is a minicrash course and review of the most relevant principles. The hospicepalliative care chapter highlights the need for a greater focus on symptom-oriented care in medicine in general and includes a helpful review of current knowledge regarding the burdens and benefits of interventions in long-term care. The chapter on depression and Alzheimer disease is a gem. Basic science information is linked well to etiologic and therapeutic implications. Capacity assessment and decisional competence, 2 challenges faced by both geriatric psychiatrists and ethics committees, are well-covered in the ethics chapter. The sex chapter is a delight and the only one that focuses on the positive aspects of aging. Limitations: The book would be strengthened by a chapter on gender, pulling together what we know about gender differences in older adults, and a chapter on health, wellness, and successful aging. There is also little discussion of the American system of health care financing and its impact on older people. Related Readings: With its many authors from over a dozen disciplines, this book has a broader scope than other standard texts, such as Blazer and colleagues' Textbook of Geriatric Psychiatry, 3rd edition (American Psychiatric Publishing, 2004).","[{'authorId': '4730448', 'name': 'L.

Differences in the conceptualization and measurement of job burnout and STS were assumed to moderate these associations. A systematic review of literature yielded 41 original studies, analyzing data from a total of 8,256 workers. Meta-analysis indicated that associations between job burnout and STS were strong (weighted r = .69). Studies applying measures developed within the compassion fatigue framework (one of the conceptualizations of job burnout and STS) showed significantly stronger relationships between job burnout and STS, indicating a substantial overlap between measures (weighted r = .74; 55% of shared variance). Research applying other frameworks and measures of job burnout (i.e., stressing the role of emotional exhaustion) and STS (i.e., focusing on symptoms resembling posttraumatic stress disorder or a cognitive shift specific for vicarious trauma) showed weaker, although still substantial associations (weighted r = .58; 34% of shared variance). Significantly stronger associations between job burnout and STS were found for: (a) studies conducted in the United States compared to other countries; (b) studies using English-language versions of the questionnaires compared to other-language versions, and (c) research in predominantly female samples. The results suggest that, due to high correlations between job burnout and STS, there is a substantial likelihood that a professional exposed to secondary trauma would report similar levels of job burnout and STS, particularly if job burnout and STS were measured within the framework of compassion fatigue.","[{'authorId': '6291588', 'name': 'R.

Obese children may be at increased risk of becoming obese adults. To examine the relationship between obesity in childhood and obesity in adulthood, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature published between 1970 and July 1992. Comparison between studies was complicated by differences in study design, definitions of obesity, and analytic methods used. Although the correlations between anthropometric measures of obesity in childhood and those in adulthood varied considerably among studies, the associations were consistently positive.


RESULTS
About a third (26 to 41%) of obese preschool children were obese as adults, and about half (42 to 63%) of obese school-age children were obese as adults. For all studies and across all ages, the risk of adult obesity was at least twice as high for obese children as for nonobese children. The risk of adult obesity was greater for children who were at higher levels of obesity and for children who were obese at older ages.


CONCLUSION
The wide range of estimates in this literature are, in part, due to differences in study designs, definitions of obesity, ages at which participants were measured, intervals between measurements, and population and cultural differences.","[{'authorId': '5368543', 'name': 'M.

Eighteen social work students took part in a five-scenario Objective Structured Clinical Examination adapted for social work consisting of a 15-minute interview followed by a 15-minute reflective dialogue following structured questions designed to elicit dimensions of meta-competence. Ninety reflections were transcribed and analyzed revealing variation in students' ability to conceptualize practice, to intentionally use self, and to learn from reviewing their practice. Also, each meta-competence was found to be grounded in a similar structure, that of a continuum with reflections ranging from in-depth, rich, textured discussions to those that are more superficial, scant, and concrete. Variation in students' ability to conceptualize practice and use diversity concepts was found, related to students' emotional reactions. Some students described becoming emotionally ‘dysregulated’ and therefore unable to use knowledge in practice. Implications include the importance of articulating the inter-relationships and links between concepts and practice when teaching and assisting students to develop emotional self-regulation.","[{'authorId': '152494785', 'name': 'M.

This Essay evaluates potential technological solutions that could help home robots keep their promises, avert their eyes, and otherwise mitigate privacy harms. Our goals are to inform regulators of robot-related privacy harms and the available technological tools for mitigating them, and to spur technologists to employ existing tools and develop new ones by articulating principles for avoiding privacy harms. 
We posit that home robots will raise privacy problems of three basic types: (1) data privacy problems; (2) boundary management problems; and (3) social/relational problems. Technological design can ward off, if not fully prevent, a number of these harms. We propose five principles for home robots and privacy design: data minimization, purpose specifications, use limitations, honest anthropomorphism, and dynamic feedback and participation. We review current research into privacy-sensitive robotics, evaluating what technological solutions are feasible and where the harder problems lie. We close by contemplating legal frameworks that might encourage the implementation of such design, while also recognizing the potential costs of regulation at these early stages of the technology.","[{'authorId': '39223052', 'name': 'M.

At the individual level, however, the personality variable of allocentrism (consisting of behaviors found in collectivist cultures) was negatively related to the use of deception.

In this qualitative study, we identify staff opposed to SWPBIS among staff in 36 schools across 9 districts in western Washington. Nonsupportive staff (n = 44) are compared to supportive staff (n = 1,166) on demographic variables. Then, open-ended statements provided by nonsupportive staff are coded and analyzed to identify themes and develop an understanding of concerns about the SWPBIS initiative in their schools. Nonsupportive staff were concerned for the commitment and participation of all stakeholders, including staff, administrators, and students. Some sources of opposition were attributable to misunderstandings of SWPBIS and outright philosophical disagreements. Other sources of staff opposition were attributable not to the SWPBIS framework, but to school-level factors such as negative climate. We provide consultants with suggestions for engaging nonsupportive staff as well as directions for future research.","[{'authorId': '115408405', 'name': 'Ashli D.

In both samples, critical self-referent attributions were concurrently associated with depressive symptoms as reported by teacher (Study 1), peer, and self-report (Study 2). Critical self-referent attributions also were concurrently associated with loneliness and with actual peer experiences, including peer rejection in both studies. Results from both studies support a cognitive vulnerability–stress model, suggesting that the tendency to derive critical self-referent attributions from ambiguous peer experiences is most closely associated with depressive symptoms when accompanied by high levels of peer victimization.

It now covers all aspects of human life, from birth to bereavement, through all manner of computing, from device ecologies to nano-technology. It comes as no surprise that the role of theory in HCI has also greatly expanded from the early days of scientific testing to include other functions such as describing, explaining, critiquing, and as the basis for generating new designs. The book charts the theoretical developments in HCI, both past and present, reflecting on how they have shaped the field. It explores both the rhetoric and the reality: how theories have been conceptualized, what was promised, how they have been used and which has made the most impact in the field -- and the reasons for this.

Yet, in comparison to adult models of depression, very little is known about the specific psychosocial stressors that contribute to adolescent depression, and whether these can be targeted by interventions. In this review, we consider the role of peer rejection. First, we present a comprehensive review of studies using innovative experimental paradigms to understand the role of peer rejection in adolescent depression. We show how reciprocal relationships between peer rejection and depressive symptoms across adolescence powerfully shape and maintain maladaptive trajectories. Second, we consider how cognitive biases and their neurobiological substrates may explain why some adolescents are more vulnerable to the effects of, and perhaps exposure to, peer rejection compared to others. Finally, we draw attention to emerging cognitive and functional magnetic resonance imaging‐based neurofeedback training, which by modifying aspects of information processing may promote more adaptive responses to peer rejection. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying adolescent depression may not only alleviate symptoms during a period of substantial developmental challenges, but may also reduce the burden of the disorder across the lifespan.","[{'authorId': '40346208', 'name': 'B.

To learn hand-eye coordination for grasping, we trained a large convolutional neural network to predict the probability that task-space motion of the gripper will result in successful grasps, using only monocular camera images independent of camera calibration or the current robot pose. This requires the network to observe the spatial relationship between the gripper and objects in the scene, thus learning hand-eye coordination. We then use this network to servo the gripper in real time to achieve successful grasps. We describe two large-scale experiments that we conducted on two separate robotic platforms. In the first experiment, about 800,000 grasp attempts were collected over the course of two months, using between 6 and 14 robotic manipulators at any given time, with differences in camera placement and gripper wear and tear. In the second experiment, we used a different robotic platform and 8 robots to collect a dataset consisting of over 900,000 grasp attempts. The second robotic platform was used to test transfer between robots, and the degree to which data from a different set of robots can be used to aid learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves effective real-time control, can successfully grasp novel objects, and corrects mistakes by continuous servoing. Our transfer experiment also illustrates that data from different robots can be combined to learn more reliable and effective grasping.","[{'authorId': '1736651', 'name': 'S.

We asked 24 skilled typists (WPM = 70.7 T 16.4) to type 600 words, each of which was followed by a four-alternative explicit report screen. Typists typed 91.8% of the words correctly. Mean interkeystroke intervals, plotted in Fig. 3A, show post-error slowing for incorrect responses (F 1,138 = 117.7, p < 0.01) and corrected errors (F 1,138 = 120.0, p < 0.01), but not for inserted errors (F < 1.0), indicating that inner-loop detection distinguishes between actual errors and correct responses. Explicit detection probabilities, plotted in Fig. 3B, show good discrimination between correct and error responses. For correct responses, typists said "" correct "" more than "" error "" [t(23) = 97.29, p < 0.01]; for error responses, typists said "" error "" more than "" correct "" [t(23) = 8.22, p < 0.01]. Typists distinguished actual errors from inserted errors well, avoiding an illusion of authorship. They said "" error "" more than "" inserted "" for actual errors [t(23) = 7.06, p < 0.01] and "" inserted "" more than "" error "" for inserted errors [t(23) = 14.75, p < 0.01]. However, typists showed a strong illusion of authorship with corrected errors. They were just as likely to call them correct responses as corrected errors [t(23) = 1.38]. The post-error slowing and post-trial report data show a dissociation between inner-and outer-loop error detection. We assessed the dissociation further by comparing post-error slowing on trials in which typists did and did not experience illusions of authorship (21). The pattern of post-error slowing was the same for both sets of trials (fig. S6), suggesting that the pattern in Fig. 3A is representative of all trials. The three experiments found strong dissocia-tions between explicit error reports and post-error slowing. These dissociations are consistent with the hierarchical error-detection mechanism that we proposed, with an outer loop that mediates explicit reports and an inner loop that mediates post-error slowing. This nested-loop description of error detection is consistent with hierarchical models of cognitive control in typewriting (9, 10, 15–17) and with models of hierarchical control in other complex tasks (2, 8, 22).

In order to make a significant leap forward in affective expression data collection and the insights based on it, our work has created and validated a novel framework for collecting and analyzing facial responses over the Internet. The first experiment using this framework enabled 3,268 trackable face videos to be collected and analyzed in under two months. Each participant viewed one or more commercials while their facial response was recorded and analyzed. Our data showed significantly different intensity and dynamics patterns of smile responses between subgroups who reported liking the commercials versus those who did not. Since this framework appeared in 2011, we have collected over three million videos of facial responses in over 75 countries using this same methodology, enabling facial analytics to become significantly more accurate and validated across five continents. Many new insights have been discovered based on crowd-sourced facial data, enabling Internet-based measurement of facial responses to become reliable and proven.

Numerous studies report an association between social support and protection from depression, but no systematic review or meta-analysis exists on this topic.


AIMS
To review systematically the characteristics of social support (types and source) associated with protection from depression across life periods (childhood and adolescence; adulthood; older age) and by study design (cross-sectional v cohort studies).


METHOD
A systematic literature search conducted in February 2015 yielded 100 eligible studies. Study quality was assessed using a critical appraisal checklist, followed by meta-analyses.


RESULTS
Sources of support varied across life periods, with parental support being most important among children and adolescents, whereas adults and older adults relied more on spouses, followed by family and then friends. Significant heterogeneity in social support measurement was noted. Effects were weaker in both magnitude and significance in cohort studies.


CONCLUSIONS
Knowledge gaps remain due to social support measurement heterogeneity and to evidence of reverse causality bias.","[{'authorId': '4578451', 'name': 'G. Gariépy'}, {'authorId': '7385080', 'name': 'H.

Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (iCBT) may help to reduce barriers and improve access to treatment, but few studies have examined its use with older adults. The present study evaluated the efficacy, acceptability and feasibility of a brief iCBT program, the Managing Your Mood Program, to treat depression amongst adults aged 60 years and older. Method: Using an open trial design, 20 participants with elevated symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9) total scores ≥ 10) received access to five educational lessons and homework summaries, additional resources, a moderated discussion forum and weekly telephone or email contact from a clinical psychologist. Eighty percent of the sample met diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode at pre-treatment. Results: Completion rates and response rates were high, with 16/20 participants completing the five lessons within the 8 weeks, and post-treatment and 3-month follow-up data being collected from 17/20 participants. Participants improved significantly on the PHQ-9 and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), with large within-group effect sizes (Cohen’s d) at follow-up of 1.41 and 2.04, respectively. The clinician spent a mean time of 73.75 minutes (SD = 36.10 minutes) contacting participants within the trial and the program was rated as highly acceptable by participants. Conclusions: The results are encouraging and support the potential value of iCBT in the treatment of depressive symptoms amongst older adults.","[{'authorId': '5324295', 'name': 'B.

Here, we review the evidence from 69 original studies on human-animal interactions (HAI) which met our inclusion criteria with regard to sample size, peer-review, and standard scientific research design. Among the well-documented effects of HAI in humans of different ages, with and without special medical, or mental health conditions are benefits for: social attention, social behavior, interpersonal interactions, and mood; stress-related parameters such as cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure; self-reported fear and anxiety; and mental and physical health, especially cardiovascular diseases. Limited evidence exists for positive effects of HAI on: reduction of stress-related parameters such as epinephrine and norepinephrine; improvement of immune system functioning and pain management; increased trustworthiness of and trust toward other persons; reduced aggression; enhanced empathy and improved learning. We propose that the activation of the oxytocin system plays a key role in the majority of these reported psychological and psychophysiological effects of HAI. Oxytocin and HAI effects largely overlap, as documented by research in both, humans and animals, and first studies found that HAI affects the oxytocin system. As a common underlying mechanism, the activation of the oxytocin system does not only provide an explanation, but also allows an integrative view of the different effects of HAI.","[{'authorId': '37806877', 'name': 'A.

4a191bb8c04538cae794379502ce552a0b7adf15,"Introduction Everyone experiences stress at one time or another – from major events such as the death of a loved one, to more minor stressors such as financial difficulties. Not surprisingly, exposure to stress is generally associated with a wide range of negative outcomes, including decreased well-being, increased incidence of disease, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder (Dohrenwend & Dohrenwend, 1974; Kendler et al., 1999; Monat et al., 2007). However, not all individuals who are exposed to even high levels of stress develop such negative outcomes. In fact, recent evidence suggests that a considerable number of individuals exhibit resilience, which is commonly defined as maintained or improved mental health in the face of stress, after short disruptions (if any) to normal functioning (Freitas & Downey, 1998; Rutter, 1999; Luthar et al., 2000; Bonanno, 2005). Note that this definition, which we adapt here, conceptualizes resilience as a potential outcome after exposure to stress rather than a psychological trait that leads to positive outcomes (c.f. Norris et al., 2008). It, therefore, appears that, in the face of comparable stressors, some individuals exhibit significantly impaired functioning while others show impressive resilience. Understanding the factors that govern the great individual variance in outcomes after stress is important for understanding mental health and for developing interventions and prevention programs that foster resilience. What factors, then, might predict resilience? One key to this question might lie in the fact that stressful events are inherently highly emotional (Sarason et al., 1978; Lazarus, 1999). For this reason, people’s ability to regulate emotions may be a critically important factor in determining resilience (Figure 2.1). The present chapter will review relevant literatures and suggest that there is indeed evidence to support this thesis. More specifically, we will propose that a specific type of emotion regulation, cognitive emotion regulation, holds particular promise for contributing to resilience.","[{'authorId': '4041983', 'name': 'Allison S.

4a2f5ad8b238ff33cb2cce499e08bb7d47fd2d72,"Assistive social robots, a particular type of assistive robotics designed for social interaction with humans, could play an important role with respect to the health and psychological well-being of the elderly. Objectives Assistive social robots are believed to be useful in eldercare for two reasons, a functional one and an affective one. Such robots are developed to function as an interface for the elderly with digital technology, and to help increase the quality of life of the elderly by providing companionship, respectively. There is a growing attention for these devices in the literature. However, no comprehensive review has yet been performed to investigate the effectiveness of such robots in the care of the elderly. Therefore, we systematically reviewed and analyzed existing literature on the effects of assistive social robots in health care for the elderly. We focused in particular on the companion function. Data Sources A systematic search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library databases, IEEE, ACM libraries and finally Google Scholar was performed for records through December 2007 to identify articles of all studies with actual subjects aimed to assess the effects of assistive social robots on the elderly. This search was completed with information derived from personal expertise, contacts and reports. Study Selection and Data Extraction Since no randomized controlled trials (RCT)’s have been found within this field of research, all studies reporting effects of assistive robotics in elderly populations were included. Information on study design, interventions, controls, and findings were extracted for each article. In medical journals only a few articles were found, whereas about 50 publications were found in literature on ICT and robotics. Data Synthesis The identified studies were all published after 2000 indicating the novelty of this area of research. Most of these publications contain the results of studies that report positive effects of assistive social robots on health and psychological well-being of elders. Solid evidence indicating that these effects can indeed be attributed to the actual assistive social robot, its behavior and its functionality is scarce. Conclusions There is some qualitative evidence as well as limited quantitative evidence of the positive effects of assistive social robots with respect to the elderly. The research designs, however, are not robust enough to establish this. Confounding variables often cannot be excluded. This is partly due to the chosen research designs, but also because it is unclear what research methodology is adequate to investigate such effects. Therefore, more work on methods is needed as well as robust, large-scale studies to establish the effects of these devices.","[{'authorId': '1735303', 'name': 'J.

Internalizing was defined in two ways: as social withdrawal (to avoid overlap of items with measures of emotionality) or, more broadly, as anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints. In general, children with externalizing problems, compared with children with internalizing problems and nondisordered children, were more prone to anger, impulsivity, and low regulation. Children with internalizing symptoms were prone to sadness, low attentional regulation, and low impulsivity. Relations between internalizing problems and emotionality were more frequent when the entire internalizing scale was used. Findings suggest that emotion and regulation are associated with adjustment in systematic ways and that there is an important difference between effortful control and less voluntary modes of control.","[{'authorId': '15102546', 'name': 'N.

This study presents an analysis of the interaction between emotional audio (human voice) and video (simple animation) cues. The emotional relevance of the channels is analyzed with respect to their effect on human perception and through the study of the extracted audio-visual features that contribute most prominently to human perception. As a result of the unequal level of expressivity across the two channels, the audio was shown to bias the perception of the evaluators. However, even in the presence of a strong audio bias, the video data were shown to affect human perception. The feature sets extracted from emotionally matched audio-visual displays contained both audio and video features while feature sets resulting from emotionally mismatched audio-visual displays contained only audio information. This result indicates that observers integrate natural audio cues and synthetic video cues only when the information expressed is in congruence. It is therefore important to properly design the presentation of audio-visual cues as incorrect design may cause observers to ignore the information conveyed in one of the channels.","[{'authorId': '2523983', 'name': 'E.

To meet this need, we collected, annotated, and prepared for public distribution a new database of facial emotions in the wild (called AffectNet). AffectNet contains more than 1,000,000 facial images from the Internet by querying three major search engines using 1,250 emotion related keywords in six different languages. About half of the retrieved images were manually annotated for the presence of seven discrete facial expressions and the intensity of valence and arousal. AffectNet is by far the largest database of facial expression, valence, and arousal in the wild enabling research in automated facial expression recognition in two different emotion models. Two baseline deep neural networks are used to classify images in the categorical model and predict the intensity of valence and arousal.

4b17daf8bed51d5672baf13b8592eb961c88499f,"Social touch forms an important aspect of the human non-verbal communication repertoire, but is often overlooked in human-robot interaction. In this study, we investigated whether robot-initiated touches can induce physiological, emotional, and behavioral responses similar to those reported for human touches. 39 Participants were invited to watch a scary movie together with a robot that spoke soothing words. In the Touch condition, these words were accompanied by a touch on the shoulder. We hypothesized that this touch – as compared with no touch – could (H1) attenuate physiological (heart rate (variability), skin conductance, cortisol, and respiration rate) and subjective stress responses that were caused by the movie. Moreover, we expected that a touch could (H2) decrease aversion towards the movie, (H3) increase positive perceptions of the robot (e.g., its appearance and one’s attitude towards it), and (H4) increase compliance to the robot’s request to make a monetary donation. Although the movie did increase arousal as intended, none of the hypotheses could be confirmed. Our findings suggest that merely simulating a human touching action with the robot’s limbs is insufficient to elicit physiological, emotional, and behavioral responses in this specific context and with this amount of participants. To inform future research on the opportunities and limitations of robot-initiated touch, we reflect on our methodology and identify dimensions that may play a role in physical human-robot interactions: e.g., the robot’s touching behavior, its appearance and behavior, the user’s personality, the body location where the touch is applied, and the (social) context of the interaction. Social touch can only become an integral and effective part of a robot’s non-verbal communication repertoire, when we better understand if, and under which boundary conditions such touches can elicit responses in humans.","[{'authorId': '23824995', 'name': 'Christian J.

Further, because participants can hold multiple identities or can adopt new pseudonymous personas, a reliable and trustworthy mechanism for reputation transfer (RT) from one persona to another is required. Such a reputation transfer model must preserve privacy and at the same time prevent linkability of learners' identities and personas. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving reputation management (RM) system which allows secure transfer of reputation.

The proposed decision-making system is biologically inspired and it is based on drives, motivations, and emotions. The agent has certain needs or drives that must be within a certain range, and motivations are understood as what moves the agent to satisfy a drive. Considering that the well-being of the agent is a function of its drives, the goal of the agent is to optimize it. Currently, the implemented artificial emotions are happiness, sadness, and fear. The novelties of our approach are, on one hand, that the generation method and the role of each of the artificial emotions are not defined as a whole, as most authors do. Each artificial emotion is treated separately. On the other hand, in the proposed system it is not mandatory to predefine either the situations that must release any artificial emotion or the actions that must be executed in each case. Both the emotional releaser and the actions can be learned by the agent, as happens on some occasions in nature, based on its own experience. In order to test the decision-making process, it has been implemented on virtual agents (software entities) living in a simple virtual environment. The results presented in this paper correspond to the implementation of the decision-making system on an agent whose main goal is to learn from scratch how to behave in order to maximize its well-being by satisfying its drives or needs. The learning process, as shown by the experiments, produces very natural results. The usefulness of the artificial emotions in the decision-making system is proven by making the same experiments with and without artificial emotions, and then comparing the performance of the agent.","[{'authorId': '1853452', 'name': 'M.

Bit coin has demonstrated in the financial space that trusted, auditable computing is possible using a decentralized network of peers accompanied by a public ledger. In this paper, we describe a decentralized personal data management system that ensures users own and control their data. We implement a protocol that turns a block chain into an automated access-control manager that does not require trust in a third party. Unlike Bit coin, transactions in our system are not strictly financial -- they are used to carry instructions, such as storing, querying and sharing data. Finally, we discuss possible future extensions to block chains that could harness them into a well-rounded solution for trusted computing problems in society.","[{'authorId': '2653464', 'name': 'Guy Zyskind'}, {'authorId': '31945113', 'name': 'Oz Nathan'}, {'authorId': '1682773', 'name': 'A.

A camera positioned below a translucent robot skin captures shadows generated from human touch and infers social gestures from the captured images. This approach enables rich tactile interaction with robots without the need for the sensor arrays used in traditional social robot tactile skins. It also supports the use of touch interaction with non-rigid robots, achieves high-resolution sensing for robots with different sizes and shape of surfaces, and removes the requirement of direct contact with the robot. We demonstrate the idea with an inflatable robot and a standing-alone testing device, an algorithm for recognizing touch gestures from shadows that uses Densely Connected Convolutional Networks, and an algorithm for tracking positions of touch and hovering shadows. Our experiments show that the system can distinguish between six touch gestures under three lighting conditions with 87.5 - 96.0% accuracy, depending on the lighting, and can accurately track touch positions as well as infer motion activities in realistic interaction conditions. Additional applications for this method include interactive screens on inflatable robots and privacy-maintaining robots for the home.","[{'authorId': '49994805', 'name': 'Yuhan Hu'}, {'authorId': '2039000758', 'name': 'Sara Maria Bejarano'}, {'authorId': '153673481', 'name': 'G.

Facial expression recognition (FER) is a vital task for emotion recognition. However, significant gap between human and machine exists in FER task. In this paper, we present a conditional generative adversarial network-based approach to alleviate the intra-class variations by individually controlling the facial expressions and learning the generative and discriminative representations simultaneously. The proposed framework consists of a generator G and three discriminators (<italic>Di</italic>, <italic>Da</italic>, and <italic>Dexp</italic>). The generator G transforms any query face image into another prototypic facial expression image with other factors preserved. Armed with action units condition, the generator G pays more attention to information relevant to facial expression. Three loss functions (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$L_{I}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, <italic>La</italic>, and <italic>Lexp</italic>) corresponding to the three discriminators (<italic>Di</italic>, <italic>Da</italic>, and <italic>Dexp</italic>) were designed to learn generative and discriminative representations. Moreover, after rendering the generated expression back to its original facial expression, cycle consistency loss is also applied to guarantee the identity and produce more constrained visual representations. Optimized by combining both synthesis and classification loss functions, the learnt representation is explicitly disentangled from other variations such as identity, head pose, and illumination. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate the proposed FER system is effective for expression recognition.","[{'authorId': '145124910', 'name': 'Jia Deng'}, {'authorId': '49097561', 'name': 'Gaoyang Pang'}, {'authorId': '2117993183', 'name': 'Zhiyu Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2096506', 'name': 'Zhibo Pang'}, {'authorId': '2155585952', 'name': 'Huayong Yang'}, {'authorId': '2109603504', 'name': 'Geng Yang'}]",56.0,,69.0,cGAN Based Facial Expression Recognition for Human-Robot Interaction,2019.0

In this study, we examine the relations among teacher and school-level constructs (i.e., teacher collaboration, supervision/discipline, instructional management), and student-related outcomes (i.e., high-risk behaviors, barriers to learning, student social–behavioral climate). Teachers across 29 high schools, in a large urban school district serving primarily low-income students, completed self-report surveys. Multilevel regression was used to test both individual- and school-level predictors of student outcomes. Findings suggest that teacher practices at the individual and school levels are linked to student high-risk behaviors, barriers to student learning, and school climate. More specifically, findings indicate that better supervision/discipline and instructional management are associated with fewer high-risk behaviors and barriers to learning. More instructional management is also linked to positive social–behavioral climate. Results from this study highlight the association between teacher practices and a range of student-related problem behaviors, and suggest that system-level interventions in the school may have positive effects.","[{'authorId': '48916491', 'name': 'Andrew Martinez'}, {'authorId': '115906491', 'name': 'S.

Major Professors: Eugene H. Spa↵ord and Mikhail J. Atallah. As the convergence between our physical and digital worlds continue at a rapid pace, securing our digital information is vital to our prosperity. Most current typical computer systems are unwittingly helpful to attackers through their predictable responses. In everyday security, deception plays a prominent role in our lives and digital security is no di↵erent. The use of deception has been a cornerstone technique in many successful computer breaches. Phishing, social engineering, and drive-bydownloads are some prime examples. The work in this dissertation is structured to enhance the security of computer systems by using means of deception and deceit. Deception-based security mechanisms focus on altering adversaries’ perception of computer systems in a way that can confuse them and waste their time and resources. These techniques exploit adversaries’ biases and present them with a plausible alternative to the truth bringing a number of unique advantages to computer security. In addition, deception has been widely used in many areas of computing for decades and security is no di↵erent. However, deception has only been used haphazardly in computer security. In this dissertation we present a framework where deception can be planned and integrated into computer defenses. We posit how the well-known Kerckho↵s’s principle has been misinterpreted to drive the security community away from deception-based mechanisms. We present two schemes that employ deception to protect users’ passwords during transmission and at rest when they are stored on a computer server. Moreover, we designed and built a centralized deceptive server that can be hooked to","[{'authorId': '1862040', 'name': 'Mohammed H.

Such instant judgments might be innate and automatic, being performed unconsciously and independently to other cognitive processes. Lying detection might be subject to such a modular process. Unfortunately, numerous studies highlighted problems with lying detection paradigms such as high error rates and learning effects. Additionally, humans should be motivated doing both detecting others’ lies and disguising own lies. Disguising own lies might even be more challenging than detecting other people’s lies. Thus, when trying to disguise cheating behaviour, liars might display a mixture of disguising (fake) trust cues and uncontrolled lying cues making the interpretation of the expression difficult (perceivers are guessing). In two consecutive online studies, we tested whether seeing an increasing amount (range 0–4) of lying cues (LC) and non-lying cues (NLC) on a standard face results in enhanced guessing behaviour (studies 1 and 2) and that enhanced guessing is accompanied by slower responding (study 2). Results showed that pronounced guessing and slowest responding occurred for faces with an intermediate number and not with the highest number of LC and NLC. In particular, LC were more important than NLC to uncertain lying decisions. Thus, only a few LC may interfere with automatic processing of lying detection (irrespective of NLC), probably because too little lying cue information is yet available.","[{'authorId': '4395685', 'name': 'M.

Speech and spoken language communication cues offer an important means for measuring and modeling human behavior. Observational research and practice across a variety of domains from commerce to healthcare rely on speech- and language-based informatics for crucial assessment and diagnostic information and for planning and tracking response to an intervention. In this paper, we describe some of the opportunities as well as emerging methodologies and applications of human behavioral signal processing (BSP) technology and algorithms for quantitatively understanding and modeling typical, atypical, and distressed human behavior with a specific focus on speech- and language-based communicative, affective, and social behavior. We describe the three important BSP components of acquiring behavioral data in an ecologically valid manner across laboratory to real-world settings, extracting and analyzing behavioral cues from measured data, and developing models offering predictive and decision-making support. We highlight both the foundational speech and language processing building blocks as well as the novel processing and modeling opportunities. Using examples drawn from specific real-world applications ranging from literacy assessment and autism diagnostics to psychotherapy for addiction and marital well being, we illustrate behavioral informatics applications of these signal processing techniques that contribute to quantifying higher level, often subjectively described, human behavior in a domain-sensitive fashion.","[{'authorId': '145254843', 'name': 'Shrikanth S.

The robot’s function is to increase people’s awareness to the effect of their behavior towards others, potentially leading to behavior change. Specifically, Kip1 is designed to promote nonaggressive conversation between people. It monitors theconversation’s nonverbal aspects and maintains an emotional model of its reaction to the conversation. If the conversation seems calm, Kip1 responds by a gesture designed to communicate curious interest. If the conversation seems aggressive, Kip1 responds by a gesture designed to communicate fear. We describe the design process of Kip1, guided by the principles of peripheral and evocative. We detail its hardware and software systems, and a study evaluating the effects of the robot’s autonomous behavior on couples’ conversations. We find support for our design goals. A conversation companion reacting to the conversation led to more gaze attention, but not more verbal distraction, compared to a robot that moves but does not react to the conversation. This suggests that robotic devices could be designed as companions tohuman-human interaction without compromising the natural communication flow between people. Participants also rated the reacting robot as having significantly more social human charactertraits and as being significantly more similar to them. This points to the robot’s potential to elicit people’s empathy.Categories and Subject Descriptors H.1.2 [Models and Principles]: User/Machine Systems; J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences— psychology.

In this paper, we developed a set of experiments that tasked individuals with navigating a virtual maze using different methods to simulate an evacuation. Participants chose whether or not to use the robot for guidance in each of two separate navigation rounds. The robot performed poorly in two of the three conditions. The participant's decision to use the robot and self-reported trust in the robot served as dependent measures. A 53% drop in self-reported trust was found when the robot performs poorly. Self-reports of trust were strongly correlated with the decision to use the robot for guidance ( $\phi ({90}) = + 0.745$).

This article selectively reviews and compares the EC and EF literature. The review indicates considerable similarities and overlaps in the definitions, core components, and measurement of EC and EF. Differences between the 2 literatures seem to primarily reflect differences in research focus as influenced by each field’s “tradition” rather than “real” differences in EC and EF as developmental constructs. Thus, developing an integrated theory of self-regulation encompassing the EC and EF perspectives is critical for reducing overlap and confusion in future research. The article provides a number of recommendations on how to integrate the theory and methodology of EC and EF in future research for (a) the components and organization of self-regulation, (b) the relation of self-regulation to children’s adaptive functions, (c) the neurological basis of self-regulation and its development, and (d) the development and evaluation of interventions targeting children’s self-regulation.","[{'authorId': '2218929589', 'name': 'Qing Zhou'}, {'authorId': '2110910035', 'name': 'Stephen H Chen'}, {'authorId': '47478537', 'name': 'Alexandra Main'}]",358.0,,107.0,Commonalities and Differences in the Research on Children’s Effortful Control and Executive Function: A Call for an Integrated Model of Self‐Regulation,2012.0

ER was assessed observationally during a laboratory mood induction. ER behaviors were empirically reduced into 3 categories: (a) negative focus on delay, (b) positive reward anticipation, and (c) behavioral distraction. Linear mixed models indicated that positive reward anticipation moderated the effects of maternal COD on children's internalizing problems, particularly if mothers had current depressive symptoms. Findings suggest that generating positive affect in the face of a potential frustration may be a protective ER strategy for children at risk for depression.","[{'authorId': '3234399', 'name': 'J.

The resulting implementation of a team of heterogeneous robots using a hybrid deliberative/reactive architecture produced the desired emergent societal behavior. Data collected at two different public venues illustrate how a dependent agent selects new behaviors (e.g., stop serving, move to intercept the refiner) to compensate for delays from a subordinate agent (e.g., blocked by the audience). The subordinate also modifies the intensity of its active behaviors in response to feedback from the dependent agent. The agents communicate asynchronously through knowledge query and manipulation language via wireless Ethernet.","[{'authorId': '1789429', 'name': 'R.

4e0e09e8c434fba1314168ca7e5931eb5d362a94,"Current theories suggest that social and physical pain overlap in their neurological and physiological outcomes. We investigated how social and physical pain overlap in their psychological responses by testing the hypothesis that both social and physical pain would thwart satisfaction on four human needs, worsen mood, and increase desire to aggress. In Experiment 1, recalling an experience of social or physical pain produced overlapping effects in the form of thwarted self-esteem and control needs and increased negative affect and desire to aggress. In Experiment 2, we induced social (Cyberball ostracism) or physical pain (cold pressor) within the laboratory session, and found that both pain types produced feelings of being ignored and excluded, and thwarted belonging, self-esteem, control, and meaningful existence. Our results provide further support to pain overlap theories and indicate that social and physical pain cause common psychological consequences, resulting in new ways to understand and manage pain. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. There is growing evidence in the literature showing that physical pain, the pain caused by a physical injury, and social pain, the pain caused by the threat or actual loss of a social connection (MacDonald & Leary, 2005), share a common neural system. Yet, it is still unclear whether the physiological overlap between the pain types also implies an overlap in their psychological responses. The present paper aims to fill this gap. We examined whether the social/physical pain overlap results in common psychological responses as well. The physiological overlap underlying physical and social pain was initially proposed by Panksepp (1998). Panksepp found that, besides reducing the experience of pain, the administration of an opiate also reduced crying behavior in animals that were socially isolated (Panksepp, Herman, Conner, Bishop, & Scott, 1978). Following Panksepp and colleagues’ early suggestion, several authors investigated whether similar neural brain circuitries are delegated to detect, process, and regulate both social and physical pain in social animals and humans (DeWall et al., 2010; Eisenberger, Lieberman, & Williams, 2003).","[{'authorId': '37814606', 'name': 'P.

Functional neuroimaging investigations of major depressive disorder can advance both the neural theory and treatment of this debilitating illness. Inconsistency of neuroimaging findings and the use of region-of-interest approaches have hindered the development of a comprehensive, empirically informed neural model of major depression. In this context, the authors sought to identify reliable anomalies in baseline neural activity and neural response to affective stimuli in major depressive disorder.


METHOD
The authors applied voxel-wise, whole-brain meta-analysis to neuroimaging investigations comparing depressed to healthy comparison groups with respect to baseline neural activity or neural response to positively and/or negatively valenced stimuli.


RESULTS
Relative to healthy subjects, those with major depression had reliably higher baseline activity, bilaterally, in the pulvinar nucleus. The analysis of neural response studies using negative stimuli showed greater response in the amygdala, insula, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and lower response in the dorsal striatum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in individuals with major depressive disorder than in healthy subjects.


CONCLUSIONS
The meta-analytic results support an elegant and neuroanatomically viable model of the salience of negative information in major depressive disorder. In this proposed model, high baseline pulvinar activity in depression first potentiates responding of the brain's salience network to negative information; next, and owing potentially to low striatal dopamine levels in depression, this viscerally charged information fails to propagate up the cortical-striatal-pallidalthalamic circuit to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for contextual processing and reappraisal.","[{'authorId': '2247128932', 'name': 'P.

Moreover, when the prospective period was examined as a whole, the mediation hypothesis derived from the cognitive theories was strongly supported. Hopelessness appeared to mediate the obtained relationship between cognitive vulnerability and suicidality. Finally, the obtained relationship between cognitive vulnerability and suicidality was not mediated by other hypothesized risk factors for suicidality not specified in the cognitive theories, such as past suicidality, personal history of depressive disorders, borderline and antisocial personality dysfunction, and parental history of depression.","[{'authorId': '2294629', 'name': 'L.

The second question is whether these reactions differ between different types of social events, and finally, whether such reactions disappear or change over time. Our analysis indicates that children indeed show behaviors that indicate social engagement using a range of communicative channels. While gaze towards the robot's face is the most common indication for all types of social events, verbal expressions and nods are especially common for questions, and smiles are most common after positive feedback.

In order to explore the relationship of control and initiative to discourse processes like centering, we analyze the distribution of four different classes of anaphora for two data sets. This distribution indicates that some control segments are hierarchically related to others. The analysis suggests that discourse participants often mutually agree to a change of topic. We also compared initiative in Task Oriented and Advice Giving dialogues and found that both allocation of control and the manner in which control is transferred is radically different for the two dialogue types.

There are hopes that robots will make aged-care jobs less demanding, for example, they could help senior citizens maintain a longer independent life in their own home, assist caregivers in the nursing home, or provide company to the lonely. However, there are different opinions about the use of robots in our society. 
 
In 2012, a survey was conducted in 27 EU countries to examine the public's attitudes toward robots (Special Eurobarometer 382).1 More than 26.000 European citizens responded about the areas where they believe robots should be used as a priority or banned. The survey indicated that, in general, less than one-fourth (23%) of Europeans have a negative opinion of robots. But when asked about the areas in which robots should be banned, more than half (60%) of the respondents stated that the use of robots should be banned in the care of children, elderly, and the disabled. Given these figures, little acceptance can be expected currently for robots in aged care. 
 
Nevertheless, the demographic change in developed countries places ever increasing challenges on the care and support of the elderly. Due to a higher life expectancy and declining birth rates, the proportion of older people compared to the younger ones increases and with it the number of people in need of care. For instance in Germany, 30 years ahead, predictions are that the number of 80 year old citizens will be larger than the next generation of 50 year olds that could support them.2 One possible solution considered to meet these challenges is that the use of robots in aged care could help to fill the gap.","[{'authorId': '1721018', 'name': 'I.

With reciprocal neural connections to multiple brain regions, the VN serves as a control center that integrates interoceptive information and responds with appropriate adaptive modulatory feedbacks. While most VN fibers are unmyelinated C‐fibers from the visceral organs, myelinated A‐ and B‐fiber play an important role in somatic sensory, motor, and parasympathetic innervation. VN fibers are primarily cholinergic but other noncholinergic nonadrenergic neurotransmitters are also involved. VN has four vagal nuclei that provide critical controls to the cardiovascular, respiratory, and alimentary systems. Latest studies revealed that VN is also involved in inflammation, mood, and pain regulation, all of which can be potentially modulated by vagus nerve stimulation (VNS).

Review of this literature points to ways these broader contexts are likely to influence children's development of emotional self-regulation. This review also points to innovative analytic approaches that might be useful in inferring causal mechanisms in emotion regulation research.","[{'authorId': '5169917', 'name': 'C.

Therapists go through an internal process as they try both to make sense out of the stories they hear from clients, and to integrate those stories into their own existing cognitive schemas. During this process of integration, trauma therapists often experience secondary traumatic stress reactions that negatively impact the treatment process, as well as their own experiences of self. Secondary traumatic stress, vicarious traumitization, and worker burnout are distinctly different processes that practitioners need to differentiate, even though they are often similar in their initial presentation.","[{'authorId': '26805478', 'name': 'J.

This view looks at bullying as a group phenomenon which is largely enabled and maintained by members of a school class taking on different participant roles (such as assistants of the bully, reinforcers of the bully, or outsiders). Since peers are involved in bullying in different ways, and seem to be powerful moderators of behaviour in a school class, this ""peer group power"" should also be utilized in putting an end to bullying. In interventions targeting the whole peer group it is peers that, after initial adult encouragement and training, take action against bullying. This happens informally, in their spontaneous everyday intractions. Peers can also be utilized in formal helper roles, as peer counsellors. It is suggested that the focus of counselling could be shifted from supporting the victims towards also working with students in other participant roles.","[{'authorId': '2999418', 'name': 'C.

To implicitly measure confusion, we tracked 358 subjects’ mouse trajectories as they categorized the faces. We observed a clear Uncanny Valley and a pattern of categorization supporting a perceived categorical boundary. Yet, in contrast to predictions of the category confusion mechanism hypothesis, the Uncanny Valley and category boundary locations did not coincide, and mediation analyses further failed to support a causal role of category confusion.

Addressing these challenges, Blossom aims at three design objectives: accessibility, flexibility, and expressiveness. The robot’s mechanism can be quickly assembled and partially extended by end-users. Blossom’s appearance is open-ended through handcrafted fabric exteriors created and customized by users. Smooth organic movements are achieved with tensile mechanisms, elastic components, and a soft exterior cover attached loosely to the body. Blossom’s smartphone-based gesture generation requires neither programming nor character animation experience, allowing lay users to create their own behaviors. All elements in the design were conceived with a low barrier-of-entry in mind. The result is an accessible and customizable social robot for researchers.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by a negative perception of others. Previous studies have revealed deficits and biases in facial emotion recognition. This study investigates the behavioural and electrophysiological correlates underlying facial emotion processing in individuals with BPD.


METHODS
The present study was conducted between July 2012 and May 2014. In an emotion classification task, unmedicated female patients with BPD as well as healthy women had to classify faces displaying blends of anger and happiness while the electroencephalogram was recorded. We analyzed visual event-related potentials (ERPs) reflecting early (P100), structural (N170) and categorical (P300) facial processing in addition to behavioural responses.


RESULTS
We included 36 women with BPD and 29 controls in our analysis. Patients with BPD were more likely than controls to classify predominantly happy faces as angry. Independent of facial emotion, women with BPD showed enhanced early occipital P100 amplitudes. Additionally, temporo-occipital N170 amplitudes were reduced at right hemispherical electrode sites. Centroparietal P300 amplitudes were reduced particularly for predominantly happy faces and increased for highly angry faces in women with BPD, whereas in healthy volunteers this component was modulated by both angry and happy facial affect.


LIMITATIONS
Our sample included only women, and no clinical control group was investigated.


CONCLUSION
Our findings suggest reduced thresholds for facial anger and deficits in the discrimination of facial happiness in individuals with BPD. This biased perception is associated with alterations in very early visual as well as deficient structural and categorical processing of faces. The current data could help to explain the negative perception of others that may be related to the patients' impairments in interpersonal functioning.","[{'authorId': '6683691', 'name': 'Natalie A.

This study investigated acoustic-phonetic modifications produced in noise-adapted speech (NAS) and clear speech (CS) by children, young adults, and older adults.


Method
Ten children (11-13 years of age), 10 young adults (18-29 years of age), and 10 older adults (60-84 years of age) read sentences in conversational and clear speaking style in quiet and in noise. A number of acoustic measurements were obtained.


Results
NAS and CS were characterized by a decrease in speaking rate and an increase in 1-3 kHz energy, sound pressure level (SPL), vowel space area (VSA), and harmonics-to-noise ratio. NAS increased fundamental frequency (F0) mean and decreased jitter and shimmer. CS increased frequency and duration of pauses. Older adults produced the slowest speaking rate, longest pauses, and smallest increase in F0 mean, 1-3 kHz energy, and SPL when speaking clearly. They produced the smallest increases in VSA in NAS and CS. Children slowed down less, increased the VSA least, increased harmonics-to-noise ratio, and decreased jitter and shimmer most in CS. Children increased mean F0 and F1 most in noise.


Conclusions
Findings have implications for a model of speech production in healthy speakers as well as the potential to aid in clinical decision making for individuals with speech disorders, particularly dysarthria.","[{'authorId': '2875125', 'name': 'Rajka Smiljanic'}, {'authorId': '4913550', 'name': 'Rachael C.

Face recognition and processing are so completely central to human social interactions that these functions are supported by specialized regions in the brain. One of the fundamental aspects being processed is emotion, particularly whether the emotion being expressed is positive or negative. Nevertheless, neuroimaging studies have documented that perceiving opposite emotions often activates the same or overlapping regions. Aviezer et al. (p. 1225) report that the recognition of positive versus negative emotions actually relies on information communicated by the body—the extent to which perceivers identified joy versus grief in composite figures was driven by whether the body came from a joyous (versus grievous) image rather than the face. The body reveals what the face conceals. The distinction between positive and negative emotions is fundamental in emotion models. Intriguingly, neurobiological work suggests shared mechanisms across positive and negative emotions. We tested whether similar overlap occurs in real-life facial expressions. During peak intensities of emotion, positive and negative situations were successfully discriminated from isolated bodies but not faces. Nevertheless, viewers perceived illusory positivity or negativity in the nondiagnostic faces when seen with bodies. To reveal the underlying mechanisms, we created compounds of intense negative faces combined with positive bodies, and vice versa. Perceived affect and mimicry of the faces shifted systematically as a function of their contextual body emotion. These findings challenge standard models of emotion expression and highlight the role of the body in expressing and perceiving emotions.","[{'authorId': '4387567', 'name': 'Hillel Aviezer'}, {'authorId': '5169679', 'name': 'Y.

We tested the hypothesis that the perception of bodily states is positively related to the experienced intensity of feelings as well as to the activity of first‐order and second‐order brain structures involved in the processing of feelings. Using a heartbeat perception task, subjects were separated into groups with either high or poor interoceptive awareness. During emotional picture presentation we measured high‐density EEG and used spatiotemporal current density reconstruction to identify regions involved in both interoceptive awareness and emotion processing. We observed a positive relation between interoceptive awareness and the experienced intensity of emotions. Furthermore, the P300 amplitudes to pleasant and unpleasant pictures were enhanced for subjects with high interoceptive awareness.

Objectives: We studied the association of certain weather variables (specifically, humidity, wind speed, and barometric pressure) with emergent psychiatric presentations, psychiatric admissions, incidence of violent crimes, and suicides in a metropolitan area. Method: We performed a retrospective study for the year 1999 in a mid-sized city. We included all documented emergent psychiatric visits to the city's psychiatric emergency room. We obtained violence data from the city police department and suicide data from the county medical examiner. Results: The data suggest that total numbers of acts of violence and emergency psychiatry visits are significantly associated with low barometric pressure. Psychiatric inpatient admissions and suicides are not associated with any of the weather variables investigated. Conclusions: While alternate conclusions can be drawn, we propose that the data support the interpretation that low barometric pressure is associated with an increase in impulsive behaviours. Additional investigation is warranted.","[{'authorId': '83798892', 'name': 'T.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the association of spirituality and symptoms of depression in primary care outpatients. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was performed of a dataset using 509 primary care outpatients who participated in an instrument validity study in the Kansas City (US) area. Patients were administered the Zung Depression Scale (ZDS) and the Spirituality Index of Well-Being (SIWB) in the waiting area before or after their appointment. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the relationship between the factors of interest and depressive symptoms. Results: In bivariate analyses, less insurance coverage (P < 0.01) and greater spirituality (P < 0.01) were associated with less reported depressive symptoms. In a model adjusted for covariates, spirituality (P < 0.01) remained independently associated with less symptoms.

This hierarchical sensorimotor architecture coincides with the limbic cortical architecture that underlies emotions, and thus we regard interoceptive feelings and their conjoint motivations as homeostatic emotions. We describe how bivalent feelings, emotions and sympathovagal balance can be organized and regulated efficiently in the bicameral forebrain as asymmetric positive/negative, approach/avoidance and parasympathetic/sympathetic components. We provide original evidence supporting this organization from studies of cardiorespiratory vagal activity in monkeys and functional imaging studies in healthy humans showing activation modulated by paced breathing and passively viewed emotional images.

Method: The subjects were 42 inpatients with the diagnosis of BPD and 17 OPD controls. Lifetime patterns of self-destructive behaviour were assessed using the Lifetime Borderline Symptom Index. Childhood experiences were assessed using a semistructured interview by raters who were blind to diagnosis. Results: Chronic self-destructive behaviour discriminated patients with BPD from OPD controls. In the borderline group, parental sexual abuse was significantly related to suicidal behaviour and both parental sexual abuse and emotional neglect were significantly related to self-mutilation. Conclusion: Both parental sexual abuse and emotional neglect appear to play a role in the etiology of self-destructive behaviour in BPD. The results highlight the importance of considering the effects of sexual abuse within its environmental context and suggest that the etiology of borderline symptoms is likely multifactorial.","[{'authorId': '7990678', 'name': 'Elyse D Dubo'}, {'authorId': '4223452', 'name': 'M.

A camera positioned below a translucent robot skin captures shadows generated from human touch and infers social gestures from the captured images. This approach enables rich tactile interaction with robots without the need for the sensor arrays used in traditional social robot tactile skins. It also supports the use of touch interaction with non-rigid robots, achieves high-resolution sensing for robots with different sizes and shape of surfaces, and removes the requirement of direct contact with the robot. We demonstrate the idea with an inflatable robot and a standing-alone testing device, an algorithm for recognizing touch gestures from shadows that uses Densely Connected Convolutional Networks, and an algorithm for tracking positions of touch and hovering shadows. Our experiments show that the system can distinguish between six touch gestures under three lighting conditions with 87.5 − 96.0% accuracy, depending on the lighting, and can accurately track touch positions as well as infer motion activities in realistic interaction conditions.

METHOD: A convenience sample of adult patients of an urban primary care clinic completed a self-administered questionnaire consisting of the Zung Depression Scale and the Spiritual Involvement and Beliefs Scale (SIBS). RESULTS: Among 122 respondents, 99 (81%) reported that they consider themselves religious. Responses from the Zung Depression Scale found that 76 (62%) of the patients were depressed and 46 (38%) were not. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the Zung Depression Scale and the SIBS was -0.36 (p <.0001). Backward stepwise regression analysis revealed that SIBS score and physical health predicted the Zung Depression Scale score. Age, gender, ethnicity, religious affiliation, and income showed no significant association with depression. Analysis of individual SIBS items revealed that high spirituality scores on items in the domain of intrinsic beliefs, such as belief in a higher power (p <.01), the importance of prayer (p <.0001), and finding meaning in times of hardship (p <.05), were associated negatively with depression. Attendance of religious services had no significant association with depression.

Results, based on 168 independent samples (N = 51,235 individuals), indicated that OCBs are related to a number of individual-level outcomes, including managerial ratings of employee performance, reward allocation decisions, and a variety of withdrawal-related criteria (e.g., employee turnover intentions, actual turnover, and absenteeism). In addition, OCBs were found to be related (k = 38; N = 3,611 units) to a number of organizational-level outcomes (e.g., productivity, efficiency, reduced costs, customer satisfaction, and unit-level turnover).

I AN ERA OF CONSTANT DISTRACTIONS in the form of portable phones, CD players, computers, and televisions for even young children, it is hardly surprising to discover that many students have not learned to self-regulate their academic studying very well. Consider the case of Tracy, a high school student who is infatuated with MTV. An important mid-term math exam is two weeks away, and she has begun to study while listening to popular music “to relax her.” Tracy has not set any study goals for herself—instead she simply tells herself to do as well as she can on the test. She uses no specific learning strategies for condensing and memorizing important material and does not plan out her study time, so she ends up cramming for a few hours before the test. She has only vague self-evaluative standards and cannot gauge her academic preparation accurately. Tracy attributes her learning difficulties to an inherent lack of mathematical ability and is very defensive about her poor study methods. However, she does not ask for help from others because she is afraid of “looking stupid,” or seek out supplementary materials from the library because she “already has too much to learn.” She finds studying to be anxiety-provoking, has little self-confidence in achieving success, and sees little intrinsic value in acquiring mathematical skill. Self-regulation researchers have sought to understand students like Tracy and to provide help in developing key processes that she lacks, such as goal setting, time management, learning strategies, self-evaluation, self-attributions, seeking help or information, and important self-motivational beliefs, such as self-efficacy and intrinsic task interest. In recent years, there have been exciting discoveries regarding the nature, origins, and development of how students regulate their own learning processes (Zimmerman & Schunk, 2001). Although these studies have clearly revealed how self-regulatory processes lead to success in school, few teachers currently prepare students to learn on their own. In this article, I discuss students’ self-regulation as a way to compensate for their individual differences in learning, define the essential qualities of academic self-regulation, describe the structure and function of self-regulatory processes, and, finally, give an overview of methods for guiding students to learn on their own.","[{'authorId': '12321217', 'name': 'B.

53675eb969ad590ff59eaa5d7ccbbc950ad2496b,"Intelligent autonomous agents, designed to automate and simplify many aspects of our society, will increasingly be required to also interact with other agents autonomously. Where agents interact, they are likely to encounter resource constraints. For example, agents managing household appliances to optimize electricity usage might need to share the limited capacity of the distribution grid. This thesis describes research into new algorithms for optimizing the behavior of agents operating in constrained environments, when these agents have significant uncertainty about the effects of their actions on their state. Such systems are effectively modeled in a framework of constrained multi-agent Markov decision processes (MDPs). A single-agent MDP model captures the uncertainty in the outcome of the actions chosen by a specific agent. It does so by providing a probabilistic model of state transitions, describing the likelihood of arriving in a future state, conditional on the current state and action. Agents collect different rewards or penalties depending on the current state and chosen action, informing their objective of maximizing their expected reward. To include constraints, resource consumption functions are added to the actions, and the agents' (shared) objective is modified with a condition restricting their (cumulative) resource consumption. We propose novel algorithms to advance the state of the art in three challenging settings: computing static preallocations off-line, computing dynamic (re)allocations on-line, and optimally learning model dynamics through safe reinforcement learning under the constraints. Taken together, these algorithms show how agents can coordinate their actions under uncertainty and shared resource constraints in a broad range of conditions. Furthermore, the proposed solutions are complementary: static preallocations can be used as back-up strategy for when a communication disruption prevents the use of dynamic allocations.","[{'authorId': '2863060', 'name': 'F.

To increase the feasibility and wearability of EmotionMeter in real-world applications, we design a six-electrode placement above the ears to collect electroencephalography (EEG) signals. We combine EEG and eye movements for integrating the internal cognitive states and external subconscious behaviors of users to improve the recognition accuracy of EmotionMeter. The experimental results demonstrate that modality fusion with multimodal deep neural networks can significantly enhance the performance compared with a single modality, and the best mean accuracy of 85.11% is achieved for four emotions (happy, sad, fear, and neutral). We explore the complementary characteristics of EEG and eye movements for their representational capacities and identify that EEG has the advantage of classifying happy emotion, whereas eye movements outperform EEG in recognizing fear emotion. To investigate the stability of EmotionMeter over time, each subject performs the experiments three times on different days. EmotionMeter obtains a mean recognition accuracy of 72.39% across sessions with the six-electrode EEG and eye movement features. These experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of EmotionMeter within and between sessions.","[{'authorId': '3108302', 'name': 'Wei-Long Zheng'}, {'authorId': '2157221046', 'name': 'Wei Liu'}, {'authorId': '2141538523', 'name': 'Yifei Lu'}, {'authorId': '1715839', 'name': 'Bao-Liang Lu'}, {'authorId': '145683892', 'name': 'A.

Central to group continuation are occasions of collective hedonic satisfaction that encourage attachment. These times are popularly labeled fun. While groupness can be the cause of fun, we emphasize the effects of fun, as understood by participants. Shared enjoyment, located in temporal and spatial affordances, creates conditions for communal identification. Such moments serve as commitment devices, building affiliation, modeling positive relations, and moderating interpersonal tension. Further, they encourage retrospective narration, providing an appealing past, an assumed future, and a sense of groupness. The rhetoric of fun supports interactional smoothness in the face of potential ruptures. Building on the authors’ field observations and other ethnographies, we argue that both the experience and recall of fun bolster group stability.

A qualitative study of a bill-collection organization was used to identify norms about the emotions that collectors are expected to convey to debtors and the means used by the organization to maintain such norms given that collectors' expressed emotions are simultaneously influenced by their inner feelings. These data indicate that collectors are selected, socialized, and rewarded for following the general norm of conveying urgency (high arousal with a hint of irritation) to debtors. Collectors are further socialized and rewarded to adjust their expressed emotions in response to variations in debtor demeanor. These contingent norms sometimes clash with collectors' feelings toward debtors. Bill collectors are taught to cope with such emotive dissonance by using cognitive appraisals that help them become emotionally detached from debtors and by releasing unpleasant feelings without communicating these emotions to debtors.

Younger and older participants were asked to recall two specific memories of each type and then to rate their memories on several sensorial (e.g., visual, taste) and contextual (e.g., location, time) characteristics. The authors found that emotional (both positive and negative) memories contained more sensorial and contextual details than neutral memories in both age groups, whereas positive and negative memories did not differ on most dimensions. In addition, negative memories were associated with a higher intensity of positive feelings and a reduced complexity of storyline in older as compared to younger adults. These results suggest that the effect of emotion on phenomenal characteristics of autobiographical memories is similar in younger and older adults, but that older adults tend to reappraise negative events in a more positive light than younger adults.","[{'authorId': '4829547', 'name': 'Christine Comblain'}, {'authorId': '1395736745', 'name': ""A.

In this paper, we evaluate a number of automatic speech recognition (ASR) engines under a variety of conditions, inspired by real-world social HRI conditions. Using the data collected we demonstrate that there is still much work to be done in ASR for child speech, with interactions relying solely on this modality still out of reach.

To examine the experiences of compassion fatigue, burnout, and compassion satisfaction among oncology nurses in the United States and Canada.  .


DESIGN
Quantitative, descriptive, nonexperimental. .


SETTING
Online survey with members from the Canadian Association of Nursing Oncology and the Oncology Nursing Society. .


SAMPLE
486 American and 63 Canadian practicing oncology nurses. .


METHODS
The Professional Quality of Life (ProQOL) scale, version 5, and modified Abendroth Demographic Questionnaire were administered through FluidSurveys™, an online data collection instrument. Chi-square tests of independence were used to investigate associations between demographic characteristics, health, personal stressors, and work-related characteristics to experiences of compassion fatigue, burnout, and compassion satisfaction. Compassion fatigue was measured using the subscales of secondary traumatic stress and burnout.  .


MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES
Compassion fatigue, burnout, and compassion satisfaction. .


FINDINGS
Demographic characteristics were similar in American and Canadian participants, and both cohorts reported comparable levels of compassion fatigue, burnout, and compassion satisfaction. Perception of team cohesiveness within the workplace environment was found to be significant for both groups, as indicated by significant relationships in all three subscales of secondary traumatic stress, burnout, and compassion satisfaction in the ProQOL. .


CONCLUSIONS
Healthy and supportive work environments are imperative to nurses' health, well-being, and satisfaction. Improvements in the workplace can help prevent negative sequelae, as well as improve health outcomes for patients and nurses, decrease nurse turnover, and reduce healthcare expenditures.  .

Negative mood, sadness, tension and instability of emotions were found to be antecedents of BE in an adult BED‐obese sample. However, findings were mixed regarding the role of stress, anger and positive emotions within the BED‐obese population.

We informed our authors that we would provide the introductory framework to neurobiology so as to give them the flexibility to focus with more specificity on their respective topic areas. The dizzying pace of development and advancing literature in a number of converging fields makes the study of neurobiology and clinical work an exciting and daunting task. We recognize that literature from the broad fields of attachment theory, infant research, trauma theory, cognitive neuroscience, relational theory, relational analytic trauma theory, and nonlinear dynamic systems theory (to name a few) are converging in a synergistic and interesting manner. These theories underscore that human beings are resilient and that change is possible across the life cycle, even if individuals have experienced unfortunate traumatic beginnings. We use the term neurobiology to discuss current research findings on brain structure and function(s). We agree with Louis Cozolino (2006) when he suggested that there is no such thing as a “single brain” and that an individual’s brain and mind functions, which effect a multitude of intrapsychic and interpersonal factors, are fundamentally shaped in interaction with other people. There are many implications to this statement—this article illuminates some of these implications, especially as they inform clinical work based on the understanding that the treatment relationship is a central component of change in brain functioning that leads to therapeutic change with a diverse range of clients. The purpose of this article is twofold. First, we outline some “brain basics” that give the reader foundational knowledge of neurobiology. Second, we briefly discuss the importance of “relationship” as the foundation for change in brain function.","[{'authorId': '82003814', 'name': 'Dennis Miehls'}, {'authorId': '52509524', 'name': 'J.

Environmental design, technology and assistive devices have the potential to complement care, help address some of the challenges presented by this growing need and impact on the lived experience of this vulnerable population. This systematic review was undertaken to identify the research on the use of electronic assistive technology within long-term residential care settings. A total of 3229 papers published from the inception of each of the databases up until May 2016 were retrieved from searches in four major databases. Sixty-one were identified to be included in the review. The inclusion criteria were: original peer reviewed journals; an electronic assistive technology intervention; with residents or tenants living with dementia or their family or paid caregivers; in supported living environments or residential care. The data extracted from the included studies focused on the methodology, technology, outcomes and the role of people living with dementia within the research. Overall, an extensive variety of technical interventions were found, with a broad range of methodological heterogeneity to explore their effect. Additionally, wide-spanning outcomes to support the potential of technology solutions and the challenges presented by such intervention were found.","[{'authorId': '20563305', 'name': 'Jean Daly Lynn'}, {'authorId': '1405195463', 'name': 'J.

First, it aims to test whether the effect of lettering case on investment intentions is mediated by trustworthiness. Second, the study will examine if this process is moderated by color temperature.,Following the behavioral research method, this study employed a 2 (the fully-lowercase slogan vs the initial-uppercase slogan) by 2 (warm-color design vs cool-color design) full factorial between-subject design. Two hundred participants were recruited for the experiment to test the hypotheses.,For the lowercase slogans (vs uppercase slogans), we found that people tended to have a high level of perceived trustworthiness, which led to a high level of investment intentions. In addition, the indirect effect of the lettering case on investment intentions through the perceived trustworthiness was moderated by color temperature. Specifically, the visually warm advertisement (vs visually cool design) would strengthen the effect of lowercase slogans on customers' investment intentions.,When people make a financial decision with limited, incomplete or overly complex information, simplified visual heuristics, rather than rational algorithmic processing, play a significant role in their decision-making process. However, only a limited amount of research has addressed the effect of the lettering case on customers' perceptions and the consequent decision-making process from a financial advertising perspective.

Experiment 1 compared a colorful and a gray room, whereas in experiments 2 and 3 red and blue rooms were compared. The results indicate that the color of an interior space will have effects on many different levels. The perception of the room itself was affected, and the colors also had an impact on the emotions and physiology of those who stayed in the rooms. Strong, especially red, colors and patterns put the brain into a more excited state, sometimes to such an extent as to cause a paradoxical slowing of the heart rate. Introvert persons, as well as those already in a negative mood, became more affected than others, which caused severe changes in their performance. The series of experiments described here were among the first to be carried out in full-scale rooms painted or otherwise decorated in various colors. One practical implication is that a moderate use of good color design will serve to improve the overall mood and well-being of people.

Our aim in this paper was to manipulate the Regulatory Focus Theory to assess its impact on the induction of regulatory focus related emotions in children in a pretend play scenario with a social robot. The Regulatory Focus Theory suggests that people follow one of two paradigms while attempting to achieve a goal; by seeking gains (promotion focus - associated with feelings of happiness) or by avoiding losses (prevention focus - associated with feelings of fear). We conducted a study with 69 school children in two different conditions (promotion vs. prevention). We succeeded in inducing happiness emotions in the promotion condition and found a resulting positive effect of the induction on children’s social engagement with the robot.

These 2 components of semantic cognition—representation and control—are commonly linked to left temporal and prefrontal cortex, respectively. This simple proposal, however, remains contentious because in most functional neuroimaging studies to date, the number of concepts being activated and the involvement of executive processes during retrieval are confounded. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined a task in which semantic representation and control demands were dissociable. Words with multiple meanings like “bank” served as targets in a double-prime paradigm, in which multiple meaning activation and maximal executive demands loaded onto different priming conditions. Anterior inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) was sensitive to the number of meanings that were retrieved, suggesting a role for this region in semantic representation, while posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) and inferior frontal cortex showed greater activation in conditions that maximized executive demands. These results support a functional dissociation between left ITG and pMTG, consistent with a revised neural organization in which left prefrontal and posterior temporal areas work together to underpin aspects of semantic control.","[{'authorId': '13168864', 'name': 'C.

By adopting a coin entrustment game, we quantitatively measure trust and cooperation to see if such phenomena emerge differently when a person believes they are playing a robot rather than another human. We found that while people cooperate with other humans and robots at a similar rate, they grow to trust robots more completely than humans. As a possible explanation for these differences, our survey results suggest that participants perceive humans as having faculty for feelings and sympathy, whereas they perceive robots as being more precise and reliable.","[{'authorId': '2109186113', 'name': 'Jane Wu'}, {'authorId': '3364631', 'name': 'Erin Paeng'}, {'authorId': '119205236', 'name': 'Kari Linder'}, {'authorId': '49421872', 'name': 'Piercarlo Valdesolo'}, {'authorId': '2614066', 'name': 'James C.

This is particularly true in advanced robotic projects: the objective here is to deliver a system that integrates all the hardware and software components, is capable of autonomous behaviour, and needs to be deployed in real-world scenarios toward providing an impact on future research and, ultimately, on society. On the other hand, in recent years there has been a growing interest for techniques related to software integration, but these have been mostly applied to the IT commercial domain.This paper presents the work performed in the context of the project CARESSES, a multidisciplinary research project focusing on socially assistive robotics that involves 9 partners from the EU and Japan. Given the complexity of the project, a huge importance has been placed on software integration, task planning and architecture definition since the first stages of the work: to this aim, some of the practices commonly used in the commercial domain for software integration, such as merging software from the early stage, have been applied. As a case study, the document describes the steps which have been followed in the first year of the project discussing strengths and weaknesses of this approach.","[{'authorId': '23183064', 'name': 'Roberto Menicatti'}, {'authorId': '2688386', 'name': 'C.

With regard to prevention-focused states, research evidence is less consistent, with some findings suggesting prevention-focused states promote creativity and other findings pointing to no or even negative effects. We proposed and tested the hypothesis that whether prevention-focused states boost creativity depends on regulatory closure (whether a goal is fulfilled or not). We predicted that prevention-focused states that activate the individual (unfulfilled prevention goals, fear) would lead to similar levels of creativity as promotion-focused states but that prevention-focused states that deactivate (closed prevention goals, relief) would lead to lower levels of creativity. Moreover, we predicted that this effect would be mediated by feelings of activation. Predictions were tested in 3 studies on creative insights and 1 on original ideation.

However, understanding how social and emotional skills are learned, and how this process can be supported by technology, is an important but underresearched area in HCI so far. To address this gap, we review existing approaches to social and emotions skills learning (SEL) in other fields, with a specific focus on SEL in education, in which a large number of evidence-based programs is widely deployed. In doing so, the primary aim of this article is to provide a foundation and set an agenda for future research on the design of technology that would support, and help teach, social and emotional skills. We identify the key challenges to successful learning shared by SEL programs in education—such as embedding skills learned in class also into everyday situations, promoting reflection, and providing additional opportunities for practice—and outline how these could be addressed by digital technology. Overall, our key argument is that much existing HCI work could be used in support of social and emotional skills learning in education, and possibly other domains, but that the topic has not been explored so far. We also highlight how the focus on supporting SEL would bring novel opportunities and challenges for HCI, as well as provide a basis for a strong HCI research agenda in this space.","[{'authorId': '2971246', 'name': 'P.

573cb4ad559ffe14db775217b8820b750686fa5b,"Decreased heart rate variability (HRV) is a cardiovascular predictor of mortality. Recent debate has focused on whether reductions in HRV in major depressive disorder (MDD) are a consequence of the disorder or a consequence of pharmacotherapy. Here we report on the impact of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-pharmacological intervention, vs. sertraline to further investigate this issue. The employed design was a double-blind, randomized, factorial, placebo-controlled trial. One hundred and eighteen moderate-to-severe, medication-free, low-cardiovascular risk depressed patients were recruited for this study and allocated to either active/sham tDCS (10 consecutive sessions plus two extra sessions every other week) or placebo/sertraline (50 mg/d) for 6 wk. Patients were age and gender-matched to healthy controls from a concurrent cohort study [the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil)]. The impact of disorder, treatment and clinical response on HRV (root mean square of successive differences and high frequency) was examined. Our findings confirmed that patients displayed decreased HRV relative to controls. Furthermore, HRV scores did not change following treatment with either a non-pharmacological (tDCS) or pharmacological (sertraline) intervention, nor did HRV increase with clinical response to treatment.

Two analyses requiring shared personal goals are rejected, since they fail to explain how people walking together have obligations and rights to appropriate behavior, and corresponding rights of rebuke. An alternative account is proposed: those who walk together must constitute the ""plural subject"" of a goal (roughly, their walking alongside each other).

Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity.
 MEASUREMENTS: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as “0” (not at all) to “3” (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients.
 RESULTS: As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score ≥10 had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples.
 CONCLUSION: In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.","[{'authorId': '3737608', 'name': 'K. Kroenke'}, {'authorId': '2069763', 'name': 'R.

588e300eb2d560c7b0bd2709291b5da814fe4d25,"Appropriate affect expression on robots is important in using robots to interact with humans. A pilot study was conducted to examine the recognition of emotive eye shape on the Nao as well as whether the addition of eye shape to emotive gestures would improve recognition of emotion. A comparison was made between the recognition and classification of emotive eye shapes, gestures, and the combination of both into a multimodal display. The combined display of both gesture and eye shape to convey emotion was more consistently recognized than either modality alone. The information gathered from the pilot study will be used to inform future interactive work with the Nao. Introduction Humanoid robots tend to have several modes of expression, but this doesn’t mean that they are all always necessary, nor does it mean that they must always be used the same way. It is important to explore different means of expression available to different robots to evaluate their desirability for use in human-robot interactions. This work focuses on the evaluation of emotion synthesis and sought to incorporate emotive eye shapes into emotional displays on the Aldebaran Nao to improve the recognition of affect in those displays. The Nao is a well-established platform in the field of robotics and human-robot interaction. It is used for its relatively low cost, portability, and expressive capabilities. The six emotive gestures and six corresponding eye shapes implemented here display the six basic emotions defined by Ekman and Friesen: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust (Ekman and Friesen, 1971). These displays were evaluated based on recognition in a pilot study. Related Work Emotive gestures have been implemented on several different robots (Li et al., 2009; Manohar et al., 2011) that often have no or limited facial expression. Many robots that use emotive facial expressions alone have more detailed faces or are simply faces without bodies (Arai et al., 2003; Sosnowski et al., 2006; Ribiero et al., 2011). Much previous work has been done using the Nao to convey emotion. Most of this work has involved developing emotional displays for the Nao using only gesture (Beck et al., 2010a; Beck et al., 2010b; Cohen and Neerincx, 2011), but some have gone further and incorporated other modalities available to the Nao, such as light (Haring et al., 2011; Monceau et al., 2009) and sound (Haring et al., 2011). Published emotional displays have mostly been found to be recognizable by subjects, and in fact, the recognition of emotive gestures used by the Nao was Technical Report 1 Study originally conducted Dec 2011 found to be just as good as the recognition of emotive facial expressions by the iCat, a robot that is limited to only facial movement (Cohen and Neerincx, 2011). Previous works that used the Nao's eye LEDs to convey emotion along with gesture have only manipulated the color of the LEDs (Haring et al., 2011; Monceau et al., 2009). In both cases, the purpose of changing the color of the Nao's eyes during emotive gestures was to emphasize the emotion being displayed by using a color that is normally associated with that emotion, such as red for anger. However, the emotional interpretation of color is a complicated subject and actually presents a large area of research. According to Manav's work in color-emotion associations, people have drastically different reaction to color depending on chroma, saturation, and brightness (2007). For example, the color blue is traditionally associated with sadness, but shades of green were found to be more depressive than blue in this study (Manav, 2007). Because of the amount of previous work that has explored coloring the Nao's eyes and the vagueness of published work on color-emotion associations, a new direction was used in this study instead. There are more functions of the Nao's eye LEDs than just changing color. This work instead explores the use of eye shape in emphasizing emotive gestures displayed by the Nao. Unlike color, eye shape has emotion associations well-documented by Ekman (1972) as well as others discussed below (Lundqvist et al., 1999; Baron-Cohen and Wheelwright, 1997). The following sections discuss the derivation of the eye shapes and emotive gestures displayed by the Nao. Implementation For this study, eye shapes and gestures were created for the each of the six basic emotions, happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise, described by Ekman and Friesen (1971). These emotions were chosen because they have been well studied and there is much literature available about how they are displayed. The main theoretical perspective discussed in class that this project builds upon is work by Ekman, which was used in determining some of the eye shapes (1972). Neutral Pose/Eye shape In addition to the six emotional eye shapes and poses, a neutral pose and eye shape was needed as an intermediary between each emotional display. The neutral pose was set to be the Nao in a standing position with its legs straight and arms down at its sides as seen in Figure 1. The neutral eye shape was created to be similar to shape of human eyes in a neutral position. In this position the top eyelids are slightly lower than the fully open position (Tian, Kanade, and Cohn, 2001). The neutral eye shape on the Nao mimics this by turning off the three upper LEDs in the Nao’s eyes as seen in Figure 2. Another reason for partially closing the upper lids of the eye for neutral rather than mimicking the eye being completely open and turning on all the LEDs is that it allows for a distinction between the surprise eye shape, where all the LEDs are on, and neutral. It is important for these eye shapes to be different because if they were not, then this would introduce confounds when comparing the emotional displays created with the gestures to those created with both the gestures and the eye shapes. Gestures The gesture poses created in this study were based off of three studies. One was a study by Coulson where static images of mannequins in many different postures were rated by participants Technical Report 2 Study originally conducted Dec 2011 as conveying different emotions (2004). The poses with the highest concordance rating for each of the six emotions were used as a basis for the gestures here (Coulson, 2004). A study by Kleinsmith and Silva where two dimensional rendered avatars in different poses were rated by participants was also used as a basis for the gestures here (2006). Written descriptions of different postures that correspond to emotions were also used (Wallbott, 1998). Happiness This gesture was created by keeping the arms straight and raising them slightly in front of the head in a V shape as seen in Figure 1. This arm position was based off the arm position of the pose with the highest concordance for happiness in Coulson’s study (2004). The mannequin in this pose was also leaning back slightly with the head tilted backwards (Coulson, 2004). These aspects of the pose, however, were not included due to the physical limitations of the Nao robot. The two dimensional rendered avatar in the study by Kleinsmith and Silva expressing joy also had a similar arm movement (2006). Raising the arms is also described for “elated joy” (Wallbott, 1998). Sadness This gesture was created by bending the knees, slightly opening the hands, and bending the torso forward as seen in Figure 1. Bent knees and bending the torso forward were based off the poses of sadness for both the mannequins and avatars (Coulson, 2004; Kleinsmith and Silva, 2006). Wallbott describes the upper body as being “collapsed” for the sadness gesture, which also supports leaning the torso forward (1998). Anger This gesture was created by bending the arms and putting the closed hands on the hips as seen in Figure 1. This gesture was based on Kleinsmith and Silva’s avatar for anger which has one arm in this position (2006). Instead of following the pose of this avatar completely with the other arm in a raised position, both arms were put into the bent with hand on hip position in order to make the gesture symmetrical. Fear This gesture was created by bending the knees, moving the right foot backwards slightly, and putting the hands slightly in front of the face with the arms bent as seen in Figure 1. The step back and bent knees are based off the mannequin with highest concordance for fear in Coulson’s study (2004). The positions of the arms and hands are similar to the positions of the arms and hands of the avatar for fear (Kleinsmith and Silva, 2006). This avatar also has one foot behind the other with the knees bent (Kleinsmith and Silva, 2006). Disgust This gesture was created by moving the right foot backwards, raising the arms in a straight and parallel position to the front, opening the hands slightly, and turning the head to the right as seen in Figure 1. The arms in front and foot backwards are based off the mannequin pose for disgust (Coulson, 2004). The position of this mannequin also involves leaning the head and torso backwards (Coulson, 2004). Because leaning the head backwards a noticeable amount and leaning the torso backwards without causing the robot to fall backwards is not physically possible an alternative head position was used. Instead, the head was turned to the right because this is similar to a head shake, which has been used to express negative emotions (Lee and Marsella, 2006). Technical Report 3 Study originally conducted Dec 2011 Surprise This gesture was created by moving the arms up above the head, slightly bending the elbows, and slightly bending the knees as seen in Figure 1. The position of the arms slightly bent and above the head was based off the mannequin with the most concordance for surprise in Coulson’s study (2004). The avatar in Kleinsmith and Silva’s study was also in a position with the arms raised (2006). The mannequin is also shown with one leg behind the other (Coulson, 2004)","[{'authorId': '1722137', 'name': 'Jillian Greczek'}, {'authorId': '1403930674', 'name': 'Katelyn Swift-Spong'}, {'authorId': '1742183', 'name': 'M.

58c4cacf750d310b2c18c80f06b3720ed7fb1edb,"Background The ability to decode emotional information from facial expressions is crucial for successful social interaction. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by serious problems in interpersonal relationships and emotional functioning. Empirical research on facial emotion recognition in BPD has been sparsely published and results are inconsistent. To specify emotion recognition deficits in BPD more closely, the present study implemented two emotion recognition tasks differing in response format. Method Nineteen patients with BPD and 19 healthy subjects were asked to evaluate the emotional content of visually presented stimuli (emotional and neutral faces). The first task, the Fear Anger Neutral (FAN) Test, required a rapid discrimination between negative or neutral facial expressions whereas in the second task, the Emotion Recognition (ER) Test, a precise decision regarding default emotions (sadness, happiness, anger, fear and neutral) had to be achieved without a time limit. Results In comparison to healthy subjects, BPD patients showed a deficit in emotion recognition only in the fast discrimination of negative and neutral facial expressions (FAN Test). Consistent with earlier findings, patients demonstrated a negative bias in the evaluation of neutral facial expressions. When processing time was unlimited (ER Test), BPD patients performed as well as healthy subjects in the recognition of specific emotions. In addition, an association between performance in the fast discrimination task (FAN Test) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) co-morbidity was indicated. Conclusions Our data suggest a selective deficit of BPD patients in rapid and direct discrimination of negative and neutral emotional expressions that may underlie difficulties in social interactions.","[{'authorId': '3108830', 'name': 'M.

Each day we face decisions in which we must accurately assess another individual's trustworthiness or risk suffering very real consequences. In a global marketplace of increasing heterogeneity with respect to nationality, race, and multiple other social categories, it is of great value to understand how implicitly held attitudes about group membership may support or undermine social trust and thereby implicitly shape the decisions we make. Recent behavioral and neuroimaging work suggests that a common mechanism may underlie the expression of implicit race bias and evaluations of trustworthiness, although no direct evidence of a connection exists. In two behavioral studies, we investigated the relationship between implicit race attitude (as measured by the Implicit Association Test) and social trust. We demonstrate that race disparity in both an individual's explicit evaluations of trustworthiness and, more crucially, his or her economic decisions to trust is predicted by that person's bias in implicit race attitude. Importantly, this relationship is robust and is independent of the individual's bias in explicit race attitude. These data demonstrate that the extent to which an individual invests in and trusts others with different racial backgrounds is related to the magnitude of that individual's implicit race bias. The core dimension of social trust can be shaped, to some degree, by attitudes that reside outside conscious awareness and intention.","[{'authorId': '40363678', 'name': 'D.

This technique addresses some limitations of existing techniques: they do not provide a lightweight method of interacting with objects of widely varying sizes, and many limit the objects that can be selected and the manipulations possible after making a selection. With the Voodoo Dolls technique, the user dynamically creates dolls: transient, hand held copies of objects whose effects on the objects they represent are determined by the hand holding them. For simplicity, we assume a right-handed user in the following discussion. When a user holds a doll in his right hand and moves it relative to a doll in his left hand, the object represented by the doll in his right hand moves to the same position and orientation relative to the object represented by the doll in his left hand. The system scales the dolls so that the doll in the left hand is half a meter along its longest dimension and the other dolls maintain the same relative size; this allows the user to work seamlessly at multiple scales. The Voodoo Dolls technique also allows both visible and occluded objects to be selected, and provides a stationary frame of reference for working relative to moving objects.","[{'authorId': '4630329', 'name': 'Jeffrey S.

The aim of this study was to use a quantitative meta‐analytic technique to synthesise the results of much of this research. Methods: Three separate quantitative meta‐analytical studies were conducted using the Activation Likelihood Estimation technique. Analysis was performed on three types of studies: (1) those conducted at rest comparing brain activation in patients with depression and controls; (2) those involving brain changes following antidepressant treatment; and (3) those comparing brain activation patterns induced by the induction of positive or negative emotion in patients with depression compared with controls. Results: There appears to be a complex series of areas of the brain implicated in the pathophysiology of depression although limited overlap was found across imaging paradigms. This included a network of regions including frontal and temporal cortex as well as the insula and cerebellum that are hypoactive in depressed subjects and in which there is increase in activity with treatment. There was a corresponding set of subcortical and limbic regions in which opposite changes were found. Conclusions: There is limited overlap between the brain regions identified using differing imaging methods. The most consistently identified regions include areas of the anterior cingulate, dorsolateral, medial and inferior prefrontal cortex, insula, superior temporal gyrus, basal ganglia and cerebellum. Further research is required to identify if different imaging methods are identifying complementary networks that are equally involved in the disorder.

58d4d81bdfd119371c6f3d41725f2f26bad711aa,"High performance adaptive solutions are capable of responding to the dynamic nature of users and context. These innovative and dynamic systems are steadily gaining ground over ubiquitous ‘best fit’ static models. These architectural elements often exist beyond the scope of mainstream building standards and traditional methods for data representation or communication. This presents major challenges to a highly standardized and compartmentalized industry in which ‘innovation’ is limited to a few signature practices that design iconic yet expensive structures, which often prioritize aesthetics over performance. This paper offers an overview of the benefits that integrated dynamic systems bring to buildings. Through an examination of an applied practice, this paper offers guidelines for communicating complex geometry in a clear design language across interdisciplinary collaborations. The use of diagrammatic grammar to translate underlying algorithmic rules into instructions for design allows complex, innovative solutions to be realized more effectively. The ideas presented here are based on the design principles of the competition-winning scheme of the Al-Bahr Towers. As lead consultant in Innovation Design & Research at AHR (former Aedas-UK), Abdulmajid Karanouh designed and spearheaded this project in close collaboration with Arup.

We investigated the effect of expressive suppression and emotional reappraisal on strategic decision-making in a social interactive task, that is, the Ultimatum Game. As hypothesized, participants in the emotional reappraisal condition accepted unfair offers more often than participants in the suppression and no-regulation condition. Additionally, the effect of emotional reappraisal influenced the amount of money participants proposed during a second interaction with partners that had treated them unfairly in a previous interaction. These results support and extend previous findings that emotional reappraisal as compared to expressive suppression, is a powerful regulation strategy that influences and changes how we interact with others even in the face of inequity.","[{'authorId': '1401357370', 'name': ""M.

However, the human involvement in MCS results in a high possibility for unintentionally contributing corrupted and falsified data or intentionally spreading disinformation for malevolent purposes, consequently undermining IoT services. Therefore, recruiting trustworthy contributors plays a crucial role in collecting high-quality data and providing a better quality of services while minimizing the vulnerabilities and risks to MCS systems. In this paper, a novel trust model called experience–reputation (E-R) is proposed for evaluating trust relationships between any two mobile device users in an MCS platform. To enable the E-R model, virtual interactions among the users are manipulated by considering an assessment of the quality of contributed data from such users. Based on these interactions, two indicators of trust called experience and reputation are calculated accordingly. By incorporating the experience and reputation trust indicators (TIs), trust relationships between the users are established, evaluated, and maintained. Based on these trust relationships, a novel trust-based recruitment scheme is carried out for selecting the most trustworthy MCS users to contribute to data sensing tasks. In order to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed trust-based mechanism as well as the E-R trust model, we deploy several recruitment schemes in an MCS testbed, which consists of both normal and malicious users. The results highlight the strength of the trust-based scheme as it delivers a better quality for MCS services while being able to detect malicious users. We believe that the trust-based user recruitment offers an effective capability for selecting trustworthy users for various MCS systems and, importantly, the proposed mechanism is practical to deploy in the real world.","[{'authorId': '10421619', 'name': 'N.

In Experiment 1, faces looking directly at the perceiver were rated as more attractive and as more trustworthy. In Experiment 2, when the direct gaze condition was omitted, faces that were looked at by another face were judged as more trustworthy. In Experiment 3a, participants did not remember the directions of gaze of two faces, demonstrating the dependence of the judgement on the actual situation and excluding a memory explanation.

Methods A qualitative review was undertaken by a literature search of the Medline database from 1970 to 2005 to identify studies evaluating the factors contributing to therapeutic non-compliance. Results A total of 102 articles was retrieved and used in the review from the 2095 articles identified by the literature review process. From the literature review, it would appear that the definition of therapeutic compliance is adequately resolved. The preliminary evaluation revealed a number of factors that contributed to therapeutic non-compliance. These factors could be categorized to patient-centered factors, therapy-related factors, social and economic factors, healthcare system factors, and disease factors. For some of these factors, the impact on compliance was not unequivocal, but for other factors, the impact was inconsistent and contradictory. Conclusion There are numerous studies on therapeutic noncompliance over the years. The factors related to compliance may be better categorized as “soft” and “hard” factors as the approach in countering their effects may differ. The review also highlights that the interaction of the various factors has not been studied systematically. Future studies need to address this interaction issue, as this may be crucial to reducing the level of non-compliance in general, and to enhancing the possibility of achieving the desired healthcare outcomes.","[{'authorId': '2115756621', 'name': 'Jing Jin'}, {'authorId': '32871136', 'name': 'G.

To evaluate the clinical utility of the narrative scoring scheme (NSS) as an index of narrative macrostructure for young school-age children.


METHOD
Oral retells of a wordless picture book were elicited from 129 typically developing children, ages 5-7. A series of correlations and hierarchical regression equations were completed using microstructural measures of vocabulary and grammar to predict NSS scores.


RESULTS
While the NSS was significantly correlated with age and each of the microstructural measures, the hierarchical regression analyses revealed a unique relationship between vocabulary and narrative macrostructure.


CONCLUSION
The NSS is an efficient and informative tool for documenting children's development of narrative macrostructure. The relationship between the NSS and microstructural measures demonstrates that it is a robust measure of children's overall oral narrative competence and a powerful tool for clinicians and researchers. The unique relationship between lexical diversity and the NSS confirmed that a special relationship exists between vocabulary and narrative organization skills in young school-age children.","[{'authorId': '49554070', 'name': 'John J Heilmann'}, {'authorId': '2116335694', 'name': 'Jon F.

Sensor networks capable of observing human-human interactions in the real world provide a potentially valuable and scalable source of interaction data that can be used for designing robot behavior. To that end, we present here a fully automated method for reproducing observed real-world social interactions with a robot. The proposed method includes techniques for characterizing the speech and locomotion observed in training interactions, using clustering to identify typical behavior elements and identifying spatial formations using established HRI proxemics models. Behavior logic is learned based on discretized actions captured from the sensor data stream, using a naïve Bayesian classifier. Finally, we propose techniques for reproducing robot speech and locomotion behaviors in a robust way, despite the natural variation of human behaviors and the large amount of sensor noise present in speech recognition. We show our technique in use, training a robot to play the role of a shop clerk in a simple camera shop scenario, and we demonstrate through a comparison experiment that our techniques successfully enabled the generation of socially appropriate speech and locomotion behavior. Notably, the performance of our technique in terms of correct behavior selection was found to be higher than the success rate of speech recognition, indicating its robustness to sensor noise.","[{'authorId': '2449095', 'name': 'Phoebe Liu'}, {'authorId': '2468090', 'name': 'Dylan F.

Using a software interface, children were asked to collaboratively create a story with the robot. We conducted a study with 38 children in two conditions. In one condition, the children interacted with a robot exhibiting creative behavior while in the other condition, they interacted with a robot exhibiting non creative behavior. The robot's creativity was defined as verbal and performance creativity. The robot's creative and non creative behaviors were extracted from a previously collected data set and were validated in an online survey with 100 participants. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, children's creativity measures were not higher in the creative condition than in the non creative condition. Our results suggest that merely the robot's creative behavior is insufficient to stimulate creativity in children in a child robot interaction. We further discuss other design factors that may facilitate sparking creativity in children in similar settings in the future.","[{'authorId': '28908289', 'name': 'Maha Elgarf'}, {'authorId': '1711959', 'name': 'Gabriel Skantze'}, {'authorId': '144687810', 'name': 'Christopher E.

Specifically, we wanted to analyse the association between emotion understanding and set shifting, due to the lack of studies with this EF. Data of 75 children aged 4½ years (52% boys) was collected in two laboratory visits. Emotion understanding was assessed using the Emotion Recognition Questionnaire, inhibitory control using the Head-Toes-Knees-Shoulders task and set shifting using a version of the Dimensional Change Card Sort task. IQ was evaluated using the WPPSI-R, language using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test – Revised; and ToM using six standardized tasks. Set shifting, but not inhibitory control, predicted emotion understanding, over and above mothers’ age, and children’s IQ, language ability, and ToM. Mothers’ age and children’s language ability were also significant predictors in the final regression model. Results suggest that the capacity to shift mental sets is linked with inter-individual differences in children’s understanding of situational causes of emotion. Therefore studying EFs as correlates of emotion understanding is an important focus of future research.","[{'authorId': '144815397', 'name': 'E. C. Martins'}, {'authorId': '46718729', 'name': 'A.

The authors examined the capacity of alexithymia to predict a broad range of psychiatric symptoms relative to that of other personality dimensions, age, and gender.


METHOD
The Toronto Alexithymia Scale, the Temperament and Character Inventory, and the SCL-90-R were administered to 254 psychiatric patients. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed.


RESULTS
The difficulties identifying feelings factor of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale significantly predicted all SCL-90-R subscale scores and was particularly effective, relative to the personality dimensions of the Temperament and Character Inventory, in predicting somatization. The Temperament and Character Inventory dimensions emerged as distinct and conceptually meaningful predictors for the different SCL-90-R subscales.

To date, several technologies have been explored to determine how a touch is perceived by a social robot, usually placing a large number of sensors throughout the robot’s shell. In this work, we introduce a novel approach, where the audio acquired from contact microphones located in the robot’s shell is processed using machine learning techniques to distinguish between different types of touches. The system is able to determine when the robot is touched (touch detection), and to ascertain the kind of touch performed among a set of possibilities: stroke, tap, slap, and tickle (touch classification). This proposal is cost-effective since just a few microphones are able to cover the whole robot’s shell since a single microphone is enough to cover each solid part of the robot. Besides, it is easy to install and configure as it just requires a contact surface to attach the microphone to the robot’s shell and plug it into the robot’s computer. Results show the high accuracy scores in touch gesture recognition. The testing phase revealed that Logistic Model Trees achieved the best performance, with an F-score of 0.81.

I identify Charles H. Cooley as an important precursor of the sociology of empathy, and discuss how contemporary interactionists have further developed this notion. Based on these previous insights, I next propose a preliminary framework for the study of the social construction of empathy. This framework is presented in two steps. First, I introduce a vocabulary based on interpretivist concepts: empathy frames, empathy rules, and empathy performances. Next, I coin the idea of empathy paths. I theorize three ideal-typical empathy paths: self-transcendent, therapeutic, and instrumental. Throughout this presentation, I use empirical cases to illustrate the applicability of this framework.

Approaches are presented from two viewpoints: the types of physical interactions that occur between the human and robot, and the types of sensors used to detect these interactions. We contribute a structure for the categorization of Tactile HRI research within each viewpoint. Tactile sensing techniques are grouped into three categories, according to what covers the sensors: (i) a hard shell, (ii) a flexible substrate or (iii) no covering. Three categories of physical HRI likewise are identified, consisting of contact that (i) interferes with robot behavior execution, (ii) contributes to behavior execution and (iii) contributes to behavior development.

As childhood traumas predispose to suicidal behavior it was decided to examine whether they may be a determinant of impulsivity, a personality dimension often associated with suicidal behavior. Thus 268 abstinent drug dependent patients completed both the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS). The results showed that there were significant relationships, albeit small, between CTQ scores and BIS impulsivity scores. These results suggest that childhood trauma may be one determinant of impulsivity as an adult.","[{'authorId': '2154707883', 'name': 'A. Roy'}]",82.0,,18.0,Childhood Trauma and Impulsivity.

5dbdbc2806f5bec8305ff9bfa39299f6b66e5a4b,"Schools are valuable settings in that they provide children, families, educators, and community members with chances to learn, teach, and grow. These settings are able to present positive adult and peer examples, various and daily chances to have academic and social achievement, and permanent peer and adult relations promoted by social exchanges (Sugai et al., 2000).Discipline problems such as widespread alcohol, drug abuse, and bullying shown in schools in the late 1990s, focused everyone's attention on these problem behaviors (Sugai & Horner, 2002). Such problem behaviors increasing steadily in schools pushed people and policy makers to search for new solutions to prevent these problem behaviors in schools. As Skiba (2000) said, traditional methods such as zero tolerance, strict rules and punishment, and others were of no use. There was also no evidence-based research proving the positive effect of these methods on students. As Sugai and Horner noted, such systems not using positive behavior supports caused increases in the problem behaviors that needed to be reduced. In a similar way, Costenbader and Markson (1998) stated that exclusion and punishment of problem behaviors are not effective in the long term. Some types of punishment can even be rewarding and cause problem behaviors to continue. ""Traditional school discipline practices"" (TSDP) (Scheuermann & Hall, 2011, pp. 12-13) and PBS (Positive Behavior Support) are compared in Table 1.Sprague and Horner (2006) indicated the main points of a schoolwide system for positive behavior support are: (a) problem behavior in schools is not only an important social challenge but also an obstacle to effective learning; (b) it has not been proven that conventional ""get tough"" approaches are effective; (c) a positive social culture needs to be established first through describing, teaching, and rewarding appropriate behaviors as the basis for all behavior support; (d) further behavior support processes beased on principles of behavior analysis are essential for students who need greater behavior support; (e) school staff are able not only to gather and utilize quality enhancement data systems, but also appreciate the value of those systems in terms of enhancing schools (pp. 413-427).PBS is neither a recent intervention package nor a recent behavior theory; it is rather a practice of a systems approach based on behavior to improve the capacity of schools, families, and communities with the aim of building effective settings that enhance the harmony or connection among practices validated by research and the settings where teaching and learning happen. It is focused on building and maintaining school settings that enhance behavioral outcomes for all children and youth through decreasing the effectiveness, efficiency, and relevance of problem behavior and increasing the functionality of desired behavior (Sugai et al., 2000).SWPBIS FrameworkSWPBIS is defined by the processes arranged around three major themes: Prevention, Multi-Tiered Support, and Data-based Decision Making. Contributing to the prevention of problem behavior are these principles: (a) describing and teaching basic behavioral expectations; (b) approving and awarding appropriate behavior (e.g., obeying the rules of the school, secure and considerate peer relations, and academic work/involvement); and (c) building a regular continuation of outcomes for problem behavior. Attention is focused on building a positive social atmosphere where expectations of behavior for students are greatly foreseeable, directly taught, constantly approved, and actively observed (Sprague & Horner, 2006).Homer, Todd, Lewis-Palmer, Irvin, Sugai, and Boland (2004) explained the Seven Key Features of Schoolwide Positive Behavior Support as: (a) describe 3-5 expectations for appropriate behavior schoolwide; (b) actively have all students leam the schoolwide expectations of behavior; (c) observe and approve of students when they engage in expectations of behavior; (d) correct problem behaviors by using a continuation of behavioral outcomes regularly administrated; (e) collect and use data about student behavior in order to assess and direct decision-making; (f) get leadership of schoolwide applications from a director who 1. …","[{'authorId': '2091533283', 'name': 'Kürşat Öğülmüş'}, {'authorId': '51965711', 'name': 'Sezgin Vuran'}]",20.0,,0.0,"Schoolwide Positive Behavioral Interventions and Support Practices: Review of Studies in the ""Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions"".",2016.0

For example, robots model a personalised dialogue with humans, adapting the conversation to accommodate the user's preferences in order to allow natural interactions. This study investigates the impact of such personalised interaction capabilities of a human companion robot on its social acceptance, perceived intelligence and likeability in a human-robot interaction scenario. In order to measure this impact, the study makes use of an object learning scenario where the user teaches different objects to the robot using natural language. An interaction module is built on top of the learning scenario which engages the user in a personalised conversation before teaching the robot to recognise different objects. The two systems, i.e. with and without the interaction module, are compared with respect to how different users rate the robot on its intelligence and sociability. Although the system equipped with personalised interaction capabilities is rated lower on social acceptance, it is perceived as more intelligent and likeable by the users.","[{'authorId': '19175266', 'name': 'Nikhil Churamani'}, {'authorId': '2106041266', 'name': 'Paul Anton'}, {'authorId': '5185682', 'name': 'M.

Adults were observed in play, teaching, and discipline sessions with the child and were interviewed on child-rearing philosophies. Child cognition and emotion regulation were assessed, and naturalistic observations were conducted at child-care locations. Mean-level and rank-order stability were found in child compliance to the 3 adults. Child emotion regulation and adult warm control in a discipline situation were related to self-regulated compliance to the mother, caregiver, and father. Compliance to parents correlated with parental sensitivity and philosophies, and compliance to the caregiver correlated with child cognition and social involvement when child-care quality was controlled. Maternal sensitivity and warm control discipline predicted compliance to the caregiver but not vice versa. Results are consistent with theoretical positions on the generalization of socialization from the mother to nonmaternal agents.","[{'authorId': '144708274', 'name': 'R.

In this paper, we describe an approach for rapport detection in peer tutoring, using temporal association rules learned from nonverbal, social, and on-task verbal behaviors. From a corpus of 60 hours of annotated multimodal peer tutoring data, we learn the temporal association between behaviors and the rapport score for each 30-second “thin-slice”. We then train a stacked ensemble classification model on those association rules and evaluate our ability to reliably predict rapport using multimodal behavioral data. We find that our approach allows us to predict rapport well above chance, and more accurately than two baseline models. We are able to predict high rapport more accurately for strangers and low rapport more accurately for friends, which we believe holds promise for the integration of rapport detection into collaborative learning supports and intelligent tutoring systems.","[{'authorId': '38113700', 'name': 'Michael A.

The framework is based on two main principles: on the one hand, we propose an architecture inspired by current knowledge in human memory organisation; on the other hand, we integrate such an architecture with the notion of context, which is used to modulate the knowledge acquisition process when consolidating memories and forming new ones, as well as with the notion of familiarity, which is employed to retrieve proper memories given relevant cues. Although much research has been carried out, which exploits Machine Learning approaches to provide robots with internal models of their environment (including objects and occurring events therein), we argue that such approaches may not be the right direction to follow if a long-term, continuous knowledge acquisition is to be achieved. As a case study scenario, we focus on both robot–environment and human–robot interaction processes. In case of robot–environment interaction, a robot performs pick and place movements using the objects in the workspace, at the same time observing their displacement on a table in front of it, and progressively forms memories defined as relevant cues (e.g. colour, shape or relative position) in a context-aware fashion. As far as human–robot interaction is concerned, the robot can recall specific snapshots representing past events using both sensory information and contextual cues upon request by humans.","[{'authorId': '3134131', 'name': 'F.

These conclusions, however, are largely based on cross-sectional comparisons, which limits the possibility to investigate growth trajectories and detect individual changes. Understanding individual growth patterns is crucial if we want to ultimately understand how brain development is sensitive to environmental influences such as educational or psychological interventions or childhood maltreatment. Recently, longitudinal brain imaging studies in children and adolescents have taken the first steps into examining cognitive and social-affective brain functions longitudinally with several compelling findings. First, longitudinal measurements show that activations in some brain regions, such as the prefrontal, temporal, and parietal cortex, are relatively stable over time and can be used as predictors for cognitive functions, whereas activations in other brain regions, such as the amygdala and ventral striatum, are much more variable over time. Second, developmental studies reveal how these changes are related to age, puberty, and changes in performance. These findings have implications for understanding how environmental factors influence brain development. An important future direction will be to examine individual characteristics (e.g., genetic, temperamental, personality) which make individuals differentially susceptible to their environment.","[{'authorId': '1732569', 'name': 'E.

This study aimed to adapt the Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (IERQ) to Turkish, and to investigate its psychometric properties.  METHOD: A total of 467 volunteers with a mean age of 26.63 years participated to the study. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted after preparing the Turkish version of the IERQ. The relationships between IERQ and other emotion regulation scales were investigated for criterion-related validity. In order to assess reliability, internal consistency coefficients were calculated and subsequently, testretest analyses were repeated on 50 students.  RESULTS: As in the original form the Turkish version of IERQ has a 4- factor structure, 'social modelling', 'soothing', 'enhancing positive affect' and 'perspective taking'. As expected, these factors were related to various emotion regulation strategies. Particularly the social modelling and soothing factors differed according to the level of difficulties in emotion regulation. These factors were found to be related to depression, anxiety and stress symptoms. Furthermore, the Turkish version of the IERQ satisfied the conditions of reliability. The internal consistency coefficients of factors were between .81 and .89. Test-retest correlation coefficients were found to be strong.  CONCLUSION: This study showed that the Turkish version of IERQ is a reliable and valid scale for the Turkish population. The psychometric properties of the Turkish version were similar to those of the original form.","[{'authorId': '7896427', 'name': 'Ceren Gökdağ'}, {'authorId': '4841343', 'name': 'Oya Sorias'}, {'authorId': '1484194321', 'name': 'Sidar Kıran'}, {'authorId': '134716413', 'name': 'Sibel Ger'}]",15.0,,0.0,[Adaptation of the Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Questionnaire to the Turkish Language and Investigation of its Psychometric Properties].,2019.0

This can be done in several ways; one of them is by presenting colors. The use of colors to stimulate a certain feeling, may it be calm, aggressive, energetic, happy etc. This paper tries to provide a method for generating colors to elicit a certain feelings based on an emotional state from the SAL agent. This is done by mapping the emotional state of the agent into a color. The emotional state is represented by two values Pleasure and Arousal these two form the two dimensional space in which the distinctive emotions can be placed. The emotional state of the agent is a point (coordinate) on the same 2d space, and by looking at the position of this point the current corresponding color can be calculated by interpolating between the emotions on the 2d space. The end use is to use colors elicit a certain feeling in the user, how the agent uses this to his advantage is up to the agent. Examples of use can be, the agents virtual body changes color (expressing his emotion), or the complete virtual world gets a change in color glow (a narrow emotional commitment), or a more physical example the lights in your house change colors (a broad emotional commitment).","[{'authorId': '1946082', 'name': 'N.

Participants (n=40) were observed in 5 minute interaction sessions and were asked to answer questions on perceived social abilities and technology acceptance. Results show that participants who were confronted with the more socially communicative version of the robot felt more comfortable and were more expressive in communicating with it.

Octopuses use their suckers to grasp, rotate and reposition soft objects (e.g., octopus eggs) without damaging them and to provide strong, reversible adhesion forces to anchor the octopus to hard substrates (e.g., rock) during wave surge. The biological ‘design’ of the sucker system is understood to be divided anatomically into three functional groups: the infundibulum that produces a surface seal that conforms to arbitrary surface geometry; the acetabulum that generates negative pressures for adhesion; and the extrinsic muscles that allow adhered surfaces to be rotated relative to the arm. The effector underlying these abilities is the muscular hydrostat. Guided by sensory input, the thousands of muscle fibers within the muscular hydrostats of the sucker act in coordination to provide stiffness or force when and where needed. The mechanical malleability of octopus suckers, the interdigitated arrangement of their muscle fibers and the flexible interconnections of its parts make direct studies of their control challenging. We developed a dynamic simulator (ABSAMS) that models the general functioning of muscular hydrostat systems built from assemblies of biologically constrained muscular hydrostat models. We report here on simulation studies of octopus-inspired and artificial suckers implemented in this system. These simulations reproduce aspects of octopus sucker performance and squid tentacle extension. Simulations run with these models using parameters from man-made actuators and materials can serve as tools for designing soft robotic implementations of man-made artificial suckers and soft manipulators.","[{'authorId': '46345696', 'name': 'F.

(International Practice Development Journal, 2015, 5, 1) and Nolan, Davies, Brown, Keady, and Nolan () provides useful conceptual frameworks in person-centred care, research is needed to understand how theoretical concepts can be applied into practice to support dementia care. Also, evidence is needed to demonstrate the impacts of implementing person-centred care and staff experiences. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: This paper adds to the emerging work that is providing a greater understanding of how team education in practice can make a difference in building capacity to improve dementia care. We offer timely evidence and useful insights into how an education programme, Gentle Persuasive Approaches (GPA), was implemented (""what worked"" and ""how"") in a large Canadian hospital to improve knowledge and skills among staff in dementia care. The GPA education helped hospital staff enact person-centred care by cultivating shared values and a learning environment to change attitudes, practices and conditions for continuous practice development. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Mental health nurses in advance practice are well positioned to lead dementia education and advocate for person-centred care in hospitals. Hospital leaders are responsible for providing resources to cultivate a supportive environment for continuous learning to ensure the workforce gains the capacity to meet the changing demands and needs of the ageing population. System support is essential for creating conditions to enable person-centred care. ABSTRACT: Introduction Hospital staff lacks knowledge and skills in dementia care. There is a need to understand how person-centred care theory can be operationalized in staff's practices to improve dementia care. Aims To describe the staff's experiences of learning and applying the Gentle Persuasive Approaches (GPA) to enact person-centred care in a hospital. Methods Mixed methods, including posteducation survey and focus groups, were used. Thematic analysis was conducted to identify themes that describe participants' experiences. Results Three hundred and ten staff and leaders in a hospital participated in the GPA education and completed a posteducation survey (n = 297). After 1 year, two follow-up focus groups were conducted with interdisciplinary staff (n = 24) across medicine and mental health programmes. Our analysis identified three themes to enable person-centred care: (a) changing attitudes, (b) changing practices and (c) changing conditions. Discussion This study contributes to the literature by providing evidence of how an education programme was implemented in a large Canadian hospital to build capacity for dementia care. Joint education for interprofessional staff offers value in enabling person-centred care. Implication Mental health nurses are in position to lead dementia education and advocate for person-centred care in hospitals. Staff need structural support to engage in team learning for practice improvement.","[{'authorId': '38480388', 'name': 'Lillian Hung'}, {'authorId': '88589252', 'name': 'Cathy Son'}, {'authorId': '2068734221', 'name': 'R.

613eb8f9a416d05b916f4bf9d9f48b80e6e4fd1f,"Significance Claims about how reported emotional experiences are geometrically organized within a semantic space have shaped the study of emotion. Using statistical methods to analyze reports of emotional states elicited by 2,185 emotionally evocative short videos with richly varying situational content, we uncovered 27 varieties of reported emotional experience. Reported experience is better captured by categories such as “amusement” than by ratings of widely measured affective dimensions such as valence and arousal. Although categories are found to organize dimensional appraisals in a coherent and powerful fashion, many categories are linked by smooth gradients, contrary to discrete theories. Our results comprise an approximation of a geometric structure of reported emotional experience. Emotions are centered in subjective experiences that people represent, in part, with hundreds, if not thousands, of semantic terms. Claims about the distribution of reported emotional states and the boundaries between emotion categories—that is, the geometric organization of the semantic space of emotion—have sparked intense debate. Here we introduce a conceptual framework to analyze reported emotional states elicited by 2,185 short videos, examining the richest array of reported emotional experiences studied to date and the extent to which reported experiences of emotion are structured by discrete and dimensional geometries. Across self-report methods, we find that the videos reliably elicit 27 distinct varieties of reported emotional experience. Further analyses revealed that categorical labels such as amusement better capture reports of subjective experience than commonly measured affective dimensions (e.g., valence and arousal). Although reported emotional experiences are represented within a semantic space best captured by categorical labels, the boundaries between categories of emotion are fuzzy rather than discrete. By analyzing the distribution of reported emotional states we uncover gradients of emotion—from anxiety to fear to horror to disgust, calmness to aesthetic appreciation to awe, and others—that correspond to smooth variation in affective dimensions such as valence and dominance. Reported emotional states occupy a complex, high-dimensional categorical space. In addition, our library of videos and an interactive map of the emotional states they elicit (https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/emogifs/map.html) are made available to advance the science of emotion.","[{'authorId': '49531494', 'name': 'Alan S.

Personality dispositions such as extraversion, neuroticism, and self-esteem can markedly influence levels of SWB. Although personality can explain a significant amount of the variability in SWB, life circumstances also influence long-term levels. Cultural variables explain differences in mean levels of SWB and appear to be due to objective factors such as wealth, to norms dictating appropriate feelings and how important SWB is considered to be, and to the relative approach versus avoidance tendencies of societies. Culture can also moderate which variables most influence SWB. Although it is challenging to assess SWB across societies, the measures have some degree of cross-cultural validity.

A set of 90 preparatory Chinese language students (40 males and 50 females) was assessed for their level of foreign language enjoyment using the Foreign Language Enjoyment Scale (FLES). Participles' scores on self-perceived language achievement and actual test scores were adopted as the measurement of their Chinese language proficiency. The results revealed that: (1) CSL learners experienced high level of FL enjoyment in an online learning context, (2) no significant correlation was found between FLE and leaners' actual language achievement nor between FLE and their self-perceived achievement, (3) female learners showed higher FLE than male learners and gender was found to have a significant effect on FLE-Private, (4) participants' geological location, i.e., whether in China or at home countries, significantly influenced their FLE, (5) participants' regional group was not a significant predictor of FLE, and (6) teacher-related variables and learner self-perceptions of achievement were strong predictors of FLE among CSL learners. The findings highlight the importance of teacher's role in an online learning environment and suggest that FLE may not boost performance in the short term for language beginners but is still conducive in the long run.

There will, however, necessarily be some communication hurdles between “foreign language teachers” and “native students.” This research presents an emotion recognition method for foreign language teachers in order to eliminate communication barriers between teachers and students and improve student learning efficiency. We discovered four factors of emotion recognition through literature analysis: smile, eye contact, gesture, and tone. We believe that differences in foreign language teachers’ performance in these four areas will have an impact on students’ emotion recognition and, as a result, on their learning efficiency. The influence of the foreign language teacher’s eye contact and gestures is larger (the weight of a single variable accounted for 30% or more) in the decision whether can improve the students’ classroom learning efficiency, according to 43 of the questionnaire data analysis. The second is the tone and smile (the weight of a single variable accounted for between 10 and 20%). Our research contributes to the body of knowledge on emotion recognition in university foreign language teachers by presenting a practical method for recognizing emotion in foreign language teachers. We recommend that college foreign language teachers pay attention to eye and gesture communication with students in English classrooms based on the findings. By enriching the style of emotional expression in class, college language teachers, particularly foreign language teachers, can improve communication, and connection with students.","[{'authorId': '50436853', 'name': 'Yanyun Dai'}]",3.0,,39.0,Foreign Language Teachers’ Emotion Recognition in College Oral English Classroom Teaching,2021.0

Both peer rejection and the use of morally adverse media are associated with negative developmental outcomes. This study examines processes by which peer rejection might drive adolescents to select antisocial media content by tying together developmental research on peer rejection and research on media effects. Assumed underlying mechanisms are rejection-based anger and frustration and the adolescent's moral judgment. A between-participants experimental design manipulated peer rejection versus acceptance in adolescents (Mage = 13.88 years; N = 74) and young adults (Mage = 21.37 years; N = 75), applying the Cyberball paradigm. Measures included the State Anger Inventory (STAXI) to assess feelings of rejection and the newly devised Media, Morals, and Youth Questionnaire (MMaYQue) to assess media preferences and moral judgment of media content. Using bootstrapping analyses, a double mediation was established: Higher levels of state anger in peer-rejected adolescents induced more tolerable moral judgments of antisocial media content, subsequently instigating a preference for antisocial media content. In contrast, the young adult sample showed no relations between peer rejection and antisocial media preference. Results are discussed within a downward spiral framework of combined peer and media influences.","[{'authorId': '3344037', 'name': 'X. S. Plaisier'}, {'authorId': '3132010', 'name': 'E.

We examined the associations between aspects of social hierarchy and depressive symptoms with a specific focus on one potential psychological mechanism: emotion suppression. Suppressing negative emotion has mental health costs, but individuals with low social power and low social status may use these strategies to avoid conflict. Study 1 assessed perceived social power, tendency to suppress negative emotion, and depressive symptoms in a community sample of women. Low social power was related to greater depressive symptoms, and this relationship was partially mediated by emotion suppression. Study 2 examined education as a proxy for social hierarchy position, anger suppression, and depressive symptoms in a national, longitudinal cohort study (The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults [CARDIA] study; Cutter et al., 1991). Much as in Study 1, low education levels were correlated with greater depressive symptoms, and this relationship was partially mediated by anger suppression. Further, suppression mediated the relationship between low education and subsequent depression up to 15 years later. These findings support the theory that social hierarchy affects mental health in part through a process of emotion suppression.","[{'authorId': '13069371', 'name': 'C.

Significant innovations have been introduced in recent years in the application of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to support healthcare for patients with dementia.


OBJECTIVE
In the present systematic review, our goal is to keep track of ICT concepts and approaches to support the range of activities of daily living for people with dementia and to provide a snapshot of the effect that technology is having on patients' self-reliance.


METHODS
We reviewed the literature and identified systematic reviews of cohort studies and other authoritative reports. Our selection criteria included: (1) activities of daily living, (2) ICT, and (3) dementia.


RESULTS
We identified 56 studies published between 2000 and 2015, of which 26 met inclusion criteria. The present systematic review revealed many ICT systems that could purportedly support the range of activities of daily living for patients with dementia. The results showed five research bodies: 1) technologies used by patients with dementia, 2) technologies used by caregivers, 3) monitoring systems, 4) ambient assistive living with ICTs, and 5) tracking and wayfinding.


CONCLUSIONS
There is a potential for ICTs to support dementia care at home and to improve quality of life for caregivers, reducing healthcare costs and premature institutional care for these patients.","[{'authorId': '1393688953', 'name': 'G.

62e0242a192674cc9a297a5e987268d50efd1baf,"This is the classic edition of an influential psychological study performed and written by nationally recognized expert and her associates that has revolutionized the current knowledge of attachment behavior. It would be impossible for developmental psychologists to not have come across Ainsworth’s contribution to Bowlby-Ainsworth developmental attachment theory. The purpose of this volume is to educate and deepen understanding of researchers, primary and allied heath care providers, and trainees through reporting methods and key results of Mary Ainsworth’s landmark Baltimore longitudinal study from observation of infant-mother interaction and attachment behavior. In addition to 1978 edition, this book features new information on the 4 caregiving and interaction scales developed by Mary Ainsworth from observations of 9-monthold to 12-month-old infants making them easily accessible to interested individuals. The Baltimore project beautifully illustrated the nature of the child’s relationship to his or her primary caregiver and emphasized the importance of early experience. In a meticulous yet succinct volume, the authors provide a comprehensive resource to researchers and practitioners that addresses available research studies that have used the Strange-Situation Procedure (SSP). The logic, flow, and comprehensive coverage of chapters with great analogies used to demonstrate theoretical background enable readers, even those who are beginners to attachment theory, to build a foundation in attachment theory, viewed as a secure base relationship. The SSP is described as a laboratorybased unfamiliar situation used to observe the child’s response to his/her mother’s and stranger’s behaviors. Children’s behaviors are then organized and grouped into classificatory system. Normative patterns of behavior linked to different social situations, types of statistical analyses used, and the reasoning behind these decisions are further explained. Individual differences are also addressed in detail. Review of other studies that had conducted SSP to address various variables such as neonatal separation, twins versus singletons, demographics, low birth weight, maternal attitudes and mother-infant interaction, and working versus nonworking mothers provide broader understanding of the ways patterns of attachment may or may not differ in these populations. These findings would also be of interest for infant and developmental psychologists, early childhood education specialists, primary care and developmental-behavioral pediatricians, family therapists, social workers with counseling roles, and early intervention in-home specialists/therapists. Readers, especially researchers and practitioners, will appreciate wideranging components, including instruction to the mother, coding instruction, scoring systems, and maternal caregiving and interaction scales. This volume contains clear tables of quantitative research findings and perfect illustration of the Strange Situation. The gaps in this otherwise outstanding volume are due to the authors’ decision to focus on their main samples and review of studies that directly addressed one-year-olds and preschoolers. Undoubtedly, this innovative work has had a significant impact on prevention and intervention beyond the scope of what could be included in this volume. An additional section on clinical implication and a review of how patterns of attachment apply to adopted children would have improved clinical utility. In conclusion, Ainsworth and team have provided an excellent framework describing attachment theory and how attachment behaviors are quantitatively measured through SSP. This is a “must have” for pediatricians, psychologists, social workers, and in-home therapists whose clinical care and research focuses on early childhood development, particularly social development. This book will also be of special interest to trainees, residents, fellows, and graduate students from various professional disciplines who will gain a deeper appreciation of attachment patterns, which can influence clinical encounters with young children and enhance the way care is provided in lieu of the importance of attachment figure and the child’s interaction with that attachment figure.

Cognitive models suggest that self-focused cognitive processes play a crucial role in generating and maintaining social anxiety, and that self-focused cognition occurs prior to, during, and following social situations (Clark & Wells, 1995; Rapee & Heimberg, 1997). There is a substantial body of empirical evidence demonstrating that socially anxious individuals engage in self-focused cognition during and following a social or performance situation. A smaller but growing body literature suggests that a similar process occurs prior to such situations, and that these three processes are interdependent. Furthermore, the vast majority of research to date indicates that self-focused cognitive processes are detrimental, and that they generate and maintain social anxiety in a variety of ways. However, there remains considerable scope for research to further explicate the role of these processes in the maintenance of SAD, and to enhance interventions designed to ameliorate their negative effects.","[{'authorId': '4949931', 'name': 'Alice R.

As an oft-identified mechanism of the effects of child maltreatment on later adjustment, emotion dysregulation represents a key potential pathway. The present study explored a higher order factor model of specific emotion regulation skills, and the extent to which these skill sets would indicate distinct developmental pathways from unique emotional maltreatment experiences to multidomain adjustment. A sample of 500 ethnoracially diverse college students reported on their experiences. A two-factor model of emotion regulation skills based on subscales of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale was revealed. Significant indirect effects of childhood emotional abuse on psychopathology and problems in social relationships were found through response-focused difficulties in emotion regulation, whereas a significant indirect effect of childhood emotional neglect on problems in social relationships was found through antecedent-focused difficulties in emotion regulation. These results are consistent with theoretical models and empirical evidence suggesting differential effects of childhood emotional abuse and emotional neglect, and provide an important indication for developing targeted interventions focusing on specific higher order emotion dysregulation skill clusters.","[{'authorId': '6387646', 'name': 'Sara R.

However, these have usually been investigated independently of one another. Objectives: This systematic review aimed to explore a key gap in the current literature, that being, identifying whether HRV and interoception predict emotional regulation outcomes and strategies. Methods: The process of article retrieval and selection followed the PRISMA guidelines. Databases PsychINFO, Web of Science, PubMed, CINAHL, and MEDLINE were scanned for papers published. Preliminary inclusion and exclusion criteria were specified following the PICO framework, whilst the CHARMS framework was used to help formulate the research question, and critically assess for bias. Results: Two hundred and thirty-seven studies were identified after initial database searches. Of these, eight studies were included in the final selection. Six studies explored the associations between HRV and ER, whilst three investigated the associations between interoception and ER (one study included both). Results show that greater HRV and interoception are associated with better ER. Specifically, high parasympathetic activity largely predicted the use of adaptive ER strategies such as reappraisal, and better acceptance of emotions. High interoception, instead, was predictive of effective downregulation of negative emotions and handling of social uncertainty, there was no association with any specific ER strategy. Conclusions: Awareness of one's own bodily feelings and vagal activation seem to be of central importance for the effective regulation of emotional responses. However, one limitation is the small sample of studies found, thus more studies in this area are needed in the future.","[{'authorId': '153359194', 'name': 'T.

The objective of our work is to design socially assistive robots capable of providing cognitive assistance, targeted engagement, and motivation to elderly individuals, in order to promote participation in self-maintenance activities of daily living. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of the expressive human-like robot, Brian 2.1, as a social motivator for the important activity of eating meals. An exploratory study was conducted at an elderly care facility with the robot and eight individuals, aged 82--93, to investigate user engagement and compliance during meal-time interactions with the robot along with overall acceptance and attitudes towards the robot. Results of the study show that the individuals were both engaged in the interactions and complied with the robot during two different meal-eating scenarios. A post-study robot acceptance questionnaire also determined that, in general, the participants enjoyed interacting with Brian 2.1 and had positive attitudes towards the robot for the intended activity.","[{'authorId': '144427848', 'name': 'D.

This design controls for alternative explanations of behavior including repeat game reputation effects, contractual precommitments, and punishment threats. Observed decisions suggest that reciprocity exists as a basic element of human behavior and that this is accounted for in the trust extended to an anonymous counterpart. A second treatment, social history, identifies conditions which strengthen the relationship between trust and reciprocity.","[{'authorId': '50201370', 'name': 'Joyce E.

6465db1e6e61ac15c9459ef958391c18d94f10b4,"While interacting with a social robot, children have a need to express themselves and have their expressions acknowledged by the robot. A need that is often unaddressed by the robot, due to its limitations in understanding the expressions of children. To keep the child-robot interaction manageable the robot takes control, undermining children’s ability to co-regulate the interaction. Co-regulation is important for having a fulfilling social interaction. We developed a co-creation activity that aims to facilitate more co-regulation. Children are enabled to create sound effects, gestures, and light animations for the robot to use during their conversation. A crucial additional feature is that children are able to coordinate their involvement of the co-creation process. Results from a user study (N = 59 school children, 7-11 y.o.) showed that the co-creation activity successfully facilitated co-regulation by improving children’s agency. It also positively affected the acceptance of the robot. We furthermore identified five distinct profiles detailing the different needs and motivations children have for the level of involvement they chose during the co-creation process.","[{'authorId': '2894352', 'name': 'M.

To date, research has focused on the consequences of peer victimization during childhood but neglected adolescence. Peer relationships and approval become increasingly important during adolescence; thus, peer victimization at this age may have a damaging psychological impact. Methods: Participants were 5030 adolescents aged 11–16 recruited from secondary schools in the UK. Self-report measures of victimization and symptoms of anxiety and depression were administered on three occasions over a 12-month period. Latent growth models examined concurrent and prospective victimization-related elevations in anxiety and depression symptoms above individual-specific growth trajectories. Results: Peer victimization was associated with a concurrent elevation of 0.64 and 0.56 standard deviations in depression and anxiety scores, respectively. There was an independent delayed effect, with additional elevations in depression and anxiety (0.28 and 0.25 standard deviations) six months later. These concurrent and prospective associations were independent of expected symptom trajectories informed by individual risk factors. Conclusions: Adolescent peer victimization was associated with immediate and delayed elevations in anxiety and depression. Early intervention aimed at identifying and supporting victimized adolescents may prevent the development of these disorders.","[{'authorId': '4401193', 'name': 'L.

Effortful control (EC) and observations of peer interactions were obtained from 135 preschoolers (77 boys and 58 girls, mean ages = 50.88 and 50.52, respectively). The results generally confirmed the prediction that children who are high in EC were relatively unlikely to experience high levels of negative emotional arousal in response to peer interactions, but this relation held only for moderate to high intense interactions. Socially competent responding was less likely to be observed when the interaction was intense or when negative emotions were elicited. Moreover, when the interactions were of high intensity, highly regulated children were likely to evidence socially competent responses. The relation of EC and intensity to social competence was partially mediated by negative emotional arousal. The results support the conclusion that individual differences in regulation interact with situational factors in influencing young children's socially competent responding.","[{'authorId': '1833039', 'name': 'R.

Results of confirmatory factor analyses supported the differentiation between the three categories of job characteristics in two samples (N 1 = 261 and N 2 = 441). Further, structural equation modelling confirmed the hypotheses that job hindrances associate positively with exhaustion (i.e., the main component of burnout) and negatively with vigour (i.e., the main component of work engagement). Job resources displayed the reversed pattern of relations. Job challenges were positively related to vigour. Rather unexpectedly, they were unrelated to exhaustion.

Connectivity maps were computed for each voxel in the insula based on resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data and segregated using cluster analysis. We identified 3 insular subregions with distinct patterns of connectivity: a posterior region, functionally connected with primary and secondary somatomotor cortices; a dorsal anterior to middle region, connected with dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, along with other regions of a previously described control network; and a ventral anterior region, primarily connected with pregenual anterior cingulate cortex. Applying these regions to a separate task data set, we found that dorsal and ventral anterior insula responded selectively to disgusting images, while posterior insula did not.

Partic- ipants were asked to solve a set of puzzles while being pro- vided occasional gameplay advice by a robot tutor. Each par- ticipant was assigned one of five conditions: (1) no advice, (2) robot providing randomized advice, (3) voice of the robot providing personalized advice, (4) video representation of the robot providing personalized advice, or (5) physically-present robot providing personalized advice. We assess the tutor’s ef- fectiveness by the time it takes participants to complete the puzzles. Participants in the robot providing personalized ad- vice group solved most puzzles faster on average and improved their same-puzzle solving time significantly more than partic- ipants in any other group. Our study is the first to assess the effect of the physical presence of a robot in an automated tu- toring interaction. We conclude that physical embodiment can produce measurable learning gains. Keywords: Robotics; Computer Science; Tutoring Introduction What kinds of human-robot interactions benefit from the physical embodiment of a robot? For human-robot interac- tions that require manipulating the physical world, a physical robot is a necessity, but for those interactions where physi- cal embodiment is optional, when is an embodied robot more useful than an on-screen agent? In this study, we explore the differences in task perfor- mance of participants engaged in a cognitive learning task in which a robot acts as a tutor. Participants were asked to play a puzzle game while receiving strategy advice from either: a physically-present robot, a video of the same robot, its disem- bodied voice, a robot giving randomized advice, or no agent at all. We use the resulting data to draw conclusions about the effect of embodiment in robot tutoring tasks. Previous work has investigated the social influence of a robot’s embodiment. Does a robot engender more trust, more compliance, more engagement, or more motivation by its physical presence, more so than an on-screen agent or a video representation of a robot would? Such questions have been explored via two methodologies: self-report mea- sures and task-performance measures. Using self-report mea- sures, Kidd and Breazeal (2004) found that a physically- present robot was perceived as more enjoyable, more cred- ible, and more informative than an on-screen character in a block-moving task. In Wainer, Feil-Seifer, Shell, and Mataric (2007), an embodied robot was rated as more attentive and more helpful than both a video representation of the robot and a simulated on-screen robot-like character. Tapus, Tapus, and Mataric (2009) found that individuals suffering from cog- nitive impairment and/or Alzheimer’s disease reported being more engaged with a robot treatment than a similar on-screen agent treatment. Kiesler, Powers, Fussell, and Torrey (2008) used task- performance measures to find that participants who received health advice from a physically-present robot were more likely to choose a healthy snack than participants who re- ceived the same information in robot-video or on-screen agent conditions. In Bainbridge, Hart, Kim, and Scassellati (2008), a physically-present robot yielded significantly more compliance to its commands than a video representation of the same robot. No previous work has investigated whether learning out- comes are affected by a robot’s physical presence. The closest related work is in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS´s), which are educational computer programs that produce individual- ized lessons, advice, and questions usually in a workbook- style or quiz-style environment (Nkambou, Bourdeau, & Psych´e, 2010). A parallel notion of embodiment called “the persona effect” exists in ITS research. (See Dehn and Van Mulken (2000) for an overview.) The persona effect is the impact, if any, that an on-screen character has on students using an ITS. The majority of research on the persona ef- fect has shown no significant learning gains produced by on- screen agents, although many studies note that students find an ITS with an on-screen more engaging than one without (Moundridou & Virvou, 2002). Our study is the first to assess the effect of the physical presence of a robot in an automated tutoring interaction. We use the task-performance measure of puzzle solving time in this work as well as several self-report measures. Methodology Participants There were 100 participants in this study, between 18 and 40 years of age. The study was conducted in New Haven, Con- necticut. Most participants were undergraduate and graduate students of Yale University.

Maternal and child behaviors were measured in situations that varied in the level of stress to test the hypothesis that behaviors in high stress situations would be more diagnostic of children’s subsequent self-regulatory behavior. As predicted, both maternal unresponsivity and toddlers’ negative affect, particularly in a high stress as opposed to a low stress situation, predicted children’s later use of ineffective attentional control strategies. Similarly, maternal disengagement that occurred contingent to toddlers’ distress predicted ineffective attentional control strategies whereas maternal disengagement in response to toddlers’ non-distress behaviors did not. The findings supported the utility of a contextual approach to understanding the impact of maternal and child characteristics on the development of self-regulatory skills.","[{'authorId': '19353141', 'name': 'Monica L.

A bank manager runs for hours each morning to take his mind off his impending divorce. A politician is struggling to hide her joy over a rival’s downfall during a press conference. A CEO practices yoga to handle the stress of her demanding work life. A student works through a childhood trauma by keeping a diary on his innermost feelings. In these and in many other situations in everyday life, people are at once engaged in the selfregulation of action (briefly, selfregulation) and the selfregulation of emotion (briefly, emotion regulation). Selfregulation and emotion regulation are often so intertwined that it is hard to say where one ends and the other begins. Over the past few decades, both types of regulation have become the focus of considerable theoretical and empirical research (for reviews, see Baumeister, Schmeichel, & Vohs, 2007; Koole, 2009; for comprehensive overviews, see Gross, 2007; this volume). Nevertheless, the interface between selfregulation and emotion regulation has only recently received systematic attention. Learning how selfregulation interfaces with emotion regulation is likely to generate important new insights into both processes. Among other things, selfregulation research may illuminate how people function as active agents in managing their emotional lives. Conversely, emotion regulation research may illuminate how people direct their actions in emotionarousing contexts. In this chapter, we contribute to the ongoing integration between selfregulation and emotion regulation research by reviewing contemporary research on the selfregulation of emotion. Our plan in this chapter is fourfold. First, we consider the emotion part of emotion regulation by discussing the kinds of responses that people may target in the emotion regulation process.

However, the impact of visual information regarding politicians from the opponent side in a conflict has not been systematically examined. The current study addresses this gap by examining the effect of visual news coverage—regarding the facial features of political leaders from the opponent side in a conflict—on support for peace. In an experiment conducted in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Jewish-Israeli respondents received a news item containing a proposal for peace agreement accompanied by a photograph described as portraying the Palestinian political leader offering the proposal. The photograph included a digitized facial image that was manipulated to appear as baby-faced or mature by altering the size of the eyes and lips. In line with my expectations, the baby-faced Palestinian politician was judged as more trustworthy than the mature-faced version of the same photograph and the press-reported peace proposal received higher support when offered by the baby-faced Palestinian politician.

For humans to be able to have a positive experience of interaction with such robots, they need to trust them to some degree. In this paper, we present the development and evaluation of a social robot that was created to play a card game with humans, playing the role of a partner and opponent. This type of activity is especially important, since our target group is elderly people - a population that often suffers from social isolation. Moreover, the card game scenario can lead to the development of interesting trust dynamics during the interaction, in which the human that partners with the robot needs to trust it in order to succeed and win the game. The design of the robot's behavior and game dynamics was inspired in previous user-centered design studies in which elderly people played the same game. Our evaluation results show that the levels of trust differ according to the previous knowledge that players have of their partners. Thus, humans seem to significantly increase their trust level towards a robot they already know, whilst maintaining the same level of trust in a human that they also previously knew. Henceforth, this paper shows that trust is a multifaceted construct that develops differently for humans and robots.","[{'authorId': '144106225', 'name': 'Filipa Correia'}, {'authorId': '1401670338', 'name': 'Patrícia Alves-Oliveira'}, {'authorId': '2073110332', 'name': 'Nuno Maia'}, {'authorId': '145856842', 'name': 'T.

66d9b758cf351c0ca9801b50a4aa1e0d90cf0214,"In the last few years there was an increasing interest in building companion robots that interact in a socially acceptable way with humans. In order to interact in a meaningful way a robot has to convey intentionality and emotions of some sort in order to increase believability. We suggest that human-robot interaction should be considered as a specific form of inter-specific interaction and that human–animal interaction can provide a useful biological model for designing social robots. Dogs can provide a promising biological model since during the domestication process dogs were able to adapt to the human environment and to participate in complex social interactions. In this observational study we propose to design emotionally expressive behaviour of robots using the behaviour of dogs as inspiration and to test these dog-inspired robots with humans in inter-specific context. In two experiments (wizard-of-oz scenarios) we examined humans' ability to recognize two basic and a secondary emotion expressed by a robot. In Experiment 1 we provided our companion robot with two kinds of emotional behaviour (“happiness” and “fear”), and studied whether people attribute the appropriate emotion to the robot, and interact with it accordingly. In Experiment 2 we investigated whether participants tend to attribute guilty behaviour to a robot in a relevant context by examining whether relying on the robot's greeting behaviour human participants can detect if the robot transgressed a predetermined rule. Results of Experiment 1 showed that people readily attribute emotions to a social robot and interact with it in accordance with the expressed emotional behaviour. Results of Experiment 2 showed that people are able to recognize if the robot transgressed on the basis of its greeting behaviour. In summary, our findings showed that dog-inspired behaviour is a suitable medium for making people attribute emotional states to a non-humanoid robot.","[{'authorId': '32464892', 'name': 'G.

Jk (stage name of Jordan Katembula) is the lead singer with backing vocals by Malala Mangala. The album also features guest appearances of other prominent local musicians: Nasty D (Davies Ngoma), MC Wabwino (Mukusha Chembe) and the internationally acclaimed Oliver Mtukudzi from Zimbabwe. Joe Chibangu ‘The Ambassador’, Rex Mukubonda (guitars), Jones Kabanga (guitar), Clement Kalombo (guitar), ‘2wice’ Cullen Chisha (guitar), Jeff Chappa (bass guitar), Sebastian Mutale (bass guitar) and Charles ‘Chax’ Chambuluka (drums and percussion) are the main instrumental musicians featured in this recording. From the early 1960s Zambian audiences were entertained by musicians who played what came to be known as Zam-rock, a musical style that employed Western-style musical instruments such as guitars and drums. Sung mainly in English, with a few in local languages, the songs set out to protest or rebel against ethnic taboos and some cultural practices relating to sex and relationships (Graham et al. 2006:437). Consequently, Zam-rock did not do very well in terms of sales in the Zambian music market. Foreign music was generally favoured as opposed to locally-produced music. However, during the late 1990s the musicians I prefer to call New Generation musicians made a breakthrough. Among these musicians was Jordan Katembula (Jk), who has recorded three successful, best-selling albums thus far. What is striking is that his music has become very popular and loved by his fans across generations. Mostly based on and drawn from children’s game songs, which youngsters often perform under street lights, the songs are creatively arranged to appeal to a very wide audience locally and also to Zambians living abroad. This is evident from the numerous invitations Jk has received to perform at events organised by Zambian communities in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and South Africa, among others. Helena’s fourteen tracks are rooted in social commentary on various topics, including relationships between married people and unmarried youths, promotion of good morals and restraint from hatred Jk (2003).

671c89da6e36d9acc71ea34299483d19d79f393b,"People often regulate their emotions by resorting to avoidance, a putatively maladaptive strategy. Prior work suggests that increased psychopathology symptoms predict greater spontaneous utilisation of this strategy. Extending this work, we examined whether heightened resting cardiac vagal tone (which reflects a general ability to regulate emotions in line with contextual demands) predicts decreased spontaneous avoidance. In Study 1, greater resting vagal tone was associated with reduced spontaneous avoidance in response to disgust-eliciting pictures, beyond anxiety and depression symptoms and emotional reactivity. In Study 2, resting vagal tone interacted with anxiety and depression symptoms to predict spontaneous avoidance in response to disgust-eliciting film clips. The positive association between symptoms and spontaneous avoidance was more pronounced among participants with reduced resting vagal tone. Thus, increased resting vagal tone might protect against the use of avoidance.

Four types of strategies were coded: comforting behaviors, instrumental behaviors, distraction behaviors, and cognitive reappraisals. Results indicated that 3-year-olds used proportionately more instrumental strategies than 4-year-olds, and parents of 3-year-olds showed the same pattern, whereas parents of 4-year-olds did not. Moreover, 3-year-olds used a variety of strategies when frustrated, including cognitive reappraisals. Significant positive correlations were found between the types of strategies used by the children and by the parents to help their children. It is suggested that children may be using strategies to organize their emotional states before they are able to accurately report on them.","[{'authorId': '50601759', 'name': 'K.

67cc58f2311acd9f4e8f5c0c13dbaea0fc34e7ea,"Despite ample support for enhanced affective well-being and emotional stability in healthy aging, the role of potentially important dimensions, such as the emotional arousal, has not been systematically investigated in neuroimaging studies. In addition, the few behavioral studies that examined effects of arousal have produced inconsistent findings. The present study manipulated the arousal of pictorial stimuli to test the hypothesis that preserved emotional functioning in aging is modulated by the level of arousal, and to identify the associated neural correlates. Young and older healthy participants were presented with negative and neutral pictures, which they rated for emotional content, while fMRI data were recorded. There were three main novel findings regarding the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of negative pictures with different levels of arousal in young and older adults. First, the common engagement of the right amygdala in young and older adults was driven by high arousing negative stimuli. Second, complementing an age-related reduction in the subjective ratings for low arousing negative pictures, there were opposing patterns of activity in the rostral/ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the amygdala, which showed increased vs. decreased responses, respectively, to low arousing negative pictures. Third, increased spontaneous activity in the ventral ACC/ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in older adults was linked to reduced ratings for low arousing negative pictures. Overall, these findings advance our understanding of the neural correlates underlying processing of negative emotions with different levels of arousal in the context of enhanced emotional functioning in healthy aging. Notably, the results support the idea that older adults have emotion regulation networks chronically activated, in the absence of explicit induction of the goal to regulate emotions, and that this effect is specific to low arousing negative emotions.","[{'authorId': '2695475', 'name': 'S.

The relationship of fun to usability is discussed and three dimensions of fun; Endurability, Engagement, and Expectations are described. A set of tools that can be used in empirical studies to measure these dimensions of fun is described in detail. These tools include a Smileyometer, a Fun-Sorter and an Again-Again table. Three user trials, in which the tools have been used, are described and suggestions are made for the use of each of the tools with children. A discussion of the efficacy of the tools presents the findings that there is a sufficient subset that can be used to give a reliable measure of fun. Dependent on the nature of the event being evaluated and on the number of activities being compared; the subset will be differently constructed. The paper concludes with observations about the difficulties of measuring fun with children, and some areas for further work are presented.","[{'authorId': '1743424', 'name': 'J.

The relationship between psychological factors and obesity has become a hot topic in psychosomatic research. The aim of this study was to examine the characteristics of cognitive emotion regulation (CER) strategies in Chinese adolescents with different weight status.


METHODS
Using stratified random cluster sampling, 700 and 321 adolescents were defined as adolescents with overweight status and obese status, respectively. One thousand and twenty-one adolescents with normal-weight status were also selected. All participants completed a general questionnaire and Chinese version of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire.


RESULTS
Adolescents in the obesity group obtained the highest scores on self-blame and rumination in three groups, and those from the obesity group obtained lower scores on acceptance, positive refocusing, and positive reappraisal than those from normal group (ps < 0.05). Cognitive emotion regulation strategies had a significant impact on BMI, accounting for 32.0% variance (p < 0.001). Higher scores on self-blame and rumination were associated with higher BMI, but greater acceptance and positive refocusing were associated with lower BMI (ps < 0.05).


CONCLUSION
Self-blame, rumination, acceptance, and positive refocusing have considerable effects on BMI in Chinese adolescents. The causal relationship of CER strategies and BMI should be explained more accurately and thoroughly to prevent and intervene in cases of adolescent obesity.","[{'authorId': '8250870', 'name': 'Y.

The response foils, consisting of four written words (target and alternative words) were entered into computer memory so that responses were made by pointing to a computer monitor. Subjects were 24 fourth graders with normal hearing who repeated auditory-stimulus words in noise in oral conditions, and pointed to written words representing the stimulus words in pointing conditions. Mean percent correct performance scores were higher in the pointing conditions than in the oral conditions, reflecting closed- versus open-set tasks. The results indicated that the written word portion of the Picture Identification Task can be utilized to assess the word identification performance of children who read at a fourth grade level or above.","[{'authorId': '69985586', 'name': 'J.

The 2D model proposes that trust and dominance are spontaneously evaluated from features of faces. These evaluations have adaptive significance from an evolutionary standpoint because they indicate whether someone should be approached or avoided. Method Participants rated the emotional state, personality traits, and criminal appearance of faces shown in photographs. The photographs were of males and females taken under naturalistic conditions (i.e., police mugshots) and highly controlled conditions. In the controlled photographs, the emotion display of the actor was systematically varied (happy expression, emotionally neutral expression, or angry expression). Results Both male and female faces rated high in criminal appearance were perceived as less trustworthy and more dominant in police mugshots as well as in photographs taken under highly controlled conditions. Additionally, emotionally neutral faces were deemed as less trustworthy if they were perceived as angry, and more dominant if they were morphologically mature. Systematically varying emotion displays also affected criminality ratings, with angry faces perceived as the most criminal, followed by neutral faces and then happy faces. Conclusion The 2D model parsimoniously accounts for criminality perceptions. This study extends past research by demonstrating that morphological features that signal high dominance and low trustworthiness can also signal high criminality. Spontaneous evaluations regarding criminal propensity may have adaptive value in that they may help us to avoid someone who is physically threatening. On the other hand, such evaluations could inappropriately influence decision making in criminal identification lineups. Hence, additional research is needed to discover whether and how people can avoid making evaluations regarding criminality from a person’s facial appearance.","[{'authorId': '5961668', 'name': 'H.

To fill the need for temperament questionnaires for teacher and parent informants, we adapted the popular parent/caregiver Child Behavior Questionnaire–Short Form for preschool and kindergarten teachers. Informant correspondences were low as expected, but patterns were consistent with hypotheses drawn from person perception models. Internal consistencies of the teacher scales were adequate, comparing favorably with those of parent-rated scales. Anticipated relations of temperament scales emerged with social competence and tasks of executive attention for both parent and teacher informants. Confirmatory factor analyses conducted separately for parent and teacher scales supported the familiar three-factor model when allowances were made for cross-loadings and correlated errors. A multigroup confirmatory factor analyses with parent and teacher data indicated that the factor structures of the two questionnaires are similar but not equivalent.","[{'authorId': '6782638', 'name': 'H.

They allow to tailor interactions towards individual needs and preferences, improve engagement and sense of familiarity over time, and facilitate trust between the user and the robot. To foster the development of autonomous adaptive social robots, we present a tutoring framework that recognizes new or previously met pupils and adapts the training experience through feedback about real-time performance and the tailoring of exercises and interaction based on users’ past encounters. The framework is suitable for multiparty scenarios, allowing for deployment in real-world tutoring contexts unfolding in groups. A preliminary evaluation of the framework during pilot studies and demonstration events in yoga-based training and game scenarios showed that our framework could be adapted to different contexts and populations, including children and adolescents. The robot’s ability to recognize people and personalize its behavior based on the performance of previous sessions was appreciated by participants, who reported the feeling of being followed and cared for by the robot. Overall, the framework can support autonomous robot-led training by allowing monitoring of both daily performance and improvements over multiple encounters. It also lends itself to further expansion to more complex behaviors, with the organic and modular inclusion of more advanced social capabilities, such as redirecting the robot’s attention to different learners or estimating participant engagement.","[{'authorId': '1392700266', 'name': 'G.

A large body of research has shown that alterations in ER are related to psychological disorders across different diagnostic categories. Because of the apparent ubiquity of ER difficulties in psychopathology, several authors have proposed that ER should be regarded as a transdiagnostic process. This article critically examines evidence regarding alterations in the use of cognitive ER strategies as a transdiagnostic process. Cognitive ER strategies are examined as 1 example of several possible ER-related processes that could be involved in psychopathology. There is consistent evidence showing that a reduced use of cognitive reappraisal and an increased use of negative rumination are present across a number of disorders, whereas increased levels of positive rumination appear to be confined to bipolar disorder. However, there is only preliminary evidence from prospective and/or experimental studies on the causal nature of altered ER strategy use in the development or maintenance of psychopathology. The article concludes by discussing future directions, including methodological and design issues, as well as implications for assessment and treatment when studying alterations in ER from a transdiagnostic perspective.

The research is based on a 3 step framework: 1) Human-Human Interaction, Stage-1 (HHI-S1), 2) Human-Robot Interaction, Stage-2 (HRI-S2), and 3) Human-Human Interaction, Stage-3 (HHI-S3). All three stages of the therapy consist of two command sets: 1) Controls commands and 2) Evaluation commands (auditory commands, visual commands, and combination of both). The concept of multiple robots is introduced to help multi-human communication and discourage isolation in ASD children. The joint attention of an ASD child is improved by the robotic therapy in stage 2 considering it as a key parameter for a multi-human communication scenario. The improvement in joint attention results in better command following in a triad multi-human communication scenario in stage 3 as compared to stage 1. The proposed intervention has been tested on 8 ASD subjects with 10 sessions over a period of two and a half months (10 weeks). Each session of human-human interaction (stage 1 and 3) consisted of 14 cues whereas 18 cues were presented by each robot for human-robot interaction (stage 2). The results indicate an overall 86% improvement in the social communication skills of ASD children in case of a multi-human scenario. Validation of results and effectiveness of the therapy has been further accomplished through the use of the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) score.","[{'authorId': '98656524', 'name': 'Sara Ali'}, {'authorId': '1443781694', 'name': 'Faisal Mehmood'}, {'authorId': '2115773454', 'name': 'Muhammad Jawad Khan'}, {'authorId': '1734839', 'name': 'Y.

693a5bcae0b819c954794d47081e8e3defde347d,"Although depressed mood is a normal occurrence in response to adversity in all individuals, what distinguishes those who are vulnerable to major depressive disorder (MDD) is their inability to effectively regulate negative mood when it arises. Investigating the neural underpinnings of adaptive emotion regulation and the extent to which such processes are compromised in MDD may be helpful in understanding the pathophysiology of depression. We report results from a functional magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrating left-lateralized activation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) when downregulating negative affect in nondepressed individuals, whereas depressed individuals showed bilateral PFC activation. Furthermore, during an effortful affective reappraisal task, nondepressed individuals showed an inverse relationship between activation in left ventrolateral PFC and the amygdala that is mediated by the ventromedial PFC (VMPFC). No such relationship was found for depressed individuals, who instead show a positive association between VMPFC and amygdala. Pupil dilation data suggest that those depressed patients who expend more effort to reappraise negative stimuli are characterized by accentuated activation in the amygdala, insula, and thalamus, whereas nondepressed individuals exhibit the opposite pattern. These findings indicate that a key feature underlying the pathophysiology of major depression is the counterproductive engagement of right prefrontal cortex and the lack of engagement of left lateral-ventromedial prefrontal circuitry important for the downregulation of amygdala responses to negative stimuli.","[{'authorId': '30361732', 'name': 'T.

Such systems track and assess students' knowledge via inferential methods, such as the popular Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) algorithm. However, these methods do not typically draw on the affective signals that human teachers use to assess knowledge, such as indications of discomfort, engagement, or frustration. 
 
In this paper we present a novel extension to the BKT model that uses affective data, derived autonomously from video records of children playing an interactive story-telling game with a robot, to infer student knowledge of reading skills. We find that, compared to a control group of children who played the game with only a tablet, children who interacted with an embodied social robot generated stronger affective data signals of engagement and enjoyment during the interaction. We then show that incorporating this affective data into model training improves the quality of the learned knowledge inference models. 
 
These results suggest that physically embodied, affect-aware robot tutors can provide more effective and empathic educational experiences for children, and advance both algorithmic and human-centered motivations for further development of systems that tightly integrate affect understanding and complex models of inference with interactive, educational robots.","[{'authorId': '47475540', 'name': 'Samuel Spaulding'}, {'authorId': '3297873', 'name': 'Goren Gordon'}, {'authorId': '1711777', 'name': 'C.

Based on emotion metaphors that capture mental models of emotions, we systematically designed and validated a set of 28 different uni- and multimodal expressions for the basic emotions joy, sadness, fear and anger using the most common output modalities color, motion and sound. Classification accuracy and users’ confidence of emotion assignment were evaluated in an empirical study with 33 participants and a robot probe. The findings are distilled into a set of recommendations about which modalities are most effective in communicating basic artificial emotion. Combining color with planar motion offered the overall best cost/benefit ratio by making use of redundant multi-modal coding. Furthermore, modalities differed in their degree of effectiveness to communicate single emotions. Joy was best conveyed via color and motion, sadness via sound, fear via motion and anger via color.","[{'authorId': '39665145', 'name': 'Diana Löffler'}, {'authorId': '2055455662', 'name': 'Nina Schmidt'}, {'authorId': '2730421', 'name': 'Robert Tscharn'}]",79.0,,54.0,"Multimodal Expression of Artificial Emotion in Social Robots Using Color, Motion and Sound",2018.0

Most HCI research on bereavement focuses on retaining these significant digital possessions to honor the departed. However, recent work suggests that significant digital possessions may complicate moving on; they function as both comforting and painful reminders but currently provide inflexible methods for disposal. A few works have investigated the disposal of digital objects as a means of letting go. To better understand this we interviewed 10 psychotherapists who employ rituals of letting go to help patients overcome loss in situations such as a divorce, a breakup, or a stillbirth. Patients disposed of either natural artifacts or symbolic personal possessions through actions such as burning, burying, or placing in a body of water. Therapists noted that people increasingly have digital possessions, and that the act of deletion does not offer the same cathartic sense of release as disposal of material artifacts. Based on the analysis of this grief therapy, we propose a new conceptual framework for rituals of letting go that highlights temporality, visibility, and force. It provides a vocabulary to talk about disposal. We then offer design implications connecting the rituals of letting go to the disposal of digital things. Based on our interviews and analytic framework, we propose novel technologies that better connect the embodied nature of letting go rituals to the process of digital disposal.","[{'authorId': '2175489', 'name': 'C.

The 275 children were in kindergarten through eighth grade; they completed the Children's Depression Inventory and either the “Fight” or “Game” version of the Child Affect Questionnaire (CAQ-F or CAQ-G). Children who endorsed higher levels of depressive symptoms generally reported using affect regulation strategies significantly less often than did nondepressed children, and they rated these responses as significantly less effective in altering their negative mood. Depressed girls rated mother-initiated affect regulation strategies as less effective than did nondepressed girls. Younger children rated both self- and mother-initiated strategies as more effective than did older children.

6b27e62226766385527f7eabf2fc942ea205cc24,"A common objection to the use and development of “emotional” robots is that they are deceptive. This intuitive response assumes 1) that these robots intend to deceive, 2) that their emotions are not real, and 3) that they pretend to be a kind of entity they are not. We use these criteria to judge if an entity is deceptive in emotional communication (good intention, emotional authenticity, and ontological authenticity). They can also be regarded as “ideal emotional communication” conditions that saliently operate as presuppositions in our communications with other entities. While the good intention presupposition might be a bias or illusion we really need for sustaining the social life, in the future we may want to dispense with the other conditions in order to facilitate cross-entity communication. What we need instead are not “authentic” but appropriate emotional responses-appropriate to relevant social contexts. Criteria for this cannot be given a priori but must be learned-by humans and by robots. In the future, we may learn to live with “emotional” robots, especially if our values would change. However, contemporary robot designers who want their robots to receive trust from humans had better take into account current concerns about deception and create robots that do not evoke the three-fold deception response.","[{'authorId': '46450294', 'name': 'Mark Coeckelbergh'}]",54.0,,7.0,Are Emotional Robots Deceptive?,2012.0

In Evocative Objects, Turkle collects writings by scientists, humanists, artists, and designers that trace the power of everyday things. These essays reveal objects as emotional and intellectual companions that anchor memory, sustain relationships, and provoke new ideas. This volume's special contribution is its focus on everyday riches: the simplest of objects--an apple, a datebook, a laptop computer--are shown to bring philosophy down to earth. The poet contends, ""No ideas but in things."" The notion of evocative objects goes further: objects carry both ideas and passions. In our relations to things, thought and feeling are inseparable. Whether it's a student's beloved 1964 Ford Falcon (left behind for a station wagon and motherhood), or a cello that inspires a meditation on fatherhood, the intimate objects in this collection are used to reflect on larger themes--the role of objects in design and play, discipline and desire, history and exchange, mourning and memory, transition and passage, meditation and new vision. In the interest of enriching these connections, Turkle pairs each autobiographical essay with a text from philosophy, history, literature, or theory, creating juxtapositions at once playful and profound. So we have Howard Gardner's keyboards and Lev Vygotsky's hobbyhorses; William Mitchell's Melbourne train and Roland Barthes' pleasures of text; Joseph Cevetello's glucometer and Donna Haraway's cyborgs. Each essay is framed by images that are themselves evocative. Essays by Turkle begin and end the collection, inviting us to look more closely at the everyday objects of our lives, the familiar objects that drive our routines, hold our affections, and open out our world in unexpected ways.

These questionnaires explore various domains, such as those delineated by the SF-36, Beck Depression Inventory, etc. These studies often document the impact of the medical illness on the patients’ perception of their quality of life. Moreover, the impact of quality of life domains on medical outcomes, as well as the relationships between these various domains have been noted. However, developing strategies to improve various quality of life domains has proved to be difficult. For example, although depression is documented as the most common psychological problem encountered in ESRD patients, few studies have looked at specific treatment strategies to improve the depressive symptoms of these patients [13]. And, studies that have developed strategies to treat depression have emphasized the difficulties encountered in employing successful algorithms [13]. No studies have documented that addressing or treating quality of life problems improves patient outcomes. Nevertheless, it is now recommended by K/DOQI that quality of life issues be monitored on an ongoing basis in ESRD patients [14]. The purpose of this monitoring is to define and document the quality of life status of the patient, hopefully identify therapies that can improve the patients’ quality of life, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

Existing models broadly agree that reappraisal recruits frontal and parietal control regions to modulate emotional responding in the amygdala, but they offer competing visions of how this is accomplished. One view holds that control regions engage ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), an area associated with fear extinction, that in turn modulates amygdala responses. An alternative view is that control regions modulate semantic representations in lateral temporal cortex that indirectly influence emotion-related responses in the amygdala. Furthermore, while previous work has emphasized the amygdala, whether reappraisal influences other regions implicated in emotional responding remains unknown. To resolve these questions, we performed a meta-analysis of 48 neuroimaging studies of reappraisal, most involving downregulation of negative affect. Reappraisal consistently 1) activated cognitive control regions and lateral temporal cortex, but not vmPFC, and 2) modulated the bilateral amygdala, but no other brain regions. This suggests that reappraisal involves the use of cognitive control to modulate semantic representations of an emotional stimulus, and these altered representations in turn attenuate activity in the amygdala.","[{'authorId': '4522200', 'name': 'J.

The suicide victims were categorized into non-violent and violent groups, based on the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision. Meteorological data were obtained from the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan. Socio-economic data were gathered from the Accounting and Statistics Office, Keelung City Government. Multiple linear regression analysis with backward elimination was performed to determine the model that was most effective in predicting dependent variables.


RESULTS
During the 5-year study period, the overall suicide mortality rate was negatively associated with ambient temperature. Male suicide mortality was positively correlated with unemployment, and negatively correlated with ambient temperature, barometric pressure, rainy days, family income and number of holidays. Female suicide mortality and violent suicide mortality were not significantly correlated with any meteorological or socio-economic factors. Non-violent suicide mortality was positively correlated with unemployment, and negatively correlated with ambient temperature, barometric pressure and family income.


CONCLUSIONS
Suicide is a complex psychopathological phenomenon. Further studies with individual data are warranted to confirm how meteorological and socio-economic conditions influence ones' suicidal behaviour.","[{'authorId': '2209535837', 'name': 'Ya Wen Wu'}, {'authorId': '120896921', 'name': 'Chih-Ken Chen'}, {'authorId': '153754910', 'name': 'Liang-Jen Wang'}]",11.0,,38.0,Is suicide mortality associated with meteorological and socio-economic factors?

The obese group (n = 47) reported significantly higher total scores on the Toronto Alexithymia Scale than the nonobese group (n = 190). Of the four factors of alexithymia, although significant differences were not found in the statistical analysis with a Bonferroni correction, scores on externally-oriented thinking (so-called “pensée operatoire”) were higher for the obese group than the nonobese group. The results suggest that persons with simple obesity are prone to alexithymia, in particular externally-oriented thinking.","[{'authorId': '5787785', 'name': 'I.

6d7798a3fbe70a5026c121062f08f7ad9fca4528,"This study examined the factor structure of the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) using secondary data drawn from 20 samples (N = 11,685)—7 English and 13 non-English—including 10 community, 6 student, 1 mixed community/student, 1 meditator, and 2 clinical samples. Self-compassion is theorized to represent a system with 6 constituent components: self-kindness, common humanity, mindfulness and reduced self-judgment, isolation and overidentification. There has been controversy as to whether a total score on the SCS or if separate scores representing compassionate versus uncompassionate self-responding should be used. The current study examined the factor structure of the SCS using confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) and Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling (ESEM) to examine 5 distinct models: 1-factor, 2-factor correlated, 6-factor correlated, single-bifactor (1 general self-compassion factor and 6 group factors), and 2-bifactor models (2 correlated general factors each with 3 group factors representing compassionate or uncompassionate self-responding). Results indicated that a 1- and 2-factor solution to the SCS had inadequate fit in every sample examined using both CFA and ESEM, whereas fit was excellent using ESEM for the 6-factor correlated, single-bifactor and correlated 2-bifactor models. However, factor loadings for the correlated 2-bifactor models indicated that 2 separate factors were not well specified. A general factor explained 95% of the reliable item variance in the single-bifactor model. Results support use of the SCS to examine 6 subscale scores (representing the constituent components of self-compassion) or a total score (representing overall self-compassion), but not separate scores representing compassionate and uncompassionate self-responding.","[{'authorId': '2969088', 'name': 'K.

Based on this research, investigators have variously claimed that emotional memories are indelible; that emotion has no special effects on memory at all; and that emotion leads to enhanced memory for either congruent or central information. In this overview, we review the current status of these claims. Although considerable progress has been made toward understanding whether and how emotion enhances memory, much of this research has been limited by its treatment of emotion as merely “arousal.” Evidence is presented that people process, encode, and retrieve information differently depending upon whether they are feeling happy, fearful, angry, or sad. We argue that a more complete understanding of the effects of emotion on memory will depend upon taking into account the differing motivations and problemsolving strategies associated with discrete emotions. How do emotions influence memory for autobiographical events? How well do we remember a joyful family gathering, a terrifying near-miss on the freeway, or an angry falling out with a friend? Just as importantly, what aspects of these emotional events do we remember? Much of the scientific research on these questions has focused on evaluating four broad claims: the claim that emotional memories are indelible; the opposing claim that emotion has no special effects on memory at all; the claim that emotion enhances memory for information similar in tone; and the claim that emotion enhances memory for central information at","[{'authorId': '2719543', 'name': 'L.

6db42b2eaea9858b629a3ae5754f2e0dd0cee988,"The ability to use cognitive reappraisal to regulate emotions is an adaptive skill in adulthood, but little is known about its development. Because reappraisal is thought to be supported by linearly developing prefrontal regions, one prediction is that reappraisal ability develops linearly. However, recent investigations into socio-emotional development suggest that there are non-linear patterns that uniquely affect adolescents. We compared older children (10-13), adolescents (14-17) and young adults (18-22) on a task that distinguishes negative emotional reactivity from reappraisal ability. Behaviorally, we observed no age differences in self-reported emotional reactivity, but linear and quadratic relationships between reappraisal ability and age. Neurally, we observed linear age-related increases in activation in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, previously identified in adult reappraisal. We observed a quadratic pattern of activation with age in regions associated with social cognitive processes like mental state attribution (medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, anterior temporal cortex). In these regions, we observed relatively lower reactivity-related activation in adolescents, but higher reappraisal-related activation. This suggests that (i) engagement of the cognitive control components of reappraisal increases linearly with age and (ii) adolescents may not normally recruit regions associated with mental state attribution, but (iii) this can be reversed with reappraisal instructions.","[{'authorId': '38264874', 'name': 'Kateri McRae'}, {'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

A subfield of robotics, Socially Assistive Robotics (SAR), is particularly suitable for expanding these benefits into the healthcare setting because of its unique ability to provide cognitive, social, and emotional support. This paper presents our recent research on developing SAR by evaluating the ability of a life-like conversational social robot, called Ryan, to administer internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) to older adults with depression. For Ryan to administer the therapy, we developed a dialogue-management system, called Program-R. Using an accredited CBT manual for the treatment of depression, we created seven hour-long iCBT dialogues and integrated them into Program-R using Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML). To assess the effectiveness of Robot-based iCBT and users’ likability of our approach, we conducted an HRI study with a cohort of elderly people with mild-to-moderate depression over a period of four weeks. Quantitative analyses of participant’s spoken responses (e.g. word count and sentiment analysis), face-scale mood scores, and exit surveys, strongly support the notion robot-based iCBT is a viable alternative to traditional human-delivered therapy.","[{'authorId': '119766731', 'name': 'Francesca Dino'}, {'authorId': '1387964178', 'name': 'Rohola Zandie'}, {'authorId': '3407846', 'name': 'Hojjat Abdollahi'}, {'authorId': '2094477139', 'name': 'Sarah Schoeder'}, {'authorId': '145531712', 'name': 'M.

Psychology can draw on research in these disciplines as it begins to extend creativity theory to the study of performance creativity. These other disciplines can, in turn, benefit from relevant research in the psychology of creativity.

Simulation training offers academic experiences that evoke conditions of the real world in a practical way. One hundred and four graduate social work students consented and completed the Standardized Patient Simulation course consisting of a human simulator interview, pre- and postdebriefing on late life depression, and self and faculty ratings of outcome measures. Results from pre–post testing of measures and the debriefing evaluation demonstrated that students gained in knowledge and achieved clinical skill competency. Students reported that the patient simulator was convincing, the environment was realistic, and they were satisfied with the training. The educational methodology tests students in challenging situations and offers immediate educational feedback to integrate and improve practice behaviors towards achieving clinical competency.","[{'authorId': '4399324', 'name': 'Zvi D.

Ten fully saturated chromatic colors were chosen from the Munsell color system: red, yellow, green, blue, purple, yellow-red, green-yellow, blue-green, purple-blue, and redpurple. Apart from these ten hue groups, three achromatic colors (white, black and gray) were also used. The sample consisted of 98 volunteered college students at a public institution in the southeast region of the US. Results revealed that the principle hues comprised the highest number of positive emotional responses, followed by the intermediate hues and the achromatic colors. Color symbolism seems to be apparent in how individuals associate colors with things, objects or physical space. Red-purple, for instance, was associated with the color of red wine, plum, bridesmaid dress, or the color of a bedroom.

Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 1973, 38 (3, Serial No. 150). A distinction was made between the general level of a person's IQ (i.e., the average of his scores across age) and his profile contour (i.e., the developmental pattern of inflections in performance). Most research has focused on the general level of IQ and its correlates; this project systematically investigated patterns of IQ change with data from the Fels Longitudinal Study. Normal middle-class children changed an average of 28.5 IQ points between 21/2 and 17 years of age, and one in seven displayed shifts of more than 40 points. While siblings were more similar in their general level of IQ than unrelated children matched or unmatched for social class, the pattern of developmental changes in childhood IQs or infant DQs was not more similar among siblings than among unrelated children. Twins and triplets scored lower in general level and were less variable in IQ over age than singletons, thus potentially qualifying attempts to generalize IQ change results based upon multiple-birth samples to singletons. Parent-child IQ correlations were higher when the parent was assessed as an adult than if both parent and child were tested at the same chronological ages. A sample of 80 subjects who had relatively complete IQ data (maximum of 17 tests) between 2/2 and 17 years were clustered into five groups which represented different patterns of IQ change over age. These profiles were relatively simple linear or quadratic trends and not random fluctuations about a constant value. Major inflection points occurred at 6 and 10 years of age. It was not obvious that these patterns were simple products of repeated testing or the changing nature of the IQ test. The children in the five IQ profile clusters had parents who were different in the extent to which they attempted to accelerate their child's development and the severity of punishments they administered. These parental correlates appeared to hold up even when parental education and IQ as well as the general level of the child's IQ were statistically controlled. Given the assumptions prompted by these data, the changing nature of environmental circumstances across the childhood years for a given individual may be as potent in changing IQ as the differences between family environments.

THE LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES IN IQ Several reviews of the literature on the development of mental performance are available (Bayley 1970; Bloom 1964; Pinneau 1961). However, most of the research surveyed involves correlations between mental test performance at several different ages and correlations between personality and social variables with IQ at one age versus another. Such research strategies are valuable and have yielded important results, but they are ""developmental"" only in the sense that data are available at several ages on the same subjects and correlational relationships are derived within and across age periods. Because the correlation coefficient is independent of the means of the distributions, it is possible to obtain high correlational stability of IQ across age but marked fluctuations in the group mean. In short, cross-age correlations reveal little about the nature of absolute changes in level of performance, and they provide only partial information about individual differences in developmental pattern. This project focuses on developmental patterns of change in the level of mental performance as assessed by traditional intelligence tests.","[{'authorId': '143887530', 'name': 'R.

In equivalence to Watzlawick's statement that ""one cannot not communicate"" (1968) it has been found that also in human-robot interactions one cannot be not emotional. It is therefore crucial for a robot to understand these affective signals of its communication partner and react towards them. However, up to now, online emotion recognition in realtime, interactive systems has scarcely been attempted as apparently demands concerning robustness and time constraints are very high.

It examined how perceived academic control and academic emotions predict undergraduate students' academic success, conceptualized as both low dropout intention and high achievement (indicated by GPA).

The study additionally compared freshman students (N = 597) vs. second-year students (N = 286). Using structural equation modeling, for the overall sample of undergraduate students we found that perceived academic control positively predicted enjoyment and achievement, as well as negatively predicted boredom and anxiety. The prediction of dropout intention by perceived academic control was fully mediated via anxiety. When taking perceived academic control into account, we found no specific impact of enjoyment or boredom on the intention to dropout and no specific impact of all three academic emotions on achievement. The multi-group analysis showed, however, that perceived academic control, enjoyment, and boredom among second-year students had a direct relationship with dropout intention. A major contribution of the present study was demonstrating the important roles of perceived academic control and anxiety in undergraduate students' academic success.

6ef8bf91c17fe828a05e397d9fba020605e1166c,". Dependence of heart rate variability on indicators of type 1 diabetes mellitus control. N.O., The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of the main indicators of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) control on heart rate variability (HRV). We examined 62 patients at the age of 18-45 years with an average T1DM duration of 11.0 (5.0; 18.0) years. HRV in the time and frequency range was evaluated by analyzing a 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram (ECG). The following laboratory parameters were used as markers of course and compensation of T1DM: C-peptide, HbA1c, blood creatinine, albuminuria (AU), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by CKD-EPI formula. In addition, the maximum and minimum blood glucose levels and the blood glucose range (maximum minus minimum blood glucose values) were conducted by continuous glucose monitoring system iPro2 (Medtronic MiniMed, USA). The daily monitoring of electrocardiogram (ECG) was made in parallel with long term monitoring of blood glucose. Echocardiography in all patients was performed to exclude organic heart disease and the possibility of its influence on HRV. Poor control of T1DM negatively influences HRV through decrease in both frequency and time characteristics. The blood glucose range can be an additional negative factor for cardiovascular system in T1DM patients, regardless of HbA1c, whereas it positively correlates with HRV- relative hypersympathicotonia markers: LF/HF 24-h, ρ =0.43 (p<0.05), LF/HF day ρ =0.37 (p<0.05), ρ =0.38 LF/HF night. Diabetic nephropathy is another factor of cardiovascular disease progression in T1DM, since its criteria have reliably negative (for eGFR) and positive (for AU) correlations of mean force with all HRV characteristics. Selected markers of T1DM control cause 45, 73% of variance in HRV, mainly affecting TP 24-h, TP daytime, VLF 24-h, VLF daytime. Reduction of these frequency HRV characteristics may indicate autonomic neuropathy in patients with poor control of T1DM.","[{'authorId': '2254686841', 'name': 'вул'}, {'authorId': '2254686204', 'name': 'Вернадського'}, {'authorId': '2254686520', 'name': 'Дніпро'}]",307.0,,19.0,disease: meta-analysis and dose-response meta-regression,2020.0

Results suggested that subjects' social cognitive acuity and differential responding to emotion have heretofore been underrated. Moreover, affective knowledge was significantly related to prosocial behavior in semistructured situations. Prevalent affect was related to expression of prosocial behavior (e.g., frequent expressions of anger were associated with low levels of affective knowledge and prosocial behavior).

This study investigated the neural dynamics of reappraisal of emotional responses in 28 participants who differed with respect to IA. Electroencephalography was used to characterize the time course of emotion regulation. We found that reappraisal was accompanied by reduced arousal and significant modulation of late neural responses. What is more, higher IA facilitated downregulation of affect and was associated with more pronounced modulation of underlying neural activity. Therefore, we conclude that IA not only advances the consolidation of somatic markers required for guiding individual behaviour but also creates processing advantages in tasks referring to these bodily markers.","[{'authorId': '4960170', 'name': 'Jürgen Füstös'}, {'authorId': '3128704', 'name': 'K.

The identification of the factor predicting QoL in AD is essential to develop more effective interventions. Recent research suggests that these factors could be different for the distinct informants. This study explores the QoL predictors considering three different sources of information: patients, caregivers, and healthcare staff. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a sample of 102 patients, their primary caregivers, and 15 members of the healthcare staff evaluated patients’ QoL (QoL-AD Scale). Patients’ and caregivers’ demographic and clinical data (cognitive function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, depression, and caregivers’ burden) were considered as QoL predictors. Results: In multivariate-adjusted linear regression analyses, we observed that patients’ ratings were mainly affected by their mood whereas caregivers’ ratings were also negatively influenced by patients’ irritability and burden. According to staff ratings, both psychotic symptoms and neuroleptics were associated with lower QoL. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that depression is the main variable related to patients’ QoL and that more careful management of neuropsychiatric disorders is necessary. Both proxies’ ratings are not equivalent to patients’ reports in terms of predictors but they are complementary. Thus, a thorough QoL assessment should consider separately the perspective of the different informants.","[{'authorId': '1402023401', 'name': 'M.

We used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in healthy volunteers to disrupt processing within 2 potential sites in this network—IFG and posterior middle temporal cortex. Stimulation of both sites selectively disrupted executively demanding semantic judgments: semantic decisions based on strong automatic associations were unaffected.

The results showed fair temporal stability (intraclass correlation coefficients ≥ 0.38) and good reliability (Mdn = .63; range .49-.83) for both methods. While around 40% of the variance of a single IAc measurement could be explained by a trait, approximately 27% was accounted for by occasion-specific effects of situation and person-situation interaction.

Moreover, recent neuroimaging research has suggested that increased activity in the subgenual region of the anterior cingulate cortex (subACC), which has been consistently linked with depression, is related to heightened sensitivity to peer rejection among adolescents. The goal of the current study was to directly test the hypothesis that adolescents' subACC responses are predictive of their risk for future depression, by examining the relationship between subACC activity during peer rejection and increases in depressive symptoms during the following year. During a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan, 20 13-year-olds were ostensibly excluded by peers during an online social interaction. Participants' depressive symptoms were assessed via parental reports at the time of the scan and 1 year later. Region of interest and whole-brain analyses indicated that greater subACC activity during exclusion was associated with increases in parent-reported depressive symptoms during the following year. These findings suggest that subACC responsivity to social exclusion may serve as a neural marker of adolescents' risk for future depression and have implications for understanding the relationship between sensitivity to peer rejection and the increased risk of depression that occurs during adolescence.","[{'authorId': '2845363', 'name': 'Carrie L.

710283d91f00bf84812de1090fd61c2fcb288594,"Review of the Literature Young children naturally enjoy stories. Children involved in education programs that utilize storytelling exhibit many positive behaviors related to increased literacy (Speaker, 2000; Allison and Watson, 1994). Improved listening skills, vocabulary development and an increased ability to organize narrative thought are all behaviors exhibited by young children who have been exposed to a variety of stories on a consistent basis. Storytelling has emerged as a key cognitive skill in the process of intellectual development (Kim, 1999). Cognition that is enhanced in specific ways when children are exposed to a variety of stories can also be measured in qualitative ways (Reed, 1987; Britsch, 1992; Mallan, 1997). Storytelling is also an effective bridge to emergent literacy (Rosen, 1988 in Miller and Mehler, 1994; Soundy, 1993). Since we know that children are active participants in the acquisition of language, the interactive nature of show and tell or sharing time in the early grades is actually a recreation of a remembered experience (Miller and Mehler, 1994). These tales are personal stories created by the children as a result of direct experience. The language patterns learned in these social contexts while children are interacting with adults and other children are constructed and reinforced as the teller becomes more proficient in relating the story (Strickland and Morrow, 1989). Reading stories aloud or listening and interacting with a storyteller are essentially a social experience (Britsch, 1992). Studies continue to confirm that the development of vocabulary and syntactic complexity in oral language are more advanced in children who are frequently exposed to a variety of stories (Roney, 1989; Phillips, 2000). The increases in attention span, listening skills, accuracy of recall, sequencing ability and fluency in writing have also been documented (Reed, 1987; Davis, 1982). A ""sense of story"" aids in the comprehension of the many different types of stories to which a child should be exposed (Golden, 1984). This concept of story sense is also linked to an increase in imaginative play (Raines and Isbell, 1994). Schema theorists emphasize the importance of framework in understanding text. The words that are chosen to express particular ideas, the order imposed to create meaningful sentences and then manipulated to show relationships and contexts all combine to create meaning for children (Cherry-Cruz, 2001). Robert D. Friedberg (1994) argues that storytelling is a developmentally sensitive tool that can elicit thoughts that create a more ordered sense of the world. He also believes that storytelling promotes expressive language development in speech in addition to receptive language development in both reading and listening. The research reiterates that active participation in the storytelling process increases the fluency of verbal expression in young children. The creative-predictive process involved when a child is actively involved in a story does strengthen the detailed aspects of language structure. Its value, however, is even more apparent when these techniques are implemented in a holistic way to refine language abilities. The story grammar that is introduced in storytelling and reading aloud becomes familiar to the child and is converted to later reading and writing activities (Cherry-Cruz, 2001). For young children, the correlation between storytelling and optimum language development appears clear. The use of storytelling with young children supports early literacy development and expands the creative literacy potential in young children. Methodology In this pilot study, the authors attempted to assess the qualitative changes in verbal fluency (vocabulary, grammatics. length of utterance and sentence formation) in three, four and five year olds who were actively engaged in a vigorous storytelling preschool program. The children all attended the campus preschool at The College of New Jersey. …","[{'authorId': '117797571', 'name': 'K. Speaker'}, {'authorId': '2107397825', 'name': 'D.

Firms invest in greater product variety but are less able to differentiate themselves. Growth and value creation have become the dominant themes for managers. In this paper, we explain this paradox. The meaning of value and the process of value creation are rapidly shifting from a product- and firm-centric view to personalized consumer experiences. Informed, networked, empowered, and active consumers are increasingly co-creating value with the firm. The interaction between the firm and the consumer is becoming the locus of value creation and value extraction. As value shifts to experiences, the market is becoming a forum for conversation and interactions between consumers, consumer communities, and firms. It is this dialogue, access, transparency, and understanding of risk-benefits that is central to the next practice in value creation.","[{'authorId': '145520411', 'name': 'V.

Recently, high technology has developed robots for use not only in factories but also for our living environment. In particular, human-interactive robots for psychological enrichment, which provide services by interacting with humans while stimulating their minds, are rapidly spreading. Such robots not only simply entertain but also render assistance, guide, provide therapy, educate, enable communication, and so on. Robot therapy, which uses robots as a substitution for animals in animal-assisted therapy and activity, is a new application of robots and is attracting the attention of many researchers and psychologists. The seal robot named Paro was developed especially for robot therapy and was used at hospitals and facilities for elderly people in several countries. Recent research has revealed that robot therapy has the same effects on people as animal therapy. In addition, it is being recognized as a new method of mental healthcare for elderly people. In this mini review, we introduce the merits and demerits of animal therapy. Then we explain the human-interactive robot for psychological enrichment, the required functions for therapeutic robots, and the seal robot. Finally, we provide examples of robot therapy for elderly people, including dementia patients.","[{'authorId': '40528071', 'name': 'T. Shibata'}, {'authorId': '33228483', 'name': 'K.

The validity of these norms is influenced by the observed secular increase in body weight and BMI. We hypothesized that the performance of children in health‐related physical fitness tests would be negatively related to increased BMIs, and therefore fitness tests might be used as criteria for developing a more appropriate set of BMI norms. We evaluated the existing data from a nation‐wide fitness survey for students in Taiwan (444 652 boys and 433 555 girls) to examine the relationship between BMI and fitness tests. The fitness tests used included: an 800/1600‐m run/walk; a standing long jump; bent‐leg curl‐ups; and a sit‐and‐reach test. The BMI percentiles developed from the subgroup whose test scores were better than the ‘poor’ quartile in all four tests were compared with those of the whole population and linked to the adult criteria for overweight and obesity. The BMIs were significantly related to the results of fitness testing. A total of 43% of students had scores better than the poorest quartile in all of their tests. The upper BMI percentile curves of this fitter subgroup were lower than those of the total population. The 85th and 95th BMI percentile values of the fitter 18‐year‐old‐students (23.7 and 25.5 kg m−2 for boys; 22.6 and 24.6 kg m−2 for girls) linked well with the adult cut‐off points of 23 and 25 kg m−2, which have been recommended as the Asian criteria for adult overweight and obesity. Hence, the BMI norms for children and adolescents could be created from selected subgroups that have better physical fitness. We expect that the new norms based on this approach will be used not only to assess the current status of obesity or overweight, but also to encourage activity and exercise.","[{'authorId': '2111897612', 'name': 'Walter Chen'}, {'authorId': '143838325', 'name': 'Cheng-Chieh Lin'}, {'authorId': '2113566689', 'name': 'Ching-Tien Peng'}, {'authorId': '2004645193', 'name': 'Chia-Ing Li'}, {'authorId': '2196428980', 'name': 'H.‐C.

In this diary study, we investigated multi-level predictors of daily counterproductive work behavior (CWB) relying on the theoretical frameworks of affective events theory and the emotion-centered model of CWB. We assessed significant work events, event-based fairness perceptions, negative emotional reactions to work events, and employee CWB over a 10-day period. We tested within-person relations predicting CWB, and cross-level moderating effects of two emotion regulation strategies (suppression and reappraisal). Results from a multi-level path analysis revealed that significant work events had both direct and indirect effects on negative emotional reactions. Further, negative emotional reactions in turn mediated the relationships between significant work events and all forms of daily CWB as well as the relationship between event-based fairness perceptions and daily CWB-O. Results also supported the moderating role of reappraisal emotion regulation strategy on relations between significant work events and negative emotional reactions. Less support, however, was found for the moderating influence of suppression on the link between negative emotional reactions and CWB. Among the broad work event categories we identified, our supplemental analyses revealed that negative work events involving interactions with supervisors elicited the highest levels of employee negative emotional reactions. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[{'authorId': '8381772', 'name': 'Fadel K.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of job demands and resources as well as emotional labour on job satisfaction and emotional exhaustion among nurses.


BACKGROUND
While emotional labour is a construct that has considerable significance in health care as nurses often need to express organizationally desired emotions, little research has investigated the relationships between emotional labour, job demands and resources in the prediction of nurses' well-being.


METHODS
The questionnaire was distributed to 450 registered nurses (RN) working in a teaching hospital in Taiwan during February 2007, of which 240 valid questionnaires were returned and analysed (53.33% response rate). In addition to descriptive statistics and correlation, structural equation modelling (LISREL 8.8) was conducted.


RESULTS
The findings showed that the frequency of interacting with difficult patients positively related to surface acting. Perceived organizational support (POS) positively related to deep acting and negatively to surface acting. The results also showed that surface acting related negatively, and deep acting related positively, to job satisfaction. The frequency of interactions with difficult patients related positively to emotional exhaustion, and negatively to job satisfaction. Perceived organizational support related negatively to emotional exhaustion and positively to job satisfaction.


CONCLUSIONS
The results suggest that job demands, resources and emotional labour can predict nurses' well-being.


IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT
The results of the present study indicate that nurses' well-being can be predicted by job demands, resources and emotional labour. There is a need to address organizational support and training programmes to enhance job satisfaction and reduce emotional exhaustion among nurses.","[{'authorId': '2325195', 'name': 'Huei-Yin Chou'}, {'authorId': '40166741', 'name': 'R.

Based on three cases taken from a corpus of 64 interviews and on a protocol identifying the essentially verbal expression of emotions and emotion management, the focus in the paper is on how emotions can erupt when the client is recounting biographical episodes and how counsellors handle the situation. The results highlight the discourse procedures used by clients (e.g. preliminary phrases, seeking ratification, hesitations, repetitions, reference to self) and by counsellors (e.g. reformulations, questions) and show that counsellors can transform the client’s emotional reactions, which can have a decisive impact on the outcome of counselling interviews.","[{'authorId': '2085841674', 'name': 'Isabelle Olry‐Louis'}]",9.0,,74.0,Expression and management of emotions in career counselling interactions,2018.0

While individual aspects of these fMRI models have been evaluated, they have not been evaluated in a comprehensive manner with empirical data. In this work, a total of 2 million random task fMRI group analyses have been performed using resting state fMRI data, to compute empirical familywise error rates for the software packages SPM, FSL and AFNI, as well as a standard non-parametric permutation method. While there is some variation, for a nominal familywise error rate of 5% the parametric statistical methods are shown to be conservative for voxel-wise inference and invalid for cluster-wise inference; in particular, cluster size inference with a cluster defining threshold of p = 0.01 generates familywise error rates up to 60%. We conduct a number of follow up analyses and investigations that suggest the cause of the invalid cluster inferences is spatial auto correlation functions that do not follow the assumed Gaussian shape. By comparison, the non-parametric permutation test, which is based on a small number of assumptions, is found to produce valid results for voxel as well as cluster wise inference. Using real task data, we compare the results between one parametric method and the permutation test, and find stark differences in the conclusions drawn between the two using cluster inference. These findings speak to the need of validating the statistical methods being used in the neuroimaging field.","[{'authorId': '1409436948', 'name': 'A.

In this study, 23 adolescents were excluded during a ball-tossing game in which they believed they were playing with two other adolescents during an fMRI scan; in reality, participants played with a preset computer program. Afterwards, participants reported their exclusion-related distress and rejection sensitivity, and parents reported participants' interpersonal competence. Similar to findings in adults, during social exclusion adolescents displayed insular activity that was positively related to self-reported distress, and right ventrolateral prefrontal activity that was negatively related to self-reported distress. Findings unique to adolescents indicated that activity in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (subACC) related to greater distress, and that activity in the ventral striatum related to less distress and appeared to play a role in regulating activity in the subACC and other regions involved in emotional distress. Finally, adolescents with higher rejection sensitivity and interpersonal competence scores displayed greater neural evidence of emotional distress, and adolescents with higher interpersonal competence scores also displayed greater neural evidence of regulation, perhaps suggesting that adolescents who are vigilant regarding peer acceptance may be most sensitive to rejection experiences.","[{'authorId': '2845363', 'name': 'Carrie L.

Research suggests that self-compassion may improve mental health by promoting emotion regulation (Berking & Whitley, ). This review aimed to identify studies which investigated the relationship between self-compassion, emotion regulation, and mental health in order to examine the role of emotional regulation as a mechanism of change.


METHODS
Searches were conducted in PsycINFO, CINAHL, Medline complete, Web of Science and Scopus databases. Inclusion criteria required publications to be: peer reviewed, published in English, contain validated measures of self-compassion and emotion regulation, and report a direct analysis on the relationship between these constructs.


RESULTS
The search yielded five studies which met inclusion criteria. Emotion regulation significantly mediated the relationship between self-compassion and mental health. This pattern was consistent across community and clinical samples, for a range of mental health symptoms including stress, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. A critical limitation of the review was that all included studies used cross-sectional data, limiting interpretations regarding causation.


CONCLUSIONS
Results provide preliminary evidence that emotion regulation may be a mechanism of change in the relationship between self-compassion and mental health. Self-compassion may be a pertinent preliminary treatment target for individuals who avoid experiences of emotions.","[{'authorId': '51041535', 'name': 'Elisa Inwood'}, {'authorId': '32265785', 'name': 'Madeleine Ferrari'}]",214.0,,34.0,"Mechanisms of Change in the Relationship between Self-Compassion, Emotion Regulation, and Mental Health: A Systematic Review.",2018.0

To this end, we manipulated the robot gaze, i.e., mutual (social) gaze and neutral (non-social) gaze, throughout an experiment involving letter identification. Our results suggest that people are sensitive to the mutual gaze of an artificial agent, they feel more engaged with the robot when a mutual gaze is established, and eye-contact supports attributing human-like characteris-tics to the robot.

73785babc59d20ddb3d812108cebb337b71bb389,"To examine the coregulation of positive affect during mother–infant and father–infant interactions, 100 couples and their first-born child were videotaped in face-to-face interactions. Parents’ and infant’s affective states were coded in one-second frames, and synchrony was measured with timeseries analysis. The orientation, intensity, and temporal pattern of infant positive arousal were assessed. Synchrony between same-gender parent–infant dyads was more optimal in terms of stronger lagged associations between parent and infant affect, more frequent mutual synchrony, and shorter lags to responsiveness. Infants’ arousal during mother–infant interaction cycled between medium and low levels, and high positive affect appeared gradually and was embedded within a social episode. During father– child play, positive arousal was high, sudden, and organized in multiple peaks that appeared more frequently as play progressed. Mother–infant synchrony was linked to the partners’ social orientation and was inversely related to maternal depression and infant negative emotionality. Father–child synchrony was related to the intensity of positive arousal and to father attachment security. Results contribute to research on the regulation of positive emotions and describe the unique modes of affective sharing that infants coconstruct with mother and father. RESUMEN: Para examinar la co-regulación del afecto positivo durante las interacciones entre la madre y su hijo y el padre y su hijo, cien parejas y sus hijos primerizos fueron grabadas en vı́deo en sesiones de interacciones cara a cara. Los estados afectivos de los padres y de los infantes fueron codificados en marcos de un segundo, y la sincronı́a se midió por medio de un análisis de tiempo en serie. Se evaluaron la orientación, la intensidad, y el patrón temporal del despertar positivo del infante. La sincronı́a entre las dı́adas del mismo sexo (madre-hija o padre-hijo) fue más óptima en términos de más fuertes asociaciones espaciadas del afecto entre padre/madre e infante, la más frecuente mutua sincronı́a, y más cortos espacios de sensibilidad.. El despertar de los niños durante la interacción entre la madre y su infante osciló entre los niveles medio y bajo, y el afecto positivo alto apareció gradualmente y se encontraba metido dentro de una situación social. Durante el juego entre el padre y su infante, el despertar positivo fue alto, rápido y organizado en múltiples puntos máximos que aparecieron con mayor frecuencia a medida que el juego progresaba. La sincronı́a entre la madre y su infante fue asociada con la orientación social de los participantes y fue inversamente relacionada con la depresión maternal y la negativa emocionalidad del infante. La sincronı́a entre el padre y su infante fue relacionada con la intensidad del despertar positivo y con la seguridad de la afectividad paterna. Los resultados contribuyen a la investigación sobre la regulación de las emociones positivas y describen los modelos únicos de la afectividad compartida que los infantes co-construyen con la madre y el padre.

Previous research has found support for two contradicting theories: similarity attraction and complementary attraction. The similarity attraction theory implies that people prefer a robot with a similar personality to their own (e.g., an extroverted person prefers an extroverted robot). According to the complementary attraction theory, people prefer a robot's personality opposite to their own (e.g., extroverted people prefer an introverted robot). In contrast to both theories, we argue that what is considered an appropriate personality for a robot depends on the task context. In a 2×2 between-groups experiment (N=45), we found trends that indicated similarity attraction for extrovert participants when the robot was a tour guide and complementary attraction for introverted participants when the robot was a cleaner. These trends show that preferences for robot personalities may indeed depend on the context of the robot's role and the stereotype perceptions people hold for certain jobs. Robot behaviors likely need to be adapted not in complimentary or similarity to the users' personality but to the users' expectations about what kind of personality and behaviors are consistent with such a task or role.","[{'authorId': '1897729', 'name': 'M.

Study One examined this association in seven domains – psychopathology, positive psychological health, emotional intelligence, self-concept, body image, motivation, and interpersonal functioning – and found that while reduced negative self-responding had a stronger link to negative emotionality and self-evaluation than positive self-responding, they were roughly equivalent predictors in other domains. Study Two examined the association of compassionate and reduced uncompassionate behavior with sympathetic nervous system and inflammatory activity after stress, and found they equally predicted salivary alpha amylase and interleukin-6 levels in individuals after a stressful situation. Overall, results suggest that both compassionate and reduced uncompassionate self-responding are central to self-compassion and that both help to explain its link to healthy psychological functioning.","[{'authorId': '2969088', 'name': 'K.

It is believed that, based on this ability, they will play an essential role in human society in the not-so-distant future. This article examined the proposition that robots could form relationships with children and that children might learn from robots as they learn from other children. In this article, this idea is studied in an 18-day field trial held at a Japanese elementary school. Two English-speaking ""Robovie"" robots interacted with first- and sixth-grade pupils at the perimeter of their respective classrooms. Using wireless identification tags and sensors, these robots identified and interacted with children who came near them. The robots gestured and spoke English with the children, using a vocabulary of about 300 sentences for speaking and 50 words for recognition. The children were given a brief picture-word matching English test at the start of the trial, after 1 week and after 2 weeks. Interactions were counted using the tags, and video and audio were recorded. In the majority of cases, a child's friends were present during the interactions. Interaction with the robot was frequent in the 1st week, and then it fell off sharply by the 2nd week. Nonetheless, some children continued to interact with the robot. Interaction time during the 2nd week predicted improvements in English skill at the posttest, controlling for pretest scores. Further analyses indicate that the robots may have been more successful in establishing common ground and influence when the children already had some initial proficiency or interest in English. These results suggest that interactive robots should be designed to have something in common with their users, providing a social as well as technical challenge.","[{'authorId': '48309591', 'name': 'T.

Adolescents living with neither mothers nor partners had better teaching interactions but lower HOME scores compared with those living with mothers. High mother support was associated with more secure infant attachment only for those adolescents living with partners. When mother support was low, adolescents living alone had more secure infants than adolescents living with partners.

Secondary traumatic stress (STS) refers to a set of psychological symptoms that mimic post-traumatic stress disorder, but is acquired through exposure to persons suffering the effects of trauma. Numerous studies have sought to identify correlates of both VT and STS, yet there still exists a lack of conceptual clarity in the literature about VT, STS, and the related constructs of burnout and compassion fatigue. This has made it difficult to use the literature to inform practice and training. This study clarifies the definitions of VT and STS and uses levels of evidence analysis to synthesize the research findings to date. Originally planned as a meta-analysis, the study was re-designed as methodological issues in the literature became apparent that would call into question the validity of a meta-analysis. The current method of analysis documents the degree of evidence for the most commonly researched factors that have been researched as possible contributors to the development of both VT and STS, synthesizing the findings of published research and dissertations written in the English language from 1994–2003. Findings indicate that persuasive evidence exists for personal trauma history, reasonable evidence for perceived coping style, and some evidence for supervision experiences, as important predictors of VT. Persuasive evidence for amount of exposure to trauma material and reasonable evidence for personal trauma history are indicated as important in the development of STS. Limitations of the current study and directions for further research are discussed. *An earlier version of this paper was presented at the 112th Annual Conference of the American Psychological Association, 31 July 2004, Honolulu Hawaii, USA","[{'authorId': '40620831', 'name': 'Katie Baird'}, {'authorId': '3514924', 'name': 'A.

Studies in humans and laboratory animals show that eating can also be regulated by factors unrelated to metabolic control. Several studies suggest a link between stress, access to highly palatable food, and eating disorders. Eating “comfort foods” in response to a negative emotional state, for example, suggests that some individuals overeat to self-medicate. Clinical data suggest that some individuals may develop addiction-like behaviors from consuming palatable foods. Based on this observation, “food addiction” has emerged as an area of intense scientific research. A growing body of evidence suggests that some aspects of food addiction, such as compulsive eating behavior, can be modeled in animals. Moreover, several areas of the brain, including various neurotransmitter systems, are involved in the reinforcement effects of both food and drugs, suggesting that natural and pharmacological stimuli activate similar neural systems. In addition, several recent studies have identified a putative connection between neural circuits activated in the seeking and intake of both palatable food and drugs. The development of well-characterized animal models will increase our understanding of the etiological factors of food addiction and will help identify the neural substrates involved in eating disorders such as compulsive overeating. Such models will facilitate the development and validation of targeted pharmacological therapies.","[{'authorId': '134383412', 'name': 'Matteo Di Segni'}, {'authorId': '6499963', 'name': 'E.

Functional neuroimaging studies have shown that each one depends upon interactions between pFC, interpreted as implementing cognitive control, and limbic regions, interpreted as mediating emotional responses. However, no study has directly compared distraction with reappraisal, and it remains unclear whether they draw upon different neural mechanisms and have different emotional consequences. The present fMRI study compared distraction and reappraisal and found both similarities and differences between the two forms of emotion regulation. Both resulted in decreased negative affect, decreased activation in the amygdala, and increased activation in prefrontal and cingulate regions. Relative to distraction, reappraisal led to greater decreases in negative affect and to greater increases in a network of regions associated with processing affective meaning (medial prefrontal and anterior temporal cortices). Relative to reappraisal, distraction led to greater decreases in amygdala activation and to greater increases in activation in prefrontal and parietal regions.

This phenomenon makes communication between robots and individuals become more natural. However, many robots currently in use are appearance constrained and not able to perform facial expressions and gestures. In addition, although humanoid-oriented techniques are promising, they are time and cost consuming, which leads to many technical difficulties in most research studies. To increase interactive efficiency and decrease costs, we alternatively focus on three interaction modalities and their combinations, namely color, sound, and vibration. We conduct a structured study to evaluate the effects of the three modalities on a human's emotional perception towards our simple-shaped robot “Maru.” Our findings offer insights into human-robot affective interactions, which can be particularly useful for appearance-constrained social robots. The contribution of this work is not so much the explicit parameter settings but rather deepening the understanding of how to express emotions through the simple modalities of color, sound, and vibration while providing a set of recommended expressions that HRI researchers and practitioners could readily employ.","[{'authorId': '66245274', 'name': 'Sichao Song'}, {'authorId': '1679243', 'name': 'S.

Our aim was to compare emotion processing and regulation between 102 women with morbid obesity who apply for bariatric surgery and 102 women from the general population (control group) and to examine in the group with morbid obesity the association of emotion processing and regulation with emotional eating. The group with morbid obesity reported higher scores on difficulty identifying feelings (alexithymia, p = 0.002) and suppression of emotions (p = 0.003) than the control group. In the women with morbid obesity, more negative affect and a higher difficulty identifying feelings were correlated with more emotional eating (r = 0.36 and r = 0.35, p < 0.001). Our study suggests that negative emotions and unhealthy emotion processing may play a role in emotional eating, and it indicates the possible relevance of emotion processing and emotional regulation as initiating or perpetuating mechanisms in morbid obesity.","[{'authorId': '4471630', 'name': 'H.

Individuals with either condition can appear uncaring towards others. This study set out to compare and contrast directly boys with psychopathic tendencies and boys with ASD on tasks assessing aspects of affective empathy and cognitive perspective taking. The main aim of the study was to assess whether a distinct profile of empathy deficits would emerge for boys with psychopathic tendencies and ASD, and whether empathy deficits would be associated with conduct problems in general, rather than psychopathic tendencies or ASD specifically. Methods Four groups of boys aged between 9 and 16 years (N = 96) were compared: 1) psychopathic tendencies, 2) ASD, 3) conduct problems and 4) comparison. Tasks were included to probe attribution of emotions to self, empathy for victims of aggression and cognitive perspective-taking ability. Results Boys with psychopathic tendencies had a profile consistent with dysfunctional affective empathy. They reported experiencing less fear and less empathy for victims of aggression than comparison boys. Their cognitive perspective-taking abilities were not statistically significantly different from those of comparison boys. In contrast, boys with ASD had difficulties with tasks requiring cognitive perspective taking, but reported emotional experiences and victim empathy that were in line with comparison boys. Boys with conduct problems did not differ from comparison boys, suggesting that the affective empathy deficit seen in boys with psychopathic tendencies was specific to that group, rather than common to all boys with conduct problems. Conclusions Although both groups can appear uncaring, our findings suggest that the affective/information processing correlates of psychopathic tendencies and ASD are quite different. Psychopathic tendencies are associated with difficulties in resonating with other people’s distress, whereas ASD is characterised by difficulties in knowing what other people think.","[{'authorId': '152339451', 'name': 'A.

Empathy can lead to personal distress or to empathic concern (sympathy). The goal of this paper is to address the underlying cognitive processes and their neural underpinnings that constitute empathy within a developmental neuroscience perspective. In addition, we focus on how these processes go awry in developmental disorders marked by impairments in social cognition, such as autism spectrum disorder, and conduct disorder. We argue that empathy involves both bottom-up and top-down information processing, underpinned by specific and interacting neural systems. We discuss data from developmental psychology as well as cognitive neuroscience in support of such a model, and highlight the impact of neural dysfunctions on social cognitive developmental behavior. Altogether, bridging developmental science and cognitive neuroscience helps approach a more complete understanding of social cognition. Synthesizing these two domains also contributes to a better characterization of developmental psychopathologies that impacts the development of effective treatment strategies.","[{'authorId': '3235030', 'name': 'J.

According to Gross's (1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271-299) process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners. This review concludes with a consideration of five important directions for future research on emotion regulation processes.","[{'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

Background: Trust is an important psychological factor determining the acceptance of smart systems. Because smart systems tend to be treated like humans, and similarity has been shown to increase trust in humans, we expected that similarity would increase trust in a virtual agent. Methods: In a driving simulator experiment, participants (N = 111) were presented with a virtual agent that was either similar to them or not. This agent functioned as their virtual driver in a driving simulator, and trust in this agent was measured. Furthermore, we measured how trust changed with experience. Results: Prior to experiencing the agent, the similar agent was trusted more than the dissimilar agent. This effect was mediated by perceived similarity. After experiencing the agent, the similar agent was still trusted more than the dissimilar agent. Conclusion: Just as similarity between humans increases trust in another human, similarity also increases trust in a virtual agent. When such an agent is presented as a virtual driver in a self-driving car, it could possibly enhance the trust people have in such a car. Application: Displaying a virtual driver that is similar to the human driver might increase trust in a self-driving car.","[{'authorId': '2327911', 'name': 'F.

Overall, deep acting displayed weak relationships with indicators of impaired well-being and job attitudes but positive relationships with emotional performance and customer satisfaction (ρs .18 and .37). A meta-analytic regression analysis provides information on the unique contribution of emotion-rule dissonance, surface acting, and deep acting in statistically predicting well-being and performance outcomes.

The second issue focuses psychologically on the nature of the human-robotic relationship, about how humans can and often do respond quickly and powerfully in social terms to robots, but also how the relationship is psychologically impoverished, may be fundamentally, especially from a moral perspective. To advance our argument, we draw on our research over the last few years on people's relationships with Sony's robotic dog AlBO, particularly one of our studies that analyzes the type of issues that people discuss in AIBO online discussion forums. Finally, building on our conceptual and empirical analyses, we offer five central considerations toward framing the human relationship with robotic others.","[{'authorId': '144674612', 'name': 'P.

However, there exists no systematic mapping of thermal feedback to models of emotion that could be used by designers and users to convey a range of emotions in HCI. A common way of classifying emotions and quantifying emotional experience is through ratings along valence and arousal dimensions, originating from Russell's circumplex model [32]. Therefore, the research in this paper mapped subjective ratings of a range of thermal stimuli to the circumplex model to understand the range of emotions that might be conveyed through thermal feedback. However, as the suitability of the model varies depending on the type of emotional stimuli [31], we also compared the goodness of fit of ratings between the circumplex and vector [8,31] models of emotion. The results showed that thermal feedback was interpreted as representing a limited range of emotions concentrated in just two quadrants or categories of the circumplex: high valence, low arousal and low valence, high arousal. Warm stimuli were perceived as more pleasant/positive than cool stimuli and altering either the rate or extent of temperature change affected both valence and arousal axes simultaneously. The results showed a significantly better fit to a vector model than to the circumplex.","[{'authorId': '13176154', 'name': 'Graham A. Wilson'}, {'authorId': '153021494', 'name': 'D.

The results strongly and consistently indicated that acute social exclusion increased nonconscious positive affect. Compared to nonexcluded participants, excluded participants recalled more positive memories from childhood than did accepted participants (Experiment 1), gave greater weight to positive emotion in their judgments of word similarity (Experiments 2 and 3), and completed more ambiguous word stems with happy words (Experiments 4a and 4b). This process was apparently automatic, as participants asked to imagine exclusion overestimated explicit distress and underestimated implicit positivity (Experiment 3). Four final experiments showed that this automatic emotion regulation process was found among participants low (but not high) in depressive symptoms (Experiments 5 and 6) and among participants high (but not low) in self-esteem (Experiments 7 and 8). These findings suggest that acute exclusion sets in motion an automatic emotion regulation process in which positive emotions become highly accessible, which relates to positive mental health.","[{'authorId': '2069897549', 'name': 'C.

The purpose of this review is to configure primarily qualitative and mixed methods findings from studies meeting our selection and quality criterion to answer the review question: How do robotic construction kits function as computational manipulatives in P–12 STEM education? Our synthesis of the literature has resulted in four key insights that are new to the field. First, RCKs have a unique double application: They may be used for direct instruction in robotics (first-order uses) or as analogical tools for learning in other domains (second-order uses). Second, RCKs make possible additional routes to learning through the provision of immediate feedback and the dual modes of representation unique to RCKs. Third, RCKs support a computational thinking learning progression beginning with a lower anchor of sequencing and finishing with a high anchor of systems thinking. And fourth, RCKs support evolving problem-solving abilities along a continuum, ranging from trial and error to heuristic methods associated with robotics study. Furthermore, our synthesis provides insight into the second-order (analogical) uses of RCKs as computational manipulatives in the disciplines of physics and biology. Implications for practice and directions for future research are discussed.

The online learning component monitors interactions and collects explicit and implicit user feedback from a conversation and feeds it back to the classifier in the form of new class instances and adjusted threshold values for triggering the classes. In addition, it enables a trusted master to teach it new question-answer pairs via question-answer paraphrasing, and solicits help with maintaining question-answer-class relationships when needed, obviating the need for explicit programming.

This study appealed to ‘ interoceptive inference ’ , under the FEP, to seek new insights into autonomic (dys)function and brain – body integration by examining the relationship between cardiac interoception and autonomic cardiac control in healthy controls and patients with forms of or- thostatic intolerance (OI); to (i) seek empirical support for interoceptive inference and (ii) delineate if this relationship was sensitive to increased interoceptive prediction error in OI patients during head-up tilt (HUT)/ symptom provocation. Measures of interoception and heart rate variability (HRV) were recorded whilst supine and during HUT in healthy controls (N=20), postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS, N=20) and vasovagal syncope (VVS, N=20) patients. Compared to controls, interoceptive accuracy was reduced in both OI groups. Healthy controls' interoceptive sensibility positively correlated with HRV whilst supine. Conversely, both OI groups' interoceptive awareness negatively correlated with HRV during HUT. Our pilot study o ﬀ ers initial support for interoceptive inference and suggests OI cohorts share a central pathophysiology underlying interoceptive de ﬁ cits expressed across distinct cardiovascular autonomic pathophysiology. From a predictive coding per-spective, OI patients' data indicates a failure to attenuate/modulate ascending interoceptive prediction errors, reinforced by the concomitant failure to engage autonomic re ﬂ exes during HUT.

Specifically, it was tested whether attention allocation processes differ between individuals with overweight and normal weight using transient changes of food-related and neutral pictures. Change detection latencies in objects of central interest (CI) or objects of marginal interest (MI) were measured as an index of attention allocation in a sample of fifty-three students with overweight/obesity and sixty students with normal weight during a flicker paradigm with neutral, hypercaloric and hypocaloric food pictures. Both groups of participants showed an attentional bias for food-related pictures as compared to neutral pictures. However, the bias was larger in individuals with overweight than in individuals with normal weight when changes were of marginal interest, suggesting a stronger avoidance of the food-related picture. This study showed that food-related stimuli influence attention allocation processes in both participants with overweight and normal weight. In particular, as compared to individuals with normal weight, those with overweight seem to be characterised by a stronger attentional avoidance of (or smaller attention maintenance on) food-related stimuli that could be considered as a voluntary strategy to resist food consumption.","[{'authorId': '67123587', 'name': 'F.

Ten professional actors enacted 12 emotions in a scenario-based social interaction setting. Participants (N = 43) rated all emotional expressions with muted sound and blurred faces on six spatiotemporal characteristics of gestural arm movement that were found to be related to emotion in previous research (amount of movement, movement speed, force, fluency, size, and height/vertical position). Arousal and potency were found to be strong determinants of the perception of gestural dynamics, whereas the differences between positive or negative emotions were less pronounced. These results confirm the importance of arm movement in communicating major emotion dimensions and show that gesture forms an integrated part of multimodal nonverbal emotion communication.","[{'authorId': '47658592', 'name': 'N.

7924810f80a3472ade67cbced39262e2d1ef84cd,"Effective patient care, clinical research, and public health efforts require comparability of laboratory results independent of time, place, and measurement procedure. Comparability is achieved by establishing metrological traceability, which ensures that measurement procedures measure the same quantity and that the calibration of measurement procedures is traceable to a common reference system consisting of reference methods and materials. Whereas standardization ensures traceability to the International System of Units, harmonization ensures traceability to a reference system agreed on by convention. This article provides an overview of standardization and harmonization with an emphasis on commutability as an important variable that affects testing accuracy. Commutability of reference materials is required to ensure that traceability is established appropriately and that laboratory results are comparable. The use of noncommutable reference materials leads to inaccurate results. Whereas procedures and protocols for standardizing measurements are established and have been successfully applied in efforts such as the Hormones Standardization Program of the CDC, harmonization activities require new, more complex procedures and approaches. The American Association for Clinical Chemistry, together with its domestic and international partners, formed the International Consortium for Harmonization of Clinical Laboratory Results to coordinate harmonization efforts.

To describe the psychometric properties of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a brief measure of the prosocial behavior and psychopathology of 3-16-year-olds that can be completed by parents, teachers, or youths.


METHOD
A nationwide epidemiological sample of 10,438 British 5-15-year-olds obtained SDQs from 96% of parents, 70% of teachers, and 91% of 11-15-year-olds. Blind to the SDQ findings, all subjects were also assigned DSM-IVdiagnoses based on a clinical review of detailed interview measures.


RESULTS
The predicted five-factor structure (emotional, conduct, hyperactivity-inattention, peer, prosocial) was confirmed. Internalizing and externalizing scales were relatively ""uncontaminated"" by one another. Reliability was generally satisfactory, whether judged by internal consistency (mean Cronbach a: .73), cross-informant correlation (mean: 0.34), or retest stability after 4 to 6 months (mean: 0.62). SDQ scores above the 90th percentile predicted a substantially raised probability of independently diagnosed psychiatric disorders (mean odds ratio: 15.7 for parent scales, 15.2 for teacher scales, 6.2 for youth scales).


CONCLUSION
The reliability and validity of the SDQ make it a useful brief measure of the adjustment and psychopathology of children and adolescents.","[{'authorId': '2144914', 'name': 'R. Goodman'}]",5726.0,,18.0,Psychometric properties of the strengths and difficulties questionnaire.,2001.0

Nevertheless, empirical studies investigating this assumed relationship remain sparse. This study aimed to examine interrelations between the ability to perceive heartbeats accurately (interoceptive awareness), depressive symptoms, and anxiety in healthy participants. Methods: A well‐validated heartbeat perception task to measure interoceptive awareness together with two questionnaires indexing anxiety and depression were administered to 119 participants. Results: As main results we observed a negative correlation between heartbeat perception and depression. Only when focussing on high anxiety levels this negative correlation coefficient between depression and interoception remained significant. Conclusions: Our results highlight the possible relationship between depressive symptoms and interoceptive awareness and may have further implications for theoretical models of anxiety disorders and their treatment.

Factor analysis and reliability results confirmed the validity of ERQ to assess adolescents’ regulation strategies. Correlation and regression results showed that a greater reliance on CR was positively associated with better well-being outcomes for most indicators, especially life satisfaction, social support perception, and positive affect; greater preference for ES conversely was associated with lower well-being level for all indicators, including psychological health, emotional loneliness, and negative affect. Neither gender nor age differences were observed for CR and ES; CR and ES were positively correlated with each other. Both analysis of variance and regression results showed gender to be a significant factor for well-being indicators (e.g. males’ higher positive affect and life satisfaction than females’), whereas age was associated with differences in psychological health only, with 16-year olds reporting the lowest health, and 14-year olds the highest. The findings overall show that adolescents’ well-being is related to preferred EmR strategies, mirroring associations found in the adult population. The study results also suggest the need to further explore this relationship in adolescence.","[{'authorId': '2081475826', 'name': 'Chiara Verzeletti'}, {'authorId': '2420782', 'name': 'V.

7964021994ef9197505eb038a43fe3e2d798b59b,"Since Freud, clinicians have understood that disturbing memories contribute to psychopathology and that new emotional experiences contribute to therapeutic change. Yet, controversy remains about what is truly essential to bring about psychotherapeutic change. Mounting evidence from empirical studies suggests that emotional arousal is a key ingredient in therapeutic change in many modalities. In addition, memory seems to play an important role but there is a lack of consensus on the role of understanding what happened in the past in bringing about therapeutic change. The core idea of this paper is that therapeutic change in a variety of modalities, including behavioral therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, emotion-focused therapy, and psychodynamic psychotherapy, results from the updating of prior emotional memories through a process of reconsolidation that incorporates new emotional experiences. We present an integrated memory model with three interactive components - autobiographical (event) memories, semantic structures, and emotional responses - supported by emerging evidence from cognitive neuroscience on implicit and explicit emotion, implicit and explicit memory, emotion-memory interactions, memory reconsolidation, and the relationship between autobiographical and semantic memory. We propose that the essential ingredients of therapeutic change include: (1) reactivating old memories; (2) engaging in new emotional experiences that are incorporated into these reactivated memories via the process of reconsolidation; and (3) reinforcing the integrated memory structure by practicing a new way of behaving and experiencing the world in a variety of contexts. The implications of this new, neurobiologically grounded synthesis for research, clinical practice, and teaching are discussed.","[{'authorId': '50480971', 'name': 'R.

Self-compassion and emotional regulation have been identified as constructive attitudes towards the self which can reduce emotional distress. This study is the first to examine the role of a self-compassionate attitude towards the self in reducing symptoms of social anxiety. The study also explored the role of emotional regulation strategies of cognitive reappraisal (CR) and expressive suppression (ES) as mechanisms that mediate the impact of self-compassion on social anxiety.


DESIGN
Structural equation modelling (SEM) was conducted on cross-sectional correlational data with MPlus version 6.


METHODS
A sample of 750 undergraduate students (378 men and 372 women) completed an online survey comprised of well validated self-report measures of social anxiety, emotional regulation and self-compassion.


RESULTS
Structural equation modelling showed that self-compassion predicted lower social anxiety directly and indirectly through lower ES. Higher self-compassion also predicted higher CR. Contrary to expectation, CR did not predict lower social anxiety. Exploratory analyses of self-compassion divided into Compassionate Self-responding (CSR) and Refraining from Non-compassionate Responding (RUSR) identified RUSR as a predictor of lower social anxiety directly and indirectly via ES and CR. CSR had no direct effect on social anxiety but did so indirectly via CR.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings provide preliminary evidence that self-compassion can play an important role in alleviating social anxiety and that emotion regulation through ES and CR are important mechanisms of that influence.


PRACTITIONER POINTS
Adopting a more compassionate attitude towards the self can reduce the symptoms of social anxiety Emotional regulation through reducing emotional suppression may be a mechanism whereby higher levels of self-compassion reduce symptoms of social anxiety. Although higher levels of self-compassion predict greater use of emotional regulation through cognitive appraisal, cognitive appraisal does not predict levels of symptoms of social anxiety The capacity to refrain from non-compassionate self-responding may reduce symptoms of social anxiety directly and indirectly through lower levels of emotional suppression and greater cognitive reappraisal (CR). However, compassionate self-responding only influences symptoms of social anxiety through CR.","[{'authorId': '34620978', 'name': 'G. Bates'}, {'authorId': '52167054', 'name': 'B.

We hypothesized that trait self-esteem would be related to social pain responsiveness, and we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to experimentally investigate this potential relationship. Participants (n = 26) performed a cyberball task, a computerized game of catch during which the participants were excluded from the game. Participants then rated the degree of social pain experienced during both inclusion in and exclusion from the game. Individuals with lower trait self-esteem reported increased social pain relative to individuals with higher trait self-esteem, and such individuals also demonstrated a greater degree of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activation. A psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed a positive connectivity between the dorsal anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices for the lower trait self-esteem group, and a corresponding negative connectivity for the higher trait self-esteem group. Heightened dorsal anterior cortex activity and a corresponding connection with the prefrontal cortex might be one possible explanation for the greater levels of social pain observed experienced by individuals with low trait self-esteem.","[{'authorId': '2660754', 'name': 'K.

This secondary mode of interactive communication is hypothesized to permit a more natural collaboration, similar to the ""body language"" interaction between two cooperating humans. This paper describes the implementation and validation of a hidden Markov model (HMM) for estimating human affective state in real time, using robot motions as the stimulus. Inputs to the system are physiological signals such as heart rate, perspiration rate, and facial muscle contraction. Affective state was estimated using a two- dimensional valence-arousal representation. A robot manipulator was used to generate motions expected during human-robot interaction, and human subjects were asked to report their response to these motions. The human physiological response was also measured. Robot motions were generated using both a nominal potential field planner and a recently reported safe motion planner that minimizes the potential collision forces along the path. The robot motions were tested with 36 subjects. This data was used to train and validate the HMM model.

Religious attendance is associated with U.S. adult mortality in a graded fashion: People who never attend exhibit 1.87 times the risk of death in the follow-up period compared with people who attend more than once a week. This translates into a seven-year difference in life expectancy at age 20 between those who never attend and those who attend more than once a week. Health selectivity is responsible for a portion of the religious attendance effect: People who do not attend church or religious services are also more likely to be unhealthy and, conse-quently, to die. However, religious attendance also works through increased social ties and behavioral factors to decrease the risks of death. And although the magnitude of the association between religious attendance and mortality varies by cause of death, the direction of the association is consistent across causes.","[{'authorId': '5945819', 'name': 'R.

Children with autism have difficulties with social interaction and several studies indicate that they show preference toward interaction with objects, such as computers and robots, rather than with humans. In 1991, Carol Gray developed Social Stories, an intervention tool aimed to increase children’s social skills. Social stories are short scenarios written or tailored for autistic individuals to help them understand and behave appropriately in social situations. This study shows that, in specific situations, the social performance of autistic children improves when using the robot Probo, as a medium for social story telling, than when a human reader tells the stories. The robot tells Social Stories to teach ASD children how to react in situations like saying “hello”, saying “thank you” and “sharing toys”. The robot has the capability of expressing emotions and attention via its facial expressions and its gaze.

Existing systems are mainly based on simplified protocols which qualitatively evaluate subject performance. We propose a robotic coaching platform for training social, motor and cognitive capabilities, with two main contributions: (i) using triadic interactions(adult, robot and child), with robotic mirroring, and (ii) providing quantitative performance indicators. The key system features were accurately designed, including type of protocols, feedback systems and evaluation metrics, contemplating the requirements for applications with ASD children. We implemented two protocols, Robot-Master and Adult-Master, where children performed different gestures guided by the robot or the adult respectively, eventually receiving feedback about movement execution. In both, the robot mirrors the subject during the movement. To assess system functionalities, with a homogeneous group of subjects, tests were carried out with 28 healthy subjects; one preliminary acquisition was done with an ASD child. Data analysis was customized to design protocol-specific parameters for movement characterization. Our tests show that robotic mirroring execution depends on the complexity and standardization of movements, as well as on the robot technical features. The feedback system evaluated movement phases and successfully estimated the completion of the exercises. Future work includes improving platform flexibility and adaptability, and clinical trials with ASD children to test the impact of the robotic coach on reducing symptoms. We trust that the proposed quantitative performance indicators extend the current state-of-the-art towards clinical usage of robotic-based coaching systems.","[{'authorId': '118399629', 'name': 'Laura Santos'}, {'authorId': '26602958', 'name': 'A.

Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to test an emotion regulation model of self-compassion and stress among psychologists, including postgraduate trainees undertaking clinical work (n = 198). Self-compassion significantly negatively predicted emotion regulation difficulties and stress symptoms.

Building on meta-analytic data, this study finds greater support for the causal relationships implied by a psychological construal of the construct and reveals that CO influences frontline employees' job outcomes through its effects on stress and engagement. Moderation analyses also indicate that CO's influence on model variables is stronger when frontline employees' customer workloads increase and is weaker as the need for customer persuasion increases. These findings contradict widely held assumptions rooted in a behavioral view of CO—namely, that CO is a consequence of job states, a proximate determinant of job outcomes, and most beneficial when ample opportunity for customer engagement exists. Overall, the results support a broadened perspective that recognizes that CO improves job outcomes because it enhances frontline employees' psychological welfare in addition to being good for business. These findings suggest that managers should consider CO an important criterion in frontline employee decisions, recognize CO as beneficial when limited opportunity for customer engagement exists, and avoid efforts to curtail CO's costs at the frontline employee level.","[{'authorId': '7391583', 'name': 'A.

 This paper envisions a future where autonomous agents are used to foster and support pro-social behavior in a hybrid society of humans and machines. Pro-social behavior occurs when people and agents perform costly actions that benefit others. Acts such as helping others voluntarily, donating to charity, providing informations or sharing resources, are all forms of pro-social behavior. We discuss two questions that challenge a purely utilitarian view of human decision making and contextualize its role in hybrid societies: i) What are the conditions and mechanisms that lead societies of agents and humans to be more pro-social? ii) How can we engineer autonomous entities (agents and robots) that lead to more altruistic and cooperative behaviors in a hybrid society? We propose using social simulations, game theory, population dynamics, and studies with people in virtual or real environments (with robots) where both agents and humans interact. This research will constitute the basis for establishing the foundations for the new field of Pro-social Computing, aiming at understanding, predicting and promoting pro-sociality among humans, through artificial agents and multiagent systems.

Boys are usually more aggressive than girls, have lower self-regulation and understand primary emotions less. However, those who understand emotions better behave more prosocially. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the relationship of self-regulation and emotion understanding  with regard to aggressive behaviour in preschool boys. The participants in this  study included 241 boys aged 3 to 7, their parents (both mothers and fathers) and preschool teachers. Self-regulation was measured by parental estimations of inhibitory control and attentional focusing. Aggressive behaviour was measured by teachers' estimations, while emotion understanding was assessed in individual interviews with the boys. The results showed that the boys who recognized and described primary emotions better and had high self-regulation showed less aggressive behaviour, while those who understood emotions less and had low self-regulation behaved more aggressively. The results were discussed in the light of importance of strengthening self-regulation and emotion understanding in preschool boys as a way of developing their social and emotional competence.  Key words: aggressive behaviour; emotion understanding; preschool boys; self-regulation  --- Sažetak Dosadasnja istraživanja pokazala su da djeca koja imaju bolju samokontrolu manifestiraju manje agresivnog ponasanja u svakodnevnim vrsnjackim interakcijama.

The following skills are investigated: technical, information, communication, collaboration, critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills. To understand differences in the level of these skills among workers, we need to know the factors that determine an individual’s skill level. A systematic literature review was conducted to provide a comprehensive overview of empirical studies measuring skill determinants. The results show that there is strong need for research on determinants of communication and collaboration skills. In a digital context, determinants for creativity and critical thinking are hardly studied. Furthermore, the identified determinants of 21st-century skills studies are limited to personality and psychological determinants, neglecting, for example, social determinants such as social support.

Prior work in psychology has demonstrated that both the trust violation framing and the trust repair strategy influence how effectively trust can be restored. We investigate trust repair between a human and a robot in the context of a competitive game, where a robot tries to restore a human's trust after a broken promise, using either a competence or integrity trust violation framing and either an apology or denial trust repair strategy. Results from a $2\times 2$ between-subjects study ($n=82$) show that participants interacting with a robot employing the integrity trust violation framing and the denial trust repair strategy are significantly more likely to exhibit behavioral retaliation toward the robot. In the Dyadic Trust Scale survey, an interaction between trust violation framing and trust repair strategy was observed. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering both trust violation framing and trust repair strategy choice when designing robots to repair trust. We also discuss the influence of human-to-robot promises and ethical considerations when framing and repairing trust between a human and robot.","[{'authorId': '36152065', 'name': 'S.

Indeed, they considered that they were capable of coping with difficulties with some compensatory strategies. They therefore declared that they did not need or want a robot for the moment but that they considered it potentially useful either for themselves in the future or for other older adults suffering from frailty, loneliness, and disability.

This sociological version complements the psychological and attitudinal conceptualizations of experimental and survey researchers. Trust is seen to include both emotional and cognitive dimensions and to function as a deep assumption underwriting social order. Contemporary examples such as lying, family exchange, monetary attitudes, and litigation illustrate the centrality of trust as a sociological reality. In recent years, sociologists have begun to treat trust as a sociological topic (e.g., Conviser; Garfinkel; Haas and Deseran; Henslin; Holzner; Strub and Priest; Weigert,a,b). Indeed, two short and powerful books, Niklas Luhmann's Trust and Pauoer (1979) and Bernard Barber's The Logic and Limits of Trust (1983), have placed trust at the center of sociological theorizing about contemporary society. Nevertheless, we agree with Luhmann's lament that there is a ""regrettably sparse literature which has trust as its main theme within sociology"" (8). There is a large quantity of research on trust by experimental psychologists and political scientists, which, however, appears theoretically unintegrated and incomplete from the standpoint of a sociology of trust. These researchers typically conceptualize trust as a psychological event within the individual rather than as an intersubjective or systemic social reality. They also tend to use methodological approaches that reduce trust to its cognitive content through psychometric scaling techniques or to its behavioral expressions in laboratory settings.

Objectives Based on the theories of regulatory focus and value control, this study developed a multi-mediation model to investigate whether self-efficacy and academic emotions can mediate the relationship between regulatory focus and online learning engagement. Methods A total of 926 high school student (52.16% female, mean age = 16.47 years) were recruited to participate in this study and completed self-report measures of regulatory focus, online learning engagement, online learning self-efficacy and academic emotions. And we used SPSS macro PROCESS developed by Hayes to examine the mediating role of online learning self-efficacy and academic emotions. Results and Conclusions The results indicated that promotion focus had a stable positive effect on online learning engagement of high school students, whereas prevention focus had a significant negative effect on the same.

However, there is no clarity on the impact of the interaction quality between a child with ASD and a robot on the effectiveness of the therapy. Previous research showed that the use of a robot in Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) could be an effective treatment component in diminishing ASD-related symptoms. Further analyzing the data from a randomized controlled trial of PRT treatment, we looked at the long-term effects of child–robot game interactions to see whether the interaction quality changes over time. The attention and the engagement of six children were measured through the observation of non-verbal behavior at three different stages in the treatment that took 20 sessions per child. The gaze and arm/hand behavior of the participants towards the robot, the game, and other present humans were observed. The analysis showed no significant decrease in the attention and the engagement of the children towards the robot and the game. However, the attention and engagement toward the parents of the children increased. We conclude that the main result of sustained attention and engagement with the robot is due to the personalization of the games to meet the specific needs of this user group. These specific needs are met through inclusion of variability to the level of development and personal choice of each participating child. We see the additional finding of increased attention towards the parents as especially positive since the children are expected to improve in human–human interaction as a result of this treatment.","[{'authorId': '2003378087', 'name': 'M.

How may prospective owners of a personal robot feel about the data that might be collected about them? In order to investigate this issue experimentally, we conducted an exploratory study where 12 participants were exposed to an HRI scenario in which disclosure of personal information became an issue.

The physiological component has been described as changes in the peripheral autonomic nervous system often characterized by increased sweating, throbbing of the heart, pupillary dilation, facial flush, and gastric motility. These physiological responses have been hypothesized as either a necessary mediating mechanism or a peripheral correlate of the emotional experience (Cannon, 1927; James, 1884). Moreover, there is renewed speculation that some physiological signatures are associated with specific emotional states (e.g., Ekman, Levenson, & Friesen, 1983). In contrast with the research that has eloquently described detailed facial patterns and the social contexts associated with specific emotions, the role of physiology in the development of expressivity and the regulation of affect has not been adequately investigated. Although in the temperament literature a physiological substrate is commonly assumed to be related to the regulation of affect (e.g., Bates, Freeland, & Lounsbury, 1979; Rothbart & Derryberry, 1981), physiological measures are seldom quantified. Moreover, physiological constructs rarely motivate this area of research or provide insight into individual variations in the regulation and expression of affect.","[{'authorId': '4226466', 'name': 'S.

In Speculative Everything, Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby propose a kind of design that is used as a tool to create not only things but ideas. For them, design is a means of speculating about how things could be -- to imagine possible futures. This is not the usual sort of predicting or forecasting, spotting trends and extrapolating; these kinds of predictions have been proven wrong, again and again. Instead, Dunne and Raby pose ""what if"" questions that are intended to open debate and discussion about the kind of future people want (and do not want). Speculative Everything offers a tour through an emerging cultural landscape of design ideas, ideals, and approaches. Dunne and Raby cite examples from their own design and teaching and from other projects from fine art, design, architecture, cinema, and photography. They also draw on futurology, political theory, the philosophy of technology, and literary fiction. They show us, for example, ideas for a solar kitchen restaurant; a flypaper robotic clock; a menstruation machine; a cloud-seeding truck; a phantom-limb sensation recorder; and devices for food foraging that use the tools of synthetic biology. Dunne and Raby contend that if we speculate more -- about everything -- reality will become more malleable.

Methods:In the nursing home, patients were assigned by living units, based on dementia severity, to one of the three parallel therapeutic arms to compare: CONTROL, PARO and NAO (Phase 1) and CONTROL, PARO, and DOG (Phase 2). In the day care center, all patients received therapy with NAO (Phase 1) and PARO (Phase 2). Therapy sessions were held 2 days per week during 3 months. Evaluation, at baseline and follow-up, was carried out by blind raters using: the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), the Severe Mini Mental State Examination (sMMSE), the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), the Apathy Scale for Institutionalized Patients with Dementia Nursing Home version (APADEM-NH), the Apathy Inventory (AI) and the Quality of Life Scale (QUALID). Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests performed by a blinded investigator. Results: In the nursing home, 101 patients (Phase 1) and 110 patients (Phase 2) were included. There were no significant differences at baseline. The relevant changes at follow-up were: (Phase 1) patients in the robot groups showed an improvement in apathy; patients in NAO group showed a decline in cognition as measured by the MMSE scores, but not the sMMSE; the robot groups showed no significant changes between them; (Phase 2) QUALID scores increased in the PARO group. In the day care center, 20 patients (Phase 1) and 17 patients (Phase 2) were included. The main findings were: (Phase 1) improvement in the NPI irritability and the NPI total score; (Phase 2) no differences were observed at follow-up.","[{'authorId': '4916858', 'name': 'Meritxell Valentí Soler'}, {'authorId': '114185955', 'name': 'L.

Facial expressions and behaviours are two important channels for human-robot interaction. Robot performance based on a static emotional state cannot vividly display dynamic and complex emotional transference. Building a real-time emotional interactive model is a critical part of robot expression. First, the attenuating emotional state space is defined and the state transfer probability is acquired. Secondly, the emotional expression model based on the HMM is proposed and the performance transference probability is calculated. Finally, this model is verified by a 15 degrees of freedom robot platform. Moreover, the interactive effects are analysed by a statistical algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the emotional expression model can acquire an expressive performance and remove the mechanized interactive mode when compared to traditional algorithms.","[{'authorId': '2070510244', 'name': 'Liu Xin'}, {'authorId': '49633798', 'name': 'Xie Lun'}, {'authorId': '2108081157', 'name': 'Zhi-liang Wang'}, {'authorId': '2061347755', 'name': 'Dong-mei Fu'}]",15.0,,13.0,Robot Emotion and Performance Regulation Based on HMM,2013.0

We tested whether humans can also strategically deploy transient facial movements to camouflage the default social traits conveyed by the phenotypic morphology of their faces. We used the responses of 12 observers to create models of the dynamic facial signals of dominance, trustworthiness, and attractiveness. We applied these dynamic models to facial morphologies differing on perceived dominance, trustworthiness, and attractiveness to create a set of dynamic faces; new observers rated each dynamic face according to the three social traits. We found that specific facial movements camouflage the social appearance of a face by modulating the features of phenotypic morphology. A comparison of these facial expressions with those similarly derived for facial emotions showed that social-trait expressions, rather than being simple one-to-one overgeneralizations of emotional expressions, are a distinct set of signals composed of movements from different emotions. Our generative face models represent novel psychophysical laws for social sciences; these laws predict the perception of social traits on the basis of dynamic face identities.","[{'authorId': '145806226', 'name': 'Daniel Gill'}, {'authorId': '48522841', 'name': 'Oliver G.

Existing research suggests that although accurate judgments of another's trustworthiness require extensive interactions with the person, we often make trustworthiness judgments based on facial cues on the first encounter. However, little is known about what facial cues are used for such judgments and what the bases are on which individuals make their trustworthiness judgments. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that individuals may use facial attractiveness cues as a “shortcut” for judging another's trustworthiness due to the lack of other more informative and in-depth information about trustworthiness. Using data-driven statistical models of 3D Caucasian faces, we compared facial cues used for judging the trustworthiness of Caucasian faces by Caucasian participants who were highly experienced with Caucasian faces, and the facial cues used by Chinese participants who were unfamiliar with Caucasian faces. We found that Chinese and Caucasian participants used similar facial cues to judge trustworthiness. Also, both Chinese and Caucasian participants used almost identical facial cues for judging trustworthiness and attractiveness. Conclusions/Significance The results suggest that without opportunities to interact with another person extensively, we use the less racially specific and more universal attractiveness cues as a “shortcut” for trustworthiness judgments.","[{'authorId': '48101393', 'name': 'Fen Xu'}, {'authorId': '6945822', 'name': 'Dingcheng Wu'}, {'authorId': '6888388', 'name': 'Rie Toriyama'}, {'authorId': '2010071', 'name': 'Fengling Ma'}, {'authorId': '3003945', 'name': 'S.

Little work thus far in CSCW and HCI has examined the potential of technology to support or enhance such interventions. This paper provides the first steps to unpacking this socio-technical design space, focusing on emotional regulation (ER) as a specific instance of a protective factor. We combine a user-centred approach to understanding lived experiences of families (interviews, design workshops) with an expert-led understanding of what makes interventions psychologically effective. Our findings suggest the potential of technology to enable a shift in how prevention interventions are designed and delivered: empowering children and parents through a new model of 'child-led, situated interventions', where participants learn through actionable support directly within family life, as opposed to didactic in-person workshops and a subsequent 'skills application'. This conceptual model was then instantiated in a technology probe, which was deployed with 14 families.

The system relies on the learning by teaching paradigm to build an interaction, so as to stimulate meta-cognition, empathy and increased self-esteem in the child user. We hypothesise that use of a humanoid robot in such a system could not just engage an unmotivated student, but could also present the opportunity for children to experience physically-induced benefits encountered during human-led handwriting interventions, such as motor mimicry.By leveraging simulated handwriting on a synchronised tablet display, a NAo humanoid robot with limited fine motor capabilities has been configured as a suitably embodied handwriting partner. Statistical shape models derived from principal component analysis of a dataset of adult-written letter trajectories allow the robot to draw purposefully deformed letters. By incorporating feedback from user demonstrations, the system is then able to learn the optimal parameters for the appropriate shape models.Preliminary in situ studies have been conducted with primary school classes to obtain insight into children’s use of the novel system. Children aged 6–8 successfully engaged with the robot and improved its writing to a level which they were satisfied with.

This study examined neuroendocrine and cardiovascular responses to performance and peer rejection stressors over the adolescent transition in a normative sample. Participants were 82 healthy children (ages 7–12 years, n = 39, 22 females) and adolescents (ages 13–17, n = 43, 20 females) recruited through community postings. Following a habituation session, participants completed a performance (public speaking, mental arithmetic, mirror tracing) or peer rejection (exclusion challenges) stress session. Salivary cortisol, salivary alpha amylase (sAA), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), and heart rate were measured throughout. Adolescents showed significantly greater cortisol, sAA, SBP, and DBP stress response relative to children. Developmental differences were most pronounced in the performance stress session for cortisol and DBP and in the peer rejection session for sAA and SBP. Heightened physiological stress responses in typical adolescents may facilitate adaptation to new challenges of adolescence and adulthood. In high-risk adolescents, this normative shift may tip the balance toward stress response dysregulation associated with depression and other psychopathology. Specificity of physiological response by stressor type highlights the importance of a multisystem approach to the psychobiology of stress and may also have implications for understanding trajectories to psychopathology.","[{'authorId': '4588779', 'name': 'L.

In general, people are said to create stereotypical agent behavioral models in their minds based on the agents' appearances, and these appearances significantly affect their way of interaction. Therefore, it is quite important to address with the following research question: How does an agent's appearance affect its interactions with people? Specifically, a preliminary experiment was conducted to select eight artificial sounds for which people can estimate two specific primitive attitudes (e.g., positive or negative). Then an experiment was conducted where the participants were presented with the selected artificial sounds through three kinds of agents: a MindStorms robot, AIBO robot, and laptop PC. In particular, the participants were asked to select the correct attitudes based on the sounds expressed by these three agents. The results showed that the participants had better interpretation rates when a PC presented the sounds and lower rates when the MindStorms and AIBO robots presented the sounds, even though the sounds expressed by these agents were the same. The results of this study contribute to the design policy of the interactive agents, such as, What types of appearances should agents have to effectively interact with people, and which kinds of information should these agents express to people?","[{'authorId': '1723194', 'name': 'T.

However, there is little work to guide decisions on the optimum number of trials to use, which should balance reliability and power against task duration and participant burden. Here, 174 participants completed 100 trials of a widely used heartbeat detection task where participants attempt to detect whether presented tones occurred synchronously or asynchronously with their heartbeats. First, we quantified measurement reliability of the participant's accuracy derived from differing numbers of trials of the task using a correlation metric; we found that at least 40-60 trials were required to yield sufficient reliability. Next, we quantified power by simulating how the number of trials influenced the ability to detect a correlation between cardiac interoceptive sensitivity and other variables that differ across participants, including a variable measured from our sample (body mass index) as well as simulated variables of varying effect sizes. Using these simulations, we quantified the trade-offs between sample size, effect size, and number of trials in the heartbeat detection task such that a researcher can easily determine any one of these variables at given values of the other two variables. We conclude that using fewer than 40 trials is typically insufficient due to poor reliability and low power in estimating an effect size, although the optimal number of trials can differ by study.","[{'authorId': '87262323', 'name': 'I.

This paper presents an exploratory study that, for the first time, uses the Regulatory Focus Theory (RFT) to assess children's creativity skills in an educational context with a social robot. We investigated whether two key emotional regulation techniques, promotion (approach) and prevention (avoidance), stimulate creativity during a story-telling activity between a child and a robot. We conducted a between-subjects field study with 69 children between the ages of 7 and 9 years old, divided between two study conditions: (1) promotion, where a social robot primes children for action by eliciting positive emotional states, and (2) prevention, where a social robot primes children for avoidance by evoking a states related to security and safety associated with blockage-oriented behaviors. To assess changes in creativity as a response to the priming interaction, children were asked to tell stories to the robot before (pre-test) and after (post-test) the priming interaction. We measured creativity levels by analyzing the verbal content of the stories. We coded verbal expressions related to creativity variables, including fluency, flexibility, elaboration, and originality. Our results show that children in the promotion condition generated significantly more ideas, and their ideas were on average more original in the stories they created in the post-test rather than in the pre-test. We also modeled the process of creativity that emerges during storytelling in response to the robot's verbal behavior. This paper enriches the scientific understanding of creativity emergence in child-robot collaborative interactions.","[{'authorId': '28908289', 'name': 'Maha Elgarf'}, {'authorId': '2052028871', 'name': 'Natalia Calvo-Barajas'}, {'authorId': '1401670338', 'name': 'Patrícia Alves-Oliveira'}, {'authorId': '1556566185', 'name': 'G.

An adaptive Fuzzy controller to map environmental inputs such as temperature, humidity, luminosity and human proximity to values of the PAD emotional model (Pleasure, Arousal, and Dominance) is proposed. The PAD values are used to change the performance of the robot trajectories designed to express different features. These robot motions are commanded by the Robust Generalized Predictive Controllers (RGPC) using convex optimization by Youla parametrization that involves the robot regulation with the adaptive motion.

Robots generally excel at specific tasks in structured environments but lack the versatility and the adaptability required to interact with and locomote within the natural world. To increase versatility in robot design, we present robotic skins that can wrap around arbitrary soft bodies to induce the desired motions and deformations. Robotic skins integrate actuation and sensing into a single conformable material and may be leveraged to create a multitude of controllable soft robots with different functions or gaits to accommodate the demands of different environments. We show that attaching the same robotic skin to a soft body in different ways, or to different soft bodies, leads to distinct motions. Further, we show that combining multiple robotic skins enables complex motions and functions. We demonstrate the versatility of this soft robot design approach in a wide range of applications—including manipulation tasks, locomotion, and wearables—using the same two-dimensional (2D) robotic skins reconfigured on the surface of various 3D soft, inanimate objects.","[{'authorId': '51054137', 'name': 'Joran W.

We train the fitting model for different users before recognition. A high-quality AAM alignment results rely on appropriate selections of initial positions. In our method, we apply partial AAM fitting on mouth and eyes. Therefore we could have a better alignment for facial features; as a result, it can implement for tracking real-world video and perform real-time alignment. To obtain stable partial AAM, we use multi-level optical flow to determine initial positions of facial feature models. Then we use the Eigen-faces dynamic face recognition system to recognize different users and select the trained fitting model in recognizing the facial expressions, we combine the methodology of facial expression recognition with Eigen-faces dynamic face recognition.

Very few studies have investigated emotion regulation in the context in which it is usually deployed, namely, the complexity of everyday life. We address this in the current paper by reporting findings of two experience-sampling studies (Ns = 46 and 95) investigating the use of six emotion-regulation strategies (reflection, reappraisal, rumination, distraction, expressive suppression, and social sharing) and their associations with changes in positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) in daily life. Regarding the relative use of emotion-regulation strategies, a highly similar ordering was found across both studies with distraction being used more than sharing and reappraisal. While the use of all six strategies was positively correlated both within- and between-persons, different strategies were associated with distinct affective consequences: Suppression and rumination were associated with increases in NA and decreases in PA, whereas reflection was associated with increases in PA across both studies. Additionally, reappraisal, distraction, and social sharing were related to increases in PA in Study 2.

Data was collected by means of direct observation of people behaviour during interaction with robots. The most interesting result to emerge is that of young people: they tended to react to the robots presence with extreme curiosity and, quite often, to treat them aggressively. In this paper, the word bullying is used to describe any kind of improper and violent behaviour, intended to cause damages or impede the robot operation. It is the authors' opinion that if not tackled appropriately, abuses towards robots may become a serious hindrance to their future deployment, and safety. Hence, the necessity to tackle this issue with dedicated solutions during the early phases of design.","[{'authorId': '153723511', 'name': 'P. Salvini'}, {'authorId': '3141568', 'name': 'G.

Studies on the prevalence, incidence, persistence and resolution of NPS in patients living in nursing homes are sparse. The aim of this study was to evaluate the course of NPS in patients with dementia living in Norwegian nursing homes. Methods: 169 patients from seven Norwegian nursing homes were assessed five times over a period of 16 months with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). The severity and the frequency of the NPI were analyzed. Results: 91.7% of the patients had at least one clinically significant NPS at one or more assessments over the 16 months. Irritability (63.5%), agitation (51.0%) and disinhibition (50.0%) had the highest cumulative prevalence, while irritability (42.6%), disinhibition (37.8%) and depression (31.5%) showed the highest cumulative incidence. Delusion, agitation and irritability were enduring symptoms while the other symptoms had high resolution rates. The severity of the NPS did not vary significantly over time. Conclusion: Almost every patient in Norwegian nursing homes had at least one clinically significant NPS over 16 months, but individual NPS show a fluctuating course. This should influence how we monitor and treat NPS in patients with dementia.","[{'authorId': '107960689', 'name': 'S. Bergh'}, {'authorId': '6900012', 'name': 'K.

8246cb158c7da0b01a5e9269f7319ab5a1410ebd,"The independence of positive and negative affect has been heralded as a major and counterintuitive finding in the psychology of mood and emotion. Still, other findings support the older view that positive and negative fall at opposite ends of a single bipolar continuum. Independence versus bipolarity can be reconciled by considering (a) the activation dimension of affect, (b) random and systematic measurement error, and (c) how items are selected to achieve an appropriate test of bipolarity. In 3 studies of self-reported current affect, random and systematic error were controlled through multiformat measurement and confirmatory factor analysis. Valence was found to be independent of activation, positive affect the bipolar opposite of negative affect, and deactivation the bipolar opposite of activation. The dimensions underlying D. Watson, L. A. Clark, and A. Tellegen's (1988) Positive and Negative Affect schedule were accounted for by the valence and activation dimensions. A consensus on a descriptive structure of current affect is at hand—if we can only agree on what the structure is. The psychology of mood, emotion, and affect needs a consensual structure and is tantalizingly close to achieving one. Among the remaining disagreements, the most puzzling and persistent is bipolarity versus independence. Is positive affect the bipolar opposite of, or is it independent of, negative affect? Are happiness and sadness two ends of one continuum, or separate entities, like apples and oranges? A resolution to this puzzle is needed to answer questions about the number of dimensions of affect, how affect should be measured, and the underlying processes involved. Despite repeated attempts, a solution to this puzzle remains elusive, and a long-simmering debate has recently flared up. Much is at stake in this debate, for important lines of research have arisen on these opposing assumptions. This article offers conceptual and empirical analyses aimed at resolving the dispute.","[{'authorId': '1731779', 'name': 'L. F. Barrett'}, {'authorId': '46367714', 'name': 'J.

Depressive symptoms may be present in any of the psychiatric disturbances seen in such a clinic, and a diagnosis of depressive disorder must still be made on a clinical basis. However, the use of such a scale is valuable in documenting and quantitating initial symptoms and complaints, and following changes in the patient's clinical course subsequent to treatment, using any of the modalities available.

In particular, the roles of the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and inferior parietal lobe (IPL) in proactive and reactive inhibitory control are still under debate. This study aimed at examining the causal role of the right IFG and IPL in proactive and reactive inhibitory control, using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and the stop signal task. Twenty-two participants completed three sessions of the stop signal task, under anodal tDCS in the right IFG, the right IPL, or the primary visual cortex (VC; 1.5 mA for 15 min), respectively. The VC stimulation served as the active control condition. The tDCS effect for each condition was calculated as the difference between pre- and post-tDCS performance. Proactive control was indexed by the RT increase for go trials (or preparatory cost), and reactive control by the stop signal RT. Compared to the VC stimulation, anodal stimulation of the right IFG, but not that of the IPL, facilitated both proactive and reactive control. However, the facilitation of reactive control was not mediated by the facilitation of proactive control. Furthermore, tDCS did not affect the intraindividual variability in go RT. These results suggest a causal role of the right IFG, but not the right IPL, in both reactive and proactive inhibitory control.","[{'authorId': '2116972603', 'name': 'Ying Cai'}, {'authorId': '1390905572', 'name': 'Siyao Li'}, {'authorId': '2153466659', 'name': 'Jing Liu'}, {'authorId': '46599097', 'name': 'Dawei Li'}, {'authorId': '1853355', 'name': 'Zifang Feng'}, {'authorId': '1896016766', 'name': 'Qiang Wang'}, {'authorId': '49752037', 'name': 'Chuansheng Chen'}, {'authorId': '143877322', 'name': 'G.

This developmental period is one when an individual is probably stronger, of higher reasoning capacity, and more resistant to disease than ever before, yet when mortality rates increase by 200%. These untimely deaths are not due to disease but to preventable deaths associated with adolescents putting themselves in harm's way (e.g., accidental fatalities). We present evidence that these alarming health statistics are in part due to diminished self-control--the ability to inhibit inappropriate desires, emotions, and actions in favor of appropriate ones. Findings of adolescent-specific changes in self-control and underlying brain circuitry are considered in terms of how evolutionarily based biological constraints and experiences shape the brain to adapt to the unique intellectual, physical, sexual, and social challenges of adolescence.","[{'authorId': '145144855', 'name': 'B.

Research reveals that counselling victims of violent crime may cause psychological symptoms in trauma workers, which in turn may lead to Secondary Traumatic Stress (STS).

Furthermore there also appears to be a lack of studies that focus on the roles that key variables play in the transmission of STS. Therefore through the analysis of 64 self-report questionnaires, we aim to explore the psychological impact on trauma workers who work with ‘victims’ of violent crimes, specifically focusing on the level of exposure to traumatic material; level of empathy; level of perceived social support and their relation to STS. In order to test these hypotheses, analysis comprised simple statistics, correlations, a t test and a moderate multiple regression. Results indicate that the trauma workers, to some extent, experience symptoms of STS. In addition, it was found that previous exposure to traumatic material (in the personal lives of counsellors), level of empathy, and level of perceived social support have a significant relationship with STS. Social support was not found to have a moderating effect, but empathy emerged as a consistent moderator between the trauma workers' previous exposure to traumatic material and STS.","[{'authorId': '114203301', 'name': 'Victoria MacRitchie'}, {'authorId': '2070688041', 'name': 'S.

An increasing number of experiments attempt to examine the influence of affect on other psychological phenomena. To accomplish this research, it is necessary to experimentally modify participants' affective states. In the present experiment, we compared the efficacy of four commonly used affect induction procedures. Participants (38 healthy undergraduate students: 18 males) were randomly assigned to either a pleasant or an unpleasant affect induction group, and then underwent four different affect induction procedures: (1) recall of an affectively salient event accompanied by affectively congruent music, (2) script-driven guided imagery, (3) viewing images while listening to affectively congruent music, and (4) posing affective facial actions, body postures, and vocal expressions.

Using a non-anthropomorphic social robot and a simple counting game, we examine the effects that empathy-generating robot dialogue has on participant performance across three conditions. In the self-directed condition, the robot petitions the participant to reduce his or her performance so that the robot can avoid punishment. In the externally-directed condition, the robot petitions on behalf of its programmer so that its programmer can avoid punishment. The control condition does not involve any petitions for empathy. We find that externally-directed petitions from the robot show a higher likelihood of motivating the participant to sacrifice his or her own performance to help, at the expense of incurring negative social effects. We also find that experiencing these emotional dialogue events can have complex and difficult to predict effects, driving some participants to antipathy, leaving some unaffected, and manipulating others into feeling empathy towards the robot.","[{'authorId': '30325272', 'name': 'Bradley Hayes'}, {'authorId': '145164611', 'name': 'D.

However, little is known about differences in counselor burnout from the counselors' perspective in rural versus urban treatment centers. In 2008, focus group data from 28 rural and urban counselors in a southern state were analyzed, revealing three burnout themes across all counselors: causes, consequences, and prevention. However, there were various differences between rural and urban counselors in subthemes, with only rural counselors citing office politics and low occupational prestige as causes of burnout. Only urban counselors reported responses endorsing the subthemes of role reversal, clients trying to choose their counselors, and changing jobs as consequences of burnout. All counselors cited coworker support, clinical supervision, and self-care as important strategies for managing burnout. In sum, context clearly matters as rural counselors cited more causes of burnout; yet, the implications of burnout are universal in that they often lead to poor quality clinical care. There is a continued need for greater understanding of addiction as a disease, which would reduce stigma, especially in rural areas, as well as increase the prestige and earning potential of the substance abuse counseling occupation.","[{'authorId': '4239295', 'name': 'C.

Since our cognitive system specializes in recognizing a human, avatars of the distant people can make us strongly feel that we share space with them, provided that their appearance has been designed to sufficiently resemble humans. In this paper, we investigate the minimal requirements of robot avatars for distant people to feel their presence. Toward this aim, we give an overview of the chronological development of Dogu̅, which are human figurines made in ancient Japan. This survey of the Dogu̅ shows that the torso, not the face, was considered the primary element for representing a human. It also suggests that some body parts can be represented in a simple form. Following the development of Dogu̅, we use a conversation task to examine what kind of body representation is necessary to feel a distant person's presence. The experimental results show that the forms for the torso and head are required to enhance this feeling, while other body parts have less impact. Finally, we summarize design considerations for communication avatars.","[{'authorId': '2177583', 'name': 'H.

While these investigations continue, significant progress has been made to adapt AFNI to fix such problems. Two separate lines of changes have been made. First, a long-tailed model for the spatial correlation of the FMRI noise characterized by autocorrelation function (ACF) was developed and implemented into the 3dClustSim tool for determining the cluster-size threshold to use for a given voxel-wise threshold. Second, the 3dttest++ program was modified to do randomization of the voxel-wise t-tests and then to feed those randomized t-statistic maps into 3dClustSim directly for cluster-size threshold determination-without any spatial model for the ACF. These approaches were tested with the Beijing subset of the FCON-1000 data collection. The first approach shows markedly improved (reduced) FPR, but in many cases is still above the nominal 5%. The second approach shows FPRs clustered tightly about 5% across all per-voxel p-value thresholds ≤ 0.01. If t-tests from a univariate GLM are adequate for the group analysis in question, the second approach is what the AFNI group currently recommends for thresholding. If more complex per-voxel statistical analyses are required (where permutation/randomization is impracticable), then our current recommendation is to use the new ACF modeling approach coupled with a per-voxel p-threshold of 0.001 or below. Simulations were also repeated with the now infamously “buggy” version of 3dClustSim: the effect of the bug on FPRs was minimal (of order a few percent).","[{'authorId': '114176426', 'name': 'R.

One aim is to specify this thesis with respect to language development. The empirical investigations show that language is the central means of creating pretence. By explicit metacommunication, children collaboratively negotiate the plot, transform meanings and distinguish fiction from reality. Thus, metacommunication functions as a verbal frame, determining the meanings within play. Thereby children overcome sympraxic language use which is characteristic of toddlers. Another result is that role play changes during the preschool years. The paper argues that these changes can be subsumed under a general developmental phenomenon, namely the transition of interpsychic into intrapsychic processes. A point of special interest is why preschoolers, through role play, can act in the ZPD, although their ability to cooperate with other children is only at a nascent stage. To explain this, the paper discusses several aspects of psychosocial development.","[{'authorId': '2073285770', 'name': 'Helga Andresen'}]",49.0,,53.0,Role Play and Language Development in the Preschool Years,2005.0

The results show that suppression is associated with less anxiety expression, greater physiological responding, and less memory for the speech while having no impact on negative affect.

The results suggest that the idea of a care-receiving robot is feasible and that the robot can help children learn new English verbs efficiently. In addition, we report on investigations into several forms of teaching performed by children, which were revealed through observations of the children, parent interviews, and other useful knowledge.

Data were collected using a semistructured interview with 6 female clients in humanistic psychotherapy. Grounded-theory analysis of this material suggests that a TO works through a 5-phase process of ‘holding’ in which the client successively integrates 3 themes: (a) the continuity of the therapist's existence, (b) connectedness with the therapist, and (c) the development of a new sense of self. A spiral microtheory is proposed that shows how these themes interact across time and relate to the client's experience of shame. The analysis suggests a use of TOs that is broader than D. W. Winnicott's (1953) conception and includes selfobject functions (H. Kohut, 1971).","[{'authorId': '8004217', 'name': 'J. Arthern'}, {'authorId': '4590963', 'name': 'A.

This is a first exploratory study aimed to analyze and compare the perspectives adopted on reflection (immersion and distancing) of negative experiences across therapy and the relationship between them and depressive symptoms in contrasting therapeutic outcomes of emotion-focused therapy (EFT). Method: Three good-outcomes cases and three poor-outcomes cases of EFT, diagnosed with mild to moderate depression at the beginning of therapy, were randomly selected. Immersion and distancing on negative experiences were analyzed using the measure of immersed and distanced speech. The depressive symptoms were assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Results: Significant differences across sessions were only found in the good-outcome cases which showed a significant decrease of immersion and an increase of distancing, and this evolution pattern was found related to the reduction of symptoms. Moreover, at the beginning of therapy, distancing was higher in the poor-outcome cases rather than in the good-outcome cases. Conclusion: The progressive and significant evolution from higher immersion at the initial phase to higher distancing in the final phase may be helpful in EFT for depression.","[{'authorId': '38289083', 'name': 'Eunice Barbosa'}, {'authorId': '144396863', 'name': 'Sara Silva'}, {'authorId': '113139253', 'name': 'J.

This cognitive control process, termed response inhibition, refers to the ability to inhibit an action once initiated and has been localized to the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) based on functional imaging and brain lesion studies. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a brain stimulation technique that can facilitate as well as impair cortical function. To explore whether response inhibition can be improved through rIFG electrical stimulation, we administered focal tDCS before subjects performed the stop signal task (SST), which measures response inhibition. Notably, activation of the rIFG by unilateral anodal stimulation significantly improved response inhibition, relative to a sham condition, whereas the same tDCS protocol did not affect response time in the go trials of the SST and in a control task. Furthermore, the SST was not affected by tDCS at a control site, the right angular gyrus. Our results are the first demonstration of response inhibition improvement with brain stimulation over rIFG and further confirm the rIFG involvement in this task. Although this study was conducted in healthy subjects, present findings with anodal rIFG stimulation support the use of similar paradigms for the treatment of cognitive control impairments in pathological conditions.","[{'authorId': '40470901', 'name': 'L.

89197409e5d2695788bb43787ccfa895f44b6caa,"Purpose: Professional service firms' clients often develop stronger attachments to their key contact employee than to the service firm. Since professionals are highly mobile, buyers of professional business services constantly have to decide whether to follow their key contact employee or remain with their incumbent firm, while service firms face the threat of losing customers if the employee leaves. This study examines how the key contact employee's human capital, the social capital between the contact employee and the client, and the service company's structural capital affect the decision whether to follow the key contact employee to another professional service firm. Methodology/approach: The model is tested on a sample of 120 organizational buyers of advertising services by using partial last squares, a structural equation modelling technique. Findings: Professional service firms' investments in company-specific structural capital create a deterrent for clients to follow the contact employee, because remaining with the service firm will increase clients' return on the service providers' structural capital. Furthermore, higher levels of structural capital reduce the value of the contact employee's investments in human capital should the employee leave. Conversely, human capital creates motivation to follow the contact employee, while social capital only provides value in combination with human capital. Research implications: This study employs concepts developed in economics and economic sociology rather than relationship marketing variables to examine attachments to individual professional service providers and to professional service firms. Practical implications: The findings underline the importance of competence, both at the company and individual level, for retaining clients of professional services. These results contrast previous studies emphasizing close interpersonal relationships and service firms' relationship-building activities. Originality/value/contribution: Human, social, and structural capital provide value to clients and therefore apply well to professional services. Hence, these variables provide alternative explanations to service firms' client retention or desertion than traditional relationship marketing variables do. The findings add to our understanding of service provider–client relationships in professional services and knowledge intensive firms.","[{'authorId': '118968803', 'name': 'Harald Biong'}, {'authorId': '119990073', 'name': 'A.

Interestingly, young men showed significantly higher proportions of deliberate smiles in comparison to laughter when interacting with people of a different age class than when interacting in same-age groups. The pattern of affiliative behaviours in women remained unaffected by the age composition of groups. This partly supports the power asymmetry hypothesis and suggests that in men, deliberate smiles could play a role in the regulation of hierarchical relationships.","[{'authorId': '48898927', 'name': 'M.

8984ce3123e185a2fdefa7951e16bd938faafd15,"Robotics is finally at the brink of entering our daily lives. Having transitioned from success in factory automation (auto assembly) and high-precision laboratory work (aiding DNA sequencing and medication delivery), it is now poised to move into much messier, less structured, and more uncertain human-inhabited environments. While simple robot vacuum cleaners are already doing their work in over a million homes, robotics researchers are eagerly developing much more complex and intelligent robots that will work with and for people in hospitals, elder care centers, and eventually homes. What happens when intelligent robots and people share an environment and even share goals? This question is at the heart of human-robot interaction (HRI), an inherently interdisciplinary research endeavor that brings together engineering and social science, cognitive science, neuroscience, ethics, and the disciplines directly related to the application domains the robot technology would operate in, such as health care and education. Human-robot interaction, as an instance of human-machine interaction, is as much a study of people as it is of robots; it requires us to gain insight into a new and dynamically changing relationship between humans and intelligent machines. Within the larger context of HRI, our research work is focused on socially assistive robotics (SAR), whose challenge is to aid people through social interaction, rather than through physical contact. SAR brings together HRI and assistive robotics, which has demonstrated successes in hands-on rehabilitation through the use of high-precision but low-autonomy and low-interactivity systems. Thus, SAR presents an entirely new set of research challenges, as we strive to understand how robots can interact with people in order to effectively and measurably help in the difficult processes of convalescence, rehabilitation, socialization, training, and education. It may seem counter-intuitive that physical robots are used for social assistance. After all, why not use software agents or devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) endowed with intelligent interfaces? The answer rests on the fundamentally human tendency to socially engage with, and attribute lifelike properties to machines, especially embodied ones like robots, that exhibit sufficient (often quite simple) attributes of biological-like movement or appearance. The human projection of intentions, goals, and emotions to such embodied devices has been shown to be is inescapable, culture-independent (although featuring culture-specific responses), uninhibited by sophistication of knowledge and familiarity with the details of the technology, and resistant to change with time or with repeated encounters. This means that people cannot help but respond …","[{'authorId': '1742183', 'name': 'M.

Their perceptual judgments are based on simple movement features, such as overall speed, but also on more intricate posture and dynamic cues. The systematic analysis of such features is complicated due to the difficulty of considering the large number of potentially relevant kinematic and dynamic parameters. To identify emotion-specific features we motion-captured the neutral and emotionally expressive (anger, happiness, sadness, fear) gaits of 25 individuals. Body posture was characterized by average flexion angles, and a low-dimensional parameterization of the spatio-temporal structure of joint trajectories was obtained by approximation with a nonlinear mixture model. Applying sparse regression, we extracted critical emotion-specific posture and movement features, which typically depended only on a small number of joints. The features we extracted from the motor behavior closely resembled features that were critical for the perception of emotion from gait, determined by a statistical analysis of classification and rating judgments of 21 observers presented with avatars animated with the recorded movements. The perceptual relevance of these features was further supported by another experiment showing that artificial walkers containing only the critical features induced high-level after-effects matching those induced by adaptation with natural emotional walkers.","[{'authorId': '5273793', 'name': 'Claire L.

Founded on these measures and desires, Arash was designed, built, improved, and enhanced to operate successfully in pediatric cancer hospitals. Two experiments were devised to evaluate the children’s level of acceptance and involvement with the robot, assess their feelings about it, and measure how much the robot was similar to the favored conceptual sketch. Both experiments were conducted in the form of storytelling and appearance/performance evaluations. The obtained results confirm high engagement and interest of pediatric cancer patients with the constructed robot.","[{'authorId': '145793437', 'name': 'A.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT, 1985, 56, 972988. In 4 experiments, children aged 4 and 6 years were assessed for their insight into the time course of emotion. 6-year-old Western and Chinese children exhibited a highly consistent pattern: they judged that an initially intense emotional reaction, be it positive or negative, would wane gradually over time. They made the same claim regarding their emotional rection to experiences that they recalled from their own lives. 4-year-olds were less consistent. In 2 experiments, they failed to show the gradual waning pattern that characterized the judgments of 6-year-olds.

Fifty 22- to 35-year-old men and women participated in structured interviews designed to assess identity and intimacy status. They also completed the Identity Status Incomplete Sentences Blank for Adults and several other paper-and-pencil inventories: the Edwards Personal Preference Schedule, the Inventory of Psychosocial Development, the Jourard Self-Disclosure Questionnaire, and the Yufit Intimacy-Isolation Scale. Results suggest that there is a relationship between identity status and intimacy in adults, that the interviews and the Identity Status Incomplete Sentences Blank for Adults are more closely related to each other than to other measures of theoretically similar constructs, and that these measures of identity and intimacy are useful with adults.

Given the common use of self-ratings and other-ratings (e.g., supervisor or coworker) of organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), the purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the extent to which these rating sources provide comparable information. The current study's results provided three important lines of evidence supporting the use and construct-related validity of self-rated OCB. The meta-analysis of mean differences demonstrated that the mean difference in OCB ratings is actually quite small between self- and other-raters. Importantly, the difference between self- and other-raters was influenced by neither the response scale (i.e., agreement vs. frequency) nor the use of antithetical/reverse-worded items on OCB scales. The meta-analysis of correlations showed that self- and other-ratings are moderately correlated but that self–other convergence is higher when antithetical items are not used and when agreement response scales are used. In addition, self-ratings and supervisor-ratings showed significantly more convergence than self-ratings and coworker-ratings. Finally, an evaluation of self-rated and other-rated OCB nomological networks showed that although self-rated and other-rated OCBs have similar patterns of relationships with common correlates, other-rated OCB generally contributed negligible incremental variance to correlates and only contributed appreciable incremental variance to other-rated behavioral variables (e.g., task performance and counterproductive work behavior). Implications and future research directions are discussed, particularly regarding the need to establish a nomological network for other-rated OCB.

Initial research has suggested that providing children with information about robots’ mechanical status does not alter children's humanlike perception of, and relationship formation with, social robots. Against this background, our study experimentally investigated the effects of transparency about a robot's lack of human psychological capacities (intelligence, self-consciousness, emotionality, identity construction, social cognition) on children's perceptions of a robot and their relationship to it. Our sample consisted of 144 children aged 8 to 9 years old who interacted with the Nao robot in either a transparent or a control condition. Transparency decreased children's humanlike perception of the robot in terms of animacy, anthropomorphism, social presence, and perceived similarity. Transparency reduced child-robot relationship formation in terms of decreased trust, while children's feelings of closeness toward the robot were not affected.","[{'authorId': '40913188', 'name': 'C.

Children with autism have impaired social communication and social interaction skills which make it difficult for them to participate in many different forms of social and collaborative play. Our proof-of-concept 10-week, long term study demonstrates how a humanoid robot can be used to foster and support collaborative play among children with autism. In this work, KASPAR operates fully autonomously, and uses information on the state of the game and behavior of the children to engage, motivate, encourage, and advise pairs of children playing an imitation game. Results are presented from a first evaluation study which examined whether having pairs of children with autism play an imitative, collaborative game with a humanoid robot affected the way these children would play the same game without the robot. Our initial evaluation involved six children with autism who each participated in 23 controlled play sessions both with and without the robot, using a specially designed imitation-based collaborative game. In total 78 play sessions were run. Detailed observational analyses of the children's behaviors indicated that different pairs of children with autism showed improved social behaviors in playing with each other after they played as pairs with the robot KASPAR compared to before they did so. These results are encouraging and provide a proof-of-concept of using an autonomously operating robot to encourage collaborative skills among children with autism.","[{'authorId': '3278532', 'name': 'Joshua Wainer'}, {'authorId': '2100046', 'name': 'B.

Although critical care nurses gain satisfaction from providing compassionate care to patients and patients' families, the nurses are also at risk for fatigue. The balance between satisfaction and fatigue is considered professional quality of life.


OBJECTIVES
To establish the prevalence of compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue in adult, pediatric, and neonatal critical care nurses and to describe potential contributing demographic, unit, and organizational characteristics.


METHODS
In a cross-sectional design, nurses were surveyed by using a demographic questionnaire and the Professional Quality of Life Scale to measure levels of compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction.


RESULTS
Nurses (n = 221) reported significant differences in compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue on the basis of sex, age, educational level, unit, acuity, change in nursing management, and major systems change.


CONCLUSIONS
Understanding the elements of professional quality of life can have a positive effect on work environment. The relationship between professional quality of life and the standards for a healthy work environment requires further investigation.

Depression is often characterized as a disorder of affect regulation. However, research focused on delineating the key dimensions of affective experience (other than valence) that are abnormal in depressive disorder has been scarce, especially in child and adolescent samples. As definitions of affect regulation center around processes involved in initiating, maintaining, and modulating the occurrence, intensity, and duration of affective experiences, it is important to examine the extent to which affective experiences of depressed youth differ on these dimensions from those of healthy youth.


METHODS
The affective behavior and experience of adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 75) were compared to a demographically matched cohort of healthy adolescents (n = 77). Both samples were recruited from community high schools. A multi-source (parents and adolescent), multi-method (interviews, behavioral observations, questionnaires) assessment strategy was used to examine positive and negative affects.


RESULTS
Depressed youth had significantly longer durations, higher frequency, and greater intensity when experiencing angry and dysphoric affects and shorter durations and less frequency of happy affect when compared to healthy youth. The most consistent, cross-method results were evident for duration of affect.


CONCLUSIONS
Clinically depressed adolescents experienced disturbances in affective functioning that were evident in the occurrence, intensity, and duration of affect.

Social robots, bearing embodied immediacy that fosters engaging and compliant interactions, are a unique platform to deliver problem-solving support such as thinking aloud to young learners. In this work, we explore the effects of a robot platform and the think-aloud strategy on learning outcomes in the context of a one-on-one tutoring interaction. Results from a 2x2 between-subjects study (n = 52) indicate that both the robot platform and use of the think-aloud strategy promoted learning gains for children. In particular, the robot platform effectively enhanced immediate learning gains, measured right after the tutoring session, while the think-aloud strategy improved persistent gains as measured approximately one week after the interaction. Moreover, our results show that a social robot strengthened students’ engagement and compliance with the think-aloud support while they performed cognitively demanding tasks. Our work indicates that robots can support metacognitive strategy use to effectively enhance learning and contributes to the growing body of research demonstrating the value of social robots in novel educational settings.","[{'authorId': '2764097', 'name': 'Aditi Ramachandran'}, {'authorId': '2805730', 'name': 'Chien-Ming Huang'}, {'authorId': '49343386', 'name': 'Edward Gartland'}, {'authorId': '1792053', 'name': 'B.

Studies (687; 4,946 effects, 49,473 participants) were included that elicited the discrete emotions of happiness, sadness, anger, and anxiety as independent variables with adults. Consistent with discrete emotion theory, there were (a) moderate differences among discrete emotions; (b) differences among discrete negative emotions; and (c) correlated changes in behavior, experience, and physiology (cognition and judgment were mostly not correlated with other changes). Valence, valence-arousal, and approach-avoidance models of emotion were not as clearly supported. There was evidence that these factors are likely important components of emotion but that they could not fully account for the pattern of results. Most emotion elicitations were effective, although the efficacy varied with the emotions being compared. Picture presentations were overall the most effective elicitor of discrete emotions. Stronger effects of emotion elicitations were associated with happiness versus negative emotions, self-reported experience, a greater proportion of women (for elicitations of happiness and sadness), omission of a cover story, and participants alone versus in groups. Conclusions are limited by the inclusion of only some discrete emotions, exclusion of studies that did not elicit discrete emotions, few available effect sizes for some contrasts and moderators, and the methodological rigor of included studies.","[{'authorId': '5078798', 'name': 'Heather C.

Different from data sets such as DEAP [15] and MAHNOB-HCI [31], DECAF contains (1) brain signals acquired using the Magnetoencephalogram (MEG) sensor, which requires little physical contact with the user's scalp and consequently facilitates naturalistic affective response, and (2) explicit and implicit emotional responses of 30 participants to 40 one-minute music video segments used in [15] and 36 movie clips, thereby enabling comparisons between the EEG versus MEG modalities as well as movie versus music stimuli for affect recognition. In addition to MEG data, DECAF comprises synchronously recorded near-infra-red (NIR) facial videos, horizontal Electrooculogram (hEOG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), and trapezius-Electromyogram (tEMG) peripheral physiological responses. To demonstrate DECAF's utility, we present (i) a detailed analysis of the correlations between participants' self-assessments and their physiological responses and (ii) single-trial classification results for valence, arousal and dominance, with performance evaluation against existing data sets.

ISBN13: 9780199758715David Harvey, a public intellectual and Marxist geographer published, The Enigma of Capital and the Crisis of Capitalism in 2010. While particularly relevant directly following the United States' Great Recession, this book is an academic tour de force that continues to be an essential read for anyone interested in the historical expansion of the economic crisis and the global social response, including the Occupy Wall Street Movement. The book is built upon identifying what capital is and how instability is inherently part of capitalism; this idea is what Harvey identifies as the 'crisis -prone' nature of the system. Often noted for his public discourse, Harvey has written this book to be accessible to a broad audience, providing an interesting read for both academics and laymen unfamiliar with Marxism, neoliberalism and related concepts. In The Enigma of Capital, audiences will not only find detailed critical and historical analyses of the movement of capital, but will also find fresh descriptions and innovative examples of the process.Those who know of Harvey's work may be most familiar with The Limits to Capital (1982), often noted as Harvey's magnum opus, which provides the theoretical foundations to many of his subsequent texts. The Enigma of Capital differs significantly from The Limits to Capital in a number of ways. Most importantly, The Enigma of Capital was written and published during an economic crisis. Harvey uses this juncture of crisis to identify the historical trends in the political economy that led to its current state. The organization of the book is reminiscent of A Brief History of Neoliberalism as published in 2005, in which Harvey not only defines neoliberalism as, ""a theory of political economic practices that proposes that human well-being can best be advanced by liberating individual entrepreneurial freedoms and skills within an institutional framework characterized by strong private property rights, free markets, and free trade"" (p. 2), but also identifies the global adoption of neoliberalism from the 1960s forward. In The Limits to Capital, Harvey asserts that capitalism may not have a limit because of technological innovations; however, he revises this claim in The Enigma of Capital, proposing the ""3 percent compound thesis"". The thesis argues that in order for capitalism to produce acceptable returns, it must grow by three percent per annum. The compounded nature of this growth implies that raw growth is perpetually needed. Harvey contends that, ""compound growth forever is not possible and the troubles that have beset the world these last thirty years signal that the limit is looming to continuous capital accumulation that cannot be transcended except by creating fictions that cannot last"" (p. 227-228).In support of his thesis, Harvey uses a systems approach to identify seven dialectally interrelated parts of capitalism or what he terms ""activity spheres"": technologies and organizational forms, social relations, institutional and administrative arrangements, production and labor processes, relations to nature, the reproduction of daily life and the species and 'mental conceptions of the world'. These seven dimensions co-evolve in history, where capital and the accumulation of capital arises from movement within and between these spheres. Sources of crises are found in the barriers to capital movement and accumulation within and between these spheres. …","[{'authorId': '117623816', 'name': 'Cameron Whitley'}]",783.0,,0.0,The Enigma of Capital: and the Crises of Capitalism,2011.0

8d496abd8901df21983938e2c4d86cba96fd8136,"In educational scenarios involving social robots, understanding the way robot behaviors affect children’s motivation to achieve their learning goals is of vital importance. It is crucial for the formation of a trust relationship between the child and the robot so that the robot can effectively fulfill its role as a learning companion. In this study, we investigate the effect of a regulatory focus design scenario on the way children interact with a social robot. Regulatory focus theory is a type of self-regulation that involves specific strategies in pursuit of goals. It provides insights into how a person achieves a particular goal, either through a strategy focused on “promotion” that aims to achieve positive outcomes or through one focused on “prevention” that aims to avoid negative outcomes. In a user study, 69 children (7–9 years old) played a regulatory focus design goal-oriented collaborative game with the EMYS robot. We assessed children’s perception of likability and competence and their trust in the robot, as well as their willingness to follow the robot’s suggestions when pursuing a goal. Results showed that children perceived the prevention-focused robot as being more likable than the promotion-focused robot. We observed that a regulatory focus design did not directly affect trust. However, the perception of likability and competence was positively correlated with children’s trust but negatively correlated with children’s acceptance of the robot’s suggestions.","[{'authorId': '2052028871', 'name': 'Natalia Calvo-Barajas'}, {'authorId': '28908289', 'name': 'Maha Elgarf'}, {'authorId': '1556566185', 'name': 'G.

Some researchers propose that people apply the same social norms to computers as they do to humans, suggesting that social psychological knowledge can be applied to our interactions with computers. In contrast, theories of human–automation interaction postulate that humans respond to machines in unique and specific ways. We believe that anthropomorphism—the degree to which an agent exhibits human characteristics—is the critical variable that may resolve this apparent contradiction across the formation, violation, and repair stages of trust. Three experiments were designed to examine these opposing viewpoints by varying the appearance and behavior of automated agents. Participants received advice that deteriorated gradually in reliability from a computer, avatar, or human agent. Our results showed (a) that anthropomorphic agents were associated with greater trust resilience, a higher resistance to breakdowns in trust; (b) that these effects were magnified by greater uncertainty; and c) that incorporating human-like trust repair behavior largely erased differences between the agents. Automation anthropomorphism is therefore a critical variable that should be carefully incorporated into any general theory of human–agent trust as well as novel automation design.","[{'authorId': '113889522', 'name': 'E.

Drawing inspiration from established psychology literature investigating how children trust entities who teach or provide them with information (informants), we designed and conducted an experiment to examine how robot errors affect how young children (3–5 years old) trust robots. Our results suggest that children utilize their understanding of people to develop their perceptions of robots, and use this to determine how to interact with robots.

Despite its significance, the music-movement relationship is poorly understood. We present an empirical method for testing whether music and movement share a common structure that affords equivalent and universal emotional expressions. Our method uses a computer program that can generate matching examples of music and movement from a single set of features: rate, jitter (regularity of rate), direction, step size, and dissonance/visual spikiness. We applied our method in two experiments, one in the United States and another in an isolated tribal village in Cambodia. These experiments revealed three things: (i) each emotion was represented by a unique combination of features, (ii) each combination expressed the same emotion in both music and movement, and (iii) this common structure between music and movement was evident within and across cultures.","[{'authorId': '4128039', 'name': 'Beau Sievers'}, {'authorId': '2871387', 'name': 'L.

In order to extract commonality of facial expressions from different individuals, personality effect of individual needs to be minimized as much as possible. In this paper, we present a temporal-contrastive appearance network (TCAN) that utilizes the temporal feature to remove the personality effect. The high level feature is extracted from a video consisting of a sequence of frames through a proposed by convolutional neural networks (CNN). In order to let our CNN framework be able to extract similar features from adjacent frames, special loss function is introduced. Moreover, the neutral and peak expression frames are identified through comparison of distances among frames. Then, facial expressions can be classified by the so-called contrastive representation between neutral and peak expressions. We conducted our experiment in the most widely used databases (CK+ and Oulu-CASIA) for facial expression recognition.

Empathy involves not only the affective experience of the other person's actual or inferred emotional state but also some minimal recognition and understanding of another's emotional state. In light of multiple levels of analysis ranging from developmental psychology, social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and clinical neuropsychology, this article proposes a model of empathy that involves parallel and distributed processing in a number of dissociable computational mechanisms. Shared neural representations, self-awareness, mental flexibility, and emotion regulation constitute the basic macrocomponents of empathy, which are underpinned by specific neural systems. This functional model may be used to make specific predictions about the various empathy deficits that can be encountered in different forms of social and neurological disorders.","[{'authorId': '3235030', 'name': 'J.

The purpose of this paper is to critically examine the current knowledge in developmental and affective neuroscience with an emphasis on the perception of pain in others. It will be argued that human empathy involves several components: affective arousal, emotion understanding and emotion regulation, each with different developmental trajectories. These components are implemented by a complex network of distributed, often recursively connected, interacting neural regions including the superior temporal sulcus, insula, medial and orbitofrontal cortices, amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex, as well as autonomic and neuroendocrine processes implicated in social behaviors and emotional states. Decomposing the construct of empathy into subcomponents that operate in conjunction in the healthy brain and examining their developmental trajectory provides added value to our current approaches to understanding human development. It can also benefit our understanding of both typical and atypical development.","[{'authorId': '3235030', 'name': 'J. Decety'}]",502.0,,64.0,The Neurodevelopment of Empathy in Humans,2010.0

However, a causal relationship between rVLPFC function and explicit emotional regulation is not clear in the context of social exclusion. This study employed anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to activate rVLPFC while participants used emotional regulation to reappraise pictures of social exclusion. Forty-four participants were randomly assigned to an active tDCS group or a sham group. Both groups viewed social exclusion images under two conditions: in the no-reappraisal condition, participants were instructed to passively view social exclusion images; in the reappraisal condition, they reappraised the images to down-regulate negative emotional responses. Compared to sham stimulation, anodal tDCS over the rVLPFC resulted in less negative emotion ratings, and produced significantly smaller pupil diameter in the reappraisal, compared to no-reappraisal block. The tDCS also led to longer fixation durations to rejectees and shorter fixation durations to rejecters. Taken together, these findings suggest a causal role for rVLPFC in down-regulation of negative emotions produced by social exclusion. This study has implications for clinical interventions targeting emotional regulation deficits.","[{'authorId': '29344809', 'name': 'Zhenhong He'}, {'authorId': '47903824', 'name': 'Yiqin Lin'}, {'authorId': '8848142', 'name': 'Lisheng Xia'}, {'authorId': '46271416', 'name': 'Zhenli Liu'}, {'authorId': '143682725', 'name': 'Dandan Zhang'}, {'authorId': '49691586', 'name': 'R.

Data were collected in 10 different countries (N = 14,521), and results indicated that the original 17-item Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) can be shortened to 9 items (UWES-9). The factorial validity of the UWES-9 was demonstrated using confirmatory factor analyses, and the three scale scores have good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Furthermore, a two-factor model with a reduced Burnout factor (including exhaustion and cynicism) and an expanded Engagement factor (including vigor, dedication, absorption, and professional efficacy) fit best to the data. These results confirm that work engagement may be conceived as the positive antipode of burnout. It is concluded that the UWES-9 scores has acceptable psychometric properties and that the instrument can be used in studies on positive organizational behavior.","[{'authorId': '2215744', 'name': 'W.

The mother made sure you got there by 8:30 to witness the morning bath, an opportunity for playful interaction with the baby. The baby has been dressed in cozy warm clothes, her hair brushed and styled with a tiny curlicue atop her head. The mother has given her the midmorning bottle, then sung to her and played patty-cake for a few minutes before placing her in the playpen to entertain herself with a mobile while the mother attends to other things nearby. Now, about half an hour later, the baby is beginning to get fussy. The mother watches her for a minute, then offers a toy and turns away again. Soon, the baby again begins to fuss. “Seems bored and in need of attention,” you think. But the mother looks at the baby sympathetically and in a soft voice says, “Oh, are you tired?” Without further ado, she picks up the baby, carries her upstairs, tucks her into her crib, and pulls down the shades. To your surprise, the baby fusses for a few more moments and then is quiet. The mother looks serene. “She needs plenty of sleep in order to grow,” she explains. “When she doesn’t have her nap or go to bed on time, we can always tell the difference—she’s not so happy and playful.” This scenario—based on an actual observation—illustrates how parents’ cultural beliefs, or “parental ethnotheories,” are expressed in the daily lives of families. The Dutch mother we observed interpreted her child’s behavior in the context of culturally shared beliefs about the nature of infants CHAPTER FOUR","[{'authorId': '46443210', 'name': 'S.

The current study elicited two positive emotions (amusement and tenderness) and two negative emotions (anger and fear) that are similar in both valence and arousal dimensions to examine the differences in brain activities in these emotional states. Frontal electroencephalographic (EEG) asymmetry and midline power in three bands (theta, alpha and beta) were measured when participants watched affective film excerpts. Significant differences were detected between tenderness and amusement on FP1/FP2 theta asymmetry, F3/F4 theta and alpha asymmetry. Significant differences between anger and fear on FP1/FP2 theta asymmetry and F3/F4 alpha asymmetry were also observed. For midline power, midline theta power could distinguish two negative emotions, while midline alpha and beta power could effectively differentiate two positive emotions. Liking and dominance were also related to EEG features. Stepwise multiple linear regression results revealed that frontal alpha and theta asymmetry could predict the subjective feelings of two positive and two negative emotions in different patterns. The binary classification accuracy, which used EEG frontal asymmetry and midline power as features and support vector machine (SVM) as classifiers, was as high as 64.52% for tenderness and amusement and 78.79% for anger and fear. The classification accuracy was improved after adding these features to other features extracted across the scalp. These findings indicate that frontal EEG asymmetry and midline power might have the potential to recognize discrete emotions that are similar in the valence-arousal coordinate space.","[{'authorId': '2111396838', 'name': 'Guozhen Zhao'}, {'authorId': '2108093926', 'name': 'Yulin Zhang'}, {'authorId': '144566241', 'name': 'Y.

8f5603f1234d0b745e436273dcb023af9aff54e4,"What motives underlie the ways humans interact socially? Are these the same for all societies? Are these part of our nature, or influenced by our environments? Over the last decade, research in experimental economics has emphatically falsified the textbook representation of Homo economicus. Literally hundreds of experiments suggest that people care not only about their own material payoffs, but also about such things as fairness, equity and reciprocity. However, this research left fundamental questions unanswered: Are such social preferences stable components of human nature; or, are they modulated by economic, social and cultural environments? Until now, experimental research could not address this question because virtually all subjects had been university students, and while there are cultural differences among student populations throughout the world, these differences are small compared to the full range of human social and cultural environments. A vast amount of ethnographic and historical research suggests that people's motives are influenced by economic, social, and cultural environments, yet such methods can only yield circumstantial evidence about human motives. Combining ethnographic and experimental approaches to fill this gap, this book breaks new ground in reporting the results of a large cross-cultural study aimed at determining the sources of social (non-selfish) preferences that underlie the diversity of human sociality. The same experiments which provided evidence for social preferences among university students were performed in fifteen small-scale societies exhibiting a wide variety of social, economic and cultural conditions by experienced field researchers who had also done long-term ethnographic field work in these societies. The findings of these experiments demonstrated that no society in which experimental behaviour is consistent with the canonical model of self-interest. Indeed, results showed that the variation in behaviour is far greater than previously thought, and that the differences between societies in market integration and the importance of cooperation explain a substantial portion of this variation, which individual-level economic and demographic variables could not. Finally, the extent to which experimental play mirrors patterns of interaction found in everyday life is traced. The book starts with a succinct but substantive introduction to the use of game theory as an analytical tool and its use in the social sciences for the rigorous testing of hypotheses about fundamental aspects of social behaviour outside artificially constructed laboratories. The results of the fifteen case studies are summarized in a suggestive chapter about the scope of the project.

Here, energy was the psychological driving force of emotional transition in the cognitive emotional model. The input facial expression was translated into external energy by expression-emotion mapping. Robot’s next emotional state was determined by the cognitive energy (the stimulus after cognition) and its own current emotional energy’s size and source’s position. The two random quantities in emotional transition process—the emotional family and the specific emotional state in the AVS (arousal-valence-stance) 3D space—were used to simulate human emotion selection. The model had been verified by an emotional robot with 10 degrees of freedom and more than 100 kinds of facial expressions. Experimental results show that the emotional regulation model does not simply provide the typical classification and jump in terms of a set of emotional labels but that it operates in a 3D emotional space enabling a wide range of intermediary emotional states to be obtained. So the robot with cognitive emotional regulation model is more intelligent and real; moreover it can give full play to its emotional diversification in the interaction.","[{'authorId': '2120100730', 'name': 'Xin Liu'}, {'authorId': '143971861', 'name': 'Lun Xie'}, {'authorId': '2118791677', 'name': 'Anqi Liu'}, {'authorId': '152347211', 'name': 'Danjie Li'}]",5.0,"{'name': 'Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society', 'pages': '1-8', 'volume': '2015'}",28.0,Cognitive Emotional Regulation Model in Human-Robot Interaction,2015.0

Method: Eleven 5–7 year-old children participated in a CBT-group while parents participated in psychoeducation. Children were randomly assigned to an experimental or delayed-treatment control group. Results: From pre- to post-treatment, all children had less parent reported negativity/lability, better parent reported emotion regulation, and shorter outbursts, and also generated more coping strategies in response to vignettes. Parents also reported increases in their own confidence and their child's ability to deal with anger and anxiety. Conclusions: This study suggests that young children with high functioning ASD may benefit from CBT to improve regulation of anger and anxiety, and parent training may improve parental self-efficacy. Future studies are needed to make conclusions about its efficacy.","[{'authorId': '2404523', 'name': 'A. Scarpa'}, {'authorId': '8961282', 'name': 'N.

9021b7491a2669ae87ef336cd1ab8884e265c01c,"A number of neuroimaging findings have been interpreted as evidence that the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) subserves retrieval of semantic knowledge. We provide a fundamentally different interpretation, that it is not retrieval of semantic knowledge per se that is associated with left IFG activity but rather selection of information among competing alternatives from semantic memory. Selection demands were varied across three semantic tasks in a single group of subjects. Functional magnetic resonance imaging signal in overlapping regions of left IFG was dependent on selection demands in all three tasks. In addition, the degree of semantic processing was varied independently of selection demands in one of the tasks. The absence of left IFG activity for this comparison counters the argument that the effects of selection can be attributed solely to variations in degree of semantic retrieval.

This study used a dyadic multilevel modeling approach to explore the coregulation of spouses' mood states and cortisol levels in 30 married couples who sampled saliva and reported on mood states 4 times per day for 3 days. For both husbands and wives, own cortisol level was positively associated with partner's cortisol level, even after sampling time was controlled. For wives, marital satisfaction weakened the strength of this effect. Partner's negative mood was positively associated with own negative mood for both husbands and wives. Marital satisfaction fully moderated this effect, reducing the strength of the association between one's own and one's partner's negative mood states. Spouses' positive moods were not correlated. As expected, within-couple coregulation coefficients were stronger when mood and cortisol were sampled in the early morning and evening, when spouses were together at home, than during the workday. The results suggest that spouses' fluctuations in negative mood and cortisol levels are linked over several days and that marital satisfaction may buffer spouses from their partners' negative mood or stress state.","[{'authorId': '6283440', 'name': 'D.

 BACKGROUND
 Emotion regulation is a key transdiagnostic risk factor for a range of psychopathologies, making it a prime target for both prevention and treatment interventions in childhood. Existing interventions predominantly rely on workshop or in-person therapy-based approaches, limiting the ability to promote emotion regulation competence for children in everyday settings and at scale. Purrble is a newly developed, inexpensive socially assistive robot—in the form of an interactive plush toy—which uses haptic feedback to support in-the-moment emotion regulation. It is accessible to children as needed in their daily lives, without the requirement for a priori training. While qualitative data from prior studies show high engagement in-situ and anecdotal evidence of the robot being incorporated into children’s emotion regulation routines, there is so far no quantitative evidence of the intervention’s impact on child outcomes.
 
 
 OBJECTIVE
 The aim of this study is to examine, for the first time, the efficacy of a new intervention model for child-led emotion regulation—Purrble—that could be deployed across prevention and treatment contexts.
 
 
 METHODS
 A total of 120 children aged 8-10 will be selected from an `enriched’ non-clinical US population: for inclusion, the cutoff for parent’s rating of child dysregulation will be 10 points or higher on the total difficulties score on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. This cutoff selects for a measurable—but not necessarily clinical—level of the child’s emotion regulatory difficulties. The selected families will be randomly assigned with .5 probability to receive either Purrble or an active control (non-interactive plush toy). The primary outcome will be a daily EMA measure of child emotion regulation capability (as reported by parents) over a period of 4 weeks. Exploratory analyses will investigate the intervention impact on secondary outcomes of child emotion regulation, collected weekly over the same 4 week period, with follow-ups at 1 month and 6 months post-deployment. Quantitative data will be analysed on an intent-to-treat basis. A proportion of families (~30% of the sample) will be interviewed post deployment as part of process analysis.
 
 
 RESULTS
 The study is funded by UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship (MR/T041897/1) and an in-kind contribution from Committee for Children. It received ethical approval from the Pearl IRB (#18-CFC-101). Participant recruitment will start in February 2021, with the 1 month deployment expected in April - May 2021. The results of the analysis will be published in 2021.
 
 
 CONCLUSIONS
 The study will be the first quantitative evaluation of the efficacy of an innovative, proof-of-concept intervention model for an in-situ, child-led emotion regulation intervention. The insights into the trajectory of daily changes, complemented with weekly questionnaire batteries and post-deployment interviews will result in an in-depth understanding of whether, and how the hypothesised intervention logic model works, leading to further intervention optimisation.

However, a child-focused definition of school readiness is limited because it neither identifies processes that lead children to acquire these competencies, nor does it recognize children's dependence on opportunities within settings that support development of these competencies. The model of school readiness presented in this article broadly defines school readiness as a function of an organized system of interactions and transactions among people (children, teachers, parents, and other caregivers), settings (home, school, and child care), and institutions (communities, neighborhoods, and governments). We propose that the primary mechanisms through which children acquire readiness-related competencies are social relationships children form with peers, parents, and teachers. This perspective on school readiness, emphasizing the mediating role of relational processes, offers guidance for designing interventions to improve school readiness through strengthening relationships between parents and children, parents and teachers, and teachers and children.","[{'authorId': '5313007', 'name': 'Andrew J.

The aim of this study was to investigate the interrelationships between childhood trauma, attachment, alexithymia, and the severity of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in a cohort of participants with OCD.


RATIONALE
There is a growing body of research linking traumatic experiences in childhood with the development of OCD. The mechanisms involved in this association are not yet clear.


METHODS
The sample was comprised of 82 people with OCD and 92 comparison participants. A cross-sectional design was used, utilizing internet-mediated administration of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire - revised (CTQ-R); the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale - Self-Report (Y-BOCS-SR); the Experiences in Close Relationships Scale (ECR); and Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). Partial least squares (PLS) analysis was used to determine significant paths between the constructs.


RESULTS
Results of PLS analysis supported all of the hypotheses made: there was a significant positive correlation between childhood trauma and attachment avoidance, which in turn was significantly positively associated with alexithymia. Alexithymia was significantly associated with the severity of OCD symptoms and the number of OCD symptoms. Mediational analysis showed that alexithymia significantly carried an influence from attachment avoidance to the severity of obsessions and the number of obsession symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
There is a relationship between childhood trauma and OCD, however this relationship is not direct in nature but is influenced by peoples' past experiences with significant others and associated difficulties in emotional processing.","[{'authorId': '152396677', 'name': 'Lea Carpenter'}, {'authorId': '51308128', 'name': 'M.

Children who interacted with the robot showed greater increases in positive mood than children in either of the two control conditions, but did not differ from control participants in terms of negative mood, anxiety, or arousal. SARs may convey benefits for children’s mental health by augmenting positive mood.

Recent studies demonstrate that a bias in the attentional processing of negative information may be an important cognitive vulnerability factor underlying the onset and maintenance of depression. However, to date, the nature of this attentional bias is still poorly understood and further exploration of this topic to advance current knowledge of attentional biases in depression seems imperative. Method. This study examined attentional biases for angry facial expressions presented for 1000 ms in 20 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 20 non-depressed control participants (NC) matched for age and gender using an emotional modification of the Exogenous Cueing task. Results. Patients with MDD showed maintained attention for angry faces compared with neutral faces. In comparison with non-depressed participants they showed a stronger attentional engagement for angry faces. In contrast, the NC group directed attention away from angry faces, more rapidly disengaging their attention compared with neutral faces. Conclusions. This pattern of results supports the assumption that MDD is characterized by deficits in the attentional processing of negative, interpersonal information and suggests a ‘protective’ bias in non-depressed individuals. Implications in relation to previous research exploring cognitive and interpersonal functioning in depression are discussed.","[{'authorId': '5003354', 'name': 'L.

This study investigated interoceptive awareness in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), a chronic pain condition accompanied by various affective symptoms. Interoceptive awareness was assessed in 45 FMS patients and 31 healthy individuals using a heartbeat perception task. Cognitive performance, comorbid psychiatric disorders and medication use were assessed as possible confounding variables. Concerning the primary outcome, patients exhibited markedly reduced heartbeat perception compared to healthy individuals. Moreover, there was an inverse relationship between interoceptive awareness and FMS symptom severity. Reduced interoceptive awareness may be involved in the affective aspects of FMS pathology. Poor access to bodily signals may restrict patients´ ability to integrate these signals during emotional processing, which, by extension, may preclude optimal emotional self-regulation.","[{'authorId': '5108557', 'name': 'S.

Next we review evidence that a technique traditionally associated with regulating behavioural goals (forming implementation intentions or “if-then” planning) can help to overcome these difficulties. Meta-analysis indicated that forming implementation intentions is effective in modifying emotional outcomes, with a large effect relative to no regulation instructions (k = 21, N = 1306 d + = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.61 to 1.20) and a medium-sized effect relative to goal intention instructions (k = 29, N = 1208, d + = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.42 to 0.65).

9263e2f0419aab0b6c5a376d0d576fd98f3415da,"Psychiatric comorbidity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a subject of critical scientific importance, affecting the quality of life, prognosis, and functional outcomes. The prevalence of psychiatric disorders vary considerably according to variables such as index subject characteristics, study setting, sampling frame, diagnostic methods used, as well as country of geographic origin. To date, most studies comprise clinical or treatment referral samples in tertiary care or subjects enrolled in clinical trials and genetic cohort collections. Such samples carry the potential for overestimation of both the frequency and severity of psychiatric comorbidity. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed and Web of Science databases restricted to population-based study publications in the English between May 1, 2015, and May 31, 2020. A comprehensive keyword list was generated to investigate co-occurrence of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents with ASD. A wide range of DSM-5 based disorders such as anxiety, mood, ADHD, intellectual disability/intellectual developmental disorder, eating/feeding, gender dysphoria and sleep-wake disorders were assessed. Initial search revealed a total of 1674 articles after removal of duplicates. Two independent researchers conducted a parallel-blinded screening process to identify the eligible studies based on titles and abstracts; 39 studies were analyzed in the current review. The main findings show prevalence estimates of 22.9% (95% CI: 17.7- 29.2) for intellectual disability; 26.2% (22-31) for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; 11.1% (8.6-14.1) for anxiety disorders; 19.7% (11.9-30.7) for sleep disorders; 7% (5.2- 9.3) for disruptive disorders; 2% (1.3- 3.1) for bipolar disorders; 2.7% (1.8- 4.2) for depression; 1.8% (0.4–8.7) for obsessive-compulsive disorder; and 0.6% (0.3–1.1) for psychosis. Psychiatric comorbidity in population-based studies is lower than in clinical and referred samples. However, our results also indicate that the frequency of psychiatric comorbidity in children and adolescents with ASD in the population context is considerable, without the influence of referral bias implicit in clinical and treatment samples. There is a need for better targeted diagnostic tools to detect psychiatric comorbidity in children and youth in future population-based studies, as an essential component in providing care as well as new insights into the nature and mechanisms of its underlying associations.

Our work aims to improve the performance of such a human-robot team: the robot tries to guide the human towards an effective strategy, sometimes against the human's own preference, while still retaining his trust. We achieve this through a principled human-robot mutual adaptation formalism. We integrate a bounded-memory adaptation model of the human into a partially observable stochastic decision model, which enables the robot to adapt to an adaptable human. When the human is adaptable, the robot guides the human towards a good strategy, maybe unknown to the human in advance. When the human is stubborn and not adaptable, the robot complies with the human's preference in order to retain their trust. In the shared autonomy setting, unlike many other common human-robot collaboration settings, only the robot actions can change the physical state of the world, and the human and robot goals are not fully observable. We address these challenges and show in a human subject experiment that the proposed mutual adaptation formalism improves human-robot team performance, while retaining a high level of user trust in the robot, compared to the common approach of having the robot strictly following participants' preference.","[{'authorId': '37586303', 'name': 'S.

The control structures under study cover nested, chained, hierarchical, delayed interaction and communications, and symmetric systems. Such structures are strongly related to several modern-day and future applications including integrated flight propulsion systems, platoons of vehicles, micro-electro-mechanical systems, networked control, control of networks, production lines and chemical processes. It is shown that the system classes presented have the common feature that all stabilizing controllers can be characterized by convex constraints on the Youla-Kucera parameter. Using this feature, a solution to a general optimal performance problem that incorporates time domain and frequency domain constraints is obtained. A synthesis procedure is provided which at every step yields a feasible controller together with a measure of its performance with respect to the optimal. Convergence to the optimal performance is established. An example of a multinode network congestion control problem is provided that illustrates the effectiveness of the developed methodology.","[{'authorId': '9288428', 'name': 'Xingguang Qi'}, {'authorId': '1713627', 'name': 'M.

This brain region may also influence the experience of social pain, which has been shown to activate similar neural networks as seen in response to physical pain. Here, we applied sham or active low-frequency (1 Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the left DLPFC, previously shown to exert bilateral effects in pain perception, in healthy participants. Following stimulation, participants played the “Cyberball Task”; an online ball-tossing game in which the subject participant is included or excluded. Compared to sham, rTMS did not modulate behavioural response to social exclusion. However, within the active rTMS group only, greater trait personal distress was related to enhanced negative outcomes to social exclusion. These results add further support to the notion that the effect of brain stimulation is not homogenous across individuals, and indicates the need to consider baseline individual differences when assessing response to brain stimulation. This seems particularly relevant in social neuroscience investigations, where trait factors may have a meaningful effect.","[{'authorId': '1805764', 'name': 'B.

93d571d0fe84f4befbfff4bdeaab3a13982f0bee,"We propose that depression can be viewed as an adaptation to conserve energy after the perceived loss of an investment in a vital resource such as a relationship, group identity, or personal asset. Tendencies to process information negatively and experience strong biological reactions to stress (resulting from genes, trauma, or both) can lead to depressogenic beliefs about the self, world, and future. These tendencies are mediated by alterations in brain areas/networks involved in cognition and emotion regulation. Depressogenic beliefs predispose individuals to make cognitive appraisals that amplify perceptions of loss, typically in response to stressors that impact available resources. Clinical features of severe depression (e.g., anhedonia, anergia) result from these appraisals and biological reactions that they trigger (e.g., autonomic, immune, neurochemical). These symptoms were presumably adaptive in our evolutionary history, but are maladaptive in contemporary times. Thus, severe depression can be considered an anachronistic manifestation of an evolutionarily based “program.”","[{'authorId': '145373715', 'name': 'A. Beck'}, {'authorId': '6734729', 'name': 'K.

In Study 1, preschoolers waited or worked for desired delayed rewards. Delay times increased when children worked in the presence of rewards but, as predicted, this increase was due to the distraction provided by the work itself. not because attention to rewards motivated children to sustain work. Analysis of spontaneous attention deployment showed that attending to rewards reduces delay time regardless of the working or waiting nature of the task. Fixing attention on rewards was a particularly detrimental strategy regardless of the type of task. Study 2 showed that when the work is not engaging, however, attention to rewards can motivate instrumental work and facilitate delay of gratification as long as attention deployment does not become fixed on the rewards.","[{'authorId': '32661128', 'name': 'P.

To this end, a wide range of punishing behaviours may first be employed but if these are not successful, the individual may be permanently excluded. Therefore a person may be the subject of ostracism even if not excluded from the group: Where the punishing behaviours of the group persuade an individual to change their behaviour, the process will have served its function and will cease. The possibility that some bullying at school may be the result of this process emerged during the qualitative analysis of retrospective accounts from adults who are deaf. This resulted in a review of the relevant literature and a set of codes which were employed to reanalyse the data. The findings suggest that some bullying in groups can indeed be understood as ostracism.","[{'authorId': '48883866', 'name': 'R. Dixon'}]",1051.0,,21.0,Ostracism,2007.0

It is a beauty of things unconventional. The immediate catalyst for this book was a widely publicized tea event in Japan. The Japanese aesthetic of wabi-sabi has long been associated with the tea ceremony, and this event promised to be a profound wabi-sabi experience. Hiroshi Teshigahara, the hereditary iemoto (grand master) of the Sogetsu school of flower arranging, had commissioned three of Japan's most famous and fashionable architects to design and build their conceptions of ceremonial tea-drinking environments. Teshigahara in addition would provide a fourth design. After a three-plus-hour train and bus ride from my office in Tokyo, I arrived at the event site, the grounds of an old imperial summer residence. To my dismay I found a celebration of gorgeousness, grandeur, and elegant play, but hardly a trace of wabi-sabi. One slick tea hut, ostensibly made of paper, looked and smelled like a big white plastic umbrella. Adjacent was a structure made of glass, steel, and wood that had all the intimacy of a highrise office building. The one tea house that approached the wabi-sabi qualities I had anticipated, upon closer inspection, was fussed up with gratuitous post- modern appendages. It suddenly dawned on me that wabi-sabi, once the preeminent high-culture Japanese aesthetic and the acknowledged centerpiece of tea, was becoming-had become?-an endangered species. Admittedly, the beauty of wabi-sabi is not to everyone's liking. But I believe it is in everyone's interest to prevent wabi-sabi from disappearing altogether. Diversity of the cultural ecology is a desirable state of affairs, especially in opposition to the accelerating trend toward the uniform digitalization of all sensory experience, wherein an electronic ""reader"" stands between experience and observation, and all manifestation is encoded identically. In Japan, however, unlike Europe and to a lesser extent America, precious little material culture has been saved.

The results of this study show that participants' preferences change over time as the participants habituate to the robot. This trend was significant in terms of the robot's appearance and approach direction.

94bd64ef67ea4fd605b937baa4df803f5604a3b7,"Abstract Background: Children with cerebral palsy have difficulty to sit, stand, walk, run and jump independently. Therapy is an important factor in improving these aspects, and if applied in early intervention treatments, when the child is growing, it could have many benefits. These therapies require intensive and extended sessions, which in turn demand dedication and effort. New strategies that provide interesting and motivating interventions are often incorporated to improve the participation and performance of the children in the therapies. Therapies using social assistive robots can be alternative and complementary methods to promote the participation and motivation of children with cerebral palsy. Methods: The objective of this work is to validate the effectiveness of a 16-session physical therapy program to improve the participation and fulfillment of therapeutic objectives on an 8 year-old boy with dyskinetic cerebral palsy for motor learning to walk using a social assistive robot. The therapy program was carried out through a methodological proposal that uses SMART objectives (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Timed), Goal-Directed Therapy (GDT) and its evaluation through Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS). Results: A NAO robot was used as a social assistive robot to support a physical therapy for a child with cerebral palsy. In this work, it was observed that the motivation generated by the interaction with the social assistive robot facilitated the persistence in the walking and the fulfillment of the objectives. Conclusion: Using humanoid robots as social assistive robots may benefit therapeutic processes on children with motor disabilities. The methodology developed provides a formal way to achieve objectives in therapeutic processes for children with cerebral palsy. Implications for rehabilitation It requires researchers to conduct more studies to validate the potential of the use of social robots in therapeutic interventions that promote development in children with motor disabilities, such as cerebral palsy. Promoting the use of new technologies in therapeutic processes such as humanoid robots allows us to create new strategies to know the impact of this technology in the area of rehabilitation. The use of formal methodologies focused on the patient, along with multidisciplinary teams, could increase the possibilities of using social robots to improve cognitive and motor outcomes in children with cerebral palsy. The formulation of SMART objectives and their quantification through the GAS scale can be used as recommendations to improve the formulation of goals in therapeutic interventions for children with cerebral palsy.","[{'authorId': '2156911', 'name': 'J.

95023ce0f8205ea7c5a73181222069c9ef4b73bf,"ABSTRACT Social work practitioners increasingly use mindfulness techniques, and research into the impact of this practice is being explored by multiple related disciplines, such as psychology and education. Cultivating the potential benefits of mindfulness at multiple practice levels necessitates curricular integration of mindfulness training. This article reports on the evaluation of a 14-week mindfulness-based pedagogical model implemented in two sections of social work field seminars. Using a pretest and posttest survey design that included an existing five-dimension mindfulness scale, students exhibited significant change in three facets of mindfulness: observing, nonjudgment of inner experience, and nonreactivity to inner experience. Implications for social work education and directions for future research are explored.","[{'authorId': '2108599166', 'name': 'Jacquelyn J. Lee'}, {'authorId': '51896861', 'name': 'S.

Further, we argue that service organizations need a particular blend of explicitness of display rules and role discretion for the purpose of optimizing sales performance. As hypothesized, findings from 2 samples of salespeople suggest that either high or low explicitness of display rules impedes service delivery behaviors and sales performance, which peaks at moderate explicitness of display rules and high role discretion.

This study utilized an ecologically valid paradigm to test the hypothesis that adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) would show altered reactivity to peer rejection and acceptance relative to healthy controls in a network of ventral brain regions implicated in affective processing of social information. A total of 48 adolescents (ages 11-17), including 21 with a current diagnosis of MDD and 27 age- and gender-matched controls, received rigged acceptance and rejection feedback from fictitious peers during a simulated online peer interaction during functional neuroimaging. MDD youth showed increased activation to rejection relative to controls in the bilateral amygdala, subgenual anterior cingulate, left anterior insula and left nucleus accumbens. MDD and healthy youth did not differ in response to acceptance. Youth more advanced in pubertal maturation also showed increased reactivity to rejection in the bilateral amygdala/parahippocampal gyrus and the caudate/subgenual anterior cingulate, and these effects remained significant when controlling for chronological age. Findings suggest that increased reactivity to peer rejection is a normative developmental process associated with pubertal development, but is particularly enhanced among youth with depression.","[{'authorId': '3234399', 'name': 'J.

To clarify this, we analyzed remote handshaking in which a robot hand that was attached just under a videoconferencing terminal's display moved according to the opening and closing motion of a conversation partner's hand. Combining touch and video channels raises a question as to whether the partner's action of touching a haptic device should be visible to the user. If it can be invisible, the action may be unnecessary, and a unilaterally controlled device may be enough to establish an effective touch channel. Our analysis revealed that the feeling of being close to the partner can be enhanced by mutual touch in which the partner's action needs to occur but should be invisible.","[{'authorId': '2268916', 'name': 'Hideyuki Nakanishi'}, {'authorId': '2109387734', 'name': 'Kazuaki Tanaka'}, {'authorId': '2057979035', 'name': 'Yuya Wada'}]",110.0,,37.0,Remote handshaking: touch enhances video-mediated social telepresence,2014.0

Negative emotions and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies play a role in the onset and maintenance of binge eating in BED. Anger and sadness, along with negative emotions related to interpersonal experiences (i.e., disappointment, being hurt or loneliness), seem to be particularly relevant. Individuals with BED have a tendency to suppress and ruminate on their unwanted emotions, which leads to increased psychopathological thoughts and symptoms. Compared to healthy controls, they use adaptive strategies, such as reappraisal, less frequently. Evidence concerning the causal relation between negative affect and binge eating is inconclusive and still very limited. While experimental studies in a laboratory setting lack ecological validity, ecological momentary assessment studies offer more promise at unraveling the causal relationship between emotions and binge eating. Increases in negative affect are found to be antecedents of binge eating in BED. However, there seems to be less support for the possibility that binge eating serves as a means to alleviate negative affect. Finally, BED seems to be related to other forms of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, such as substance abuse and self-harm.","[{'authorId': '3662212', 'name': 'A.

One way to accomplish these aims is to anthropomorphize a product's appearance. The current research investigates how people decode emotional “facial” expressions from product shapes and how this affects liking of the design, using three studies in the domain of cars and one in the domain of cellular phones. In accordance with theories on the perception of human faces, the first study shows that perception of friendliness is limited to the grille (mouth), while aggressiveness can be communicated with both grille and headlights (eyes). The next study examines the best-liked combination of these two emotional expressions and finds that consumers prefer the combination of an upturned (friendly) grille with slanted (aggressive) headlights. The authors further explain this finding on a process level by showing that this combination triggers a positive affective state of both high pleasure and arousal. The third study validates the results with automobile sales data, and a fourth study extends the findings to another product category.","[{'authorId': '2179772', 'name': 'Jan R.

The review is organized by emotion domain, including emotion understanding, affective experiences, physiological indicators of arousal and emotion, and processes for the regulation of emotion. We included studies which presented data for children and adolescents ages 6-18, and included measures of emotion and parent-child attachment. Although some areas have been investigated more than others, we found that secure attachment was related to more adaptive functioning in each of the emotion domains. Finally, we review future directions to be explored and address gaps in the current literature.","[{'authorId': '2104648795', 'name': 'Kaela Stuart Parrigon'}, {'authorId': '1917881', 'name': 'Kathryn A.

The evolution of the mood after the MIP was monitored for a period of 8 min with the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM; every 2 min) and with recordings of skin conductance level (SCL) and electrocardiography (ECG). The SAM pleasure ratings showed that short and longer film fragments were effective in inducing a longer lasting negative mood, whereas the negative mood induced by the IAPS slideshow was short lived. The induced arousal during the anxious MIPs diminished quickly after the mood induction; nevertheless, the SCL data suggest longer lasting arousal effects for both movies. The decay of the induced mood follows a logarithmic function; diminishing quickly in the first minutes, thereafter returning slowly back to baseline. These results reveal that caution is needed when investigating the effects of the induced mood on a task or the effect of interventions on induced moods, because the induced mood diminishes quickly after the mood induction.","[{'authorId': '2873035', 'name': 'A.

Although cognitive processes are at the center in developing new ideas, they are rarely taken into account in research and development of design support methods and systems. It is conceivable that if one understands how cognitive processes are stimulated to generate design ideas, then more effective methods and tools can be developed to support conceptual design. In this article, a cognitive model of conceptual design is developed to capture the relationships among design entities, design operations, and cognitive processes. A protocol analysis is performed to evaluate the model, and a cognitive experiment carried out to study the creative patterns and stimulating relationships. The results show that designers exhibit patterns of creative design behavior, and that these patterns can be captured and instilled into the design process to promote creativity.","[{'authorId': '117216412', 'name': 'Yan Jin'}, {'authorId': '2098604298', 'name': 'Oren Benami'}]",66.0,,75.0,Creative patterns and stimulation in conceptual design,2010.0

Conclusions: (1) The empirical research on the instructional effectiveness of games is fragmented, filled with ill defined terms, and plagued with methodological flaws. (2) Some games provide effective instruction for some tasks some of the time, but these results may not be generalizable to other games or instructional programs. (3) No evidence indicates that games are the preferred instructional method in all situations. (4) Instructional games are more effective if they are embedded in instructional programs that include debriefing and feedback. (5) Instructional support during play increases the effectiveness of instructional games. Recommendations: (1) The decision to use a game for instruction should be based on a detailed analysis of learning requirements and tradeoffs among alternate instructional approaches. (2) Program managers and procurement officials should insist that instructional game developers demonstrate how their game will support instructional objectives. (3) Games should be used as adjuncts and aids, not as stand-alone instruction.

962a3ae2c2baa04b0bc428934e3d772fdcfcded9,"Social robots have the potential to provide support in a number of practical domains, such as learning and behaviour change. This potential is particularly relevant for children, who have proven receptive to interactions with social robots. To reach learning and therapeutic goals, a number of issues need to be investigated, notably the design of an effective child-robot interaction (cHRI) to ensure the child remains engaged in the relationship and that educational goals are met. Typically, current cHRI research experiments focus on a single type of interaction activity (e.g. a game). However, these can suffer from a lack of adaptation to the child, or from an increasingly repetitive nature of the activity and interaction. In this paper, we motivate and propose a practicable solution to this issue: an adaptive robot able to switch between multiple activities within single interactions. We describe a system that embodies this idea, and present a case study in which diabetic children collaboratively learn with the robot about various aspects of managing their condition. We demonstrate the ability of our system to induce a varied interaction and show the potential of this approach both as an educational tool and as a research method for long-term cHRI.","[{'authorId': '3061255', 'name': 'Alexandre Coninx'}, {'authorId': '143997370', 'name': 'Paul E.

This paper seeks to provide insight into increasing the autonomy level of social robots in therapy to move beyond WoZ. With the final aim of improved human-human social interaction for the children, this multidisciplinary research seeks to facilitate the use of social robots as tools in clinical situations by addressing the challenge of increasing robot autonomy.We introduce the clinical framework in which the developments are tested, alongside initial data obtained from patients in a first phase of the project using a WoZ set-up mimicking the targeted supervised-autonomy behaviour.

969671cc6826e975ab2872cdd9cc55f9b4f4e883,"ABSTRACT Objectives: To interrogate the concept of personhood and its application to care practices for people with dementia. Method: We outline the work of Tom Kitwood on personhood and relate this to conceptualisations of personhood in metaphysics and in moral philosophy. Results: The philosophical concept of personhood has a long history. The metaphysical tradition examines the necessary and sufficient qualities that make up personhood such as agency, consciousness, identity, rationality and second-order reflexivity. Alternative viewpoints treat personhood as a matter of degree rather than as a superordinate category. Within moral philosophy personhood is treated as a moral status applicable to some or to all human beings. Conclusion: In the light of the multiple meanings attached to the term in both metaphysics and moral philosophy, personhood is a relatively unhelpful concept to act as the foundation for developing models and standards of care for people with dementia. Care, we suggest, should concentrate less on ambiguous and somewhat abstract terms such as personhood and focus instead on supporting people's existing capabilities, while minimising the harmful consequences of their incapacities.","[{'authorId': '49239507', 'name': 'P.

Emotion dysregulation partially mediated this relationship, driven by its behavioral component, impulsivity. Gender and ethnicity effects were examined. Findings point to the need for increased attention to adult outcomes of emotional abuse and increased clinical awareness of emotion regulation as a key developmental mechanism of adaptation in adulthood.","[{'authorId': '6387646', 'name': 'Sara R.

Ryan Companionbot prototyped in this project, is a rear-projected life-like conversational robot. Ryan is equipped with features that can (1) interpret and respond to users' emotions through facial expressions and spoken language, (2) proactively engage in conversations with users, and (3) remind them about their daily life schedules (e.g. taking their medicine on time). Ryan engages users in cognitive games and reminiscence activities. We conducted a pilot study with six elderly individuals with moderate dementia and/or depression living in a senior living facility in Denver. Each individual had 24/7 access to a Ryan in his/her room for a period of 4–6 weeks. Our observations of these individuals, interviews with them and their caregivers, and analyses of their interactions during this period revealed that they established rapport with the robot and greatly valued and enjoyed having a Companionbot in their room.","[{'authorId': '3407846', 'name': 'Hojjat Abdollahi'}, {'authorId': '2314025', 'name': 'A.

We then go beyond this largely pedagogical function and delineate the conceptual and strategic implications of making use of such distinctions with regard to a wide range of phenomena, including control and stress, attitudes, and personality traits. We also provide a specific compendium of analytic procedures appropriate for making the most effective use of the moderator and mediator distinction, both separately and in terms of a broader causal system that includes both moderators and mediators.","[{'authorId': '114028501', 'name': 'R.

Purpose: This study investigated the effects of an internet-based self-efficacy intervention (the experimental condition), compared to an education (the active control condition) on STS and SPTG among workers exposed to traumatic events indirectly, through their clients. We hypothesized that the group assignment (experimental vs. control) would affect STS and SPTG indirectly, with a mediating role of self-efficacy beliefs. Methods: Participants were 168 health and human services professionals (78% women), exposed indirectly to a traumatic event at work. They were randomly assigned to either a 4-session internet-based self-efficacy intervention (n = 87) or an education control group (n = 81) which received information about coping resources and consequences of stressors at work or at home. STS, SPTG, and self-efficacy were measured at the baseline (Time 1), 1-month follow-up (Time 2) and 2-month follow-up (Time 3). Results: Analysis of covariance showed that the group assignment had a significant effect on STS (Time 2) and self-efficacy (Time 2), with lower STS and higher self-efficacy reported by the self-efficacy intervention participants. Compared to the experimental group, the active control (education) group participants reported higher SPTG at Time 2. Mediation analyses indicated that the group assignment had indirect effects on STS and SPTG at Time 3. Workers who experienced increases in self-efficacy (Time 2) through the intervention were more likely to report lower STS and higher SPTG at Time 3. Conclusion: Elucidating the mediating processes that explain why an intervention for secondary trauma works is essential in order to develop more effective support systems that promote improved mental health outcomes among health and human services professionals. Prevention programs for workers exposed indirectly to traumatic events may target self-efficacy enhancement and education.","[{'authorId': '6291588', 'name': 'R.

976c5206ff3f9f7ac5ddc1a55d62b7e2e7510328,"Obesity is a chronic metabolic disease characterised by an increase of body fat stores. It is a gateway to ill health, and it has become one of the leading causes of disability and death, affecting not only adults but also children and adolescents worldwide. In clinical practice, the body fatness is estimated by BMI, and the accumulation of intra-abdominal fat (marker for higher metabolic and cardiovascular disease risk) can be assessed by waist circumference. Complex interactions between biological, behavioural, social and environmental factors are involved in regulation of energy balance and fat stores. A comprehensive history, physical examination and laboratory assessment relevant to the patient's obesity should be obtained. Appropriate goals of weight management emphasise realistic weight loss to achieve a reduction in health risks and should include promotion of weight loss, maintenance and prevention of weight regain. Management of co-morbidities and improving quality of life of obese patients are also included in treatment aims. Balanced hypocaloric diets result in clinically meaningful weight loss regardless of which macronutrients they emphasise. Aerobic training is the optimal mode of exercise for reducing fat mass while a programme including resistance training is needed for increasing lean mass in middle-aged and overweight/obese individuals. Cognitive behavioural therapy directly addresses behaviours that require change for successful weight loss and weight loss maintenance. Pharmacotherapy can help patients to maintain compliance and ameliorate obesity-related health risks. Surgery is the most effective treatment for morbid obesity in terms of long-term weight loss. A comprehensive obesity management can only be accomplished by a multidisciplinary obesity management team. We conclude that physicians have a responsibility to recognise obesity as a disease and help obese patients with appropriate prevention and treatment. Treatment should be based on good clinical care, and evidence-based interventions; should focus on realistic goals and lifelong multidisciplinary management.","[{'authorId': '9947728', 'name': 'V.

As such, increasing children's skills early on could improve their success in middle and high school. To this end, we propose that a robotic learning companion could supplement children's early language education. The robot targets both the social nature of language learning and the adaptation necessary to help individual children. The robot is designed as a social character that interacts with children as a peer, not as a tutor or teacher. It will play a storytelling game, during which it will introduce new vocabulary words, and model good story narration skills, such as including a beginning, middle, and end; varying sentence structure; and keeping cohesion across the story. We will evaluate whether adapting the robot's level of language to the child's - so that, as children improve their storytelling skills, so does the robot - influences (i) whether children learn new words from the robot, (ii) the complexity and style of stories children tell, (iii) the similarity of children's stories to the robot's stories. We expect children will learn more from a robot that adapts to maintain an equal or greater ability than the children, and that they will copy its stories and narration style more than they would with a robot that does not adapt (a robot of lesser ability). However, we also expect that playing with a robot of lesser ability could prompt teaching or mentoring behavior from children, which could also be beneficial to language learning.","[{'authorId': '2716110', 'name': 'J.

The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), specifically the dorsal ACC, has been targeted as a key substrate in the physical and social pain matrix and was hypothesized to regulate activation response to various facial conditions. We show that participants demonstrated greatest ACC activation when being excluded by self-resembling and same-race faces, relative to other-race faces. Additionally, participants expressed greater distress and showed increased ACC activation as a result of exclusion in the same-race condition relative to the other-race condition. A positive correlation between implicit racial bias and activation in the amygdala was also evident. Implicit attitude about other-race faces partly explains levels of concern about exclusion by out-group individuals. These findings suggest that individuals are more distressed and their brain (i.e. neural alarm system) responds with greater activation when being excluded by individuals whom they are more likely to share group membership with.","[{'authorId': '39272772', 'name': 'Austen L.

Medicine has learned much from professions that have established programs in simulation for training, such as aviation, the military and space exploration. Increased demands on training hours, limited patient encounters, and a focus on patient safety have led to a new paradigm of education in healthcare that increasingly involves technology and innovative ways to provide a standardized curriculum. A robust body of literature is growing, seeking to answer the question of how best to use simulation in healthcare education. Building on the groundwork of the Best Evidence in Medical Education (BEME) Guide on the features of simulators that lead to effective learning, this current Guide provides practical guidance to aid educators in effectively using simulation for training. It is a selective review to describe best practices and illustrative case studies. This Guide is the second part of a two-part AMEE Guide on simulation in healthcare education. The first Guide focuses on building a simulation program, and discusses more operational topics such as types of simulators, simulation center structure and set-up, fidelity management, and scenario engineering, as well as faculty preparation. This Guide will focus on the educational principles that lead to effective learning, and include topics such as feedback and debriefing, deliberate practice, and curriculum integration – all central to simulation efficacy. The important subjects of mastery learning, range of difficulty, capturing clinical variation, and individualized learning are also examined. Finally, we discuss approaches to team training and suggest future directions. Each section follows a framework of background and definition, its importance to effective use of simulation, practical points with examples, and challenges generally encountered. Simulation-based healthcare education has great potential for use throughout the healthcare education continuum, from undergraduate to continuing education. It can also be used to train a variety of healthcare providers in different disciplines from novices to experts. This Guide aims to equip healthcare educators with the tools to use this learning modality to its full capability.","[{'authorId': '4666150', 'name': 'Ivette Motola'}, {'authorId': '35055310', 'name': 'L.

97d8fc37601ebaf42695463e8fb221ed51a60389,"Translator’s preface In his famous essay on the uncanny, first published in 1919, Sigmund Freud begins by complaining that aesthetics has hitherto not paid much attention to the aberrant and the repulsive. This complaint is also an expression of anticipatory pleasure on the part of Freud the writer, in so far as the uncanny in particular has no “literature” with which to contend – but he has to admit that there is one exception, namely the essay translated below (“The ‘Uncanny’” 219). Jentsch emphasises that the uncanny arises from a certain experience of the uncertain or undecidable, and this seems intolerable to Freud. Freud decides, in other words, that the undecidable cannot be tolerated as a theoretical explanation, but it nonetheless recurs in his own essay, undecidably (see 221 and 230-31). He also pays close attention to Jentsch’s argument about the uncanniness of automata (226-27 and 233). Dr. Ernst Jentsch was born in 1867. The diversity of his cultural and psychological interests can be seen in his published works. His study of mood (1902) includes a sympathetic account of affect in the Studien uber Hysterie of Freud and Breuer (Die Laune 49-51); in his two-part Musik und Nerven (1904 and 1911), 5 he notes how uncanny effects are readily produced in music (2: 5657); and, amongst other works, he produced German translations of Havelock Ellis and Cesare Lombroso. Reference has often been made to Jentsch’s essay on the uncanny, in the vast secondary literature of psychoanalysis after Freud, as if its content were already known, familiar and thus not requiring to be read. The essay had never before been translated into English; inasmuch as it now appears both familiar and unfamiliar, its reappearance here can be called ‘uncanny.’ This translation first appeared in Angelaki 2.1 (1995), and I remain deeply grateful to Sarah Wood, the issue editor and one of the founders of the journal. For their advice, I would also like to thank Peter Krapp, Robert White, and especially Forbes Morlock – whose “Doubly Uncanny,” which immediately followed my translation on its first publication, remains a good starting point for further research.","[{'authorId': '2082907982', 'name': 'E.

In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of studies using social robots to improve psychological well-being. This systematic review investigates the effect of social robot interventions for depression in older adults.


METHODS
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) method was used to identify and select existing studies. Nine electronic databases were searched for relevant studies. Methodological quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument. Screening, data extraction, and synthesis were performed by three reviewers. Inclusion criteria covered original quantitative studies investigating social robots for depression in older adults.


FINDINGS
Seven studies were identified-six randomized controlled trials and one comparison study-with all classified as good quality. Social robot interventions consisted of companion, communication, and health-monitoring robots. Three studies presented promising outcomes for reducing depressive symptoms in older adults following social robot interventions, and three studies showed decreased, but nonsignificant, trends in depression scores.


CONCLUSIONS
The results highlight the potential of social robot interventions for reducing depression in older adults. However, the evidence is not strong enough to formulate recommendations on clinical effectiveness.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
Social robots are being used with increasing frequency to potentially provide personal support to older adults living in long-term care facilities.

Interaction between humans and robots need to show similar emergent coordination. To this aim models of human synchronization have recently been ported on collaborative robots with success [1]. However, it is also important to consider under which conditions the human partner is willing to adapt to the robot while performing a joint task. The main research goal of this study is to understand whether the temporal adaptation usually observed during human-human interaction occurs also during human-robot cooperation. We present a collaborative joint task engaging both human subjects and the humanoid robot iCub in pursuing an identical common goal: putting blocks into a box. We examine human action timing, evinced from motion capture data, in order to investigate whether humans adapt their behavior to the robot. We compare a quantitative measure of such adaptation with the subjective evaluation extracted from questionnaires. We observe that on average participants tend to adapt to their robotic partner. Nevertheless, by looking at individual behaviors, only few showed a clear adaptation to its timing, despite the vast majority of the subjects reported to have been influenced by the robot. We conclude discussing the potential factors influencing human adaptability, with the suggestion that the speed of execution of the robot is determinant in the coordination.","[{'authorId': '2064343149', 'name': 'F.

To help us understand the difference between people's social interactions with an agent and a robot, we experimentally compared people's responses in a health interview with (a) a computer agent projected either on a computer monitor or life-size on a screen, (b) a remote robot projected life-size on a screen, or (c) a collocated robot in the same room. We found a few behavioral and large attitude differences across these conditions. Participants forgot more and disclosed least with the collocated robot, next with the projected remote robot, and then with the agent. They spent more time with the collocated robot and their attitudes were most positive toward that robot. We discuss tradeoffs for HRI research of using collocated robots, remote robots, and computer agents as proxies of robots.","[{'authorId': '2063989220', 'name': 'Aaron Powers'}, {'authorId': '47198673', 'name': 'S.

However, little is known about how children judge trustworthiness from faces. The present study examined the facial features that contributed to judgments of trustworthiness and attractiveness by three groups of Chinese children aged 8 years old (n = 34; 17 boys), 10 years old (n = 34; 17 boys), and 12 years old (n = 34; 17 boys) and a comparison group of 37 undergraduates (M age = 20.2 yr.; 16 men). Using FaceGen Modeler 3.1, a total of 400 East Asian adult faces (200 male, 200 female) portraying neutral emotions with direct gazes were generated. The faces were represented by 61 shape features and were presented for a maximum of 3,000 msec. in the center of the computer screen in randomized order. The participants were asked to judge whether each person was trustworthy and to rate the level of trustworthiness; 1 month later, the attractiveness of the same faces was judged using a similar procedure. The children and the adults used similar facial features to judge trustworthiness (e.g., the brow ridge, nose, and chin). Some of the facial features used by the different age groups as the basis for the trustworthiness and attractiveness judgments were similar. Facial attractiveness accounted for roughly 30 to 60% of the variance in the groups' trustworthiness judgments. Thus, facial attractiveness may serve as a heuristic property that signals trustworthiness and guides adaptive social decisions. More importantly, even children as young as 8 years old use a strategy similar to that of adults to make trustworthiness judgments, although some differences in the use of specific facial features were observed among the age groups.","[{'authorId': '2010071', 'name': 'Fengling Ma'}, {'authorId': '48101393', 'name': 'Fen Xu'}, {'authorId': '51145918', 'name': 'Xianming Luo'}]",36.0,,44.0,Children's and Adults' Judgments of Facial Trustworthiness: The Relationship to Facial Attractiveness,2015.0

However, there has been a recent convergence among numerous theoretical orientations in drawing from investigations of emotions within basic affective sciences, which highlight the survival and societal functions of emotions, the involvement of multiple biological systems in emotion generation, and a dynamic model for regulatory aspects of emotions. These characterizations of emotion suggest a number of ways that current treatments may benefit from explicit incorporation of interventions targeting emotions, particularly for resistant forms of adult psychopathology. Specifically, emotion-related skills training and broadening the role of emotions in meaning change may be important areas for expansion within the treatment of adult psychopathology.","[{'authorId': '6384086', 'name': 'D.

Here, we test the hypothesis that this impulse control capacity is driven by increased maturation of frontostriatal circuitry using a fiber-tracking approach combined with longitudinal imaging. In total, 192 healthy volunteers between 8 and 26 years underwent diffusion tensor imaging scanning and completed a delay-discounting task twice, separated by a 2-year interval. We investigated dynamic associations between frontostriatal white matter (WM) integrity and delay of gratification skills. Moreover, we examined the predictive value of frontostriatal WM integrity for future delay of gratification skills. Results showed that delay discounting increases with age in a quadratic fashion, with greatest patience during late adolescence. Data also indicated nonlinear development of frontostriatal WM, with relative fast development during childhood and early adulthood and—on average—little change during mid-adolescence. Furthermore, the positive association between age and delay discounting was further increased in individuals with higher WM integrity of the frontostriatal tracts. Predictive analysis showed that frontostriatal WM development explained unique variance in current and future delay of gratification skills. This study adds to a descriptive relation between WM integrity and delay of gratification by showing that maturation of frontostriatal connectivity predicts changes in delay of gratification skills. These findings have implications for studies examining deviances in impulse control by showing that the developmental path between striatum and prefrontal cortex may be an important predictor for when development goes astray. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT During the transition from childhood to adulthood, individuals generally show increased patience and become better in delaying gratification. The exact neural correlates of delay of gratification, however, remain poorly understood. By measuring both frontostriatal white matter (WM) integrity and delay of gratification skills at two time points, we were able to provide links for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying this type of impulse regulation capacity. We demonstrate that the ability to delay gratification improves between childhood and young adulthood and this improvement is predicted by the integrity of frontostriatal WM connections. This study adds to a descriptive relation between WM quality and delay of gratification by showing that maturation of frontostriatal connectivity predicts improvements in delay of gratification skills.","[{'authorId': '5491920', 'name': 'M.

Across kingdoms and length scales, certain cells and organisms navigate their environments not through locomotion but through growth. This pattern of movement is found in fungal hyphae, developing neurons, and trailing plants, and is characterized by extension from the tip of the body, length change of hundreds of percent, and active control of growth direction. This results in the abilities to move through tightly constrained environments and form useful three-dimensional structures from the body. We report a class of soft pneumatic robot that is capable of a basic form of this behavior, growing substantially in length from the tip while actively controlling direction using onboard sensing of environmental stimuli; further, the peak rate of lengthening is comparable to rates of animal and robot locomotion. This is enabled by two principles: Pressurization of an inverted thin-walled vessel allows rapid and substantial lengthening of the tip of the robot body, and controlled asymmetric lengthening of the tip allows directional control. Further, we demonstrate the abilities to lengthen through constrained environments by exploiting passive deformations and form three-dimensional structures by lengthening the body of the robot along a path.

However, it is important as well to study and compare ethnic identity and its correlates across groups. This article presents a questionnaire measure of ethnic identity based on the elements of ethnic identity that are common across groups, so that it can be used with all ethnic groups. The questionnaire was administered to 417 high school students and 136 college students from ethnically diverse schools. Reliability, assessed by Cronbach 's alpha, was .81 for the high school sample and .9Ofor the college sample. The relationship of ethnic identity to various demographic variables and to self-esteem was examined. The measure can be used to examine similarities and differences in ethnlic identity and its correlates among youths from different ethnic groups.","[{'authorId': '34961408', 'name': 'J.

While meaningful inroads have been made in this area regarding the use of ethical lethal military robots, including work by our laboratory, these needs transcend the warfighting domain and are pervasive, extending to eldercare, robot nannies, and other forms of service and entertainment robotic platforms. This paper presents an overview of the spectrum and specter of ethical issues raised by the advent of these systems, and various technical results obtained to date by our research group, geared towards managing ethical behavior in autonomous robots in relation to humanity. This includes: 1) the use of an ethical governor capable of restricting robotic behavior to predefined social norms; 2) an ethical adaptor which draws upon the moral emotions to allow a system to constructively and proactively modify its behavior based on the consequences of its actions; 3) the development of models of robotic trust in humans and its dual, deception, drawing on psychological models of interdependence theory; and 4) concluding with an approach towards the maintenance of dignity in human-robot relationships.","[{'authorId': '1706062', 'name': 'R.

However, changes in healthcare delivery coupled with concerns about lack of objectivity or standardization of clinical examinations lead to the introduction of the ‘simulated patient’ (SP). SPs are now used widely for teaching and assessment purposes. SPs are usually, but not necessarily, lay people who are trained to portray a patient with a specific condition in a realistic way, sometimes in a standardized way (where they give a consistent presentation which does not vary from student to student). SPs can be used for teaching and assessment of consultation and clinical/physical examination skills, in simulated teaching environments or in situ. All SPs play roles but SPs have also been used successfully to give feedback and evaluate student performance. Clearly, given this potential level of involvement in medical training, it is critical to recruit, train and use SPs appropriately. We have provided a detailed overview on how to do so, for both teaching and assessment purposes. The contents include: how to monitor and assess SP performance, both in terms of validity and reliability, and in terms of the impact on the SP; and an overview of the methods, staff costs and routine expenses required for recruiting, administrating and training an SP bank, and finally, we provide some intercultural comparisons, a ‘snapshot’ of the use of SPs in medical education across Europe and Asia, and briefly discuss some of the areas of SP use which require further research.","[{'authorId': '145780443', 'name': 'J.

In particular, two physical cues can be exploited, i.e. the Interaural Time Difference (ITD) and the Interaural Level Difference (ILD). It is known that joint use of ITD and ILD provides good source azimuth estimations. In many practical situations binaural localization has to be performed in closed environments, where the presence of reverberation degrades the performance of available position estimators. In this paper a possible solution to this difficult problem is introduced. The proposed solution is based on proper use of cepstral prefiltering prior to source localization by ITD and ILD. It is shown that cepstrum can help in reducing the effects of reverberation, thus yielding better location estimates.","[{'authorId': '143652999', 'name': 'R.

Specifically, we begin by synthesizing a model of self-regulation based on contemporary educational and psychological literatures. Then we use that model as a structure for analyzing the cognitive processes involved in self-regulation, and for interpreting and integrating findings from disparate research traditions. We propose an elaborated model of SRL that can embrace these research findings and that spotlights the cognitive operation of monitoring as the hub of self-regulated cognitive engagement. The model is then used to reexamine (a) recent research on how feedback affects cognitive engagement with tasks and (b) the relation among forms of engagement and achievement. We conclude with a proposal that research on feedback and research on self-regulated learning should be tightly coupled, and that the facets of our model should be explicitly addressed in future research in both areas.","[{'authorId': '29637867', 'name': 'Deborah L Butler'}, {'authorId': '2972227', 'name': 'P.

Despite the evidence for the influence of positive mental well-being on health, there is, to our knowledge, no research examining the possible effects of positive antenatal mental health on the development of the offspring. Using exploratory bifactor analysis, this prospective study (n = 1,066) demonstrated the feasibility of using common psychiatric screening tools to examine the effect of positive maternal mental health. Antenatal mental health was assessed during 26th week of pregnancy. The effects on offspring were assessed when the child was 12, 18, and 24 months old. Results showed that positive antenatal mental health was uniquely associated with the offspring's cognitive, language and parentally rated competences. This study shows that the effects of positive maternal mental health are likely to be specific and distinct from the sheer absence of symptoms of depression or anxiety.","[{'authorId': '3275870', 'name': 'D.

The main instruments used were the basic psychological needs scale, the emotional regulation scale and the academic stress questionnaire. Results show a positive relationship between the need of autonomy and the two dimensions of emotional regulation – cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression-. Cognitive reappraisal did not exhibit any relationship within the social science students examined. Further, the needs of autonomy and competence were positively related with cognitive reappraisal, and negatively related with expressive suppression. The greatest correlation strength was revealed in students studying health sciences. Finally, it was revealed that health science students made better use of emotional regulation in order to control academic stress. This highlights the importance of developing emotional regulation and satisfying basic psychological needs within higher education.","[{'authorId': '1400811678', 'name': 'Ramón Chacón-Cuberos'}, {'authorId': '1404901375', 'name': 'E.

A fourth subscale, general self-worth, independent of any particular skill domain, was included. A new question format was devised which provides a broader range of responses and reduces the tendency to give socially desirable responses. The psychometric properties of the scale are presented for third through ninth grades. Emphasis is placed on its factorial validity. Each subscale defines a separate factor, indicating that children make clear differentiations among these domains. The factor structure is extremely stable across this grade range.

Abnormalities in the default mode, executive and salience networks are implicated in both rumination and attentional control difficulties in MDD. In the current study, individuals with MDD (n = 16) and healthy controls (n = 16) completed tasks designed to elicit self-focused (ruminative) and externally-focused thinking during fMRI scanning. The MDD group showed greater default mode network connectivity and less executive and salience network connectivity during the external-focus condition. Contrary to our predictions, there were no differences in connectivity between the groups during the self-focus condition. Thus, it appears that when directed to engage in self-referential thinking, both depressed and non-depressed individuals similarly recruit networks supporting this process. In contrast, when instructed to engage in non-self-focused thought, non-depressed individuals show a pattern of network connectivity indicative of minimized self-referential processing, whereas depressed individuals fail to reallocate neural resources in a manner consistent with effective down regulation of self-focused thought. This is consistent with difficulties in regulating self-focused thinking in order to engage in more goal-directed behavior that is seen in individuals with MDD.","[{'authorId': '6175156', 'name': 'E.

In recent years, the importance of emotions and their assistance to cognition has been increasingly acknowledged. Emotions are no longer considered undesirable or simply useless. Their role in various aspects of human and animal cognition like perception, attention, memory, decision-making and social interaction has been recognised as essential. The importance of emotions is much more evident in social interaction and therefore much of the emotions research done in arti cial systems focuses on the expression and recognition of emotions. However, recent neurophysiological research suggests that emotions also play a crucial part in cognition itself. This thesis investigates ways in which arti cial emotions can improve autonomous behaviour in the domain of a simple, but complete, solitary learning agent. For this purpose, a non-symbolic emotion model was designed and implemented. It takes the form of a recurrent arti cial neural network where emotions in uence the perception of the state of the world, on which they ultimately depend. This is done through a hormone system that acts as a persistence mechanism. This model is somewhat more sophisticated than those usually found in equivalent non-symbolic systems, yet the emotions themselves were restricted to a few simpli ed emotions that do not try to mimic the complexity of the human counterparts, but are a orded by the agent's interaction with the environment. Several hypotheses were investigated of how the emotion model above could be integrated in a reinforcement learning framework which, by itself, provides the base for the adaptiveness necessary for autonomy. Experiments were carried out in a realistic robot simulator that compared the performance of emotional with non-emotional agents in a survival task that consists of maintaining adequate energy levels in an environment with obstacles and energy sources. One of the most common roles attributed to emotions is as source of reinforcement and was therefore examined rst. In experiments with a controller that selects between primitive actions, the reinforcement provided by emotions was found inappropriate because of the time scale discrepancies introduced by the emotion model. The reinforcement provided by emotions proved to be much more successful when used by a controller that selects between behaviours rather than actions, achieving equivalent performance to that of a standard reinforcement function. One of the crucial issues for e cient and productive learning, highlighted by the latter experiments, is to determine exactly when the controller should re-evaluate its decision concerning which behaviour to activate. The emotions proved to be particularly helpful in this role, enabling better performance with substantially less computational e ort than the best suited interruption mechanism using regular time intervals. The modulation of learning parameters such as learning rate and the exploration vs. exploitation ratio was also explored. Experiments suggested that emotions might also be useful for this purpose. This research led to the conclusion that arti cial emotions are a useful construct to have in the domain of behaviour-based autonomous agents, because they provide a unifying way to tackle di erent issues of control, analogous to natural systems' emotions.","[{'authorId': '2230847', 'name': 'S.

Research purpose: To provide an overview of the JD–R model, which incorporates many possible working conditions and focuses on both negative and positive indicators of employee well-being. Moreover, the studies of the special issue were introduced. Research design: Qualitative and quantitative studies on the JD–R model were reviewed to enlighten the health and motivational processes suggested by the model. Main findings: Next to the confirmation of the two suggested processes of the JD–R model, the studies of the special issue showed that the model can be used to predict work-place bullying, incidences of upper respiratory track infection, work-based identity, and early retirement intentions. Moreover, whilst psychological safety climate could be considered as a hypothetical precursor of job demands and resources, compassion satisfaction moderated the health process of the model. Contribution/value-add: The findings of previous studies and the studies of the special issue were integrated in the JD–R model that can be used to predict well-being and performance at work. New avenues for future research were suggested. Practical/managerial implications: The JD–R model is a framework that can be used for organisations to improve employee health and motivation, whilst simultaneously improving various organisational outcomes.","[{'authorId': '4847518', 'name': 'E.

Method: In a cross-sectional study, 329 (187 female, 142 male) students from the University of Shiraz were assessed using the short form of the Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale (SELSA-S) and the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). Data were analyzed using correlation coefficients, factor analysis and t-tests. Results: After the translation of the SELSA-S scale and the cultural conformity of its agents, the factor analysis of the convergent coefficients to MSPSS and SWLS methods were used to determine its validity. The results of the factor analysis revealed three factors in the SELSA-S scale that were described as a loneliness feeling in romance, in society, and in family.

We found that the continuous proximity of the teacher had the greatest impact on the level of play engagement, while the teacher's walking around and only brief contacts with the children had a negative impact. In line with earlier studies, two-sided and reciprocal interactions between teacher and children also yielded positive results for play engagement. Both our quantitative and qualitative analyses showed a strong co-variation of variables. When the teacher paid only brief visits, and peers also walked in and out, there was a greater likelihood of one-sided interactions, When the teacher was always nearby, we observed the opposite. Dutch teachers spend most of their time walking around. Their pedagogy seems to be based on a model of individual care and control and insensitiveness of group dynamic processes.","[{'authorId': '40017455', 'name': 'E.

Although activations have consistently been reported within the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), it remains unclear which ACC subdivision is particularly involved. To provide a quantitative estimation of the specific involvement of ACC subdivisions in social pain, we conducted a voxel-based meta-analysis. The literature search identified 46 articles that included 940 subjects, the majority of which used the cyberball task. Significant likelihoods of activation were found in both the ventral and dorsal ACC for both social pain elicitation and self-reported distress during social pain. Self-reported distress involved more specifically the subgenual and pregenual ACC than social pain-related contrasts. The cyberball task involved the anterior midcingulate cortex to a lesser extent than other experimental tasks. During social pain, children exhibited subgenual activations to a greater extent than adults. Finally, the ventro-dorsal gradient of ACC activations in cyberball studies was related to the length of exclusion phases. The present meta-analysis contributes to a better understanding of the role of ACC subdivisions in social pain, and it could be of particular importance for guiding future studies of social pain and its neural underpinnings.","[{'authorId': '4558336', 'name': 'J.

9e603d32746dd4eaba556795f5b3218ed3ca8eff,"CONTEXT
Major depressive disorder is associated with impairments in processing emotional stimuli, and residual impairments are observed during remission, possibly indicating trait vulnerability. Stimuli with social context represent a distinct class of emotional stimuli, which in healthy volunteers are associated with specific neural substrates but have not previously been studied relative to vulnerability to depression.


OBJECTIVE
To explore whether individuals with remitted major depressive disorder had altered neuronal processing of social emotional stimuli.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional design using functional magnetic resonance imaging, combined with a cognitive activation task.


SETTING
General community of greater Manchester, England.


PARTICIPANTS
Twenty-five unmedicated participants fully remitted from major depressive disorder and 29 age-matched control subjects.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Neuronal responses to positive and negative social interaction images vs valence-matched images with less overt social context.


RESULTS
Participants with remitted depression showed attenuated frontopolar response relative to controls for positive and negative images depicting social interactions. For negative social images, participants with remitted depression also showed reduced latero-orbitofrontal response relative to controls.


CONCLUSIONS
In the absence of current symptoms, individuals with remitted major depressive disorder showed reduced frontopolar processing of stimuli showing social interactions, a reduction not seen for stimuli showing individual successes and failures and, therefore, not simply an effect of emotional valence. These results suggest a specific trait abnormality in social emotional processing associated with vulnerability to depression, which may have implications for understanding social cognition mechanisms and for developing effective psychological therapies.","[{'authorId': '49691586', 'name': 'R.

In this work, we present a realtime approach to detect the 2D pose of multiple people in an image.

This bottom-up system achieves high accuracy and realtime performance, regardless of the number of people in the image. In previous work, PAFs and body part location estimation were refined simultaneously across training stages. We demonstrate that a PAF-only refinement rather than both PAF and body part location refinement results in a substantial increase in both runtime performance and accuracy. We also present the first combined body and foot keypoint detector, based on an internal annotated foot dataset that we have publicly released. We show that the combined detector not only reduces the inference time compared to running them sequentially, but also maintains the accuracy of each component individually.

Introduction: The aim of this research was to validate the General Health Questionnaire28 (GHQ-28) as a screening instrument of mental disorders in the population of aged 15 yr and above in Tehran City, capital of Iran. Methods: Overall, 879 people (455 females and 424 males) were chosen by the randomized cluster sampling from families under the coverage of health centers of the universities of Tehran, Iran and Shahid Beheshty. The study was carried out in two stage procedures. In the first step the GPs completed the GHQ-28, and in the second step all the samples were clinically interviewed by psychiatric residents based on DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. Results: By using conventional scoring method of GHQ, the cut off point for the sample was 6. The sensitivity and specificity of this questionnaire were 84.7% and 93.8% respectively, and the overall misclassification rate was 8.2%. Likert scoring method of GHQ showed a cut off point of 24 and the sensitivity, specificity and the overall misclassification rate of 70.5%, 92.3% and 12.3% respectively. The concurrent validity of this questionnaire carried out by the Symptom Checklist90Revised indicated that there was a meaningful correlation between scores of samples within the scales of these instruments. The Pearson correlation between the scales and total scores of GHQ-28 suggested that fluctuation of anxiety symptoms had an important character in predicting abnormality than the other scales. Conclusion: The evaluation of reliability of GHQ-28 carried out by the testretest procedure a week after the first stage, and validation of this instrument indicated that the instrument could be used successfully in the epidemiological study of mental disorders as a screening instrument.","[{'authorId': '13497612', 'name': 'A.

We focus on physical modifications of the robot, which enables visual guidance instructions, since auditory guidance instructions pose potential problems in a noisy emergency environment. Robotic platforms can convey visual guidance instructions through motion, static signs, dynamic signs, and gestures using single or multiple arms. In this paper, we discuss the different guidance modalities instantiated by different physical platform constructs and assess the abilities of the platforms to convey information related to evacuation. Human-robot interaction studies with 192 participants show that participants were able to understand the information conveyed by the various robotic constructs in 75.8% of cases when using dynamic signs with multi-arm gestures, as opposed to 18.0% when using static signs for visual guidance. Of interest to note is that dynamic signs had equivalent performance to single-arm gestures overall but drastically different performances at the two distance levels tested. Based on these studies, we conclude that dynamic signs are important for information conveyance when the robot is in close proximity to the human but multi-arm gestures are necessary when information must be conveyed across a greater distance.","[{'authorId': '3333879', 'name': 'P.

Analyses that adjusted for maternal vocabulary score, family income, child gender, observed quality of the home environment, and observed maternal cognitive stimulation indicated that the overall quality of child care, and language stimulation in particular, was consistently but modestly related to cognitive and language outcomes at ages 15, 24, and 36 months. The effect sizes for high (top quartile) versus low (bottom quartile) quality ranged from .18 to .48. After adjusting for child care quality, cumulative experience in center-based care was associated with better outcomes than was participation in other types of care. The amount of time children spent in care was not related to outcomes. Children in exclusive maternal care did not differ systematically from children in child care. Tests for lagged relations of earlier child care experiences to later performance (adjusting for current child care) showed that language stimulation predicted subsequent cognitive and language performance 9 to 12 months later. Although children in center care at age 3 performed better than children in other types of care, earlier experience in child care homes was associated with better performance at age 3 than was experience in other types of care.

The data suggest that the clinical presentation, correlates, and natural course of depression are remarkably similar across the lifespan. There are, however, important developmental differences. Specifically, the familial and psychological context in which depression develops in youngsters is associated with variability in the frequency and nature of depressive symptoms and comorbid conditions among children and adolescents. Maturational differences have also been identified in the neurobiological correlates of depression. These developmental differences may be associated with the observed variability in clinical response to treatment and longitudinal course.

Professionals did observe meaningful application possibilities, but the lacking adaptability, expandability and technical stability of the robot platform make application in daily care practice impossible. The application of a robot like IROMEC for children with severe physical disabilities seems to be positive and worthwhile, but usability and feasibility aspects are crucial for success.","[{'authorId': '13204077', 'name': 'Renée J.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to verify whether a videomodeling intervention is effective for the acquisition of social and emotional behaviour and skills of children with ASD using tablet PC. METHODS: One 6-year-old child with ASD, who does not use verbal communication, was involved in a multiple baseline across behaviours design: the independent variable was the videomodeling intervention, instead the dependent variable was the participant behaviour. Intervention was preceded by a pre-session of Functional Communication training. An intersubject analysis was used to evaluate participant percentage of response through the sessions. RESULTS: The participant showed a marked improvement in his emotional skills. The intersubjective analysis carried out shows the sharp increase in response in many target behaviours from the baseline to the intervention phase. A limitation of the study was the lack of time: there were only two inversion sessions, no follow-up evaluation, no generalization and no double-blind study. CONCLUSIONS: It would be interesting for future research to extend it to everyday life scenarios, to enhance generalization in other contexts, involving a larger number of people with ASD.","[{'authorId': '34838813', 'name': 'Angelo Rega'}, {'authorId': '117628122', 'name': 'Federica Somma'}, {'authorId': '116010808', 'name': 'L.

The method is philosophical analysis and involves the application of theories from political theory to the ethics of technology. A veil of complexity creates the illusion that machine actions belong to a mysterious and unpredictable domain, and some argue that this unpredictability absolves designers of responsibility. Such a move would create a moral hazard related to both (a) strategically increasing unpredictability and (b) taking more risk if responsible humans do not have to bear the costs of the risks they create. Hobbes's theory allows for the clear and arguably fair attribution of action while allowing for necessary development and innovation. Innovation will be allowed as long as it is compatible with social order and provided the beneficial effects outweigh concerns about increased risk.

Yet, surprisingly, recent findings demonstrate that people use cognitive reappraisal less frequently than might be expected (Suri, Whittaker, & Gross, 2015). We employ cognitive energetics theory (CET) to explain this puzzling behavior. CET posits that the likelihood of launching any cognitive process is a function of two opposing forces: the driving force (i.e., the motivation to launch the process) and the restraining force (i.e., task difficulty). We thus hypothesized that people choose to use cognitive reappraisal relatively rarely because of the difficulty of implementing it. We also postulated that the decision to reappraise (or not) does not simply depend on stimuli emotional intensity because the latter is associated with both the driving and the restraining forces. In support of our hypotheses, we found that when the images' emotional intensity posed difficulty for reappraisal (i.e., highly intense images), reducing this difficulty by asking participants to merely predict others' (Study 1) or their own choices (Study 2) increased reappraisal choice. Finally, in Study 3, we show that a relatively easy to implement reappraisal strategy was chosen more often than the more difficult one for high (but not low) intensity images. These findings illustrate the relevance of a CET-based motivational analysis to emotion regulation choice.

The results of multigroup confirmatory factor analysis showed that the 6-factor structure of the EAQ30 is similar in all three samples. These results were confirmed by the high coefficients of congruence that indicated factorial invariance across samples. Comparison between the three samples showed minor cultural differences. These findings support the factorial and construct validity of the EAQ30 and suggest that the EAQ30 accurately captures the structure of children’s emotional dispositions, regardless of cultural differences.","[{'authorId': '40005541', 'name': 'M.

In this article, we present a novel multimodal emotional HRI architecture to promote natural and engaging bidirectional emotional communications between a social robot and a human user. User affect is detected using a unique combination of body language and vocal intonation, and multimodal classification is performed using a Bayesian Network. The Emotionally Expressive Robot utilizes the user’s affect to determine its own emotional behavior via an innovative two-layer emotional model consisting of deliberative (hidden Markov model) and reactive (rule-based) layers. The proposed architecture has been implemented via a small humanoid robot to perform diet and fitness counseling during HRI. In order to evaluate the Emotionally Expressive Robot’s effectiveness, a Neutral Robot that can detect user affects but lacks an emotional display, was also developed. A between-subjects HRI experiment was conducted with both types of robots. Extensive results have shown that both robots can effectively detect user affect during the real-time HRI. However, the Emotionally Expressive Robot can appropriately determine its own emotional response based on the situation at hand and, therefore, induce more user positive valence and less negative arousal than the Neutral Robot.","[{'authorId': '32418659', 'name': 'A.

a2cd92e49ac04811fb44329385e6b123685e73a0,"For the first time we report that by introducing sub-nm roughness on a Si surface, the energy coupling between a single layer graphene (SLG) and the Si substrate can be improved substantially. This is contrary to the traditional view that a rough surface contact will weaken the energy coupling, rather than improve it. Periodical grooves of 2 nm width and 2 nm spacing are introduced on the surface of a Si substrate. It is surprisingly found that when the groove depth (δ) is less than 0.54 nm, the interfacial thermal resistance decreases against the increasing δ (more than 10% decrease at δ = 0.54 nm). The observed finding is explained soundly with the interfacial C-Si bond tuning by the surface roughness. For δ < 0.54 nm, the C-Si bond length in the suspended graphene region is large, and graphene experiences a strong pulling-down force (attractive) from the Si substrate. On the other hand, the graphene in the supported region is in direct contact with Si and experiences an extremely strong repulsive force to balance the pulling-down force in the suspended region. The repulsive force on graphene in the supported region can reach a level of 228 MPa. This significantly increases the local energy coupling and offsets the energy coupling reduction in the suspended graphene region. The discovery in this work points out that for extremely soft materials like graphene, it is possible to tune the material-substrate bonding by introducing sub-nm roughness on the substrate surface to significantly improve interfacial energy coupling.","[{'authorId': '1519063958', 'name': 'Jingchao Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2108745763', 'name': 'Yongchun Wang'}, {'authorId': '145276363', 'name': 'Xinwei Wang'}]",66.0,,41.0,Rough contact is not always bad for interfacial energy coupling.,2013.0

In this work, we investigate how a robot can use information from prior conversations with the same child to foster a sense of relationship over time. To address this question, we conducted a repeated interaction study with three experimental conditions: a baseline control condition, in which the robot retains no information between conversations and relies on a typical elicitation-response paradigm; a persistence condition, in which children experience the same topic flow but with some robot turns that refer back to prior shared events; and a pro-active persistence condition, in which the robot attempts to offer its own feelings and opinions pro-actively and congruently with what it knows about the child. Our results indicate age differences with respect to the measures of interest. During conversations with the robot, older children who were assigned to the persistence conditions exhibited more positive affect, while younger children showed more positive affect in the control condition. Moreover, in a set of comparative judgments among robots they had played with, children in the augmented persistence condition considered PIPER to be the most intelligent and their favorite more often than children in the other conditions, overall, but the effect was more evident in the older children.","[{'authorId': '39799707', 'name': 'Iolanda Leite'}, {'authorId': '11845717', 'name': 'André Pereira'}, {'authorId': '2142730', 'name': 'J.

Teachers nationwide have implemented several approaches to reduce student misbehavior, including School-wide Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) and co-teaching. However, since misbehaver still disrupts learning, research is still needed to find a classroom intervention that will reduce misbehavior in a classroom to prevent students from under achieving, disruption of peers’ learning and teacher burnout. Zones of Regulation focuses on self-regulation, while addressing sensory processing, executive functioning, and emotional regulation. This experimental study tested the effects of co-taught Zones of Regulation on students’ Social, Academic, and Emotional Behavior Risk Screener (SAEBRS). Fifty-six early elementary students (48% female) were assigned randomly to either the experimental group, which received co-taught direct instruction with Zones of Regulation or the control group, which received standard instruction with a morning meeting. It was predicted that the experimental group would score higher on the SAEBRS than the control group. Although results showed no statistical difference on the SAEBRS scores between the two groups, more students in the experimental group moved from “at risk” to “not at risk”. This study suggests additional research needs to be conducted to determine if co-taught Zones of Regulation instruction is an effective intervention for reducing misbehavior.","[{'authorId': '116736230', 'name': 'M.

Recent studies showing that members of literate cultures associated the same emotion concepts with the same facial behaviors could not demonstrate that at least some facial expressions of emotion are universal; the cultures compared had all been exposed to some of the same mass media presentations of facial expression, and these may have taught the people in each culture to recognize the unique facial expressions of other cultures. To show that members of a preliterate culture who had minimal exposure to literate cultures would associate the same emotion concepts with the same facial behaviors as do members of Western and Eastern literate cultures, data were gathered in New Guinea by telling subjects a story, showing them a set of three faces, and asking them to select the face which showed the emotion appropriate to the story.

a389767a2901d51bd8450f9930b398b6f61cab05,"Several studies have found a delay in the development of facial emotion recognition and expression in children with an autism spectrum condition (ASC). Several interventions have been designed to help children to fill this gap. Most of them adopt technological devices (i.e., robots, computers, and avatars) as social mediators and reported evidence of improvement. Few interventions have aimed at promoting emotion recognition and expression abilities and, among these, most have focused on emotion recognition. Moreover, a crucial point is the generalization of the ability acquired during treatment to naturalistic interactions. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of two technological-based interventions focused on the expression of basic emotions comparing a robot-based type of training with a “hybrid” computer-based one. Furthermore, we explored the engagement of the hybrid technological device introduced in the study as an intermediate step to facilitate the generalization of the acquired competencies in naturalistic settings. A two-group pre-post-test design was applied to a sample of 12 children (M = 9.33; ds = 2.19) with autism. The children were included in one of the two groups: group 1 received a robot-based type of training (n = 6); and group 2 received a computer-based type of training (n = 6). Pre- and post-intervention evaluations (i.e., time) of facial expression and production of four basic emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, and anger) were performed. Non-parametric ANOVAs found significant time effects between pre- and post-interventions on the ability to recognize sadness [t(1) = 7.35, p = 0.006; pre: M (ds) = 4.58 (0.51); post: M (ds) = 5], and to express happiness [t(1) = 5.72, p = 0.016; pre: M (ds) = 3.25 (1.81); post: M (ds) = 4.25 (1.76)], and sadness [t(1) = 10.89, p < 0; pre: M (ds) = 1.5 (1.32); post: M (ds) = 3.42 (1.78)]. The group*time interactions were significant for fear [t(1) = 1.019, p = 0.03] and anger expression [t(1) = 1.039, p = 0.03]. However, Mann–Whitney comparisons did not show significant differences between robot-based and computer-based training. Finally, no difference was found in the levels of engagement comparing the two groups in terms of the number of voice prompts given during interventions. Albeit the results are preliminary and should be interpreted with caution, this study suggests that two types of technology-based training, one mediated via a humanoid robot and the other via a pre-settled video of a peer, perform similarly in promoting facial recognition and expression of basic emotions in children with an ASC. The findings represent the first step to generalize the abilities acquired in a laboratory-trained situation to naturalistic interactions.","[{'authorId': '51967089', 'name': 'F.

There are ample reviews that show that adherence among patients suffering from chronic diseases average about 50% in the developed countries and the magnitude of this problem is of greater proportion in developing countries, given the paucity of health resources and inequities in access to health care. This is a comprehensive detailed report from the W HO, which sets out clear objectives and target audience. It provides a critical review of what is known about adherence to long-term therapies. The main target audience of this report is policy makers and health care managers who are in position to have an impact on national and local policies. It explains the ways that will benefit patients, health care systems and societies, with better health outcomes and economic efficiency. This report is also a very useful reference for scientists and clinicians in their daily work who are not only involved in the direct patient care but may also indirecdy impact on the policies at the level of the institutions or at the government level. The main objective of the report is to improve worldwide rates of adherence to therapies commonly used in treating chronic conditions. It addresses the issue of system approach rather than the burden of problem of compliance placed on the patient. The four objectives that are laid out in detail summarizes the existing knowledge on adherence, increasing awareness among policy makers about the poor rates of adherence and its health and economic consequences, promote discussions and provide the basis for policy guidelines. The lay out of the book is easy to understand as it sets the stage by defining the disease status and the magnitude of the problem. In different sections it talks about the improving adherence rates and guidelines for the countries and then discusses the disease specific reviews of 9 common chronic conditions by identifying 5 dimensions of adherence: 1) social economic factors; 2) health system factors; 3) condition related factors; 4) therapy related factor; and 5) patient related factors. It emphasizes the growing evidence, which suggest that because of the alarmingly low rate of adherence, increasing the effectiveness of adherence interventions may have a far greater impact on the health of the population then any improvement in specific medical treatments. Based on the disease specific reviews and talking about the solution based on the 5 dimensions of adherence it lays out the plan for the policy makers, that the health care system must evolve to meet new challenges. It looks into the shortcoming of the existing systems where the systems directed appointment length does not allow time to adequately address adherence behavior. That the systems are the one that determine the fee structures, lack of financial reimbursement for patient counseling and education, which directly relates to decrease adherencefocused interventions. It tends to provide new challenges to understand and better evolve the health systems by sharing of information between the clinics and the pharmacies and the level of communication among patients. In reviewing this report, the health care providers, the policy makers and health managers tend to grasp the essential objectives of this report with specific take home messages that is: a) poor adherence to treatment of chronic diseases is a worldwide problem of striking magnitude; b) impact of poor adherence grows as the burden of chronic disease grows, as worldwide it is expected to exceed 65% in 2020; c) consequences of poor adherence to long-term therapies are poor health outcomes and increase health care costs; d) improving adherence also enhance patients safety; e) adherence is an important modifier of health system effectiveness. In summary this is an excellent report which very well lays out the plan for discussion of the main concepts of definition of adherence and its relevance to epidemiology and economics. It gives important insight and guidance for the countries in order to put into context the real impact of adherence on health and economics. It helps readers with clinical practice to find it useful especially the section on disease specific reviews of 9 chronic conditions that are reviewed in depth.

Beyond intracortical effects, functional imaging as well as behavioral studies are suggesting additional tDCS‐driven alterations of subcortical areas, however, direct evidence for such effects is scarce. We aimed to investigate the impact of tDCS on cortico‐subcortical functional networks by seed functional connectivity analysis of different striatal and thalamic regions to prove tDCS‐induced alterations of the cortico‐striato‐thalamic circuit. fMRI resting state data sets were acquired immediately before and after 10 min of bipolar tDCS during rest, with the anode/cathode placed over the left primary motor cortex (M1) and the cathode/anode over the contralateral frontopolar cortex. To control for possible placebo effects, an additional sham stimulation session was carried out. Functional coupling between the left thalamus and the ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1) significantly increased following anodal stimulation over M1. Additionally, functional connectivity between the left caudate nucleus and parietal association cortices was significantly strengthened. In contrast, cathodal tDCS over M1 decreased functional coupling between left M1 and contralateral putamen. In summary, in this study, we show for the first time that tDCS modulates functional connectivity of cortico‐striatal and thalamo‐cortical circuits. Here we highlight that anodal tDCS over M1 is capable of modulating elements of the cortico‐striato‐thalamo‐cortical functional motor circuit.

Self-compassion describes a positive and caring attitude of a person toward her- or himself in the face of failures and individual shortcomings. As a result of this caring attitude, individuals high in self-compassion are assumed to experience higher individual well-being. The present meta-analysis examines the relationship between self-compassion and different forms of well-being.


METHOD
The authors combined k = 79 samples, with an overall sample size of N = 16,416, and analyzed the central tendencies of effect sizes (Pearson correlation coefficients) with a random-effect model.


RESULTS
We found an overall magnitude of the relationship between self-compassion and well-being of r = .47. The relationship was stronger for cognitive and psychological well-being compared to affective well-being. Sample characteristics and self-esteem were tested as potential moderators. In addition, a subsample of studies indicated a causal effect of self-compassion on well-being.


CONCLUSIONS
The results clearly highlight the importance of self-compassion for individuals' well-being. Future research should further investigate the relationship between self-compassion and the different forms of well-being, and focus on the examination of possible additional moderators.","[{'authorId': '7353043', 'name': 'Ulli Zessin'}, {'authorId': '118391006', 'name': 'O.

It suggested that teacher-rated preschool behavior such as aggressive, anxious-withdrawn, and prosocial behaviors influence cognitive self-control, which in turn positively determines school achievement at the end of first grade (when controlling for intellectual abilities). Participants were 291 kindergarten children. Results from structural equation modeling demonstrated that all hypothesized path models were significant, except the one between anxious-withdrawn behavior and cognitive self-control. A second model was thus specified in which a path between anxious-withdrawn behavior and school achievement was estimated. The second model offered a better representation of the sample data (comparative fit index = .99, normormed fit index = .98), ×2(19, N = 286) = 29.43, p > .05, and the path between anxious-withdrawn behavior and school achievement was found significant. The role of preschool behavior and cognitive self-control in first-grade school achievement is discussed. There is a consensus that children's successful school transition from kindergarten to the first grade is particularly important because children's grades in the first years of school substantially affect subsequent achievement trajecto- ries (e.g., Alexander & Entwisle, 1988; Alexander, Entwisle, & Dauber, 1993; Ensminger & Slusarick, 1992; Reynolds & Bezrucko, 1993; Willms & Jacobsen, 1990). Moreover, children's poor school achievement may constitute a risk factor for mental health difficulties in later childhood or adolescence (e.g., Feldman & Wentzel, 1990; Tremblay et al., 1992) and in adulthood (Caspi, Elder, B Kazdin, 1985). Therefore, a quintessential research problem exists in identifying specific processes that could impair or facilitate children's academic performance during the first years of schooling. Particular attention has been given to the influence of the family processes (e.g., the affective climate, the cognitive stimulation, the quality of the parent-child interaction, parental involvement) and characteristics (e.g., socioeco- nomic level) on school achievement (Crane, 1996; Gorges & Elliott, 1995; Grolnick & Ryan, 1989; Pianta & Harbers, 1996).

Among the processes that have been associated with school achieve- ment, children's ability to engage in self-control (Kendall, 1993) is of particular importance during the early grades. Indeed, children's ability to concentrate on a task and to participate in the academic routine are determinants of their school achievement (Alexander et al., 1993). Such behavior during the early primary grades enhances learning opportu- nities and contributes favorably to school achievement. Therefore, it is important to focus on processes such as children's ability to engage in cognitive self-control in a learning situation. Cognitive serf-control abilities, along with self-efficacy perception and commitment to academic goals, are a key element involved in children's serf-regulated learning (Zimmerman, 1989, 1990). The current prospective study was undertaken to assess the interplay between children's behavioral characteristics and their ability to engage in cognitive self-control as predictors of their school achievement in first grade. Some limits identified in previous studies led us to consider the mediating role of children's cognitive self-control between their behavioral characteristics in kindergarten and their school performance in first grade. First, little is known about specific processes that could play a mediating role between children's preschool behav- ioral characteristics and later school achievement (Belsky & MacKinnon, 1994). Second, most of the studies that have considered the association between children's behavioral characteristics (anxious-depressive, aggressive, or prosocial 111","[{'authorId': '6098583', 'name': 'S.

The study was conducted with a sample of 445 nurses and healthcare assistants from a general hospital. Team reflexivity was evaluated with the validation of the French version of the team reflexivity scale (Facchin, Tschan, Gurtner, Cohen, & Dupuis, 2006). Burnout was measured with the MBI General Survey (Schaufeli, Leiter, Maslach, & Jackson, 1996). Emotional dissonance and re-evaluation were measured with the scale developed by Andela, Truchot, & Borteyrou (2015). With reference to Rimé's theoretical model (2009), we suggested that both dimensions of team reflexivity (task and social reflexivity) respond to both psychological necessities induced by dissonance (cognitive clarification and socio-affective necessities). Firstly, results indicated that emotional dissonance was related to burnout.

More specifically, due to their characteristics (predictability, simplicity, and repetition) robots can be especially helpful to teach emotional abilities to children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous research has provided preliminary evidence that robots can help children improve in some domains such as joint attention and imitation. However, no studies have examined how robots can be integrated in intervention protocols targeting the acquisition of emotional abilities in children with ASD. This paper presents a work in progress on an emotional ability training developed for children with ASD using the QT socially assistive robot. This training aims to test whether children with ASD can benefit from a robot-mediated training to improve emotional ability.","[{'authorId': '37570080', 'name': 'Andreia P.

This study focused on literate language features in spoken narratives of school-age children with typical language development and school-age children with language impairments (LI).


METHOD
The spoken narrative retellings from male and female children aged 7 to 10 years were analyzed. The samples yielded scores for the literate language features of conjunctions, elaborated noun phrases, mental and linguistic verbs, and adverbs. A general language performance measure (number of different words) also was studied.


RESULTS
Group membership main effects were statistically significant for conjunctions and elaborated noun phrases, with effect sizes ranging from small to moderate. No statistically significant differences were obtained for age level or gender. Correlations between scores for number of different words and scores for the literate language features were low to moderate.


CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
The measures of conjunctions and elaborated noun phrases differentiated children with LI from those with typical language. When the number of different words was normalized for sample length, support for its use as a general language performance measure was not obtained.","[{'authorId': '15448190', 'name': 'Kellie S Greenhalgh'}, {'authorId': '38552117', 'name': 'C.

This archival study examined the growth curve characteristics of the indexes following traumatic brain injury. The primary hypothesis was that there is systematic variability in the components (e.g., slope) of the curves. Subjects included 40 children with documented loss of consciousness, age at injury 9.3 years (SD = 2.6), 68% severe TBI, evaluated with a full WISC-III a minimum of three times post-injury. Growth curve analyses with hierarchical linear modeling, conducted with factor scores recalculated as non-age-standardized z scores, indicated that although the intercept was reliable and could be predicted by injury characteristics, there was little systematic variation in index growth rates. Findings suggest that WISC-III indexes are of limited utility as repeated measures of recovery following TBI.","[{'authorId': '38598399', 'name': 'J. B. Kay'}, {'authorId': '5621359', 'name': 'S.

Similar results were found in earlier work with adults, who often avert their gaze during cognitively difficult tasks (A. M. Glenberg, J. L. Schroeder, & D. A. Robertson, 1998). Twenty-five 8-year-olds and 26 5-year-olds answered verbal reasoning and arithmetic questions of varying difficulty. The older children increased gaze aversion from the face of the adult questioner in response to both difficult verbal reasoning questions and difficult arithmetic questions. In contrast, younger children (5-year-olds) responded less consistently to cognitive difficulty. It is concluded that adultlike patterns of gaze aversion in response to cognitive difficulty are certainly acquired by 8 years of age. The implications of appropriate gaze aversion for children's management of cognitive processing resources are considered.","[{'authorId': '1401226124', 'name': 'G.

Methods Based on focus groups performed in two centers (Poland and Spain), we created surveys for medical staff, patients, and caregivers, including: functional requirements; human–robot interaction, the design of the robotic assistant and user acceptance aspects. Using Likert scale and analysis made on the basis of the frequency of survey responses, we identified users’ needs as high, medium, and low priority. Results We gathered 264 completed surveys (100 from medical staff, 81 from caregivers, and 83 from potential users). Most of the respondents, almost at the same level in each of the three groups, accept robotic assistants and their support in everyday life. High level priority functional requirements were related to reacting in emergency situations (calling for help, detecting/removing obstacles) and to reminding about medication intake, about boiling water, turning off the gas and lights (almost 60% of answers). With reference to human–robot interaction, high priority was given to voice operated system and the capability of robotic assistants to reply to simple questions. Conclusion Our results help in achieving better understanding of the needs of patients with cognitive impairments during home tasks in everyday life. This way of conducting the research, with considerations for the interests of three stakeholder groups in two autonomic centers with proven experience regarding the needs of our patient groups, highlights the importance of obtained results.","[{'authorId': '4176153', 'name': 'A.

We first present evidence that humanness has two distinct senses, one representing properties that are unique to our species, and the other—human nature—those properties that are essential or fundamental to the human category. An integrative model of dehumanisation is then laid out, in which distinct forms of dehumanisation correspond to the denial of the two senses of humanness, and the likening of people to particular kinds of nonhuman entities (animals and machines). Studies demonstrating that human nature attributes are ascribed more to the self than to others are reviewed, along with evidence of the phenomenon's cognitive and motivational basis. Research also indicates that both kinds of humanness are commonly denied to social groups, both explicitly and implicitly, and that they may cast a new light on the study of stereotype content. Our approach to the study of dehumanisation complements the tradition of research on infrahumanisation, and indicates new directions for exploring the importance of humanness as a dimension of social perception.","[{'authorId': '3041938', 'name': 'N.

Recent researches discussed the effect of personality traits on the verbal and nonverbal production, which plays a major role in transferring and understanding messages in a social interaction between a human and a robot. The characteristics of the generated gestures (e.g., amplitude, direction, rate, and speed) during the nonverbal communication can differ according to the personality trait, which, similarly, influences the verbal content of the human speech in terms of verbosity, repetitions, etc. Therefore, our research tries to map a human's verbal behavior to a corresponding combined robot's verbal-nonverbal behavior based on the personality dimensions of the interacting human. The system estimates first the interacting human's personality traits through a psycholinguistic analysis of the spoken language, then it uses PERSONAGE natural language generator that tries to generate a corresponding verbal language to the estimated personality traits. Gestures are generated by using BEAT toolkit, which performs a linguistic and contextual analysis of the generated language relying on rules derived from extensive research into human conversational behavior. We explored the human-robot personality matching aspect and the differences of the adapted mixed robot's behavior (gesture and speech) over the adapted speech only robot's behavior in an interaction. Our model validated that individuals preferred more to interact with a robot that had the same personality with theirs and that an adapted mixed robot's behavior (gesture and speech) was more engaging and effective than a speech only robot's behavior.

Does mimicry cause rapport and cooperation, or merely reflect it? Virtual humans can provide unique insights into these social processes by allowing unprecedented levels of experimental control. In a 2 x 2 factorial design, we examined the impact of facial mimicry and counter-mimicry in the iterated prisoner's dilemma. Participants played with an agent that copied their smiles and frowns or one that showed the opposite pattern -- i.e., that frowned when they smiled. As people tend to smile more than frown, we independently manipulated the contingency of expressions to ensure any effects are due to mimicry alone, and not the overall positivity/negativity of the agent: i.e., participants saw either a reflection of their own expressions or saw the expressions shown to a previous participant. Results show that participants smiled significantly more when playing an agent that mimicked them. Results also show a complex association between smiling, feelings of rapport, and cooperation. We discuss the implications of these findings on virtual human systems and theories of cooperation.","[{'authorId': '2065815350', 'name': 'Rens Hoegen'}, {'authorId': '47871040', 'name': 'J.

Super Cilia Skin (SCS) is a computationally enhanced membrane that couples tactile/ kinesthetic input with tactile and visual output. Our prototype manipulates the orientation of an array of yarn-like actuators (cilia) to display dynamic images or physical gestures. Like cloth, SCS is designed to be applied to arbitrary objects to engage sight and touch. Unlike traditional textiles, SCS can sense touch and dynamically move its surface. This article will discuss the potential for scale shifts with actuated textiles in which the material can blur boundaries between foreground/environment and field/object. Our design studies will present applications in which actuated textiles can use their material properties to improve interpersonal communication, enhance creative expression, and assist education in young learners by engaging tactile/kinesthetic intelligences.","[{'authorId': '3038806', 'name': 'Hayes Raffle'}, {'authorId': '19537927', 'name': 'James Tichenor'}, {'authorId': '145208441', 'name': 'H.

Children 5 years old, known to present an immature global visual bias, and 8 years old, known to pay attention predominantly to global information, were placed in either a neutral or pleasant emotional context and subsequently presented with a global/local visual judgement task. As with previous findings for adults, both age groups presented a pronounced perceptual bias toward global information following exposure to emotionally pleasant pictures. Interestingly, younger children, who do not present a global bias during the neutral exposure, presented the same preference for global information as older children when exposed to the pleasant context. These findings indicate that emotion may strongly affect visual perception in children, with important implications for educational practice and models of cognition.","[{'authorId': '4824216', 'name': 'N.

a6e5960cdd53db1618b7b55e64205572b08fd45d,"Background Faces play a key role in signaling social cues such as signals of trustworthiness. Although several studies identify the amygdala as a core brain region in social cognition, quantitative approaches evaluating its role are scarce. Objectives This review aimed to assess the role of the amygdala in the processing of facial trustworthiness, by analyzing its amplitude BOLD response polarity to untrustworthy versus trustworthy facial signals under fMRI tasks through a Meta-analysis of effect sizes (MA). Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) analyses were also conducted. Data sources Articles were retrieved from MEDLINE, ScienceDirect and Web-of-Science in January 2016. Following the PRISMA statement guidelines, a systematic review of original research articles in English language using the search string “(face OR facial) AND (trustworthiness OR trustworthy OR untrustworthy OR trustee) AND fMRI” was conducted. Study selection and data extraction The MA concerned amygdala responses to facial trustworthiness for the contrast Untrustworthy vs. trustworthy faces, and included whole-brain and ROI studies. To prevent potential bias, results were considered even when at the single study level they did not survive correction for multiple comparisons or provided non-significant results. ALE considered whole-brain studies, using the same methodology to prevent bias. A summary of the methodological options (design and analysis) described in the articles was finally used to get further insight into the characteristics of the studies and to perform a subgroup analysis. Data were extracted by two authors and checked independently. Data synthesis Twenty fMRI studies were considered for systematic review. An MA of effect sizes with 11 articles (12 studies) showed high heterogeneity between studies [Q(11) = 265.68, p < .0001; I2 = 95.86%, 94.20% to 97.05%, with 95% confidence interval, CI]. Random effects analysis [RE(183) = 0.851, .422 to .969, 95% CI] supported the evidence that the (right) amygdala responds preferentially to untrustworthy faces. Moreover, two ALE analyses performed with 6 articles (7 studies) identified the amygdala, insula and medial dorsal nuclei of thalamus as structures with negative correlation with trustworthiness. Six articles/studies showed that posterior cingulate and medial frontal gyrus present positive correlations with increasing facial trustworthiness levels. Significant effects considering subgroup analysis based on methodological criteria were found for experiments using spatial smoothing, categorization of trustworthiness in 2 or 3 categories and paradigms which involve both explicit and implicit tasks. Limitations Significant heterogeneity between studies was found in MA, which might have arisen from inclusion of studies with smaller sample sizes and differences in methodological options. Studies using ROI analysis / small volume correction methods were more often devoted specifically to the amygdala region, with some results reporting uncorrected p-values based on mainly clinical a priori evidence of amygdala involvement in these processes. Nevertheless, we did not find significant evidence for publication bias. Conclusions and implications of key findings Our results support the role of amygdala in facial trustworthiness judgment, emphasizing its predominant role during processing of negative social signals in (untrustworthy) faces. This systematic review suggests that little consistency exists among studies’ methodology, and that larger sample sizes should be preferred.","[{'authorId': '153443310', 'name': 'S.

I have had a great deal of help and feedback from many people in writing this book. Among the many scholars and friends I am indebted to are also would like to express my thanks to those scholars whose work has stimulated my own thinking in the early stages of the research reported on here: John Upshur, Leonard Newmark, and S. Pit Corder all recognized the reality of language ""acquisition"" in the adult long before I did. I would also like the thank Introduction This book is concerned with what has been called the ""Monitor Theory"" of adult second language acquisition. Monitor Theory hypothesizes that adults have two independent systems for developing ability in second languages, subconscious language acquisition and conscious language learning, and that these systems are interrelated in a definite way: subconscious acquisition appears to be far more important. The introduction is devoted to a brief statement of the theory and its implications for different aspects of second language acquisitions theory and practice. We define acquisition and learning, and present the Monitor Model for adult second language performance. Following this, brief summaries of research results in various areas of second language acquisition serve as both an overview of Monitor Theory research over the last few years and as introduction to the essays that follow. Language acquisition is very similar to the process children use in acquiring first and second languages. It requires meaningful interaction in the target language-natural communication-in which speakers are concerned not with the form of their utterances but with the messages they are conveying and understanding. Error correction and explicit teaching of rules are not relevant to language acquisition but caretakers and native speakers can modify their utterances addressed to acquirers to help them understand, and these modifications are thought to help the acquisition process (Snow and Ferguson, 1977). It has been hypothesized that there is a fairly stable order of acquisition of structures in language acquisition, that is, one can see clear 1 similarities across acquirers as to which structures tend to be acquired early and which tend to be acquired late (Brown, 1973; Dulay and Burt, 1975). Acquirers need not have a conscious awareness of the ""rules"" they possess, and may self-correct only on the basis of …","[{'authorId': '3374726', 'name': 'S.

As our group examines this question in the context of emotional touch between a person and a furry social robot, we require sensors designed to detect and recognize subtle, nuanced touches. To this end, we demonstrate a new type of sensor based on conductive fur, which is sensitive to movements unavailable to conventional pressure sensors. The sensor captures motion by measuring changing current as the fur's conductive threads connect and disconnect during touch interaction. We then use machine learning to classify gestures from this time series. An informal evaluation with seven participants found 82% recognition of a 3-gesture set, showing promise for this approach to gesture recognition, and opening a path to emotionally intelligent touch sensing.","[{'authorId': '37560821', 'name': 'Anna Flagg'}, {'authorId': '145721392', 'name': 'Diane Tam'}, {'authorId': '1796517', 'name': 'Karon E Maclean'}, {'authorId': '34473053', 'name': 'R.

Likewise, we found support for job resources such as knowledge, autonomy, and a supportive environment motivating employees and positively relating to engagement. Job demands were found to hinder an employee with a negative relationship to engagement, whereas job resources were found to negatively relate to burnout. Finally, we found that burnout was negatively related to working safely but that engagement motivated employees and was positively related to working safely.

Given that a core feature of BPD is affective instability, which is characterized by emotional hyperreactivity and deficits in emotion regulation, it seems conceivable that short-lasting emotional distress might exert temporary detrimental effects on cognitive performance. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how task-irrelevant emotional stimuli (fearful faces) affect performance and fronto-limbic neural activity patterns during attention-demanding cognitive processing in 16 female, unmedicated BPD patients relative to 24 age-matched healthy controls. In a modified flanker task, emotionally negative, socially salient pictures (fearful vs. neutral faces) were presented as distracters in the background. Patients, but not controls, showed an atypical response pattern of the right amygdala with increased activation during emotional interference in the (difficult) incongruent flanker condition, but emotion-related amygdala deactivation in the congruent condition. A direct comparison of the emotional conditions between the two groups revealed that the strongest diagnosis-related differences could be observed in the dorsal and, to a lesser extent, also in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (dACC, rACC) where patients exhibited an increased neural response to emotional relative to neutral distracters. Moreover, in the incongruent condition, both the dACC and rACC fMRI responses during emotional interference were negatively correlated with trait anxiety in the patients, but not in the healthy controls. As higher trait anxiety was also associated with longer reaction times (RTs) in the BPD patients, we suggest that in BPD patients the ACC might mediate compensatory cognitive processes during emotional interference and that such neurocognitive compensation that can be adversely affected by high levels of anxiety.","[{'authorId': '38295126', 'name': 'Jana Holtmann'}, {'authorId': '4171421', 'name': 'Maike C.

The current study compared two perspectives of emotional labor as predictors of burnout beyond the effects of negative affectivity: job-focused emotional labor (work demands regarding emotion expression) and employee-focused emotional labor (regulation of feelings and emotional expression). Significant differences existed in the emotional demands reported by five occupational groupings. The use of surface-level emotional labor, or faking, predicted depersonalization beyond the work demands. Perceiving the demand to display positive emotions and using deep-level regulation were associated with a heightened sense of personal accomplishment, suggesting positive benefits to this aspect of work. These findings suggest new antecedents of employee burnout and clarify the emotional labor literature by comparing different conceptualizations of this concept.","[{'authorId': '3152475', 'name': 'C.

In contrast, high metabolic activity in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex may be predictive of poor outcomes to both medication and psychotherapy, suggesting that nonstandard treatments may be pursued earlier in the treatment course. Although these findings will require replication before clinical adoption, they provide preliminary support for the concept that brain states can be measured and applied to the selection of a specific treatment most likely to be beneficial for an individual patient.","[{'authorId': '3182740', 'name': 'B.

a8489d4f84daaadb06c60bc00b1cc49b49afd1e7,"Individual variation in physiological responsiveness to stress mediates risk for mental illness and is influenced by both experiential and genetic factors. Common polymorphisms in the human gene for FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5), which is involved in transcriptional regulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, have been shown to interact with childhood abuse and trauma to predict stress‐related psychopathology. In the current study, we examined if such gene–environment interaction effects may be related to variability in the threat‐related reactivity of the amygdala, which plays a critical role in mediating physiological and behavioral adaptations to stress including modulation of the HPA axis. To this end, 139 healthy Caucasian youth completed a blood oxygen level‐dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging probe of amygdala reactivity and self‐report assessments of emotional neglect (EN) and other forms of maltreatment. These individuals were genotyped for 6 FKBP5 polymorphisms (rs7748266, rs1360780, rs9296158, rs3800373, rs9470080 and rs9394309) previously associated with psychopathology and/or HPA axis function. Interactions between each SNP and EN emerged such that risk alleles predicted relatively increased dorsal amygdala reactivity in the context of higher EN, even after correcting for multiple testing. Two different haplotype analyses confirmed this relationship as haplotypes with risk alleles also exhibited increased amygdala reactivity in the context of higher EN. Our results suggest that increased threat‐related amygdala reactivity may represent a mechanism linking psychopathology to interactions between common genetic variants affecting HPA axis function and childhood trauma.","[{'authorId': '2234165848', 'name': 'Michael G.

One explores failures encountered in a limited amount of time in a real crisis (World Trade Center rescue response). Another covers regular use of 13 robots over two years. The remaining eight studies are field tests of robots performed by the Test and Evaluation Coordination Office at Fort Leonard Wood. A novel taxonomy of UGV failures is presented which categorizes failures based on the cause (physical or human), its impact, and its repairability. Important statistics are derived and illustrative examples of physical failures are examined using this taxonomy. Reliability in field environments is low, between 6 and 20 hours mean time between failures. For example, during the PANTHER study (F. Cook, 1997) 35 failures occurred in 32 days. The primary cause varies: one study showed 50% of failures caused by effectors; another study showed 54% of failures occurred in the control system. Common causes are: unstable control systems, platforms designed for a narrow range of conditions, limited wireless communication range, and insufficient bandwidth for video-based feedback.","[{'authorId': '152389028', 'name': 'Jennifer Carlson'}, {'authorId': '1789429', 'name': 'R.

Beginning at age 1;2, mothers kept a diary of children's words. Diary entries were discussed during phone calls to the home every 2½ weeks. A chronological record of nouns and other word classes was coded from the diary records. Thirteen children evidenced a prolonged period of up to three months during which rate of acquisition markedly increased. Almost threequarters of the words learned during this period were nouns. Five children evidenced more gradual word-learning, and acquired a balance of nouns and other word classes. These results suggest that the terms ‘vocabulary spurt’ and ‘naming explosion’ best describe children who focus their early linguistic efforts on a single strategy: learning names for things. Other children may attempt to encode a broad range of experience with a more varied lexicon, a strategy that results in more gradual lexical growth.","[{'authorId': '118414325', 'name': 'Beverly A.

Because of concerns over self-report measurement, there have been recent calls to collect ratings of employees' CWB from their supervisors or coworkers (i.e., other-raters) as alternatives or supplements to self-ratings. However, little is still known about the degree to which other-ratings of CWB capture unique and valid incremental variance beyond self-report CWB. The present meta-analysis investigates a number of key issues regarding the incremental contribution of other-reports of CWB. First, self- and other-ratings of CWB were moderately to strongly correlated with each other. Second, with some notable exceptions, self- and other-report CWB exhibited very similar patterns and magnitudes of relationships with a set of common correlates. Third, self-raters reported engaging in more CWB than other-raters reported them engaging in, suggesting other-ratings capture a narrower subset of CWBs. Fourth, other-report CWB generally accounted for little incremental variance in the common correlates beyond self-report CWB.

Subjects were 61 kindergarten and first-grade white, middle-class children and their parents. Parent and child expressiveness were assessed in a laboratory ring-toss game designed to elicit a range of emotional responses. Parent expressiveness in the home was also assessed with Halberstadt's Family Expressiveness Questionnaire. The questionnaire, completed by both mother and father, assesses a range of emotions in a variety of settings typical of many families, and consists of items tapping both positive and negative expressiveness. Children were interviewed about their understanding of emotions across a broad range of areas. Results indicated that maternal expressiveness (home) and paternal expressiveness (home and laboratory) but not children's expressiveness with parents were associated with children's peer relations. Although children's understanding of emotions was generally not associated with family expressiveness, understanding predicted children's peer relations. In addition, children's understanding influenced the links between maternal expressiveness in the home and peer relations and between paternal expressiveness in the laboratory and peer relations. This pattern of results underscores the importance of the emotional climate of the family for the development of children's social relations with peers.","[{'authorId': '35669149', 'name': 'J.

As a way to ensure that students with disabilities or other special needs have access to the same curriculum as other students and the opportunity to succeed in the general education setting, co-teaching occurs when two professionals, typically a general education teacher and a special education teacher or another specialist, partner in delivering instruction. Although the research base on co-teaching is still emerging, it suggests that co-teaching is far more complex to effectively implement than it might seem at first consideration.

Heart rate variability (HRV) reflects the complexity of the heart-brain two-way dynamic interactions. HRV entropy analysis quantifies the unpredictability and complexity of the heart rate beats intervals. We here investigate the complexity index (CI), a score of HRV complexity by aggregating the non-linear multi-scale entropies over a range of time scales, and its discriminative power in chronic patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state (MCS), and its relation to brain functional connectivity. Methods: We investigated the CI in short (CIs) and long (CIl) time scales in 14 UWS and 16 MCS sedated. CI for MCS and UWS groups were compared using a Mann-Whitney exact test. Spearman's correlation tests were conducted between the Coma Recovery Scale-revised (CRS-R) and both CI. Discriminative power of both CI was assessed with One-R machine learning model. Correlation between CI and brain connectivity (detected with functional magnetic resonance imagery using seed-based and hypothesis-free intrinsic connectivity) was investigated using a linear regression in a subgroup of 10 UWS and 11 MCS patients with sufficient image quality. Results: Higher CIs and CIl values were observed in MCS compared to UWS. Positive correlations were found between CRS-R and both CI. The One-R classifier selected CIl as the best discriminator between UWS and MCS with 90% accuracy, 7% false positive and 13% false negative rates after a 10-fold cross-validation test. Positive correlations were observed between both CI and the recovery of functional connectivity of brain areas belonging to the central autonomic networks (CAN). Conclusion: CI of MCS compared to UWS patients has high discriminative power and low false negative rate at one third of the estimated human assessors' misdiagnosis, providing an easy, inexpensive and non-invasive diagnostic tool. CI reflects functional connectivity changes in the CAN, suggesting that CI can provide an indirect way to screen and monitor connectivity changes in this neural system. Future studies should assess the extent of CI's predictive power in a larger cohort of patients and prognostic power in acute patients.","[{'authorId': '1903176', 'name': 'F.

We used a human functional neuroimaging approach to ask how affect-, value-, and regulation-related brain systems interact to predict effects of graphic anti-smoking messages for individual smokers (both males and females) and within a population-level messaging campaign. Results indicated that increased activity in the amygdala, a region involved in affective reactivity, predicted both personal quit intentions and population-level information-seeking and this was mediated by activity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a region involved in computing an integrative value signal. Further, the predictive value of these regions was moderated by expression of a meta-analytically defined brain pattern indexing emotion regulation. That is, amygdala and vmPFC activity strongly tracked with population behavior only when participants showed low recruitment of this brain pattern, which consists of regions involved in goal-driven regulation of affective responses. Overall, these findings suggest that affective and value-related brain responses can predict the success of persuasive messages and that neural mechanisms of emotion regulation can shape these responses, moderating the extent to which they track with population-level message impact.

Pour cause de ce groupe démographique croissant, la démence de plus en plus (le plus souvent causée par la maladie d’Alzheimer) exercera un impact significatif sur notre communauté vieillissante et ses soignants. La démence est associée à des comportements difficiles tels que l’agitation, l’errance et l’agression. Les prestataires de soins doivent trouver des stratégies novatrices afin de faciliter la qualité de vie pour cette population; d’ailleurs, de telles stratégies doivent valoriser l’individu. Les robots socialement engagés – conçu spécifiquement à la communication et aux fins thérapeutiques – fournir un moyen d’atteindre cet objectif. Cet article décrit une étude dans laquelle Paro (un bébé phoque robotique) a été utilisé dans le cadre d’un programme de formation d’été pour étudiants. Les conclusions préliminaires suggèrent que l’integration des robots socialement engagés peuvent se révéler comme utiles cliniquement en milieux de soins de longue durée. ABSTRACT In 2010, approximately 500,000 Canadians suffered from a dementia-related illness. The number of sufferers is estimated to double in about 25 years. Due to this growing demographic, dementia (most frequently caused by Alzheimer’s disease) will increasingly have a significant impact on our aging community and their caregivers. Dementia is associated with challenging behaviours such as agitation, wandering, and aggression. Care providers must find innovative strategies that facilitate the quality of life for this population; moreover, such strategies must value the individual person. Social commitment robots – designed specifically with communication and therapeutic purposes – provide one means towards attaining this goal. This paper describes a study in which Paro (a robotic baby harp seal) was used as part of a summer training program for students. Preliminary conclusions suggest that the integration of social commitment robots may be clinically valuable for older, agitated persons living with dementia in long-term care settings.","[{'authorId': '2745700', 'name': 'K.

An overview of basic concepts of information consensus in networks and methods of convergence and performance analysis for the algorithms are provided. Our analysis framework is based on tools from matrix theory, algebraic graph theory, and control theory. We discuss the connections between consensus problems in networked dynamic systems and diverse applications including synchronization of coupled oscillators, flocking, formation control, fast consensus in small-world networks, Markov processes and gossip-based algorithms, load balancing in networks, rendezvous in space, distributed sensor fusion in sensor networks, and belief propagation.

ab2a2c436fc0c43d069749154e32cbcccae7ee2a,"Over the past 30 years, conservation of resources (COR) theory has become one of the most widely cited theories in organizational psychology and organizational behavior. COR theory has been adopted across the many areas of the stress spectrum, from burnout to traumatic stress. Further attesting to the theory's centrality, COR theory is largely the basis for the more work-specific leading theory of organizational stress, namely the job demands-resources model. One of the major advantages of COR theory is its ability to make a wide range of specific hypotheses that are much broader than those offered by theories that focus on a single central resource, such as control, or that speak about resources in general. In this article, we will revisit the principles and corollaries of COR theory that inform those more specific hypotheses and will review research in organizational behavior that has relied on the theory.","[{'authorId': '3475315', 'name': 'S.

Two hundred and fifty effects of the experimental induction of positive, elated and negative, depressed mood in adult, non-clinical samples were integrated. Effect sizes were generally larger for negative than for positive mood inductions. The presentation of a film or story turned out to be most effective in inducing both positive and negative mood states. The effects are especially large when subjects are explicitly instructed to enter the specified mood state. For elated mood, all other MIPs yielded considerably lower effectiveness scores. For the induction of negative mood states, Imagination, Velten, Music, Social Interaction and Feedback MIPs were about as effective as the Film/Story MIP without instruction. Induction effects covaried with several study characteristics. Effects tend to be smaller when demand characteristics are controlled or subjects are not informed about the purpose of the experiment. For behavioural measures, effects are smaller than for self-reports but still larger than zero. Hence, the effects of MIPs can be partly, but not fully due to demand effects.","[{'authorId': '30517729', 'name': 'R. Westermann'}, {'authorId': '2068262589', 'name': 'K.

Although normally conceived as a property of communities, the reciprocal relationship between community involvement and trust in others is a demonstration of social capital in individual behavior and attitudes. Hypotheses: Variation in social capital can be explained by citizens' psychological involvement with their communities, cognitive abilities, economic resources, and general life satisfaction. This variation affects citizens' confidence in national institutions, beyond specific controls for measures of actual performance. Methods: We analyze the pooled General Social Surveys from 1972 to 1994 in a latent variables framework incorporating aggregate contextual data. Results: Civic engagement and interpersonal trust are in a tight reciprocal relationship, where the connection is stronger from participation to interpersonal trust, rather than the reverse.","[{'authorId': '145285845', 'name': 'John M.

Although emotion regulation and eating regulation problems have both been linked to obesity in previous studies, there is little research examining the link between the two, particularly among children. Methods: A total of 782 rural second graders (49% girls, 20% American Indian) were followed longitudinally through third grade. During both data collection points, children participated in face-to-face interviews at school using the Children's Emotion Management Scales and the revised Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Results: Correlational analyses revealed that children's emotion regulation was significantly related to both external and emotional eating within and across grades, with reactivity appearing to be more consistently related to eating regulation than was inhibition. Regression analyses showed that second to third grade increases in external and emotional eating were predicted by increases in reactivity to anger and reactivity to worry. Conclusions: Given the established link in previous research between poor behavioral regulation and obesity in children, findings from this study linking child emotional reactivity and emotional and external eating (both forms of behavior dysregulation) are important in informing prevention and treatment programs. Based on these findings, targeting child emotion regulation in addition to behavior regulation skills as part of prevention and intervention programs may improve program effectiveness.","[{'authorId': '4253981', 'name': 'Amanda W Harrist'}, {'authorId': '1398301817', 'name': 'L.

ab8eae5f35e1eb60d48e1588163f38c0d798c9e0,"Abstract. Although not trained as treatment providers, teachers are increasingly faced with students who present challenging behavioral issues that require intervention. Teachers often resort to reactive and punitive strategies that have many negative side effects and drawbacks because they lack specific training in managing problem behavior in the classroom. Functional analysis and assessment approaches are commonly recommended by clinical researchers and have been demonstrated effective for managing problem behavior, but are sometimes impractical for regular classroom use. In this article, we propose a “keystone” approach to classroom management that may meet the clinical needs of children with challenging behavior while potentially serving as a more practical classroom alternative to commonly recommended strategies. With this approach, teachers are taught to focus on a circumscribed set of skills that have the potential to produce widespread improvement in child outcomes and render problem behavior unnecessary. Empirical support for individual components of this approach is discussed.","[{'authorId': '32619422', 'name': 'J.

We report the results from our experimental study in which the robot approaches 42 individuals. Twenty-nine of them interacted with the robot, while the others either ignored it or avoided any interaction with it. The robot displayed two types of behavior (i.e., promotion or prevention).

However, stimulus materials across—and even within—these three domains of research have varied considerably. Thus, integrative conclusions remain elusive. Moreover, concerns have been raised that the movements selected for such stimuli are qualitatively too different from the actual art form dance, potentially introducing noise in the data. We propose a library of dance stimuli which responds to the stimuli requirements and design criteria of these three areas of research, while at the same time respecting a dance art–historical perspective, offering greater ecological validity as compared with previous dance stimulus sets. The stimuli are 5–6 s long video clips, selected from genuine ballet performances. Following a number of coding experiments, the resulting stimulus library comprises 203 ballet dance stimuli coded in (i) 25 qualitative and quantitative movement variables; (ii) affective valence and arousal; and (iii) the aesthetic qualities beauty, liking, and interest.

The present study tests the efficacy of a brief experiential training approach used to teach MI to child welfare social work students. We hypothesized that students exposed to the experimental training would demonstrate more MI adherent behaviors, experience less decay in skills at follow-up, and report higher levels of self-efficacy and positive attitude toward using MI. Method: Using a randomized controlled trial design, 54 students were assigned to either live supervision (LS) training with standardized clients (SC) or teaching-as-usual (TAU) online self-study. Students were assessed at 4 time points through self-reports and SC interviews. Audiotapes of interviews were coded using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity coding system to determine MI skills, adherent behaviors, and proficiency level. Results: No significant demographic differences were found between groups. The LS group demonstrated overall positive change across time and consistent improvement trends on MI skills. Although no statistical difference existed between groups on baseline proficiency levels, at the 5-month follow-up, a higher percentage of the LS group had maintained or improved compared with the TAU group, suggesting overall, less decay over time. No differences were found between groups or over time on self-efficacy or empathy, whereas self-reported attitudes towards MI improved in both groups over time. Conclusions: Results indicate LS is effective in teaching early stages of MI skills and is a promising training approach for social work students.

acacb7dd844da70807e03c5889ef5afb98844895,"This article proposes that binge eating is motivated by a desire to escape from self-awareness. Binge eaters suffer from high standards and expectations, especially an acute sensitivity to the difficult (perceived) demands of others. When they fall short of these standards, they develop an aversive pattern of high self-awareness, characterized by unflattering views of self and concern over how they are perceived by others. These aversive self-perceptions are accompanied by emotional distress, which often includes anxiety and depression. To escape from this unpleasant state, binge eaters attempt the cognitive response of narrowing attention to the immediate stimulus environment and avoiding broadly meaningful thought. This narrowing of attention disengages normal inhibitions against eating and fosters an uncritical acceptance of irrational beliefs and thoughts. The escape model is capable of integrating much of the available evidence about binge eating.","[{'authorId': '2681278', 'name': 'T. Heatherton'}, {'authorId': '5142080', 'name': 'R.

The findings were consistent with prior literature suggesting that Head Start children demonstrate higher levels of physical aggression compared to community child care children, whereas community child care children had higher levels of verbal forms of aggression compared to Head Start children. However, Head Start and community child care samples did not differ in the person prevalence of aggression. Across both samples and a range of types of aggressive behavior, boys exhibited aggressive behaviors more frequently than girls. The results of factor analyses on the aggression items with the Head Start sample suggest that a greater number of aggressive behaviors constitute the two aggression (i.e., antisocial, relational) factors than the number of behaviors that uniquely load on these factors for the normative sample. This suggests that aggression may be more complex and multifaceted in a concentrated sample of preschoolers from low-income backgrounds. Results are discussed in terms of (a) the multidimensional nature of aggression during the preschool years and (b) the need for increased mental health services within Head Start and community child care programs for aggressive preschoolers.","[{'authorId': '3742836', 'name': 'J.

From this it is deduced that individuals who show good perception of heart activity tend to exhibit higher levels of a momentarily experienced emotion (in this case anxiety) and to score higher on the personality trait “Emotional Lability.” The aspect of cardiac awareness considered here is perception of heart beats. Subjects were instructed to count heart beats (only by concentrating on their body but not by taking their pulse) during a signalled time interval and the reported number of beats was then compared to the actual number of beats as extracted from the EKG. Additionally, skin conductance and respiration were recorded. During the experimental task (i.e., counting heart beats) increases in heart rate, respiration rate and number of spontaneous fluctuations in skin conductance were recorded. Groups of good and poor perceivers were formed on the basis of accuracy on the perception task. The two groups did not differ in heart rate; however, in State Anxiety and Emotional Lability, the group of good perceivers had significantly higher scores. The importance of visceroception for emotional experience is pointed out and the relevance for clinical psychology is discussed.","[{'authorId': '5947215', 'name': 'R.

However, not all presenters take the opportunity to engage in such rehearsal, due to time constraints, availability of listeners who can provide constructive feedback, or public speaking anxiety. We present RoboCOP, an automated anthropomorphic robot head that acts as a coach to provide spoken feedback during presentation rehearsals at both the individual slide and overall presentation level. The robot offers conversational coaching on three key aspects of presentations: speech quality, content coverage, and audience orientation. The design of the feedback strategies was informed by findings from an exploratory study with academic professionals who were experienced in mentoring students on their presentations. In a within-subjects study comparing RoboCOP to visual feedback and spoken feedback without a robot, the robotic coach was shown to lead to significant improvement in the overall experience of presenters. Results of a second within-subjects evaluation study comparing RoboCOP with existing rehearsal practices show that our system creates a natural, interactive, and motivating rehearsal environment that leads to improved presentation quality.","[{'authorId': '144902406', 'name': 'H.

We present the 9-item ATI scale, an economical unidimensional scale that assesses ATI as an interaction style rooted in the construct need for cognition (NFC). Results of multiple studies (n > 1500) showed that the scale achieves good to excellent reliability, exhibits expected moderate to high correlations with geekism, technology enthusiasm, NFC, self-reported success in technical problem-solving and technical system learning success, and also with usage of technical systems. Further, correlations of ATI with the Big Five personality dimensions were weak at most.

However, a large number of mobile robots currently in use for applications such as law enforcement, military, and search and rescue are not anthropomorphic, do not have any method of projecting facial expressions, and cannot be reengineered explicitly to support affective expression. This poses significant challenges in how these appearance-constrained robots will support naturalistic human-robot interaction. Fincannon et al. provides an example of how rescue workers conducting breaching expected a small tank-like robot to follow social conventions despite the robots non-anthropomorphic appearance [9]. Work by Murphy et al. [13] in using man-packable robots to act as a surrogate presence for doctors tending to trapped victims, identifies how the robot will interact with the victim as one of the four major open research issues. They noted that the robots operating within 3 meters of the simulated victims were perceived as “creepy” and not reassuring. In each of these cases, the robots were operating in highly confined spaces and the additions of faces or other devices might interfere with the critical attribute of mobility. Our work focuses on affective expression in non-anthropomorphic and appearanceconstrained robots for humanrobot interactions occurring within three meters of each other. Appearance-constrained robots are not engineered to be anthropomorphic and do not have the ability to exhibit facial expressions.

We summarize active social assistive research projects and classify them by target populations, application domains, and interaction methods. While distinguishing these from socially interactive robotics endeavors, we discuss challenges and opportunities that are specific to the growing field of socially assistive robotics.","[{'authorId': '1390033049', 'name': 'David Feil-Seifer'}, {'authorId': '1742183', 'name': 'M.

To evaluate the association between quality-of-life (QOL) impairment as reported by patients and QOL impairment as judged by nurses or physicians, with and without consideration of spiritual well-being (SWB).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
A total of 163 patients with advanced cancer were enrolled onto a therapeutic trial, and cross-sectional data were derived from clinical and demographic questionnaires obtained at baseline, including assessment of patient QOL and SWB. Clinicians rated the QOL impairment of their patients as mild, moderate, or severe. Clinician-estimated QOL impairment and patient-derived QOL categories were compared. Correlation coefficients were estimated to associate QOL scores using different instruments. The analysis of variance method was used to compare Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General scores on categorical variables.


RESULTS
There was no significant association between self-assessment scores and marital status, education level, performance status, or predicted life expectancy. However, a strong relationship between SWB and QOL was noted (P <.0001). Clinician-estimated QOL impairment matched the level of patient-derived QOL correctly in approximately 60% of cases, with only slight variation depending on the method of categorizing patient-derived QOL scores. The accuracy of clinician estimates was not associated with the level of SWB. Interestingly, a subset analysis of the inaccurate estimates revealed an association between lower SWB and clinician underestimation of QOL impairment (P =.0025).


CONCLUSION
Clinician estimates of QOL impairment were accurate in more than 60% of patients. SWB is strongly associated with QOL, but it is not associated with the overall accuracy of clinicians' judgments about QOL impairment.","[{'authorId': '17499652', 'name': 'M.

To understand trends in electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition system research and to provide practitioners and researchers with insights into and future directions for emotion recognition systems, this study set out to review published articles on emotion detection, recognition, and classification. The study also reviews current and future trends and discusses how these trends may impact researchers and practitioners alike. We reviewed 285 articles, of which 160 were refereed journal articles that were published since the inception of affective computing research. The articles were classified based on a scheme consisting of two categories: research orientation and domains/applications. Our results show considerable growth of EEG-based emotion detection journal publications. This growth reflects an increased research interest in EEG-based emotion detection as a salient and legitimate research area.

In human collaboration, emotion can serve as an evaluation of events and as a communicative cue for people to express and perceive each other’s internal states. Thus, we are motivated to investigate the influence of robots’ emotional expressions on human-robot collaboration. In particular, we conducted experiments in which a participant interacted with two Cozmo robots in a collaborative game. We found that when the robots exhibited emotional expressions, participants were more likely to collaborate with them and achieved task success in shorter time. Moreover, participants perceived emotional robots more positively and reported to have a more enjoyable experience interacting with them.

Recent works show that the performance of a FER algorithm can be improved by disentangling the expression information from identity features. In this paper, we present Transfer-based Expression Recognition Generative Adversarial Network (TER-G AN) that combines the effectiveness of a novel feature disentanglement technique with the concept of identity-invariant expression representation learning for FER. More specifically, TER-GAN learns a disentangled expression representation by extracting expression features from one image and transferring the expression information to the identity of another image. To improve the feature disentanglement process and to learn an identity-invariant expression representation, we introduce a novel expression consistency loss and an identity consistency loss that exploit expression and identity information from both real and synthetic images. We evaluated the performance of our proposed facial expression recognition technique by employing four public facial expression databases, CK+, Oulu-CASIA, MMI, BU-3DFE.

In much anthropological and sociological writings, things have mainly been considered in two ways: either as commodities or as gifts. Correspondingly, people's relationships to things and to other people seem to fall in two broad categories, often regarded as mutually exclusive: either as impersonal, economic or market relationships with strangers, or as personal gift relationships with intimates, friends or relatives. The `social life of things', however, is more varied. Drawing on Alan Page Fiske's theory of the four fundamental models of human relationship, four ways in which people may relate to each other and to things are distinguished; these models are applied to empirical data from a study on the giving of gifts in the Netherlands. Complications may occur when the parties to the transaction do not share the same frame of mind with respect to each other and to the things that are being transferred. Things may have conflicting social lives.","[{'authorId': '6008632', 'name': 'A. Komter'}]",38.0,,34.0,"Heirlooms, Nikes and Bribes: Towards a Sociology of Things",2001.0
b149e44bcd38dfc6b21f0ee1007d4674fbd27e66,"Abstract The longitudinal associations between maternal parenting behavior and toddler risk with children's emotional and social competence were examined during the transition to kindergarten, in a sample of 253 children. Toddler risk was characterized by early externalizing behavior and poor emotion regulation skills. Given that we were interested in the multiple pathways that may result in emotional and social competence, we examined the interactions among maternal parenting behavior and toddler risk. There were some significant interactions, although the pattern of results was not consistent across all competence outcomes. Maternal parenting behavior was not directly associated with children's emotional and social competence. In some instances, maternal control has differential implications for children's emotional and social competence dependent upon the child's level of early risk and maternal positive parenting. Specifically, maternal control tended to be more detrimental for children's emotional competence during the transition to kindergarten, when children exhibit higher levels of risk. Overall, it appears that there are multiple developmental pathways, depending on child and maternal characteristics that lead to early emotional and social competence.","[{'authorId': '6836855', 'name': 'Alysia Y.

The effect of positive mood states was measured in two different cognitive domains: semantic search (remote associates task) and visual selective attention (Eriksen flanker task). In the conceptual domain, positive affect enhanced access to remote associates, suggesting an increase in the scope of semantic access. In the visuospatial domain, positive affect impaired visual selective attention by increasing processing of spatially adjacent flanking distractors, suggesting an increase in the scope of visuospatial attention. During positive states, individual differences in enhanced semantic access were correlated with the degree of impaired visual selective attention. These findings demonstrate that positive states, by loosening the reins on inhibitory control, result in a fundamental change in the breadth of attentional allocation to both external visual and internal conceptual space.","[{'authorId': '47921663', 'name': 'G.

One's spirituality or religious beliefs and practices may have a profound impact on how the individual copes with the suffering that so often accompanies advanced disease. Several previous studies suggest that negative religious coping can significantly affect health outcomes.


OBJECTIVE
The primary aim of this study was to explore the relationship between spirituality, religious coping, and symptoms of distress among a group of inpatients referred to the palliative care consult service.


DESIGN
Pilot study.


SETTING
The study was conducted in a large academic medical center with a comprehensive Palliative Care and Home Hospice Program.


MEASUREMENT
(1) National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Management Assessment Tool; (2) Pargament Brief Religious Coping Scale (Brief RCOPE); (3) Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being (FACIT-Sp); (4) Puchalski's FICA; and (5) Profile of Mood States-Short Form (POMS-SF).


RESULTS
The 31 subjects surveyed experienced moderate distress (5.8 +/- 2.7), major physical and psychosocial symptom burden, along with reduced function and significant caregiving needs. The majority (87.2%) perceived themselves to be at least somewhat spiritual, with 77.4% admitting to being at least somewhat religious. Negative religious coping (i.e., statements regarding punishment or abandonment by God) was positively associated with distress, confusion, depression, and negatively associated with physical and emotional well-being, as well as quality of life.


CONCLUSIONS
Palliative care clinicians should be alert to symptoms of spiritual distress and intervene accordingly. Future research is needed to identify optimal techniques to address negative religious coping.","[{'authorId': '50792658', 'name': 'J. Hills'}, {'authorId': '3465188', 'name': 'J.

Structure has been largely neglected to date, and the author outlines ways in which the structural organisation of self-knowledge could contribute to social anxiety. High social anxiety is associated with low clarity about the self and with more uncertainty about self-judgments.

Expanding research on betrayal aversion, this study examines the role of emotions in consumers' tendency to choose safety options that provide less overall protection in order to eliminate a very small probability of harm due to safety product betrayal. In five studies we find that betrayal aversion is reduced and safer alternatives are selected when factors that dampen the emotional response to potential betrayals are introduced or taken into account. These factors include changing the betrayal from an action to an omission (study 1), introducing positive imagery (study 2), introducing visual representations of risk (study 3), making the decision for another rather than oneself (study 4), and intuitive thinking style (study 5).","[{'authorId': '2858647', 'name': 'J.

Self-compassion entails three main components: (a) self-kindness—being kind and understanding toward oneself in instances of pain or failure rather than being harshly self-critical, (b) common humanity—perceiving one's experiences as part of the larger human experience rather than seeing them as separating and isolating, and (c) mindfulness—holding painful thoughts and feelings in balanced awareness rather than over-identifying with them. Self-compassion is an emotionally positive self-attitude that should protect against the negative consequences of self-judgment, isolation, and rumination (such as depression). Because of its non-evaluative and interconnected nature, it should also counter the tendencies towards narcissism, self-centeredness, and downward social comparison that have been associated with attempts to maintain self-esteem. The relation of self-compassion to other psychological constructs is examined, its links to psychological functioning are explored, and potential group differences in self-compassion are discussed.","[{'authorId': '2969088', 'name': 'K.

b3ac5758cd39bbe72b1e10064dedcf3f550124e8,"The worldwide prevalence of obesity has dramatically increased, mostly in children and adolescents. The Emotional Eating theoretical model has proposed that the failure in emotional regulation could represent a risk factor for establishing maladaptive overeating behavior that represents an inadequate response to negative emotions and allows increasing body-weight. This systematic review investigates the relationship between overeating and both emotional regulation and emotional intelligence in childhood and adolescence, considering both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Moreover, another goal of the review is evaluating whether emotional regulation and emotional intelligence can cause overeating behaviors. The systematic search was conducted according to the PRISMA-statement in the databases Medline, PsychArtcles, PsychInfo, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Sciences, and allows 484 records to be extracted. Twenty-six studies were selected according to inclusion (e.g., studies focused on children and adolescents without clinical conditions; groups of participants overweight or with obesity) and exclusion (e.g., studies that adopted qualitative assessment or cognitive-affective tasks to measure emotional variables; reviews, commentary, or brief reports) criteria detailed in the methods. Cross-sectional studies showed a negative association between emotional regulation and overeating behavior that was confirmed by longitudinal studies. These findings highlighted the role of maladaptive emotion regulation on overeating and being overweight. The relationship between these constructs in children and adolescents was consistent. The results indicated the complexity of this association, which would be influenced by many physiological, psychological, and social factors. These findings underline the need for further studies focused on emotion regulation in the development of overeating. They should analyze the mediation role of other variables (e.g., attachment style, peer pressure) and identify interventions to prevent and reduce worldwide overweight prevalence.","[{'authorId': '67123587', 'name': 'F.

Categories of natural objects or events, including emotions, are formed as a result of repeated experiences and become organized around prototypes (Rosch, 1978); the interrelated set of emotion categories becomes organized within an abstract-to-concrete hierarchy. At the basic level of the emotion hierarchy one finds the handful of concepts (love, joy, anger, sadness, fear, and perhaps, surprise) most useful for making everyday distinctions among emotions, and these overlap substantially with the examples mentioned most readily when people are asked to name emotions (Fehr & Russell, 1984), with the emotions children learn to name first (Bretherton & Beeghly, 1982), and with what theorists have called basic or primary emotions. This article reports two studies, one exploring the hierarchical organization of emotion concepts and one specifying the prototypes, or scripts, of five basic emotions, and it shows how the prototype approach might be used in the future to investigate the processing of information about emotional events, cross-cultural differences in emotion concepts, and the development of emotion knowledge.","[{'authorId': '4509891', 'name': 'P.

First, the age of participants studied (and labels for these age groups) is a critical design consideration. We suggest that it might be logical to reduce the reliance on convenience samples of undergraduates to represent adults in psychology and cognitive neuroscience studies, since there is substantial evidence that the brain is still developing within this age range. Second, developmental researchers are broadening their scope of inquiry by testing for non-linear effects, via increased use of longitudinal strategies or much wider age ranges and larger samples.

To examine the ability to regulate emotions in children with binge eating.


METHOD
A community sample of 60 children ages 8-13 with at least one episode of loss of control (LOC) eating during the past 3 months and a matched control group without LOC (n = 60) underwent a clinical interview (Eating Disorder Examination adapted for Children) and completed self-report questionnaires assessing emotion regulation strategies, eating pathology, and depressive symptoms.


RESULTS
Children with LOC eating made a significantly higher use of dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies (p < .01), especially for the regulation of anxiety (p < .01). Maladaptive strategies were associated with greater depressiveness (p < .001). Use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies did not differ between children with and without LOC eating.


DISCUSSION
Results document an association between LOC eating and difficulties in regulating negative emotions in children. Interventions targeting LOC eating in children should include training for coping with negative emotions.","[{'authorId': '40451266', 'name': 'J. Czaja'}, {'authorId': '3435893', 'name': 'W.

Moreover, research has not considered the intersection between neural activation to experimentally induced social exclusion and naturally occurring social adversity. This study examined an integrated social pain model of internalizing symptoms, which posits that (i) neural sensitivity in the social pain network is associated with internalizing symptoms, (ii) this linkage is more robust in youth with than without a history of social adversity, and (iii) heightened avoidance motivation serves as one pathway linking neural sensitivity and internalizing symptoms. During a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan, 47 adolescent girls (M age = 15.46 years, SD = .35) with well-characterized histories of peer victimization were exposed to social exclusion. Whole-brain analyses revealed that activation to exclusion in the social pain network was associated with internalizing symptoms. As anticipated, this linkage was stronger in chronically victimized than non-victimized girls and was partially accounted for by avoidance motivation. This research indicates the importance of integrating neural, social and psychological systems of development in efforts to elucidate risk for internalizing symptoms among adolescent girls.","[{'authorId': '3952582', 'name': 'K.

Accordingly, our aim was to identify demographic and psychological correlates of overeating regulation in a sample of university students, to facilitate greater understanding of this self‐regulatory capacity. Variables of interest included emotion regulation, mindfulness, eating pathology, age, and gender. Method Self‐report measures were completed by 312 Australian university students (68% female; M age = 22 years). Results Exploratory factor analyses indicated three overeating regulation subscales: (1) general overeating regulation (general ability to resist overeating); (2) discomfort overeating dysregulation (inability to resist overeating when experiencing physical pain or negative emotions); and (3) leisure overeating dysregulation (inability to resist overeating in leisure contexts and/or in the presence of high calorie foods). Overeating regulation was not associated with age; though young men reported better general overeating regulation capacity than young women. Individuals reporting greater ability to regulate overeating (across all three subscales) reported better emotion regulation and mindfulness, and less eating pathology. Multiple regression analyses showed that the emotion regulation subscales of goal‐directedness, emotional awareness, and impulse control, and the mindfulness subscales of acting with awareness and non‐reactivity to inner experience were unique correlates of the overeating regulation subscales. Conclusions This study offers greater understanding about the different facets of overeating regulation, and highlights the relevance of emotion regulation and mindfulness in this adaptive eating practise.","[{'authorId': '51028408', 'name': 'Jessica L.

Such robots are in urgent need of finding effective ways to present themselves and communicate their intentions due to a lack of social expressivity. We particularly focus on the expression of attractiveness and hostility because a robot would need to be able to attract or keep away human users in practical human-robot interaction (HRI) scenarios. In this work, we installed an LED lighting system on a Roomba robot and conducted a series of two experiments. We first worked through a structured approach to determine the best light expression designs for the robot to show attractiveness and hostility. This resulted in four recommended light expressions. Further, we performed a verification study to examine the effectiveness of such light expressions in a typical HRI context. On the basis of the findings, we offer design guidelines for expressive lights that HRI researchers and practitioners could readily employ.","[{'authorId': '66245274', 'name': 'Sichao Song'}, {'authorId': '1679243', 'name': 'S.

In two studies, we asked viewers to rate the same female faces with or without color cosmetics, and we varied the style of makeup from minimal (natural), to moderate (professional), to dramatic (glamorous). Each look provided increasing luminance contrast between the facial features and surrounding skin. Faces were shown for 250 ms or for unlimited inspection time, and subjects rated them for attractiveness, competence, likeability and trustworthiness. At 250 ms, cosmetics had significant positive effects on all outcomes. Length of inspection time did not change the effect for competence or attractiveness. However, with longer inspection time, the effect of cosmetics on likability and trust varied by specific makeup looks, indicating that cosmetics could impact automatic and deliberative judgments differently. The results suggest that cosmetics can create supernormal facial stimuli, and that one way they may do so is by exaggerating cues to sexual dimorphism. Our results provide evidence that judgments of facial trustworthiness and attractiveness are at least partially separable, that beauty has a significant positive effect on judgment of competence, a universal dimension of social cognition, but has a more nuanced effect on the other universal dimension of social warmth, and that the extended phenotype significantly influences perception of biologically important signals at first glance and at longer inspection.","[{'authorId': '3131885', 'name': 'N.

b5b6d87f663fcc56cd7319ea49d6baaa653ecaae,"Zusammenfassung Die menschliche Mimik ist einzigartig in ihrer Fähigkeit unseren Emotionen Ausdruck zu verleihen und diese anderen Menschen zu übermitteln. Die mimische Expression grundlegender Emotionen ist über verschiedene Kulturen hinweg sehr ähnlich und du weist auch Gemeinsamkeiten zu anderen Säugetieren auf. Dies deutet auf einen gemeinsamen genetischen Ursprung des Zusammenhangs von Mimik und Emotion. Neuere Untersuchungen zeigen aber auch kulturelle Einflüsse und Unterschiede. Die Erkennung von Emotionen aus der Mimik und auch der Prozess des mimischen Ausdrucks der eigenen Emotionen erfolgt in einem äußerst komplexen zerebralen Netzwerk. Aufgrund der Komplexität des zerebralen Verarbeitungssystems gibt es eine Vielzahl von neurologischen und psychiatrischen Erkrankungen, welche die Kopplung von Mimik und Emotionen erheblich stören können. Auch durch das Tragen von Masken wird unsere Fähigkeit zur Übermittlung und zum Erkennen von Emotionen über die Mimik eingeschränkt. Durch die Mimik lassen sich aber nicht nur „echte“ Emotionen ausdrücken, sondern auch gespielte. Damit eröffnet die Mimik die Möglichkeit sozial erwünschten Ausdruck vorzuspielen und auch Emotionen bewusst vorzutäuschen. Diese Täuschungen sind jedoch zumeist nicht perfekt und können von kurzfristigen Gesichtsbewegungen begleitet sein, die auf die tatsächlich vorhandenen Emotionen hinweisen (Mikroexpressionen). Diese Mikroexpressionen sind von nur sehr kurzer Dauer und vom Menschen häufig kaum wahrnehmbar, jedoch das ideale Anwendungsgebiet für computergestützte Analysen. Diese automatische Identifikation von Mikroexpressionen hat in den letzten Jahren nicht nur wissenschaftliche Aufmerksamkeit erfahren, sondern ihr Einsatz wird auch in sicherheitsrelevanten Bereichen getestet. Der vorliegende Artikel fasst den aktuellen Wissensstand von Mimik und Emotionen zusammen. ABSTRACT Human facial expressions are unique in their ability to express our emotions and communicate them to others. The mimic expression of basic emotions is very similar across different cultures and has also many features in common with other mammals. This suggests a common genetic origin of the association between facial expressions and emotion. However, recent studies also show cultural influences and differences. The recognition of emotions from facial expressions, as well as the process of expressing one’s emotions facially, occurs within an extremely complex cerebral network. Due to the complexity of the cerebral processing system, there are a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders that can significantly disrupt the coupling of facial expressions and emotions. Wearing masks also limits our ability to convey and recognize emotions through facial expressions. Through facial expressions, however, not only “real” emotions can be expressed, but also acted ones. Thus, facial expressions open up the possibility of faking socially desired expressions and also of consciously faking emotions. However, these pretenses are mostly imperfect and can be accompanied by short-term facial movements that indicate the emotions that are actually present (microexpressions). These microexpressions are of very short duration and often barely perceptible by humans, but they are the ideal application area for computer-aided analysis. This automatic identification of microexpressions has not only received scientific attention in recent years, but its use is also being tested in security-related areas. This article summarizes the current state of knowledge of facial expressions and emotions.","[{'authorId': '47016130', 'name': 'C. Klingner'}, {'authorId': '2149403111', 'name': 'O.

b5d7dc927a42e25624db172a95f2f01578b6ec08,"We examined the course of maternal depressive symptoms and children's attachment security at 36 months in a large sample of mother–child pairs from 10 sites across the country participating in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care (N = 1077). Maternal depressive symptoms predicted higher rates of insecure attachment. Women who reported intermittent symptoms across the first 36 months had preschoolers who were more likely to be classified as insecure C or D; women with chronic symptoms were more likely to have preschoolers who were classified as insecure D. Symptoms reported only during the first 15 months were not associated with elevated rates of later insecurity. After controlling for potentially confounding demographic variables, maternal sensitivity (observed at 6, 15, 24, and 36 months) did not meaningfully account for links between attachment security and patterns of depressive symptoms. However, the course and timing of maternal depressive symptoms interacted with maternal sensitivity to predict insecurity. Women with late, intermittent, or chronic symptoms who were also low in sensitivity were more likely to have preschoolers who were insecure, in contrast to symptomatic women who were high in sensitivity. These data have implications for understanding the combined impact of maternal depressive symptoms and maternal sensitivity on children's socioemotional development.These data were collected under the auspices of the NICHD Study of Early Child Care. Susan B. Campbell, Celia A. Brownell, and Susan J. Spieker are investigators in this multisite study. We acknowledge the generous support of the NICHD (Grants HD25420 and HD25447).

b5e43a84307ce6050a1ac52944032fd6341f64ae,"Many new applications for robots require them to work alongside people as capable members of human-robot teams. These include—in the long term—robots for homes, hospitals, and offices, but already exist in more advanced settings, such as space exploration. The work reported in this paper is part of an ongoing collaboration with NASA JSC to develop Robonaut, a humanoid robot envisioned to work with human astronauts on maintenance operations for space missions. To date, work with Robonaut has mainly investigated performing a joint task with a human in which the robot is being teleoperated. However, perceptive disorientation, sensory noise, and control delays make teleoperation cognitively exhausting even for a highly skilled operator. Control delays in long range teleoperation also make shoulder-to-shoulder teamwork difficult. These issues motivate our work to make robots collaborating with people more autonomous. Our work focuses on a scenario of a human and an autonomous humanoid robot working together shoulder-to-shoulder, sharing the workspace and the objects required to complete a task. A robotic member of such a team must be able to work towards a shared goal, and be in agreement with the human as to the sequence of actions that will be required to reach that goal, as well as dynamically adjust its plan according to the human’s actions. Human-robot collaboration of this nature is an important yet relatively unexplored kind of human-robot interaction. This paper describes our work towards building a dynamic collaborative framework enabling such an interaction. We discuss our architecture and its implementation for controlling a humanoid robot, working on a task with a human partner. Our approach stems from Joint Intention Theory, which shows that for joint action to emerge, teammates must communicate to maintain a set of shared beliefs and to coordinate their actions towards the shared plan. In addition, they must demonstrate commitment to doing their own part, to the others doing theirs, to providing mutual support, and finally—to a mutual belief as to the state of the task. We argue that to this end, the concept of task and action goals is central. We therefore present a goal-driven hierarchical task representation, and a resulting collaborative turn-taking system, implementing many of the above-mentioned requirements of a robotic teammate. Additionally, we show the implementation of relevant social skills supporting our collaborative framework. Finally, we present a demonstration of our system for collaborative execution of a hierarchical object manipulation task by a robot-human team. Our humanoid robot is able to divide the task between the participants while taking into consideration the collaborator’s actions when deciding what to do next. It is capable of asking for mutual support in the cases where it is unable to perform a certain action. To facilitate this interaction, the robot actively maintains a clear and intuitive channel of communication to synchronize goals, task states, and actions, resulting in a fluid, efficient collaboration.","[{'authorId': '145666784', 'name': 'Guy Hoffman'}, {'authorId': '1711777', 'name': 'C.

Vagal efferent fibers do not originate in a common brainstem structure. The Polyvagal Theory is introduced to explain the different functions of the two primary medullary source nuclei of the vagus: the nucleus ambiguus (NA) and the dorsal motor nucleus (DMNX). Although vagal pathways from both nuclei terminate on the sinoatrial node, it is argued that the fibers originating in NA are uniquely responsible for respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Divergent shifts in RSA and heart rate are explained by independent actions of DMNX and NA. The theory emphasizes a phylogenetic perspective and speculates that mammalian, but not reptilian, brainstem organization is characterized by a ventral vagal complex (including NA) related to processes associated with attention, motion, emotion, and communication. Various clinical disorders, such as sudden infant death syndrome and asthma, may be related to the competition between DMNX and NA.","[{'authorId': '4226466', 'name': 'S.

Patients and Methods: We investigated elderly German insurants and outpatients with chronic diseases with the SpREUK and AKU questionnaires. Results: Patients with chronic diseases relied on adaptive coping styles which refer to both external help (Trust in Medical Help, Search for Alternative Help, Trust in God’s Help) and internal powers/ virtues (Conscious and Healthy Living, Perspectives and Positive Attitudes). Reappraisal (Illness as Chance) was strongly connected with Trust in God’s Help, which was of relevance particularly for female cancer patients. Compared to patients with other chronic diseases, cancer patients were significantly more in Search for Meaningful Support, had Trust in Higher Source and a Positive Interpretation of Disease. Women with breast cancer had significantly higher interest in Search for Meaningful Support and Positive Interpretation than patients with prostate cancer. The SpR attitudes and convictions were significantly influenced by gender, SpR self-categorization, and educational level.

We examined participant survey and behavioral responses to different numbers of robots (Single or Group) with different behaviors (Social or Functional).

While some studies have found evidence for specific body movements accompanying specific emotions, others indicate that movement behavior (aside from facial expression) may be only indicative of the quantity (intensity) of emotion, but not of its quality. The study reported here is an attempt to demonstrate that body movements and postures to some degree are specific for certain emotions. A sample of 224 video takes, in which actors and actresses portrayed the emotions of elated joy, happiness, sadness, despair, fear, terror, cold anger, hot anger, disgust, contempt, shame, guilt, pride, and boredom via a scenario approach, was analyzed using coding schemata for the analysis of body movements and postures. Results indicate that some emotion-specific movement and posture characteristics seem to exist, but that for body movements differences between emotions can be partly explained by the dimension of activation. While encoder (actor) differences are rather pronounced with respect to specific movement and posture habits, these differences are largely independent from the emotion-specific differences found.

The 814 children who participated in a summer day camp, 492 of whom were maltreated and 322 of whom were nonmaltreated comparison children, were assessed by camp counselors on their internalizing and externalizing symptomatology, aggressive, withdrawn, and cooperative behavior, and on personality dimensions of ego resiliency and ego control, and were rated by peers on disruptive, aggressive, and cooperative behavior. The severity within each subtype of maltreatment and the developmental period in which each subtype occurred were examined through hierarchical regression analyses. Additionally, children with similar timing or subtype patterns were grouped to explore diversity in outcomes. Results highlighted the role of severity of emotional maltreatment in the infancy–toddlerhood period and physical abuse during the preschool period in predicting externalizing behavior and aggression. Severity of physical neglect, particularly when it occurred during the preschool period, was associated with internalizing symptomatology and withdrawn behavior. Additionally, maltreatment during the school-age period contributed significant variance after earlier maltreatment was controlled. Chronic maltreatment, especially with onset during infancy–toddlerhood or preschool periods, was linked with more maladaptive outcomes. The implications of measuring multiple dimensions for improving research in child maltreatment are discussed.","[{'authorId': '40361547', 'name': 'J. T.

To enhance human-robot interaction it is necessary to investigate and understand how end-users perceive such animate behavior. In this paper, we report an experiment to investigate how people perceived different robot embodiments in terms of animacy and intelligence. iCat and Robovie II were used as the two embodiments in this experiment. We conducted a between-subject experiment where robot type was the independent variable, and perceived animacy and intelligence of the robot were the dependent variables. Our findings suggest that a robots perceived intelligence is significantly correlated with animacy. The correlation between the intelligence and the animacy of a robot was observed to be stronger in the case of the iCat embodiment. Our results also indicate that the more animated the face of the robot, the more likely it is to attract the attention of a user.

Instead, we claim that in addition to exhaustion and cynicism, inefficacy — measured with a newly developed scale — characterizes burnout. MBI-efficacy is apparently related to work engagement, considered as the positive antithesis of burnout. We performed Structural Equation Modeling in two samples of Spanish (n=239) and Dutch (n=235) university students, and two Spanish employee samples, working in various jobs (n=342) and working with information and communication technologies (n=283). Our expectations were largely confirmed: (1) compared with efficacy beliefs inefficacy beliefs relate more strongly to the other two burnout components; (2) the alternative three-factor burnout model including inefficacy fits better to the data than the traditional model including efficacy; (3) a model with inefficacy loading on burnout and efficacy loading on engagement fits the data. It is suggested that an inefficacy scale rather than a reversed efficacy scale should be used to assess burnout in future studies.","[{'authorId': '2215744', 'name': 'W.

b85de3c440413c7e55cab160027f1f695e52429d,"Emotion regulation (ER) is a basic psychological process that has been broadly linked to psychosocial adjustment. Due to its relationship with psychosocial adjustment, a significant number of instruments have been developed to assess emotion regulation in a reliable and valid manner. Among these, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ; Gross and John, 2003) is one of the most widely used, having shown good psychometric properties with adult samples from different cultures. Studies of validation in children and adolescents are, however, scarce and have only been developed for the Australian and Portuguese populations. The aim of this study was to validate the Spanish version of the ERQ for use in adolescents and determine possible differences according to the gender and age of young people. The sample consisted of 2060 adolescents (52.1% boys). Exploratory and Confirmatory factor analysis (EFA and CFA), multi-group analysis and Two-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) were performed and the percentiles calculated. The results of the AFE and CFA corroborated the existence of two factors related to the emotion regulation strategies of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, showing acceptable internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Both factors also showed good criterion validity with personality traits, self-esteem, and social anxiety. Differences in cognitive reappraisal were found with regard to age, with younger students exhibiting the greatest mastery of this strategy. Gender differences were observed regarding the expressive suppression strategy, with boys being more likely to use this strategy than girls. A gender-age interaction effect was also observed, revealing that the use of the expressive suppression strategy did not vary by age in girls, and was more widely used by boys aged 12–14 years than those aged 15–16 years. However, we found evidence of measurement invariance across sex and age groups. The results suggest that the ERQ is a valid and reliable instrument that can be used to evaluate emotion regulation strategies in adolescents.","[{'authorId': '1405022955', 'name': 'Olga Gómez-Ortiz'}, {'authorId': '6551586', 'name': 'E.

b89cda805c2691b26b9fa3ba132f3ab953e673d4,"This study empirically examines the synergistic negative effect of two kinds of job demand on job-related affective wellbeing (JAW) and the accelerating effects of cynicism in the negative relationships between job demands and JAW using a sample of 299 employees in the Chinese banking industry. Job demands include quantitative role overload and surface acting to represent the quantitative and qualitative aspects of job demands. Cynicism is introduced as a state where one’s energy resource is lost. The results of this study show that surface acting has a negative relationship with JAW, but quantitative role overload has no relationship with JAW. High levels of quantitative role overload exacerbate the negative relationship between surface acting and JAW. Cynicism also exacerbates the negative relationship between surface acting and JAW but does not have any moderating effect in the relationship between quantitative role overload and JAW. These results are consistent with the relationships predicted by resource loss spiral and resource loss cycle. The resource loss spiral means that resource loss, caused by handling with a quantitative role overload, lessens the employee’s ability to cope with surface acting. The resource loss cycle represents a vicious circle that amplifies the resource loss caused by surface acting. Surface acting reduces the level of one’s resources. Furthermore, surface acting reduces JAW and resources more strongly when an individual has low levels of previous energy resources than it reduces JAW and resources when he or she has high levels of previous energy resources.","[{'authorId': '119226606', 'name': 'Seongwook Ha'}]",10.0,,38.0,Surface Acting and Job-Related Affective Wellbeing: Preventing Resource Loss Spiral and Resource Loss Cycle for Sustainable Workplaces,2018.0

An experimental investigation was conducted in which human participants interacted with a humanoid robot whose facial expression was shown on an LCD monitor that was mounted as its head (Study 1). Participants were asked to play the ultimatum game, which is usually used to measure human altruistic behavior. All participants were assigned to be the proposer and were instructed to decide their offer within 1 min by controlling a slider bar. The corners of the robot's mouth, as indicated by the line drawing, simply moved upward, or downward depending on the position of the slider bar. The results suggest that the change in the facial expression depicted by a simple line drawing of a face significantly affected the participant's final offer in the ultimatum game. The offers were increased by 13% when subjects were shown contingent changes of facial expression. The results were compared with an experiment in a teleoperation setting in which participants interacted with another person through a computer display showing the same line drawings used in Study 1 (Study 2). The results showed that offers were 15% higher if participants were shown a contingent facial expression change. Together, Studies 1 and 2 indicate that emotional expression in simple line drawings of a robot's face elicits the same higher offer from humans as a human telepresence does.","[{'authorId': '145990834', 'name': 'K.

However, despite widespread use, disagreement persists regarding the latent structure of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), which poses serious consequences for how the measure should be administered. Furthermore, factorial invariance between genders has not been established with the 10-item PSS, though gender differences in perceived stress have been detected. This study examined the factor structure, composite reliability, convergent validity, and gender invariance of the PSS-10 among 524 UK university students. Four distinct factor models (one-factor, correlated two-factor, correlated three-factor, and bifactor) were examined using confirmatory factor analysis. The totality of results supported a bifactor solution. Multi-group analysis established configural, metric, and scalar invariance of this model across gender. This study supports the use of total PSS-10 scores with UK university students and suggests the scale is not significantly affected by gender bias.","[{'authorId': '3647959', 'name': 'Andrew Denovan'}, {'authorId': '6767621', 'name': 'Neil Dagnall'}, {'authorId': '4259561', 'name': 'K.

The investigation was performed by using non-invasive techniques (i.e. ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging). We acquired images of contiguous sections of octopus suckers, which were used to make a 3D reconstruction aimed to obtain a CAD model perfectly equivalent to the octopus sucker in terms of sizes and anatomical proportion. The 3D information was used to develop the first passive prototypes of the artificial suction cups made in silicone. Then, in accordance with Kier and Smith's octopus adhesion model, we put in tension the water volume in the interior chamber of the artificial suction cup to obtain suction. The characterization of the passive sucker was addressed by measuring both the differential pressure between external and internal water volume of suction cup (~ 105) and the pull-off force applied to detach the substrates from the suction cup (~ 8N).","[{'authorId': '2745521', 'name': 'F.

Gabrieli (p. 280; see the cover) now reviews the latest research into the causes of dyslexia. Neuroimaging studies may give early notice of impending dyslexia, and it is hoped that early interventions may lessen the impact of dyslexia. Learning occurs in many settings. Humans uniquely use the formalized settings of schools and curriculum. Infants and children also do plenty of learning outside these settings, often intermingling social interactions. Meltzoff et al. (p. 284) survey the variety of learning contexts that people experience and discuss how recent advances in neuroscience and robotics are driving a new synthesis of learning. Human learning is distinguished by the range and complexity of skills that can be learned and the degree of abstraction that can be achieved compared with those of other species. Homo sapiens is also the only species that has developed formal ways to enhance learning: teachers, schools, and curricula. Human infants have an intense interest in people and their behavior and possess powerful implicit learning mechanisms that are affected by social interaction. Neuroscientists are beginning to understand the brain mechanisms underlying learning and how shared brain systems for perception and action support social learning.

This article reviews the benefits and risks associated with various pharmacologic and psychological therapies to assess their ability to achieve the elimination of GAD symptomatology and restoration of normal function. Psychotherapeutic approaches such as applied relaxation, cognitive therapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapy have all been shown to be effective when used as monotherapies and may be beneficial when used adjunctively. Current effective pharmacotherapies for patients with GAD include anxiolytic benzodiazepines, buspirone, and antidepressants including venlafaxine and paroxetine. Benzodiazepines have long been used to treat anxiety and are particularly appropriate in short-term treatment situations; however, their adverse side-effect profile and their inability to treat depression commonly comorbid with GAD renders them less than ideal in many situations. Buspirone has demonstrated anxiolytic benefits but, like benzodiazepines, shows negligible antidepressant action. Antidepressants like paroxetine and venlafaxine are not only effective antidepressants but also effective anxiolytics, thus implying their special ability to treat GAD and concurrent depression, even over the long-term.","[{'authorId': '145194146', 'name': 'J.

More specifically, emotions are elicited in agreement with a bidimensional spatial localization of affective states, that is, arousal and valence dimensions. A dedicated experimental protocol was designed and realized where specific affective states are suitably induced while three peripheral physiological signals, i.e., ElectroCardioGram (ECG), ElectroDermal Response (EDR), and ReSPiration activity (RSP), are simultaneously acquired. A group of 35 volunteers was presented with sets of images gathered from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) having five levels of arousal and five levels of valence, including a neutral reference level in both. Standard methods as well as nonlinear dynamic techniques were used to extract sets of features from the collected signals. The goal of this paper is to implement an automatic multiclass arousal/valence classifier comparing performance when extracted features from nonlinear methods are used as an alternative to standard features. Results show that, when nonlinearly extracted features are used, the percentages of successful recognition dramatically increase. A good recognition accuracy (>;90 percent) after 40-fold cross-validation steps for both arousal and valence classes was achieved by using the Quadratic Discriminant Classifier (QDC).","[{'authorId': '1724693', 'name': 'G.

At the same time, this phase is marked by a gap in our knowledge of the genetic and environmental influences on brain responses to social feedback and their relation to behavioral aggression. In a large developmental twin sample (509 7‐ to 9‐year‐olds), the heritability and neural underpinnings of behavioral aggression following social evaluation were investigated, using the Social Network Aggression Task (SNAT). Participants viewed pictures of peers that gave positive, neutral, or negative feedback to the participant's profile. Next, participants could blast a loud noise toward the peer as an index of aggression. Genetic modeling revealed that aggression following negative feedback was influenced by both genetics and environmental (shared as well as unique environment). On a neural level (n = 385), the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex gyrus (ACCg) responded to both positive and negative feedback, suggesting they signal for social salience cues. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) were specifically activated during negative feedback, whereas positive feedback resulted in increased activation in caudate, supplementary motor cortex (SMA), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Decreased SMA and DLPFC activation during negative feedback was associated with more aggressive behavior after negative feedback. Moreover, genetic modeling showed that 13%–14% of the variance in dorsolateral PFC activity was explained by genetics. Our results suggest that the processing of social feedback is partly explained by genetic factors, whereas shared environmental influences play a role in behavioral aggression following feedback.","[{'authorId': '5491920', 'name': 'M.

International recommendations stress nonpharmacological interventions as first-line treatment. While newer psychosocial initiatives adapted to geriatric populations based on social robot therapy have emerged, to our knowledge, no studies on differential efficacy depending on BPSD profiles have been conducted yet. Objectives This pilot study examined the impact of short exposure to a social robot (Paro®) on the subjective emotional well-being of patients with major neurocognitive disorder as well as its impact on differential effects for 3 BPSD profiles. Methods Seventeen patients with major NCD with apathy (n=6), depression (n=7), and agitation (n=4) were recruited. The intervention was composed of four 15-minute individual sessions. Exposure occurred without the simultaneous presence of a health care provider. A pre–post assessment of emotional well-being was conducted with the International Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Short-Form, which measures positive and negative affectivity. Results Overall findings showed a significant increase of positive affectivity (p=0.02). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that agitated patients reduced negative affectivity significantly more than depressed patients (p=0.03). Results also confirmed users’ overall acceptability of the robot. Conclusion These findings support the usefulness of brief interactive sessions with the Paro robot for elderly patients with major NCD.

Background: Robots have evolved from continuous human-controlled master–slave servomechanisms for handling nuclear waste to a broad range of robots incorporating artificial intelligence for many applications and under human supervisory control. Methods: This mini-review describes HRI developments in four application areas and what are the challenges for human factors research. Results: In addition to a plethora of research papers, evidence of success is manifest in live demonstrations of robot capability under various forms of human control. Conclusions: HRI is a rapidly evolving field. Specialized robots under human teleoperation have proven successful in hazardous environments and medical application, as have specialized telerobots under human supervisory control for space and repetitive industrial tasks. Research in areas of self-driving cars, intimate collaboration with humans in manipulation tasks, human control of humanoid robots for hazardous environments, and social interaction with robots is at initial stages. The efficacy of humanoid general-purpose robots has yet to be proven. Applications: HRI is now applied in almost all robot tasks, including manufacturing, space, aviation, undersea, surgery, rehabilitation, agriculture, education, package fetch and delivery, policing, and military operations.","[{'authorId': '1712194', 'name': 'T.

During a 6-month, mixed-methods study, we investigated friendships among 31 assisted living residents with moderate to advanced dementia. Results revealed no correlation between test scores or demographic characteristics (except gender) and friendship dyads identified by staff. Staffs’ perceptions of residents’ friendships were not supported through our observations. We did observe friendships among residents characterized by voluntary participation and accommodation in conversation, and recognition of the uniqueness of the other. Findings suggest staff perceptions of residents’ friendships are not sufficient and that more research on this topic is needed.","[{'authorId': '6911962', 'name': 'Kate de Medeiros'}, {'authorId': '48406181', 'name': 'P.

There is a general interest in language and the body across disciplines that has invited a reconceptualization of the broader issues relative to action, cognition, culture, knowledge, social relations and identities, spatiality and temporality. The study of social interaction focuses on how multimodal resources – including language and bodily movements – are holistically and situatedly used in building human action. This article discusses some consequences and challenges of putting the body at the center of attention: it repositions language as one among other modalities, and invites us to consider the involvement of entire bodies in social interaction, overcoming a logo-centric vision of communication, as well as a visuo-centric vision of embodiment. These issues are developed through a series of conversation analytic studies, firstly of classic topics in linguistics like deixis, then of more recent topics, such as mobility and sensoriality.","[{'authorId': '72502093', 'name': 'L.

The present study examined 39 heterosexual couples' joint weight status (both partners are healthy-weight, both overweight, 1 healthy-weight, and 1 overweight) as a predictor of 2 interpersonal emotional patterns during a discussion of their shared lifestyle choices. The first pattern, coregulation, is one in which partners' coupled emotions show a dampening pattern over time and ultimately return to homeostatic levels. The second, codysregulation, is one in which partners' coupled emotions are amplified away from homeostatic balance. We demonstrate how a coupled linear oscillator (CLO) model (Butner, Amazeen, & Mulvey, 2005) can be used to distinguish coregulation from codysregulation. As predicted, healthy-weight couples and mixed-weight couples in which the man was heavier than the woman displayed coregulation, but overweight couples and mixed-weight couples in which the woman was heavier showed codysregulation. These results suggest that heterosexual couples in which the woman is overweight may face formidable coregulatory challenges that could undermine both partners' well-being. The results also demonstrate the importance of distinguishing between various interpersonal emotional dynamics for understanding connections between interpersonal emotions and health.","[{'authorId': '2012368', 'name': 'R.

Analysis suggested a person missing visible teeth was more negatively perceived on all social traits than a person with full dentition. Results were strongest when students were proposed to be linked to the edentulous individual in a personal way, i.e., dating or living as neighbor. Men and women agreed on perceptions of social traits and dentition condition.

However, this view poses fundamental challenges to prevailing conceptualizations of emotion regulation. In portraying emotion regulation as a network of multilevel processes characterized by feedback and interaction between higher and lower systems, it becomes increasingly apparent that emotion regulation is a component of (rather than a response to) emotional activation, that it derives from the mutual influence of multiple emotion-related systems (rather than the maturation of higher control processes alone), and that it sometimes contributes to maladaptive behavioral outcomes, especially in conditions of environmental adversity.

Future research might address questions of causality of FPE relative to related constructs, further data on psychometric properties, as well as on its independence from FNE in longitudinal studies. In sum, FPE seems to be a valid and reliable construct that explains cognitions, emotions, and behavior related to social anxiety at subclinical and clinical levels and therefore enriches the psychometric repertoire in the fields of social psychology, personality, and clinical psychology.","[{'authorId': '3411336', 'name': 'J.

At present, progress in this field is hindered by the fact that each facial expression needs to be programmed by humans. In order to adapt robot behavior in real time to different situations that arise when interacting with human subjects, robots need to be able to train themselves without requiring human labels, as well as make fast action decisions and generalize the acquired knowledge to diverse and new contexts. We addressed this challenge by designing a physical animatronic robotic face with soft skin and by developing a vision-based self-supervised learning framework for facial mimicry. Our algorithm does not require any knowledge of the robot's kinematic model, camera calibration or predefined expression set. By decomposing the learning process into a generative model and an inverse model, our framework can be trained using a single motor babbling dataset.

Strategies applied to alter emotions are known to differ in their impact on psychological and physiological aspects of the emotional response. However, emotion regulation outcome has primarily been assessed via self-report, and studies comparing regulation strategies with regard to their peripheral physiological mechanisms are limited in number. In the present study, we therefore aimed to investigate the effects of different emotion regulation strategies on pupil dilation, skin conductance responses, and subjective emotional responses. Thirty healthy females were presented with negative and neutral pictures and asked to maintain or up- and downregulate their upcoming emotional responses through reappraisal or distraction. Pupil dilation and skin conductance responses were significantly enhanced when viewing negative relative to neutral pictures. For the pupil, this emotional arousal effect manifested specifically late during the pupillary response. In accordance with subjective ratings, increasing negative emotions through reappraisal led to the most prominent pupil size enlargements, whereas no consistent effect for downregulation was found. In contrast, early peak dilations were enhanced in all emotion regulation conditions independent of strategy. Skin conductance responses were not further modulated by emotion regulation. These results indicate that pupil diameter is modulated by emotional arousal, but is initially related to the extent of mental effort required to regulate automatic emotional responses. Our data thus provide first evidence that the pupillary response might comprise two distinct temporal components reflecting cognitive emotion regulation effort on the one hand and emotion regulation success on the other hand.","[{'authorId': '3410911', 'name': 'Valerie L.

A sample of 32 children (at ages 12 months and 18 months) and their mothers participated in the strange situation procedure. At age 6 years, they were observed in an attachment situation and administered a standard delay of gratification task. The length of time that children were able to delay gratification at age 6 was predicted both by concurrent attachment quality and by a longitudinal attachment measure. Children with secure attachment were able to wait the longest periods of time, whereas those with insecure-disorganized attachment had the most difficulties in waiting. The effects of longitudinal, but not concurrent, attachment quality on children's total waiting time remained significant when other important variables were considered, including gender and children's cognitive functioning. An interactive effect was found between attachment quality and cognitive functioning. Insecure-avoidantly attached children with high cognitive functioning did not differ in their overall waiting times from securely attached children, but insecure-avoidantly attached children with average or low cognitive functioning did have shorter waiting times. The study provides a basis for the further investigation of mother-child attachment quality as a factor that is linked to children's delay behavior.","[{'authorId': '2251630458', 'name': 'Teresa Jacobsen'}, {'authorId': '2249502116', 'name': 'Michael Huss'}, {'authorId': '2251252631', 'name': 'Michael Fendrich'}, {'authorId': '4372914', 'name': 'M.

At its core, the model specifies how prefrontal and cingulate control systems modulate activity in perceptual, semantic, and affect systems as a function of one's regulatory goals, tactics, and the nature of the stimuli and emotions being regulated. This section also shows how the model can be generalized to understand the brain mechanisms underlying other emotion regulation strategies as well as a range of other allied phenomena.

c1bddcf1e3d554ce8379d0f02d896537a94154c7,"Hochschild (1983) introduced the term emotional labour and offered a theoretical and conceptual framework to contextualise the use of this term, though other frameworks have since been proposed (Ashforth & Humphrey, 1993; Morris & Feldman, 1996; Grandey, 2000). Generally, emotional labour is seen as a forced affective performance that may result in negative consequences for the performer (Hochschild, 1983), ranging from decreased job satisfaction to burnout. Emotional labour is performed when disparity occurs between workers' felt emotions and displayed emotions in a given occupational and organisational context. The type of emotional labour performed is shaped by the context in which it occurs (James, 1992). Emotional labour is an important concept as it relates to burnout among mental health field workers and has been applied to a range of occupational contexts: the airline industry (Whitelegg, 2002; Williams, 2003), call centre workers (Korczynski, 2003), criminal interrogators (Rafali & Sutton, 1991), legal professions (Harris, 2002; Livley, 2002), teaching (Price, 2001), nursing (Aldridge, 1994), and the medical profession (Larson & Yao, 2005). Although Hochschild (1983) did not apply the concept of emotional labour to mental health professionals, she claimed it would likely be a component within these professions. There are few studies investigating issues of emotional labour among mental health professionals (Mann & Cowburn, 2005; Karabanow, 1999; Yanay & Shahar, 1998), and this article aims to partially address the deficiency by exploring emotional labour in the context of mental health fieldwork at the Auckland branch of a community mental health organisation in New Zealand. Clarifying the role of emotional labour in mental health service delivery, and its relationship to burnout is important in developing proactive support structures for employees. Existing research Two qualitative studies have investigated emotional labour in the contexts and occupations similar to the current research (Karabanow, 1999; Yanay & Shahr, 1998). Karabanow (1999) explored the concept of emotional labour in Canadian workers at a youth shelter. Clear links were shown between organisational demands or display rules placed upon workers' expressions and emotional labour performance. Display rules tend to prescribe the expression of emotions (Ashforth & Humphrey, 1995) and ""specify the range, intensity, duration and object of emotions that are expected to be experienced--or at least displayed."" (Mann, 2006, p. 553). The negative consequences of emotional labour described by Karabanow (1999) were tied to workers' beliefs that, for management, what the workers did was never good enough. Perceived non-appreciation combined with pressure created by display rules produced feelings of always needing to give more. Interestingly, little was discussed around performance of emotional labour with clients or youth at the shelter. Rather, emotional labour seemed to arise in interactions with management and in accordance with the display rules of the organisation. This suggests that emotional labour is not performed only with clients and its negative impact can result from the overall organisational structure. Yanay and Shahr (1998) investigated emotional labour performed by third year psychology students at a residential psychiatric facility in Israel. Feeling rules (display rules) were seen as professional modes of feeling and behaving in relation to residents of the facility. The difficulties students encountered related to the uncertainty of what it was to be a professional. Performance of emotional labour was a constant negotiation between having a 'normal' emotional reaction, like anger and desire to yell at provocations from the residents, and the discourse of appropriate professional feelings and behaviour (Yanay & Shahr, 1998). Thus students tried to control their emotions according to their perceptions of what was professionally appropriate. …","[{'authorId': '2074983200', 'name': 'Y.

However, the neural mechanisms involved in regulating aggressive responses to social exclusion are still largely unknown. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) modulates the excitability of a target region. Building on studies suggesting that activity in the right ventrolateral pre-frontal cortex (rVLPFC) might aid the regulation or inhibition of social exclusion-related distress, we hypothesized that non-invasive brain polarization through tDCS over the rVLPFC would reduce behavioral aggression following social exclusion. Participants were socially excluded or included while they received tDCS or sham stimulation to the rVLPFC. Next, they received an opportunity to aggress. Excluded participants demonstrated cognitive awareness of their inclusionary status, yet tDCS (but not sham stimulation) reduced their behavioral aggression. Excluded participants who received tDCS stimulation were no more aggressive than included participants. tDCS stimulation did not influence socially included participants' aggression. Our findings provide the first causal test for the role of rVLPFC in modulating aggressive responses to social exclusion.

Here, we describe the functional and structural changes occurring in the brain during this period of life and how they relate to navigating the social environment. Areas of the social brain undergo both structural changes and functional reorganization during the second decade of life, possibly reflecting a sensitive period for adapting to one's social environment.

The neural basis for semantic control remains controversial. Neuroimaging studies have focused on the role of the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG), whereas neuropsychological research suggests that damage to a widely distributed network elicits impairments of semantic control. There is also debate about the relationship between semantic and executive control more widely. We used TMS in healthy human volunteers to create “virtual lesions” in structures typically damaged in patients with semantic control deficits: LIFG, left posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), and intraparietal sulcus (IPS). The influence of TMS on tasks varying in semantic and nonsemantic control demands was examined for each region within this hypothesized network to gain insights into (i) their functional specialization (i.e., involvement in semantic representation, controlled retrieval, or selection) and (ii) their domain dependence (i.e., semantic or cognitive control). The results revealed that LIFG and pMTG jointly support both the controlled retrieval and selection of semantic knowledge. IPS specifically participates in semantic selection and responds to manipulations of nonsemantic control demands. These observations are consistent with a large-scale semantic control network, as predicted by lesion data, that draws on semantic-specific (LIFG and pMTG) and domain-independent executive components (IPS).","[{'authorId': '13168864', 'name': 'C.

To establish a national body mass index (BMI) reference norm for the purpose of screening and more active prevention and cure on overweight and obesity in Chinese children and adolescents.


METHODS
The 2000 Chinese National Survey on Students Constitution and Health was used as reference population. In total there were more than 244.2 thousands of primary and secondary Han nationality students aged 7 through 18 years old included in this study. The BMI distribution of various Chinese children and adolescent groups were compared with the NCHS international norm, the percentage values and with advanced ages, were calculated. In the beginning, three temporary norms were set up, using the different combination of P(85), P(90) and P(95) BMI percentages. Based on the intersect testing and varifying of physiological, lipidemia biochemical and body composition measures, the best norm was then selected. B-spline smoothing method was used to correct the curves, both for males and females, composed by cut-off points at different ages.


RESULTS
Using samples from the costal developed metropolis, the BMI curves successfully overcame the shortcomings of low and depressive phenomenon of the total population, in particular after the mid-adolescent period. The temporary Norm II, composed by cut-off points of P(85) for overweight and P(95) for obesity, was found to be the best among the three temporary norms, both shown by its sensitivity and specificity. 24 and 28 were used as cut-off points for overweight and obesity in this norm, both for males and females aged 18 years. These two cut-off points were consistent with those shown in the Body Mass Index Reference Norm for Screening Overweight and Obesity in Chinese Adults. Three samples from Beijing, Henan and Sichuan, used as representatives of upper, middle and relative low levels of physical growth of children and adolescents in China, were used for extra tests. The screening results showed that among the male and female subjects aged 7 through 18 years, the prevalence rates were 17.00% and 9.46% for overweight, 9.99% and 6.47% for obesity in Beijing while 10.86% and 6.64% for overweight, 4.27% and 3.07% for obesity in Henan, and 6.95% and 4.23% for overweight and 2.84% and 2.09% for obesity in Sichuan, respectively. Data clearly showed that the results were in accordance with the actural situation seen in the Chinese students in 2000.


CONCLUSION
The newly established reference norm seemed to be good for prospective studies as it considered the facts regarding the rapid and strong tendency of secular growth changes seen in the Chinese children and adolescents. It also decreased the difference of growth levels between the Chinese children and adolescents and those of the international norms. This norm was particularly developed for the Chinese which was also in consistent with the Eastern Asia ethnic characteristics so could be promoted in China.","[{'authorId': '145100313', 'name': 'C.

Workers performed both Surface Acting and Deep Acting, and frequently reported Emotional Consonance too. SA and EC were negatively related. SA was more likely the higher the number of interactions with clients per day- itself negatively related to interaction duration. EC was more likely the higher the Involvement in the present job role - itself highly negatively related with number of client-interactions. Life Satisfaction was related negatively to SA, and positively related to EC. Emotional labor correlated with reported level of one or more Burnout components; Exhausted and Depersonalized employees reported less Life Satisfaction, and more frequent Negative emotions; Positive emotions were felt more often by Involved employees, and by those who felt Realized in their job.

However, whether this could be demonstrated using more realistic facial emotion recognition stimuli and applied to autistic females was unclear. In all, 83 females diagnosed with autism spectrum condition completed online self-report measures of autism spectrum condition severity and alexithymia, and afacial emotion recognition deficit that assessed their ability to identify multimodal displays of complex emotions. Higher levels of alexithymia, but not autism spectrum condition severity, were associated with less accurate facial emotion recognition. Difficulty identifying one’s own feelings and externally oriented thinking were the components of alexithymia that were specifically related to facial emotion recognition accuracy. However, alexithymia (and autism spectrum condition severity) was not associated with speed of emotion processing. The findings are primarily discussed with the theoretical view that perceiving and experiencing emotions share the same neural networks, thus being able to recognise one’s own emotions may facilitate the ability to recognise others’. This study is in line with previous similar research on autistic males and suggests impairments in facial emotion recognition in autistic females should be attributed to co-occurring alexithymia. Lay abstract Research with autistic males has indicated that difficulties in recognising facial expressions of emotion, commonly associated with autism spectrum conditions, may instead be due to co-occurring alexithymia (a condition involving lack of emotional awareness, difficulty describing feelings and difficulty distinguishing feelings from physical bodily sensations) and not to do with autism. We wanted to explore if this would be true for autistic females, as well as to use more realistic stimuli for emotional expression. In all, 83 females diagnosed with autism spectrum condition completed self-report measures of autism spectrum condition traits and alexithymia and completed a visual test that assessed their ability to identify multimodal displays of complex emotions. Higher levels of alexithymia, but not autism spectrum condition features, were associated with less accuracy in identifying emotions. Difficulty identifying one’s own feelings and externally oriented thinking were the components of alexithymia that were specifically related to facial emotion recognition accuracy.

Thus, context plays a central role in emotion regulation.

However, this recognition of the importance of context has appeared primarily in the theoretical realm, with the empirical work lagging behind.

Such an approach consists of specifying the components that characterize emotion regulation and then systematically evaluating deviations within each of these components and their underlying dimensions. Initial guidelines for how to combine such dimensions and components in order to capture substantial and meaningful contextual influences are presented.

The present study explores whether these models can also explain how people physically and psychologically distance themselves from robots and suggest guidelines for future design of proxemic behaviors for robots. In a controlled laboratory experiment, participants interacted with Wakamaru to perform two tasks that examined physical and psychological distancing of the participants. We manipulated the likeability (likeable/dislikeable) and gaze behavior (mutual gaze/averted gaze) of the robot. Our results on physical distancing showed that participants who disliked the robot compensated for the increase in the robot's gaze by maintaining a greater physical distance from the robot, while participants who liked the robot did not differ in their distancing from the robot across gaze conditions.

This assumption influences legal judgments, policy decisions, national security protocols, and educational practices; guides the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric illness, as well as the development of commercial applications; and pervades everyday social interactions as well as research in other scientific fields such as artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and computer vision. In this article, we survey examples of this widespread assumption, which we refer to as the common view, and we then examine the scientific evidence that tests this view, focusing on the six most popular emotion categories used by consumers of emotion research: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. The available scientific evidence suggests that people do sometimes smile when happy, frown when sad, scowl when angry, and so on, as proposed by the common view, more than what would be expected by chance. Yet how people communicate anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise varies substantially across cultures, situations, and even across people within a single situation. Furthermore, similar configurations of facial movements variably express instances of more than one emotion category. In fact, a given configuration of facial movements, such as a scowl, often communicates something other than an emotional state. Scientists agree that facial movements convey a range of information and are important for social communication, emotional or otherwise. But our review suggests an urgent need for research that examines how people actually move their faces to express emotions and other social information in the variety of contexts that make up everyday life, as well as careful study of the mechanisms by which people perceive instances of emotion in one another. We make specific research recommendations that will yield a more valid picture of how people move their faces to express emotions and how they infer emotional meaning from facial movements in situations of everyday life.

Human physiology implicitly links the production of visual features with other modes like the audio channel: Face muscles responsible for a smiling face also stretch the vocal cords that results in a characteristic smiling voice. For artificial agents capable of multimodal expression, this linkage is modeled explicitly. In our study, we observe the influence of visual and audio channel on the perception of the agent’s emotional state. We created two virtual characters to control for anthropomorphic appearance. We record videos of these agents either with matching or mismatching emotional expression in the audio and visual channel. In an online study we measured the agent’s perceived valence and arousal. Our results show that a matched smiling voice and smiling face increase both dimensions of the Circumplex model of emotions: ratings of valence and arousal grow. When the channels present conflicting information, any type of smiling results in higher arousal rating, but only the visual channel increases the perceived valence. When engineers are constrained in their design choices, we suggest they should give precedence to convey the artificial agent’s emotional state through the visual channel.","[{'authorId': '1996210170', 'name': 'Ilaria Torre'}, {'authorId': '2140634515', 'name': 'Simon Holk'}, {'authorId': '3493587', 'name': 'E.

The cause of autistic spectrum disorder (i.e., autism and Asperger's syndrome) is unknown. The serotonergic (5-HT) system may be especially implicated. However, cortical 5-HT2A receptor density in adults with the disorder has not been examined, to the authors' knowledge.


METHOD
The authors investigated cortical 5-HT2A receptor binding in eight adults with Asperger's syndrome and in 10 healthy comparison subjects with single photon emission computed tomography and the selective 5-HT2A receptor ligand 123I iodinated 4-amino-N-[1-[3-(4-fluorophenoxy)propyl]-4-methyl-4-piperidinyl]-5-iodo-2-methoxybenzamide (123I-5-I-R91150).


RESULTS
People with Asperger's syndrome had a significant reduction in cortical 5-HT2A receptor binding in the total, anterior, and posterior cingulate; bilaterally in the frontal and superior temporal lobes; and in the left parietal lobe. Also, reduced receptor binding was significantly related to abnormal social communication.


CONCLUSIONS
The authors' findings suggest that adults with Asperger's syndrome have abnormalities in cortical 5-HT2A receptor density and that this deficit may underlie some clinical symptoms.","[{'authorId': '143799270', 'name': 'D.

This essay offers a perspective on these issues by considering how emotion regulation should be defined, the various components of the management of emotion, how emotion regulation strategies fit into the dynamics of social interaction, and how individual differences in emotion regulation should be conceptualized and measured. In the end, it seems clear that emotion regulation is a conceptual rubric for a remarkable range of developmental processes, each of which may have its own catalysts and control processes. Likewise, individual differences in emotion regulation skills likely have multifaceted origins and are also related in complex ways to the person's emotional goals and the immediate demands of the situation. Assessment approaches that focus on the dynamics of emotion are well suited to elucidating these complex developmental and individual differences. In sum, a challenging research agenda awaits those who enter this promising field of study.","[{'authorId': '2246294034', 'name': 'Ross A.

The purpose of this research is to identify how the (ostensible) gender and the facial characteristics of a robot influence the extent to which people trust it and the psychological reactance they experience from its persuasive attempts. This paper reports a laboratory study where SociBot™, a robot capable of displaying different faces and dynamic social cues, delivered persuasive messages to participants while playing a game. In-game choice behavior was logged, and trust and reactance toward the advisor were measured using questionnaires. Results show that a robotic advisor with upturned eyebrows and lips (features that people tend to trust more in humans) is more persuasive, evokes more trust, and less psychological reactance compared to one displaying eyebrows pointing down and lips curled downwards at the edges (facial characteristics typically not trusted in humans). Gender of the robot did not affect trust, but participants experienced higher psychological reactance when interacting with a robot of the opposite gender. Remarkably, mediation analysis showed that liking of the robot fully mediates the influence of facial characteristics on trusting beliefs and psychological reactance. Also, psychological reactance was a strong and reliable predictor of trusting beliefs but not of trusting behavior. These results suggest robots that are intended to influence human behavior should be designed to have facial characteristics we trust in humans and could be personalized to have the same gender as the user. Furthermore, personalization and adaptation techniques designed to make people like the robot more may help ensure they will also trust the robot.","[{'authorId': '2530384', 'name': 'A. S.

c6ff186ed2952d35a74d22a4abc4448dd7869e89,"Social decisions are heavily influenced by emotion. For decades, the dominant research paradigm has been characterized by a focus on the decision maker’s own positive or negative mood. We argue that a full understanding of the role of emotion in social decision making requires a complementary focus on interpersonal effects (i.e., the effects of one individual’s emotions on the other’s behavior); a focus on discrete emotions rather than general mood states; and a distinction between cooperative and competitive settings. To advance insight into these issues, we present the Emotions as Social Information (EASI) model. The model is grounded in two basic assumptions, namely that individuals use others’ emotions to make sense of ambiguous situations, and that the effects of others’ emotions and the processes that drive them depend critically on the cooperative or competitive nature of the situation. A review of recent research supports our analysis. We demonstrate that the interpersonal effects of emotions are pervasive and can be better understood in terms of the unique social functions of each emotion than in terms of valence. Effects in cooperative settings are best explained in terms of affective reactions (i.e., emotional contagion, affect infusion, and mood management), whereas effects in competitive contexts are better understood in terms of the strategic inferences Emotions as Social Information 47 individuals draw from other’s emotions. We conclude by discussing the implications of our model and highlighting avenues for future research. Would you trust a salesperson who smiles at you, or give money to a grumpy beggar muttering angry phrases? How would you react to a friend who arrives late for an appointment looking guilty and ashamed? Would you work harder when your team leader appears upbeat and cheerful or rather irritated and moody? Reversing the roles, would you show that you are angry or happy about your negotiation partner’s insultingly low or surprisingly generous offer? If you wanted to solicit help, which emotions would you show? Diverse as they may seem, all these questions revolve around one fundamental issue: How do emotional expressions shape social interactions and decisions? This is the focus of the chapter. Emotions have long been regarded as disruptive forces that interfere with rational decision making. Increasingly, however, this view has given way to a functional perspective on emotions. Contemporary scholars share the idea that emotions signal the importance of events to relevant concerns, help prioritize goals, and generate a state of action readiness that prepares the individual to respond to changes in the environment (see, e.g., Frijda, 1986). This not only applies to individual goals and actions but also, and perhaps especially, to social interaction and decision making—situations in which one’s own behavior influences and is influenced by one or more others. Indeed, social interactions are among themost commonly reported antecedents of emotions (Anderson& Guerrero, 1998; Shaver et al., 1992), and emotions have plenty of potential to shape behavior (Frijda, 1986; Manstead, 1991; Van Kleef, 2009). Although the last decades have witnessed a growing attention to the role of emotion in social decision making, we believe that this research has not done justice to the inherently social nature of emotion. The reason is that most research has addressed the intrapersonal effects of affective states (especially positive vs. negative moods), demonstrating that individuals’ judgments and decisions are influenced by their mood state (for reviews, see e.g., Ashby et al., 1999; Forgas, 1995; Isen, 1987; Schwarz et al., 1991; Wyer et al., 1999). Although much of this work involved social situations, the role of emotion itself has been studied in a rather a-social way, ignoring the role of the interaction partner. In this article, we advocate a more social approach, advancing a new model of the interpersonal effects of emotion in social decision making. 1. Concerns with Past Research and Aims of the Present Article The chapter—and much of the research reviewed in it—is motivated by three key concerns about the dominant research focus. The first concern is the prevailing focus on intrapersonal effects. We contend that the role of 48 Gerben A. Van Kleef et al. emotion in social decision making cannot be fully understood by merely considering the decision maker’s own emotions. We don’t just feel our emotions; we also express them in social interaction. This means that other people may observe our emotions, and may be influenced by them. Parkinson’s (1996) article, entitled ‘‘Emotions are social,’’ aptly notes that our emotions are not only often evoked by social interaction; but they also influence the behavior of social interaction partners by serving as a form of communication (Ekman, 1993; Fridlund, 1994; Frijda, 1986; Knutson, 1996). A true understanding of the role of emotion in social decision making therefore requires an additional focus on the interpersonal effects of emotions—the effects of one individual’s emotions on the other’s social decisions and behavior. Despite the growing popularity of social-functional approaches to emotion (e.g., Elfenbein, 2007; Fischer & Manstead, 2008; Frijda & Mesquita, 1994; Keltner & Haidt, 1999; Morris & Keltner, 2000; Oatley & Jenkins, 1992; Van Kleef, 2009), a systematic analysis in the context of social decision making is missing. Accordingly, our first objective is to fill this void. Our second concern is with the tendency to focus on positive versus negative mood as opposed to discrete emotions. We argue that this emphasis on diffuse mood states blurs our understanding of the multifaceted role of emotion in social decision making. As explained in more detail below, each discrete emotion has its own antecedents, appraisal components, relational themes, and action tendencies (Frijda et al., 1989; Lazarus, 1991; Manstead & Tetlock, 1989; Roseman et al., 1994; Smith et al., 1993). Emotions therefore provide more differentiated information and carry more clearcut behavioral implications than moods (Weiner, 1986). Our second goal, accordingly, is to highlight these specific functions of discrete emotions in the context of social decision making. We will show that discrete emotions (e.g., happiness, anger, sadness, guilt) have differential effects on social behavior that cannot be understood in terms of valence. Our final concern is the relative neglect of the social context within which emotions are expressed and behavioral actions emerge. Although emotions have been studied in various domains of social decision making, context has seldom been varied within studies, and it has not been common to compare the effects of emotions across different social settings. We argue that it is important to consider the social context. In particular, we propose that the same emotions may have entirely different effects depending on whether they are expressed in a predominantly cooperative or competitive setting. Cooperative settings are generally characterized by higher levels of trust and benevolence and greater motivation to work together; competitive settings typically breed distrust, more selfish motivations, and strategic behavior (De Dreu et al., 2007). It stands to reason that people respond differently to a smile or frown from a partner in a cooperative setting than from an adversary in a competitive situation (Lanzetta & Englis, 1989). Emotions as Social Information 49 Motivated by these observations, we present the Emotions as Social Information (EASI) model (see also Van Kleef, 2009) to enhance understanding of the interpersonal effects of emotions in social decision making. The model is grounded in two basic assumptions. The first is that social decision-making situations are fuzzy and are characterized by insufficient information about interdependent others’ goals, desires, and intentions. In such an uncertain environment, people rely on additional cues to make sense of the situation. We propose that people use their partner’s emotions to disambiguate the situation and to inform their social decisions. Our second assumption is that the nature of the situation fundamentally shapes the interpersonal effects of emotions. In predominantly cooperative situations, where parties’ goals are aligned and trust is high, people are likely to assimilate to the emotions of their partner, and their social decisions are likely to be influenced by their resulting emotional state. In more competitive settings, in contrast, where parties’ goals conflict and trust tends to be low, individuals use their counterpart’s emotions as strategic information to inform their behavior. This distinction has important implications for our understanding of the interpersonal effects of emotions in social decision making, as we demonstrate below. This model helps us to generate and address new questions about the role of emotion in social life. How do the emotional expressions of one party influence the social decisions of interdependent others?What are the distinct social signals that are conveyed by discrete emotions, and how do individuals respond to those signals? When do emotions spread from one individual to the other, and how does this affect social decision making? What strategic information do people distill from their counterpart’s emotional expressions, and how do they act on those inferences? We rely on the EASI model and recent empirical work to provide preliminary answers to these and other questions. To do so, we proceed as follows. We first build on the aforementioned assumptions to develop our model. Next, empirical support for the main propositions of themodel is reviewed by considering research evidence from our own and others’ laboratories. We close with a section summarizing our main conclusions and their implications, highlighting some key gaps in our knowledge, and offeri","[{'authorId': '148298087', 'name': 'van Kleef'}]",451.0,,192.0,An interpersonal approach to emotion in social decision making: the emotions as social information model,2010.0
c706ece7a5447412e5df707efa5f2854e926b9c4,"Emotional inductions through music (EIM) procedures have proved to evoke genuine emotions according to neuroimaging studies. However, the persistence of the emotional states after being exposed to musical excerpts remains mostly unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the curve of emotional state generated by an EIM paradigm over a 6-min recovery phase, monitored with valence and arousal self-report measures, and physiological parameters. Stimuli consisted of a neutral and two valenced musical excerpts previously reported to generate such states. The neutral excerpt was composed in a minimalist form characterized by simple sonorities, rhythms, and patterns; the positive excerpt had fast tempo and major tones, and the negative one was slower in tempo and had minor tone. Results of 24 participants revealed that positive and negative EIM effectively induced self-reported happy and sad emotions and elicited higher skin conductance levels (SCL). Although self-reported adjectives describing evoked-emotions states changed to neutral after 2 min in the recovery phase, the SCL data suggest longer lasting arousal for both positive and negative emotional states. The implications of these outcomes for musical research are discussed.","[{'authorId': '49353047', 'name': 'F. S.

The final version of the instrument consists of four seven-item subscales, each of which taps a separate aspect of the global concept ""empathy."" One scale, the perspective-taking scale, contains items which assess spontaneous attempts to adopt the perspectives of other people and see things from their point of view. Items on the fantasy scale measure the tendency to identify with characters in movies, novels, plays and other fictional situations. The other two subscales explicitly tap respondents' chronic emotional reactions to the negative experiences of others. The empathic concern scale inquires about respondents' feelings of warmth, compassion, and concern for others, while the personal distress scale measures the personal feelings of anxiety and discomfort that result from observing another's negative experience. The factor structure underlying these scales is the same for both sexes, and emerged in two independent samples. Test-retest and internal reliabilities of all four scales were substantial. The pattern of sex differences and the intercorrelations of these four scales are discussed in terms of recent theoretical treatments of the development of empathy (Hoffman, 1976). It is concluded that the new measure has considerable potential for investigations of the multidimensional nature of empathy.","[{'authorId': '47994338', 'name': 'Mark H.

In this study, responsive joint attention was measured under two conditions in which different agents, a human and a robot, initiated joint attention via video. The participants were 15 children with ASD (mean age: 4.96 ± 1.10 years) and 15 typically developing (TD) children (mean age: 4.53 ± 0.90 years). In addition to analyses of fixation time and gaze transitions, a longest common subsequence approach (LCS) was employed to compare participants’ eye movements to a predefined logical reference sequence. The fixation of TD toward agent’s face was earlier and longer than children with ASD. Moreover, TD showed a greater number of gaze transitions between agent’s face and target, and higher LCS scores than children with ASD. Both groups showed more interests in the robot’s face, but the robot induced a lower proportion of fixation time on the target. Meanwhile participants showed similar gaze transitions and LCS results in both conditions, suggesting that they could follow the logic of the joint attention task induced by the robot as well as human. We have discussed the implications for the effects and applications of social humanoid robots in joint attention interventions.","[{'authorId': '2075436341', 'name': 'Wei Cao'}, {'authorId': '40896782', 'name': 'Wenxu Song'}, {'authorId': '2188213', 'name': 'Xinge Li'}, {'authorId': '40895011', 'name': 'Sixiao Zheng'}, {'authorId': '2116290409', 'name': 'Ge Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2134150879', 'name': 'Yanting Wu'}, {'authorId': '1491630662', 'name': 'Sailing He'}, {'authorId': '1699577', 'name': 'Huilin Zhu'}, {'authorId': '2108143099', 'name': 'Jiajia Chen'}]",19.0,,28.0,Interaction With Social Robots: Improving Gaze Toward Face but Not Necessarily Joint Attention in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder,2019.0

For many students, however, the unfamiliarity of role-playing the client in conjunction with discussing clinical concerns may lead them to become emotionally dysregulated during the social work-client encounter. To explore strategies by which students can maintain emotional regulation when playing the client role, this study garnered the perspectives of Standardized Clients from Canadian medical schools who conduct repeated, simulated performances in the client role. Standardized Clients (N = 116) responded to an online, qualitative survey which explored how they manage their emotions during simulations. Thematic analysis revealed the following regulation strategies: 1) Internal: a) Distance self from the role, b) Immerse in the role, c) Focus on emotions; and 2) External: a) Putting on a performance, and b) The importance of self-care. This paper offers suggestions for social work educators to assist students playing the client in peer-to-peer role-play exercises.","[{'authorId': '1382235830', 'name': 'Lea Tufford'}, {'authorId': '2259684324', 'name': 'Barbara Lee'}, {'authorId': '2258947218', 'name': 'Vivian Thieu'}, {'authorId': '2048031548', 'name': 'Rose Zhao'}]",0.0,"{'name': 'Journal of Teaching in Social Work', 'pages': '627 - 643', 'volume': '43'}",55.0,Emotional Regulation in Peer-To-Peer Role-Play in Canadian Social Work Education: The Contribution from Standardized Clients in Medicine,2023.0

c7c0fa40eedfd772aefeea5d4cdfca95faff5f4e,"The Model of Neurovisceral Integration suggests that vagally mediated heart rate variability (vmHRV) represents a psychophysiological index of inhibitory control and thus, is associated with emotion regulation capacity. Over the past decade, growing empirical evidence supports this notion, showing that those with higher resting vmHRV can regulate negative emotions more adequately. However, to our knowledge, no study has previously examined how resting vmHRV may relate to everyday perceived difficulties in emotion regulation. The present study attempts to examine such relationship in 183 undergraduate students (98 female, 60 minority, mean Age = 19.34). Resting vmHRV was collected during a 5-min resting baseline period, and everyday difficulties in emotion regulation were assessed using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Controlling for potential covariates (including both trait anxiety and rumination), results revealed a negative relationship between resting vmHRV and DERS such that lower resting vmHRV was associated with greater difficulties in emotional regulation, especially a lack of emotional clarity and impulse control, as indicated by the respective subscales of the DERS. These findings provide further evidence for the Neurovisceral Integration Model, suggesting that emotion regulation and autonomic regulation share neural networks within the brain. Moreover, the present study extends prior research by highlighting two distinct facets of emotion regulation (impulse control and emotional clarity) that should be of particular interest when investigating the link between emotion regulation, resting vmHRV, and related health outcomes including morbidity and mortality.","[{'authorId': '2047536202', 'name': 'DeWayne P.

Methods Experiment 1 used mouse-tracking technique to study the impact of different contexts on the judgment of face trustworthiness at the early evaluation process. Experiment 2 used the seven-point Likert scale to study the effect of different contexts on the judgment of face trustworthiness at the final evaluation result. Results Experiment 1 found that when faces are embedded in threatening negative contexts, the mouse trajectories are more tortuous for trustworthy responses and straighter for untrustworthy responses than in neutral contexts. When faces are embedded in non-threatening negative contexts, the mouse trajectories are more tortuous for trustworthy responses but did not significantly differ for untrustworthy responses than in neutral contexts. When faces are embedded in positive contexts, the mouse trajectories are straighter for trustworthy responses and more tortuous for untrustworthy responses than in neutral contexts. Experiment 2 found that faces embedded in threatening and non-threatening negative contexts have lower scores and faces embedded in positive contexts have higher scores than in neutral contexts.

With reference to the historical context, this paper reviews recent research addressing 4 major issues: early detection, intervention, education, and psychopharmacological management of children with autism and related (autistic) spectrum disorders (hereafter, “autism”). We conclude from our review of the evidence that, in the absence of additional, more compelling data, the clinical usefulness of existing screening instruments remains questionable. However, the potential importance of such research is underscored by the clear benefits of early behavioural intervention: despite differences in orientation, outcomes for children with autism can be significantly enhanced with early intensive intervention. Although many questions remain (notably, What are the critical therapeutic components? For whom? For what domains of development? For what level of intensity and duration?), interventions shown to be effective are all carefully planned, engineered, monitored, and designed to target specific skill domains. Including children with autism in regular classes within the public school system poses several challenges, the most pressing of which is the large number of school personnel who need to be trained in evidence-based teaching and behavioural management practices. Finally, psychotropic drugs may help to reduce some symptoms, but they are neither curative nor a substitute for other forms of support and intervention.","[{'authorId': '2860324', 'name': 'S.

c8147a0de2282c41266e4bc1a8d77c77be6d61dc,"Product design has been recognized as an opportunity for differential advantage in the market place. The appearance of a product influences consumer product choice in several ways. To help product development managers in optimizing the appearance of products, the present study identified the different ways in which the appearance of a product plays a role in consumer product evaluation and, hence, choice. In addition, the implications for product design of each role are listed, and managerial recommendations for optimizing the appearance of products are given. 
 
Based on a literature review, six different roles of product appearance for consumers are identified: (1) communication of aesthetic, (2) symbolic, (3) functional, and (4) ergonomic information; (5) attention drawing; and (6) categorization. A product's appearance can have aesthetic and symbolic value for consumers, can communicate functional characteristics and give a quality impression (functional value), and can communicate ease of use (ergonomic value). In addition, it can draw attention and can influence the ease of categorization of the product. In a large qualitative study (N=142) it was tested whether these roles indeed exist in consumers' process of product choice and whether they are sufficient to describe the way in which product appearance plays a role for consumers. In addition, qualitative insight into these roles was gained. After making a choice between two answering machines, subjects were interviewed about the reasons for their choice and the product information they used to form the judgments underlying their choice reasons. 
 
The six appearance roles indeed proved relevant for consumers and were sufficient to describe the influence of product appearance on product choice. The number of ways in which appearance played a role for consumers differed between 0 and 5; most subjects mentioned two different ways in which appearance influenced their product choice. The aesthetic and symbolic roles were mentioned most often. 
 
The preferred shape (e.g., rounded or angular), color, or size were found to differ depending on the way in which product appearance played a role for subjects. For example, bright colors may be valued from an aesthetic point of view but may diminish the impression of quality (i.e., functional value). This makes it difficult to optimize all roles and illustrates that the product value that is most important for consumers when purchasing a specific kind of product should be the starting point in the design of the product appearance. Furthermore, the influence of shape, color, or size on a certain kind of product value—aesthetic, symbolic, ergonomic, or functional—differed between subjects. One person may like a rounded shape, while another may prefer a rectangular shape. This means that the value of guidelines indicating how the perception of a specific kind of product value can be engendered by means of shape, color, and size is limited. This is especially the case for aesthetic and symbolic product value, which are very personal. Therefore it is recommended to test the performance of the appearance of a newly developed product on these six roles with the target group of consumers. 
 
Insight into the different ways in which appearance characteristics, such as form and color, may influence consumer choice will increase managers' awareness about how to use product appearance as a marketing tool. In addition, distinguishing these six appearance roles will help product development managers to optimize the product appearance better to market needs, as the roles have different and sometimes even conflicting implications for the design of the product appearance.","[{'authorId': '98528457', 'name': 'Mariëlle E.

Both human-human and human-robot interaction literature predicts an increase in learning with increased social availability of a tutor, where social availability has verbal and nonverbal components. Prior work has shown that greater availability in the nonverbal behaviour of a robot tutor has a positive impact on child learning. This paper presents a study with 67 children to explore how social aspects of a tutor robot's speech influences their perception of the robot and their language learning in an interaction. Children perceive the difference in social behaviour between `low' and `high' verbal availability conditions, and improve significantly between a pre- and a post-test in both conditions. A longer-term retention test taken the following week showed that the children had retained almost all of the information they had learnt. However, learning was not affected by which of the robot behaviours they had been exposed to. It is suggested that in this short-term interaction context, additional effort in developing social aspects of a robot's verbal behaviour may not return the desired positive impact on learning gains.","[{'authorId': '143953789', 'name': 'James Kennedy'}, {'authorId': '143997370', 'name': 'Paul E.

We analyzed a subsample of 5,616 youth with lifetime histories of 1 or more of 3 forms of maltreatment: psychological maltreatment (emotional abuse or emotional neglect), physical abuse, and sexual abuse. Measures included the University of California, Los Angeles Posttraumatic Stress Disorder–Reaction Index (Steinberg et al., 2004), Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2004), and 27 diagnostic and CDS-specific clinical severity indicators. Psychologically maltreated youth exhibited equivalent or greater baseline levels of behavioral problems, symptoms, and disorders compared with physically or sexually abused youth on most indicators. The co-occurrence of psychological maltreatment with physical or sexual abuse was linked to the exacerbation of most outcomes. We found that the clinical profiles of psychologically maltreated youth overlapped with, yet were distinct from, those of physically and/or sexually abused youth. Despite its high prevalence in the CDS, psychological maltreatment was rarely the focus of intervention for youth in this large national sample. We discuss implications for child mental health policy; educational outreach to providers, youth, and families; and the development or adaptation of evidence-based interventions that target the effects of this widespread, harmful, yet often overlooked form of maltreatment.","[{'authorId': '3877167', 'name': 'Joseph Spinazzola'}, {'authorId': '32719063', 'name': 'Hilary Hodgdon'}, {'authorId': '2093129', 'name': 'L.

This observation indicates that behavior often rejects the moral approach to deception. As St. Augustine wrote, “To me, however, it seems certain that every lie is a sin. . . ” (St. Augustine, 421). Later, philosophers like Immanuel Kant (1787) again adopted this uncompromising moral stance when arguing against lying. At the other extreme, economic theory is built on the assumption of “homo economicus,” a figure who acts selfishly and is unconcerned about the well-being of others. An implication of this assumption is that lies will be told whenever it is beneficial for the liar, regardless of their effect on the other party. Another implication is that there is no negative outcome associated with lying per se. This assumption is very useful in many economic models. Consider contract theory, where it is assumed that without an explicit contract, neither side will fulfill its respective obligations. For example, George Akerlof’s (1970) paper on asymmetric information and the market for lemons assumes that sellers of used cars will always lie if it is in their benefit to do so. In the mechanism design literature (e.g., Bengt Holmstrom, 1979), the standard assumption is that people will tell the truth only if this is incentive-compatible given material outcomes. In the literature on tax evasion, the choice of whether to avoid paying taxes is considered a decision under uncertainty; cost is treated as a product of the probability of being caught and the cost of punishment, whereas benefit is simply the money saved by avoiding payment. However, there is no cost associated with the very act of lying (Michael Alingham and Agnar Sandmo, 1972). Another example is the game theoretic treatment of “cheap talk” (Crawford and Joel Sobel, 1982). An intermediate approach is taken by utilitarian philosophers (e.g., Jeremy Bentham, 1789). Utilitarianism prescribes that, when choosing whether to lie, one should weigh benefits against harm, and happiness against unhappiness. As Martin Luther stated, “What harm would it do, if a man told a good strong lie for the sake of the good and for the Christian church. . . a lie out of necessity, a useful lie, a helpful lie, such lies would not be against God, he would accept them.” Similarly to the economic theory approach, this type of calculation implies that lies, apart from their resultant harm and benefit, are in themselves neutral. A lie and a truthful statement that achieve the same monetary payoffs (for both sides) are considered * Graduate School of Business, University of Chicago, 5807 South Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago, IL 60637 (e-mail: uri.gneezy.gsb.uchicago.edu).

Ira Leybman provided valuable help in running the experiment. I became interested in deception when my father was terminally ill and his physicians created in him a belief that they considered to be untrue. I dedicate this paper to his memory. 1 Important deviations from this assumption in economic modeling are found in Kenneth Arrow’s (1972) discussion of trust, Gary Becker’s (1976) modeling of altruistic preferences, and Akerlof’s (1982) study of the fair-wage hypothesis. For a general discussion, see Becker (1993): “The economic approach I refer to does not assume that individuals are motivated solely by selfishness or material gain. It is a method of analysis, not an assumption about particular motivations. Along with others, I have tried to pry economists away from narrow assumptions about self-interest. Behavior is driven by a much richer set of values and preferences” (p. 385). 2 Note that this does not mean that a completely selfish person will always lie. There may be strategic reasons not to lie. For example, see the David Kreps and Robert Wilson (1982) discussion of reputation and imperfect information; see also Vincent P. Crawford (2003). 3 Cited by his secretary, in a letter in Max Lenz, ed., Briefwechsel Landgraf Phillips des Grossmuthigen von Hessen mit Bucer, Vol. 1.","[{'authorId': '2852955', 'name': 'U.

c8727cafcc5c64ea87fdafaef8201659225aeca0,"Time-stable personality traits, such as impulsivity and its relationship with functional and structural brain alterations, have gained much attention in the recent literature. Evidence from functional neuroimaging data implies an association between impulsivity and cortical as well as subcortical areas of the reward system. Discounting future rewards during impulsive decisions can be related to activation in the orbitofrontal cortex and striatum. Cortical structural changes in prefrontal regions have been found for introspective impulsivity measures. The present study focuses on brain regions associated with delay discounting to investigate structural manifestations of trait impulsivity. To test this, seventy subjects underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) followed by a behavioral delay discounting task outside of the scanner to measure impulsivity with questions like: “Would you like to have 3€ immediately or 10€ in 5 days?”. The amount of smaller-but-sooner decisions was calculated and used as a measure of behavioral impulsivity. Furthermore, we estimated subject’s individual delay discounting parameter K reflecting the tendency to discount future rewards. Behaviorally, we found strong evidence in favor of a discounting utility model compared to a standard hyperbolic model of choice valuation. Neuronally, we focused on cortical and subcortical brain structure and investigated the association of behavioral impulsivity with delay discounting tendencies and gray matter volume. Voxel-based morphometric analyses showed positive correlations between delay discounting and gray matter volume in the striatum. Additional analyses using Freesurfer provided evidence for a positive correlation between delay discounting and gray matter volume of the caudate. Taken together, our study provides strong evidence for a structural manifestation of time-stable trait impulsivity in the human brain.","[{'authorId': '5567672', 'name': 'M.

Social robots as tutoring agents have the potential to mitigate those behaviors by actively shaping productive help-seeking behaviors. We hypothesize that effectual help-seeking behavior is a critical contributor to learning gains in a robot-child tutoring interaction. We conduct a between-subjects study where children interacted with a social robot solving fractions problems over multiple sessions (29 children; 4 sessions per child) in one of two groups. Results showed that participants in our experimental group, who received adaptive shaping strategies from the robot targeting suboptimal help requests, reduced their suboptimal behaviors over time significantly more than a control group, as well as improved their scores from pretest to posttest significantly more than a control group.","[{'authorId': '2764097', 'name': 'Aditi Ramachandran'}, {'authorId': '3003959', 'name': 'Alexandru Litoiu'}, {'authorId': '1792053', 'name': 'B.

This information can be used by clinicians to inform service planning and care pathways. Aims: The aim of this study was to review published empirical research investigating the potential mechanisms underlying therapeutic change in Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) and Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) for BPD. Method: A thorough search of the PsychInfo, CINAHL Plus, PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases revealed research into potential mechanisms of change. Results: A total of 52 abstracts were reviewed. After a full text screen of the most relevant studies, 14 met inclusion criteria. Twelve examined DBT and two CBT. Mechanisms of change identified broadly fell into three categories: emotion regulation/self-control, skills use and therapeutic alliance/investment in treatment. Outcomes measured included general mental health diagnoses (e.g. anxiety, depression) and BPD-specific symptoms (e.g. self-harm/suicidality, impulsivity, substance misuse, anger). Conclusion: Further empirically robust research is required to test hypotheses about the influence of the proposed mechanisms on therapeutic change in psychological therapies for BPD.","[{'authorId': '46616616', 'name': 'S.

c8e377a81ad22cbb4d7d7229e64f71730554d3d9,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been proposed for experimental and therapeutic modulation of regional brain function. Specifically, anodal tDCS of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) together with cathodal tDCS of the supraorbital region have been associated with improvement of cognition and mood, and have been suggested for the treatment of several neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although modeled mathematically, the distribution, direction, and extent of tDCS-mediated effects on brain physiology are not well understood. The current study investigates whether tDCS of the human prefrontal cortex modulates resting-state network (RSN) connectivity measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Thirteen healthy subjects underwent real and sham tDCS in random order on separate days. tDCS was applied for 20 min at 2 mA with the anode positioned over the left DLPFC and the cathode over the right supraorbital region. Patterns of resting-state brain connectivity were assessed before and after tDCS with 3 T fMRI, and changes were analyzed for relevant networks related to the stimulation–electrode localizations. At baseline, four RSNs were detected, corresponding to the default mode network (DMN), the left and right frontal-parietal networks (FPNs) and the self-referential network. After real tDCS and compared with sham tDCS, significant changes of regional brain connectivity were found for the DMN and the FPNs both close to the primary stimulation site and in connected brain regions. These findings show that prefrontal tDCS modulates resting-state functional connectivity in distinct functional networks of the human brain.","[{'authorId': '2165558', 'name': 'D.

If the sequence is used as a coding unit, the complexity of the coding scheme will be low but so will the amount of information in the data. If the utterance is used as a coding unit, it is possible to apply full coding (i.e., all utterances are coded) or selective coding (only relevant utterances are coded). Full coding of utterances with preservation of sequence information is by far the most laborintensive but also the most informative, as a lot of information can be derived from sequence analyses.

The first study investigated subjective feelings and behavioral affiliation tendencies in response to ostracism using a cyberball paradigm. Sixty-nine participants were assessed who differed with respect to IS. The second study examined habitual emotion regulation processes focusing on suppression and reappraisal as well as IS in 116 participants. Main results were that the effect of ostracism on distress and behavioral affiliation tendencies were qualified by IS—being ostracized had less impact on participants with stronger IS.

Our study seeks to examine the role of emotional regulation and cognitive control as possible mediators of the association between mindfulness and perceived stress.

Fifty older adults and fifty young adults were recruited for the study and completed self-report measures assessing mindfulness disposition, perceived stress, and emotional regulation. In addition, computerized measures of cognitive control assessing working memory, inhibitory control, and set-shifting were also administered. We hypothesized a negative correlation between mindfulness disposition and perceived stress such that participants reporting higher levels of dispositional mindfulness would report lower stress. In addition, we hypothesized increased difficulties in emotion regulation and lower cognitive control to mediate this relationship. Corroborating previous literature, results revealed that mindfulness disposition and perceived stress were negatively correlated in both groups. However, emotion regulation, but not cognitive control, was found to mediate the relationship between mindfulness and perceived stress in both groups.

In particular, we tested a 2-component model of teachers' need for relatedness, with representation of the need for relatedness with students and the need for relatedness with colleagues. One thousand and forty-nine teachers participated in 3 studies. In Study 1 (n = 409), we tested a model that examined how perceptions of autonomy support are associated with teachers' relatedness with colleagues and students and how relatedness subsequently predicts teaching engagement and emotional exhaustion. In Study 2 (n = 455), we tested a full SDT model, hypothesizing that perceptions of autonomy support lead to satisfaction of teachers' needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness with colleagues and students, which in turn lead to teachers' engagement and expression of emotions (anxiety, anger, and enjoyment). In Study 3 (n = 185), we used scenarios to test participants' beliefs about 2 hypothesized teachers, 1 with high student and low peer relatedness and the other with low student and high peer relatedness. Results from the 3 studies consistently emphasize the finding that for teachers, satisfaction of the need for relatedness with students leads to higher levels of engagement and positive emotions, and lower levels of negative emotions, than does satisfaction of the need for relatedness with peers.","[{'authorId': '36206919', 'name': 'R.

The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function—Preschool version (BRIEF-P) is intended to assess 5 distinct components of EF in preschool age children. In this study, a series of factor analyses was conducted with teacher-reported EF of 2,367 preschool students to assess the structure of the BRIEF-P, and the predictive relations between the resulting factors and children’s academic abilities and behavioral self-regulation were assessed to test the construct and convergent validity of the BRIEF-P scores. Results yielded mixed findings concerning the structure of the BRIEF-P and validity of its resultant scores. Results of the factor analyses indicated that the items of the BRIEF-P did not map onto factors in the way that would be expected based on its item-to-subscale mapping. The best solutions were a 4-factor and a bifactor model. The 4-factor solution revealed substantial correlations between factors, and although the bifactor solution identified a General Self-Regulation factor that explained variance in responses across items, this general factor did not account for all of the overlap among specific factors. Analyses of the relations for the factors from the correlated-factors and the bifactor models indicated that the majority of the factors had limited convergent validity with academic ability or with a measure of behavior self-regulation. Overall, these findings call into question the validity of aspects of BRIEF-P.","[{'authorId': '3905717', 'name': 'J. Spiegel'}, {'authorId': '5136064', 'name': 'C.

Investigating behaviors related to these outcomes could produce insights into how the activities work. The aim of this study was to systematically investigate behaviors seen in people with dementia during group activity with the seal robot Paro, differences in behaviors related to severity of dementia, and to explore changes in behaviors. Methods: Thirty participants from five NHs formed groups of five to six participants at each NH. Group sessions with Paro lasted for 30 minutes twice a week during 12 weeks of intervention. Video recordings were conducted in the second and tenth week. An ethogram, containing 18 accurately defined and described behaviors, mapped the participants’ behaviors. Duration of behaviors, such as “Observing Paro,” “Conversation with Paro on the lap,” “Smile/laughter toward other participants,” were converted to percentage of total session time and analyzed statistically. Results: “Observing Paro” was observed more often in participants with mild to moderate dementia (p = 0.019), while the variable “Observing other things” occurred more in the group of severe dementia (p = 0.042). “Smile/laughter toward other participants” showed an increase (p = 0.011), and “Conversations with Paro on the lap” showed a decrease (p = 0.014) during the intervention period. Conclusions: Participants with severe dementia seemed to have difficulty in maintaining attention toward Paro during the group session. In the group as a whole, Paro seemed to be a mediator for increased social interactions and created engagement.","[{'authorId': '1421958011', 'name': 'N.

cb5c440ce4cdfbda3ad2fb197f5d4a247fdaf005,"Significance Emotions coordinate our behavior and physiological states during survival-salient events and pleasurable interactions. Even though we are often consciously aware of our current emotional state, such as anger or happiness, the mechanisms giving rise to these subjective sensations have remained unresolved. Here we used a topographical self-report tool to reveal that different emotional states are associated with topographically distinct and culturally universal bodily sensations; these sensations could underlie our conscious emotional experiences. Monitoring the topography of emotion-triggered bodily sensations brings forth a unique tool for emotion research and could even provide a biomarker for emotional disorders. Emotions are often felt in the body, and somatosensory feedback has been proposed to trigger conscious emotional experiences. Here we reveal maps of bodily sensations associated with different emotions using a unique topographical self-report method. In five experiments, participants (n = 701) were shown two silhouettes of bodies alongside emotional words, stories, movies, or facial expressions. They were asked to color the bodily regions whose activity they felt increasing or decreasing while viewing each stimulus. Different emotions were consistently associated with statistically separable bodily sensation maps across experiments. These maps were concordant across West European and East Asian samples. Statistical classifiers distinguished emotion-specific activation maps accurately, confirming independence of topographies across emotions. We propose that emotions are represented in the somatosensory system as culturally universal categorical somatotopic maps. Perception of these emotion-triggered bodily changes may play a key role in generating consciously felt emotions.","[{'authorId': '2036051', 'name': 'L.

All the authors and investigators of dementia studies who provided us more specific data from their work. foreword Today, over 46 million people live with dementia worldwide, more than the population of Spain. This number is estimated to increase to 131.5 million by 2050. Dementia also has a huge economic impact. Today, the total estimated worldwide cost of dementia is US $818 billion, and it will become a trillion dollar disease by 2018. This means that if dementia care were a country, it would be the world's 18th largest economy, more than the market values of companies such as Apple (US$ 742 billion), Google (US$ 368 billion) and Exxon (US$ 357 billion). In many parts of the world, there is a growing awareness of dementia, but across the globe it remains the case that a diagnosis of dementia can bring with it stigma and social isolation. Today, we estimate that 94% of people living with dementia in low and middle income countries are cared for at home. These are regions where health and care systems often provide limited or no support to people living with dementia or to their families. The 2015 World Alzheimer Report updates data on the prevalence, incidence, cost and trends of dementia worldwide. It also estimates how these numbers will increase in the future, leaving us with no doubt that dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and other causes, is one of the biggest global public health and social care challenges facing people today and in the future. The two organisations we lead are ADI, the only worldwide federation of Alzheimer associations and global voice on dementia, and Bupa, a purpose-driven global health and care company that is the leading international provider of specialist dementia care, caring for around 60,000 people living with dementia each year. Together, we are committed to ensuring that dementia becomes an international health priority. We believe national dementia plans are the first step towards ensuring all countries are equipped to enable people to live well with dementia, and help to reduce the risk of dementia for future generations. There is now a growing list of countries which have such provision in place or which are developing national dementia plans, but it's not enough.

We explore feasibility and acceptability of integrating SR technology into pediatric health care. BrightcoveDefaultPlayer10.1542/6138651198001PEDS-VA_2018-1511 Video Abstract BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Social robots (SRs) are increasingly present in medical and educational contexts, but their use in inpatient pediatric settings has not been demonstrated in studies. In this study, we aimed to (1) describe the introduction of SR technology into the pediatric inpatient setting through an innovative partnership among a pediatric teaching hospital, robotics development, and computational behavioral science laboratories and (2) present feasibility and acceptability data. METHODS: Fifty-four children ages 3 to 10 years were randomly exposed to 1 of 3 interventions: (1) interactive SR teddy bear; (2) tablet-based avatar version of the bear; or (3) plush teddy bear with human presence. We monitored intervention enrollment and completion patterns, obtained qualitative feedback on acceptability of SR use from child life–specialist stakeholders, and assessed children’s positive and negative affect, anxiety, and pain intensity pre- and postintervention. RESULTS: The intervention was well received and appeared feasible, with 93% of those enrolled completing the study (with 80% complete parent data). Children exposed to the SR reported more positive affect relative to those who received a plush animal. SR interactions were characterized by greater levels of joyfulness and agreeableness than comparison interventions. Child life specialist stakeholders reported numerous potential benefits of SR technology in the pediatric setting. CONCLUSIONS: The SR appears to be an engaging tool that may provide new ways to address the emotional needs of hospitalized children, potentially increasing access to emotionally targeted interventions. Rigorous development and validation of SR technology in pediatrics could ultimately lead to scalable and cost-effective tools to improve the patient care experience.","[{'authorId': '2394873', 'name': 'D.

Our aim was to quantitatively summarize overlap and divergence in regions of altered brain activation associated with depression under emotionally valenced compared to cognitively demanding task conditions, and with reference to intrinsic functional connectivity. We hypothesized differences reflective of task demands. A co-ordinate-based meta-analysis technique, activation likelihood estimation, was used to analyze relevant imaging literature. These studies compared brain activity in depressed adults relative to healthy controls during three conditions: (i) emotionally valenced (cognitively easy) tasks (n = 29); (ii) cognitively demanding tasks (n = 15); and (iii) resting conditions (n = 21). The meta-analyses identified five, eight, and seven significant clusters of altered brain activity under emotion, cognition, and resting conditions, respectively, in depressed individuals compared to healthy controls. Regions of overlap and divergence between pairs of the three separate meta-analyses were quantified. There were no significant regions of overlap between emotion and cognition meta-analyses, but several divergent clusters were found. Cognitively demanding conditions were associated with greater activation of right medial frontal and insula regions while bilateral amygdala was more significantly altered during emotion (cognitively undemanding) conditions; consistent with task demands. Overlap was present in left amygdala and right subcallosal cingulate between emotion and resting meta-analyses, with no significant divergence. Our meta-analyses highlight alteration of common brain regions, during cognitively undemanding emotional tasks and resting conditions but divergence of regions between emotional and cognitively demanding tasks. Regions altered reflect current biological and system-level models of depression and highlight the relationship with task condition and difficulty.","[{'authorId': '28051825', 'name': 'S.

Frequency and duration of peer interaction behaviours were coded. In terms of duration, multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) indicated that participants with ASD spent more time engaged in solitary behaviours, less time engaged in co-operative interaction with peers, and more time engaging in reactive aggression towards peers than either comparison group. In terms of frequency, similar patterns emerged, but additionally participants with ASD engaged in fewer instances of rough/vigorous play, and were subject to more instances of social initiation and instrumental verbal aggression by peers than either comparison group.

Whereas, most research on this topic has been conducted with the 26-item Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), a briefer 12-item version of the instrument, the Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form (SCS-SF), also exists. The SCS-SF has demonstrated good validity and reliability in non-clinical samples, but it has not been used often in research with psychotherapy clients. This study was designed to examine the factor structure and construct validity of the SCS-SF in a clinical population. Data for this study were collected from 1609 college students receiving services at 10 campus counseling centers. The previously proposed factor structure of the SCS-SF was not supported. Instead, analyses revealed two factors, Self Care and Self Disparagement. Evidence for the construct validity of these factors was found via expected relationships with indices of depression, anxiety, social anxiety, hostility, academic distress, eating concerns, family distress, maladaptive perfectionism, suicidality, self-injurious behavior, and social support. SCS-SF scores were unrelated to various measures of substance use. Implications for clinical work and future research are discussed.","[{'authorId': '7441978', 'name': 'J.

However, there remain research issues and challenges that need to be addressed to fully realize the potential benefits of robot-assisted therapy. This systematic review categorizes and summarizes the literature related to robot educational/training interventions and provides a conceptual framework for collecting and classifying these articles. The challenges identified in this review are classified into four levels: robot-level, algorithm-level, experimental-research-level, and application-level challenges. The review highlights possible future research directions and offers crucial insights for researchers interested in using robots in therapy. The most relevant findings suggest that robot-assisted therapy has the potential to improve social interaction, communication, and emotional regulation skills in children with ASD. Addressing these challenges and seeking new research avenues will be critical to advancing the field of robot-assisted therapy and improving outcomes for children with ASD.

This mimicry, also called entrainment, is associated with rapport and smoother social interaction. Because rapport in learning scenarios has been shown to lead to improved learning outcomes, we examined whether enabling a social robotic learning companion to perform rapport-building behaviors could improve children's learning and engagement during a storytelling activity. We enabled the social robot to perform two specific rapport and relationship-building behaviors: speech entrainment and self-disclosure (shared personal information in the form of a backstory about the robot's poor speech and hearing abilities). We recruited 86 children aged 3–8 years to interact with the robot in a 2 × 2 between-subjects experimental study testing the effects of robot entrainment Entrainment vs. No entrainment and backstory about abilities Backstory vs. No Backstory. The robot engaged the children one-on-one in conversation, told a story embedded with key vocabulary words, and asked children to retell the story. We measured children's recall of the key words and their emotions during the interaction, examined their story retellings, and asked children questions about their relationship with the robot. We found that the robot's entrainment led children to show more positive emotions and fewer negative emotions. Children who heard the robot's backstory were more likely to accept the robot's poor hearing abilities. Entrainment paired with backstory led children to use more of the key words and match more of the robot's phrases in their story retells. Furthermore, these children were more likely to consider the robot more human-like and were more likely to comply with one of the robot's requests. These results suggest that the robot's speech entrainment and backstory increased children's engagement and enjoyment in the interaction, improved their perception of the relationship, and contributed to children's success at retelling the story.","[{'authorId': '2716110', 'name': 'J.

Integrating conservation of resources (Hobfoll, 2002) and ego depletion (Muraven & Baumeister, 2000) theories, we propose that this creates a resource loss spiral that can be slowed by the presence of a ""climate of authenticity"" among one's coworkers. We describe this climate and how it differs from other work climates. We then propose that a work unit with a climate of authenticity should provide a self-regulatory break from emotional labor with patients, thus replenishing resources and buffering against strain from emotional labor. We tested this multilevel prediction by surveying 359 health care providers nested within 48 work units at a large, metropolitan hospital. We find that medical workers experiencing more mistreatment by patients are more likely to be managing emotions with patients, and this response further contributes to the employees' job-related burnout. As predicted, managing emotions with patients was unrelated to burnout for workers in a unit with a climate of authenticity.","[{'authorId': '5248218', 'name': 'Alicia A.

Mother–child dyads participated in the parent–child emotion interaction task (Shipman & Zeman, 1999) in which they talked about emotionally-arousing situations. The PCEIT was coded for maternal validation and invalidation in response to children's emotion. Mothers were also interviewed about their approach to emotion socialization using the meta-emotion interview-parent version (Katz & Gottman, 1999). The meta-emotion interview-parent version was coded for maternal emotion coaching. Mothers also completed measures that assessed their child abuse potential and abuse-related behaviors as well as children's emotion regulation. Findings indicated that maltreated children demonstrated fewer adaptive emotion regulation skills and more emotion dysregulation than non-maltreated children. In addition, maltreating mothers engaged in less validation and emotion coaching and more invalidation in response to children's emotion than non-maltreating mothers. Finally, maternal emotion socialization behaviors mediated the relation between maltreatment status and children's adaptive emotion regulation skills.","[{'authorId': '6924992', 'name': 'Kimberly L Shipman'}, {'authorId': '4394377', 'name': 'Renee A.

Drawing on evolutionary accounts of human face perception suggesting that the face width-to-height ratio (fWHR: bizygomatic width divided by upper-face height) can signal dominance and affect its overall evaluation, this research is based on the premise that product faces are perceived in much the same way as human faces. Five experiments tested this premise. Results suggest that like human faces, product faces with high (vs. low) fWHR are perceived as more dominant. However, while human faces with high fWHR are liked less, product faces with high fWHR are liked more as revealed by consumer preference and willingness-to-pay scores. The greater preference for the high fWHR product faces is motivated by the consumers’ desire to enhance and signal their own dominant status as evidenced by the moderating effects of type of goal and of usage context. Brand managers and product designers may be particularly interested in these findings since a simple design feature can have potentially significant marketplace impact, as was also confirmed by the field data obtained from secondary sources.","[{'authorId': '94525313', 'name': 'Ahreum Maeng'}, {'authorId': '2109344', 'name': 'P.

The success of these robots - whether in motivating users to adhere to a diet regimen or in encouraging them to follow evacuation procedures in the case of a fire - will rely largely on their ability to persuade people. Research in a range of areas from political communication to education suggest that the nonverbal behaviors of a human speaker play a key role in the persuasiveness of the speaker's message and the listeners' compliance with it. In this paper, we explore how a robot might effectively use these behaviors, particularly vocal and bodily cues, to persuade users. In an experiment with 32 participants, we evaluate how manipulations in a robot's use of nonverbal cues affected participants' perceptions of the robot's persuasiveness and their compliance with the robot's suggestions across four conditions: (1) no vocal or bodily cues, (2) vocal cues only, (3) bodily cues only, and (4) vocal and bodily cues. The results showed that participants complied with the robot's suggestions significantly more when it used nonverbal cues than they did when it did not use these cues and that bodily cues were more effective in persuading participants than vocal cues were. Our model of persuasive nonverbal cues and experimental results have direct implications for the design of persuasive behaviors for humanlike robots.","[{'authorId': '2002462', 'name': 'Vijay Chidambaram'}, {'authorId': '37589777', 'name': 'Yueh-Hsuan Chiang'}, {'authorId': '145656551', 'name': 'Bilge Mutlu'}]",234.0,,59.0,Designing persuasive robots: How robots might persuade people using vocal and nonverbal cues,2012.0

It empirically examines the relationship between emotional labour and STS; and, explores the moderational role of emotional regulation strategies.

Fifty-one percent of participants reported high levels of STS. Data analysed using hierarchical multiple regression revealed that age, surface acting, and expressive suppression significantly predicted STS. Deep acting predicted STS only for those participants who reported high levels of STS. Cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression did not moderate the relationship between emotional labour and STS. Limitations of the study mainly relate to its small sample size. It contributes to the literature by highlighting high levels of STS among AMHPs and providing a rationale for future research on the construct.

The model was applied on the NAO robot to teach vocabulary to children while playing the popular game ‘Snakes and Ladders’. We conducted an exploratory evaluation of our model with 24 children at a primary school for 2 weeks to verify its impact on children’s long-term social engagement and overall vocabulary learning. Our preliminary results showed that the behaviour generated based on our model was able to sustain social engagement. In addition, it also helped children to improve their vocabulary. We also evaluated the impact of the positive, negative and neutral emotional feedback of the NAO robot on children’s vocabulary learning. Three groups of children (eight per group) interacted with the robot on four separate occasions over a period of 2 weeks. Our results showed that the condition where the robot displayed positive emotional feedback had a significantly positive effect on the child’s vocabulary learning performance as compared to the two other conditions: negative feedback and neutral feedback.","[{'authorId': '34221329', 'name': 'M.

Based on the parenting literature, four main dimensions of parenting are identified that are relevant to the study of emotional intelligence: parental responsiveness, parental positive demandingness, parental negative demandingness, and parental emotion-related coaching. Parental responsiveness, parental emotion-related coaching, and parental positive demandingness are related to children’s higher emotional intelligence, while parental negative demandingness is related to children’s lower emotional intelligence.

We summarize our prior work, in which we identify nonverbal cues that signal untrustworthy behavior and also demonstrate the human mind's readiness to interpret those cues to assess the trustworthiness of a social robot. We demonstrate that domain knowledge gained from our prior work using human-subjects experiments, when incorporated into the feature engineering process, permits a computational model to outperform both human predictions and a baseline model built in naiveté of this domain knowledge. We then present the construction of hidden Markov models to investigate temporal relationships among the trust-related nonverbal cues. By interpreting the resulting learned structure, we observe that models built to emulate different levels of trust exhibit different sequences of nonverbal cues. From this observation, we derived sequence-based temporal features that further improve the accuracy of our computational model. Our multi-step research process presented in this paper combines the strength of experimental manipulation and machine learning to not only design a computational trust model but also to further our understanding of the dynamics of interpersonal trust.","[{'authorId': '2108560159', 'name': 'Jin Joo Lee'}, {'authorId': '144288136', 'name': 'W.

The neural mechanisms underlying this switch between activation and deactivation of large-scale brain networks remain completely unknown. Here, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the mechanisms underlying switching of brain networks in three different experiments. We first examined this switching process in an auditory event segmentation task. We observed significant activation of the CEN and deactivation of the DMN, along with activation of a third network comprising the right fronto-insular cortex (rFIC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), when participants perceived salient auditory event boundaries. Using chronometric techniques and Granger causality analysis, we show that the rFIC-ACC network, and the rFIC, in particular, plays a critical and causal role in switching between the CEN and the DMN. We replicated this causal connectivity pattern in two additional experiments: (i) a visual attention “oddball” task and (ii) a task-free resting state. These results indicate that the rFIC is likely to play a major role in switching between distinct brain networks across task paradigms and stimulus modalities. Our findings have important implications for a unified view of network mechanisms underlying both exogenous and endogenous cognitive control.","[{'authorId': '2570374', 'name': 'D.

During the in-home study, several types of data was collected, including robotic sensor data from a collar worn by the robot, daily activity levels via a wristband (Jawbone) worn by the older adults, and weekly health outcome measures. Results of data analysis of the robotic intervention suggest that: 1) the use of the Paro robot in participants' homes significantly reduced the symptoms of depression for a majority of patients, and that 2) weekly fluctuations in patient depression levels can be predicted using a combination of robotic sensor data and Jawbone activity data (i.e. measuring their general activity levels and their interactions with the robot).","[{'authorId': '2439194', 'name': 'Casey C.

To understand this dichotomy, this paper reviews current challenges surrounding user engagement with mental health smartphone apps. While smartphone engagement metrics and reporting remains heterogeneous in the literature, focusing on themes offers a framework to identify underlying trends. These themes suggest that apps are not designed with service users in mind, do not solve problems users care most about, do not respect privacy, are not seen as trustworthy and are unhelpful in emergencies. Respecting these current issues surrounding mental health app engagement, we propose several solutions and highlight successful examples of mental health apps with high engagement. Further research is necessary to better characterise engagement with mental health apps and identify best practices for design, testing and implementation.","[{'authorId': '4058196', 'name': 'J.

We investigated the minimal conditions under which people make such inferences. In five experiments, each focusing on a specific trait judgment, we manipulated the exposure time of unfamiliar faces. Judgments made after a 100-ms exposure correlated highly with judgments made in the absence of time constraints, suggesting that this exposure time was sufficient for participants to form an impression. In fact, for all judgments—attractiveness, likeability, trustworthiness, competence, and aggressiveness—increased exposure time did not significantly increase the correlations. When exposure time increased from 100 to 500 ms, participants' judgments became more negative, response times for judgments decreased, and confidence in judgments increased. When exposure time increased from 500 to 1,000 ms, trait judgments and response times did not change significantly (with one exception), but confidence increased for some of the judgments; this result suggests that additional time may simply boost confidence in judgments.

Previous studies suggest that the level of clinical insight in schizophrenia patients is related to working memory functions. However, these studies were not specifically concerned with the components of working memory and had not focused in detail on working memory functions. For this reason, the current study investigated the relationship between clinical insight and working memory components in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.  METHOD: The patient group was evaluated by using the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms, the Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms, and the Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder to measure clinical insight. Moreover, all participants underwent a ""Situation Awareness"" test in order to measure working memory functions. Based on published data, the first stage of this test was accepted to measure the ""visual spatial sketchpad"" component of working memory, and the second stage was accepted to measure the ""episodic buffer"" (bound information storage) component. The functions of these components were measured separately as top-down and bottom-up cognitive processes.  RESULTS: The episodic buffer function (managed by the bottom-up cognitive process) was related with clinical insight. This relationship also continued after correcting for the effect of positive symptoms on insight. The patients performed worse than the controls in terms of visual spatial sketchpad function, which was managed by both topdown and bottom-up cognitive processes. The patients performed worse than the controls in terms of both top-down and bottom-up cognitive processes and visual spatial sketchpad function. Furthermore, the patients were also worse than the controls in terms of episodic buffer function (managed by top-down cognitive processes).  CONCLUSION: Clinical insight may be associated with binding function (associated with episodic buffer function) managed by bottom-up cognitive processes in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Further studies are necessary to confirm this novel finding.","[{'authorId': '4466743', 'name': 'Selim Tümkaya'}, {'authorId': '1486170456', 'name': 'Ezgi Hancı Yenigün'}, {'authorId': '84526238', 'name': 'Osman Zülkif Topak'}, {'authorId': '8579204', 'name': 'İbrahim Şendur'}, {'authorId': '134525178', 'name': 'Neşe Öztürk Atkaya'}, {'authorId': '5992902', 'name': 'Osman Özdel'}]",4.0,,0.0,[Is Clinical Insight Associated with Working Memory Components in Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective Disorder?],2019.0

Yet, it is unclear how AI activity correlates with feelings during social emotions, and whether this correlation may be influenced by culture, as studies correlating real-time AI activity with visceral states and feelings have focused on Western subjects feeling physical pain or basic disgust. Given psychological evidence that social-emotional feelings are cognitively constructed within cultural frames, we asked Chinese and American participants to report their feeling strength to admiration and compassion-inducing narratives during fMRI with simultaneous electrocardiogram recording. Trial-by-trial, cardiac arousal and feeling strength correlated with ventral and dorsal AI activity bilaterally but predicted different variance, suggesting that interoception and social-emotional feeling construction are concurrent but dissociable AI functions. Further, although the variance that correlated with cardiac arousal did not show cultural effects, the variance that correlated with feelings did. Feeling strength was especially associated with ventral AI activity (the autonomic modulatory sector) in the Chinese group but with dorsal AI activity (the visceral-somatosensory/cognitive sector) in an American group not of Asian descent. This cultural group difference held after controlling for posterior insula (PI) activity and was replicated. A bi-cultural East-Asian American group showed intermediate results. The findings help elucidate how the AI supports feelings and suggest that previous reports that dorsal AI activation reflects feeling strength are culture related.

Specifically, it was hypothesized that the relations between childhood physical and emotional neglect and eating disorder symptoms would be mediated by alexithymia. Participants (N = 1344) completed self-report measures through an online system. Four moderated mediation models were tested to examine our proposed mediation model in the context of potential gender differences. Consistent with prediction, our analyses revealed significant associations between childhood physical and emotional neglect and 2 types of disordered eating symptoms, and alexithymia mediated these relationships. Contrary to our hypothesis, gender moderated the relationship between alexithymia and binge eating, but not drive for muscularity. Childhood neglect, both physical and emotional, was associated with higher levels of binge eating in women, but not men.

They do not only have to operate efficiently and safely in natural, populated environments, but also be able to achieve higher levels of cooperation and communication with humans. Human–robot collaboration (HRC) is a research field with a wide range of applications, future scenarios, and potentially a high economic impact. HRC is an interdisciplinary research area comprising classical robotics, cognitive sciences, and psychology. This paper gives a survey of the state of the art of HRC. Established methods for intention estimation, action planning, joint action, and machine learning are presented together with existing guidelines to hardware design.

d082f64b8a0a07d105207eb822be58ffb61b353a,"Recognizing people's emotions from their frame of reference is very important in our everyday life. This capacity helps us to perceive or predict the subsequent actions of people, interact effectively with them and to be sympathetic and sensitive toward them. Hence, one should expect that a machine needs to have a similar capability of understanding people's feelings in order to correctly interact with humans. Current research on emotion recognition has focused on the analysis of facial expressions. However, recognizing emotions requires also understanding the scene in which a person is immersed. The unavailability of suitable data to study such a problem has made research in emotion recognition in context difficult. In this paper, we present the EMOTIC database (from EMOTions In Context), a database of images with people in real environments, annotated with their apparent emotions. We defined an extended list of 26 emotion categories to annotate the images, and combined these annotations with three common continuous dimensions: Valence, Arousal, and Dominance. Images in the database are annotated using the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) platform. The resulting set contains 18,313 images with 23,788 annotated people. The goal of this paper is to present the EMOTIC database, detailing how it was created and the information available. We expect this dataset can help to open up new horizons on creating systems able of recognizing rich information about people's apparent emotional states.","[{'authorId': '24320514', 'name': 'Ronak Kosti'}, {'authorId': '2974008', 'name': 'J.

d089b83003dc01509f7f2ed79074c40886feceb3,"We designed a robot system that assisted in behavioral intervention programs of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The eight‐session intervention program was based on the discrete trial teaching protocol and focused on two basic social skills: eye contact and facial emotion recognition. The robotic interactions occurred in four modules: training element query, recognition of human activity, coping‐mode selection, and follow‐up action. Children with ASD who were between 4 and 7 years old and who had verbal IQ ≥ 60 were recruited and randomly assigned to the treatment group (TG, n = 8, 5.75 ± 0.89 years) or control group (CG, n = 7; 6.32 ± 1.23 years). The therapeutic robot facilitated the treatment intervention in the TG, and the human assistant facilitated the treatment intervention in the CG. The intervention procedures were identical in both groups. The primary outcome measures included parent‐completed questionnaires, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), and frequency of eye contact, which was measured with the partial interval recording method. After completing treatment, the eye contact percentages were significantly increased in both groups. For facial emotion recognition, the percentages of correct answers were increased in similar patterns in both groups compared to baseline (P > 0.05), with no difference between the TG and CG (P > 0.05). The subjects’ ability to play, general behavioral and emotional symptoms were significantly diminished after treatment (p < 0.05). These results showed that the robot‐facilitated and human‐facilitated behavioral interventions had similar positive effects on eye contact and facial emotion recognition, which suggested that robots are useful mediators of social skills training for children with ASD.

However, few studies examine the use of the approach as part of a comprehensive school improvement process involving academic as well as behavioral goals, particularly with regard to use of data-driven decision making and data teams. This article describes the efforts of a low-performing middle school in establishing preventative measures and interventions within such a framework. Results indicate a reduction in teacher discipline referrals and student suspensions, including those involving students with disabilities and statistically significant improvement on 30 of 47 items of a school climate and student resiliency survey. In addition, school scores on state mastery tests in both reading and math improved by 25% and 11%, respectively. This study suggests that the implementation of a SWPBS framework may result in improved academic and behavioral outcomes for all students.","[{'authorId': '113653248', 'name': 'Edmund J.

This memory model enables the companion to remember events that are relevant or significant to itself or to the user. For other events which are either ethically sensitive or with a lower long-term value, the memory model supports forgetting through the processes of generalisation and memory restructuring. The proposed memory model draws inspiration from the human short-term and long-term memories. The short-term memory will support companions in focusing on the stimuli that are relevant to their current active goals within the environment. The long-term memory will contain episodic events that are chronologically sequenced and derived from the companion's interaction history both with the environment and the user. There are two key questions that we try to address in this work: 1) What information should the companion remember in order to generate appropriate behaviours and thus smooth the interaction with the user? And, 2) What are the relevant aspects to take into consideration during the design of memory for a companion that can have different types of virtual and physical bodies? Finally, we show an implementation plan of the memory model, focusing on issues of information grounding, activation and sensing based on specific hardware platforms.","[{'authorId': '34654263', 'name': 'W.

d18459eb0fa5cc31f7bf16bd45d72d496769ce80,"BACKGROUND
Influential studies have cast doubt on the validity of retrospective reports by adults of their own adverse experiences in childhood. Accordingly, many researchers view retrospective reports with scepticism.


METHOD
A computer-based search, supplemented by hand searches, was used to identify studies reported between 1980 and 2001 in which there was a quantified assessment of the validity of retrospective recall of sexual abuse, physical abuse, physical/emotional neglect or family discord, using samples of at least 40. Validity was assessed by means of comparisons with contemporaneous, prospectively obtained, court or clinic or research records; by agreement between retrospective reports of two siblings; and by the examination of possible bias with respect to differences between retrospective and prospective reports in their correlates and consequences. Medium- to long-term reliability of retrospective recall was determined from studies in which the test-retest period extended over at least 6 months.


RESULTS
Retrospective reports in adulthood of major adverse experiences in childhood, even when these are of a kind that allow reasonable operationalisation, involve a substantial rate of false negatives, and substantial measurement error. On the other hand, although less easily quantified, false positive reports are probably rare. Several studies have shown some bias in retrospective reports. However, such bias is not sufficiently great to invalidate retrospective case-control studies of major adversities of an easily defined kind. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that little weight can be placed on the retrospective reports of details of early experiences or on reports of experiences that rely heavily onjudgement or interpretation.


CONCLUSION
Retrospective studies have a worthwhile place in research, but further research is needed to examine possible biases in reporting.","[{'authorId': '4796044', 'name': 'J.

In this review, the distinction between effortful self-regulatory processes and those that are somewhat less voluntary is discussed, and literature on the former capacities is reviewed. Emotion-related self-regulation develops rapidly in the early years of life and improves more slowly into adulthood. Individual differences in children's self-regulation are fairly stable after the first year or two of life. Such individual differences are inversely related to at least some types of externalizing problems. Findings for internalizing problems are less consistent and robust, although emotion-related self-regulation appears to be inversely related to internalizing problems after the early years. Self-regulatory capacities have been related to both genetic and environmental factors and their interaction. Some interventions designed to foster self-regulation and, hence, reduce maladjustment, have proved to be at least partially effective.","[{'authorId': '15102546', 'name': 'N.

Small negative effect sizes were found for work support (r = -.17) and social support (r = -.26). Demographic variables appear to be less implicated although more work is needed that examines the role of gender in the context of particular personal traumas.

d25965cd2e9f267b36f77222bcb1f8944e53e5b0,"The expressions we see in the faces of others engage a number of different cognitive processes. Emotional expressions elicit rapid responses, which often imitate the emotion in the observed face. These effects can even occur for faces presented in such a way that the observer is not aware of them. We are also very good at explicitly recognizing and describing the emotion being expressed. A recent study, contrasting human and humanoid robot facial expressions, suggests that people can recognize the expressions made by the robot explicitly, but may not show the automatic, implicit response. The emotional expressions presented by faces are not simply reflexive, but also have a communicative component. For example, empathic expressions of pain are not simply a reflexive response to the sight of pain in another, since they are exaggerated when the empathizer knows he or she is being observed. It seems that we want people to know that we are empathic.

d2597fc897ea36740c899da73237e2b69ea71079,"Designing for reflection is becoming an increasingly important part of many HCI systems in a wide range of application domains. However, there is a gap in our understanding of how the process of reflection can be supported through technology. In fact, an implicit assumption in the majority of existing work is that, just by providing access to well-selected data, in-depth reflection can and will occur. To counter this view, we draw on Schön's notion of reflective practicum and apply it as a sensitising concept to identify the complex interplay of factors that support transformative reflection in the context of two social-emotional learning (SEL) studies. The results highlight the need to carefully scaffold the process of reflection, rather than simply assume that the capability to reflect is a broadly available trait to be 'triggered' through data. Building on this analysis, we develop a conceptual framework that extends the concept of the reflective practicum towards identifying appropriate roles of technology to support transformative reflection. While our case is within the context of SEL, we argue that a deeper understanding of these opportunities can also benefit designing for reflection in other areas.","[{'authorId': '2971246', 'name': 'P.

It presents usage requirements from three different groups of users and how one annotation model and a number of generic design principles guided the choices made during the development process of ELAN. Introduction At the Max-Planck-Institute for Psycholinguistics (MPI) software development on annotation tools for the manual annotation of multimedia data has been going on since the early 90’s. Over this decade there have been large changes in enabling technology and insights in the nature of linguistic annotation. Media frameworks for the handling of digital audio and especially digital video files have matured, as has media streaming technology. XML has come to existence and has become highly relevant in a short time. Rendering and input of Unicode characters is now commonplace. Simultaneously, users made experiences with the first generation of video annotation tools and became aware of and got used to these new technologies. From this a new set of requirements arose. Finally, annotation tool builders are better aware of each other’s approaches, annotation models and annotation document formats. Clearly convergence is going on, leading to easier exchange of data between annotation tools. An important role in this process was played by the paper by (Bird & Liberman, 2001) that introduced Annotation Graphs. We are closely watching and trying to participate in standards initiatives, as for example ISO TC37/SC4. The first video annotation tool developed at the MPI was MediaTagger, a QuickTime based application that runs only on pre-OS X Macintoshes. It started as a first attempt to exploit the QuickTime Movie data structure, and especially it’s text tracks, as an informal model for linguistic annotation. Since then several new formal models where made, each one building on the experiences of the previous ones and considering new user requirements. The formal modeling languages that were used are Entity-Relationship diagrams and UML. A detailed presentation and evaluation of these models can be found in (Brugman & Wittenburg, 2001). The next chapters will discuss the requirements of several different groups of users and describe the latest state of ELAN functionality. We will then present our model for annotation in some detail and show how we can cover the needs of very different user groups with one relatively simple model. In the discussions plans for future development will presented. 1 http://www.mpi.nl User requirements ELAN is developed with a number of different user groups in mind. These users are situated both within the MPI and, in an increasing number of cases, outside the MPI. Often they are participating in externally funded projects (DoBeS, ECHO). We will discuss the main requirements per group, although there is of course a substantial overlap between each group’s needs.","[{'authorId': '1778610', 'name': 'H.

The skin consists of a series of sensing and computing elements that are networked with their local neighbors and mimic the function of the Pacinian corpuscle in human skin. Each sensor node samples a vibration signal at 1 KHz, transforms the signal into the frequency domain, and classifies up to 15 textures using logistic regression. By measuring the power spectrum of the signal and comparing it with its local neighbors, computing elements can then collaboratively estimate the location of the stimulus. The resulting low-bandwidth information, consisting of the texture probability distribution and its location are then routed to a sink anywhere in the skin in a multi-hop fashion. We describe the design, manufacturing, classification, localization and networking algorithms and experimentally validate the proposed approach. In particular, we demonstrate texture classification with 71% accuracy and centimeter accuracy in localization over an area of approximately three square feet using ten networked sensor nodes.","[{'authorId': '153791774', 'name': 'Dana Hughes'}, {'authorId': '2886493', 'name': 'N.

Despite its importance, societies not always are well equipped with contexts for creativity stimulation; as a consequence, a major decline in creative abilities occurs at the age of 7 years old. We investigated the effectiveness of using a robotic system named YOLO as an intervention tool to stimulate creativity in children. During the intervention, children used YOLO as a character for their stories and through the interaction with the robot, creative abilities were stimulated. Our study (n=62) included 3 experimental conditions: i) YOLO displayed behaviors based on creativity techniques; ii) YOLO displayed behaviors based on creativity techniques plus social behaviors; iii) YOLO was turned off, not displaying any behaviors. We measured children’s creative abilities at pre- and post-testing and their creative process through behavior analysis. Results showed that the interaction with YOLO contributed to higher creativity levels in children, specifically contributing to the generation of more original ideas during story creation. This study shows the potential of using social robots as tools to empower intrinsic human abilities, such as the ability to be creative.

Combining findings from behavioral genetics and cognitive neuroscience with the accumulated research on the cognitive model opens new opportunities for integrated research. Drawing on advances in cognitive, personality, and social psychology as well as clinical observations, expansions of the original cognitive model have incorporated in successive stages automatic thoughts, cognitive distortions, dysfunctional beliefs, and information-processing biases. The developmental model identified early traumatic experiences and the formation of dysfunctional beliefs as predisposing events and congruent stressors in later life as precipitating factors. It is now possible to sketch out possible genetic and neurochemical pathways that interact with or are parallel to cognitive variables. A hypersensitive amygdala is associated with both a genetic polymorphism and a pattern of negative cognitive biases and dysfunctional beliefs, all of which constitute risk factors for depression. Further, the combination of a hyperactive amygdala and hypoactive prefrontal regions is associated with diminished cognitive appraisal and the occurrence of depression. Genetic polymorphisms also are involved in the overreaction to the stress and the hypercortisolemia in the development of depression--probably mediated by cognitive distortions.

Social psychology and neuroscience have attempted to explain this phenomenon. Here we sought to integrate results around three themes: the stimuli, the mechanisms and the benefits of interactional synchrony. As regards stimuli, we asked what characteristics, apart from temporal regularity, prompt synchronization and found that stimulus modality and complexity are important. The high temporal resolution of the auditory system and the relevance of socio-emotional information endow auditory, multimodal, emotional and somewhat variable and adaptive sequences with particular synchronizing power. Looking at the mechanisms revealed that traditional perspectives emphasizing beat-based representations of others’ signals conflict with more recent work investigating the perception of temporal regularity. Timing processes supported by striato-cortical loops represent any kind of repetitive interval sequence fairly automatically. Additionally, socio-emotional processes supported by posterior superior temporal cortex help endow such sequences with value motivating the extent of synchronizing. Synchronizing benefits arise from an increased predictability of incoming signals and include many positive outcomes ranging from basic information processing at the individual level to the bonding of dyads and larger groups.","[{'authorId': '3198934', 'name': 'S.

d48d57abe467393121fe58c6cd60f51f4c8b82a1,"While substantial effort has been invested in making robots more reliable, experience demonstrates that robots operating in unstructured environments are often challenged by frequent failures. Despite this, robots have not yet reached a level of design that allows effective management of faulty or unexpected behavior by untrained users. To understand why this may be the case, an in-depth literature review was done to explore when people perceive and resolve robot failures, how robots communicate failure, how failures influence people's perceptions and feelings toward robots, and how these effects can be mitigated. Fifty-two studies were identified relating to communicating failures and their causes, the influence of failures on human-robot interaction (HRI), and mitigating failures. Since little research has been done on these topics within the HRI community, insights from the fields of human computer interaction (HCI), human factors engineering, cognitive engineering and experimental psychology are presented and discussed. Based on the literature, we developed a model of information processing for robotic failures (Robot Failure Human Information Processing, RF-HIP), that guides the discussion of our findings. The model describes the way people perceive, process, and act on failures in human robot interaction. The model includes three main parts: (1) communicating failures, (2) perception and comprehension of failures, and (3) solving failures. Each part contains several stages, all influenced by contextual considerations and mitigation strategies. Several gaps in the literature have become evident as a result of this evaluation. More focus has been given to technical failures than interaction failures. Few studies focused on human errors, on communicating failures, or the cognitive, psychological, and social determinants that impact the design of mitigation strategies. By providing the stages of human information processing, RF-HIP can be used as a tool to promote the development of user-centered failure-handling strategies for HRIs.","[{'authorId': '52226972', 'name': 'Shanee Honig'}, {'authorId': '1399307721', 'name': 'T.

Across two sessions, 3- and 4-year-old children (N = 107) were given multitask batteries measuring IC and ToM. Inhibitory control was strongly related to ToM, r = .66, p < .001. This relation remained significant controlling for age, gender, verbal ability, motor sequencing, family size, and performance on pretend-action and mental state control tasks. Inhibitory tasks requiring a novel response in the face of a conflicting prepotent response (Conflict scale) and those requiring the delay of a prepotent response (Delay scale) were significantly related to ToM. The Conflict scale, however, significantly predicted ToM performance over and above the Delay scale and control measures, whereas the Delay scale was not significant in a corresponding analysis. These findings suggest that IC may be a crucial enabling factor for ToM development, possibly affecting both the emergence and expression of mental state knowledge. The implications of the findings for a variety of executive accounts of ToM are discussed.","[{'authorId': '2040392', 'name': 'S. M. Carlson'}, {'authorId': '6241830', 'name': 'L. J.

Both intrusive parenting and low EC have been related to psychopathology, but children's externalizing problems and low EC might affect the quality of parenting and one another. Mothers’ intrusive behavior with their children was assessed with observations, children's EC was measured with mothers’ and caregivers’ reports, and children's externalizing symptoms were assessed with mothers’, fathers’, and caregivers’ reports. In a structural equation panel model, bidirectional relations between intrusive parenting and EC were found: EC at 30 and 42 months predicted low levels of intrusive parenting a year later, controlling for prior levels of parenting and vice versa. Moreover, high levels of children's externalizing problems at both 30 and 42 months negatively predicted EC a year later, controlling for prior levels of EC. Although externalizing problems positively predicted high EC over time, this appeared to be a suppression effect because these variables had a strong negative pattern in the zero-order correlations. Moreover, when controlling for the stability of intrusive parenting, EC, and externalizing (all exhibited significant stability across time) and the aforementioned cross-lagged predictive paths, EC and externalizing problems were still negatively related within the 54-month assessment. The findings are consistent with the view that children's externalizing behavior undermines their EC and contributes to intrusive mothering and that relations between intrusive parenting and EC are bidirectional across time. Thus, interventions that focus on modifying children's externalizing problems (as well as the quality of parenting) might affect the quality of parenting they receive and, hence, subsequent problems with adjustment.","[{'authorId': '15102546', 'name': 'N.

Co-teaching has emerged as a supportive framework that uses principles of social justice in building inclusive nurturing environments, yielding positive student outcomes in social as well as academic areas of education. The authors explored the use of co-teaching within a laboratory school setting by analyzing experiences between general education faculty and not only special education faculty but also preservice teachers. Research has found that co-teaching to support preservice and early-career teachers is a natural outgrowth of the special education and general education partnerships created in the co-taught classroom when an intern is placed in such a setting. When used with fidelity, co-teaching is an instructional option that plays an integral part in building effective and efficient ways to foster student learning while enhancing classroom community. Co-teaching can be a powerful mechanism that supports sharing of responsibility and accountability for student achievement, as well as social, emotional, and behavioral growth. A child-centered philosophy was perceived as important to both preservice and co-teachers because of the individual factors that guided practice. With strong leadership from school administrators, commitment and flexibility on the part of classroom teachers, and skills of colleagues, preservice teachers report outstanding growth. Co-teaching, carefully implemented, can foster a nurturing classroom culture and support preservice teachers as they apply knowledge and skills in a constant reflective process, which benefits all teachers and students.","[{'authorId': '119752661', 'name': 'Tammy Barron'}, {'authorId': '65772647', 'name': 'Holly H.

Binge-eating disorder (BED) is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating and is associated with eating disorder and general psychopathology and overweight/obesity. Deficits in cognitive and emotional functioning for eating disorders or obesity have been reported. However, a systematic review on cognitive and emotional functioning for individuals with BED is lacking.


METHOD
A systematic literature search was conducted across three databases (Medline, PubMed, and PsycINFO). Overall, n = 57 studies were included in the present review.


RESULTS
Regarding cognitive functioning (CoF), individuals with BED consistently demonstrated higher information processing biases compared to obese and normal-weight controls in the context of disorder-related stimuli (i.e., food and body cues), whereas CoF in the context of neutral stimuli appeared to be less affected. Thus, results suggest disorder-related rather than general difficulties in CoF in BED. With respect to emotional functioning (EmF), individuals with BED reported difficulties similar to individuals with other eating disorders, with a tendency to show less severe difficulties in some domains. In addition, individuals with BED reported greater emotional deficits when compared to obese and normal-weight controls. Findings suggest general difficulties in EmF in BED. Thus far, however, investigations of EmF in disorder-relevant situations are lacking.


DISCUSSION
Overall, the cross-sectional findings indicate BED to be associated with difficulties in CoF and EmF. Future research should determine the nature of these difficulties, in regards to general and disorder-related stimuli, and consider interactions of both domains to foster the development and improvement of appropriate interventions in BED.","[{'authorId': '26864312', 'name': 'Rebekka Kittel'}, {'authorId': '5014799', 'name': 'A.

Recent discoveries from a number of independent fields, including those of devel- opmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience, can be synthesized into an integrated framework for understanding how the brain gives rise to mental processes and is directly shaped by interpersonal ex- periences. This ""interpersonal neurobiology"" (Siegel, 1999) presents an integrated view of how human development occurs within a social world in transaction with the functions of the brain that give rise to the mind. This framework suggests some basic principles for conceptualizing the essential experiential ingredients that may facilitate the development of the mind, emotional well-being, and psychological resilience during early childhood and perhaps throughout the lifespan. At the core of these processes is a fundamental mechanism of integration which can be seen at a variety of levels, from the interpersonal to the neurological. Integration may be conceptualized as the basic process that secure attachments fa- cilitate in promoting psychological well-being.

In Turkey, eating disorders have been increasing in prevalence among adolescents. Family relations and parenting have been studied as sociocultural influences that shape individuals’ eating behaviors and relationships with food. Eating behaviors have psychosocial outcomes for adolescents’ development and are affected by parental warmth and care. This study investigated the relationship between fathers’ parental attitudes and young individuals’ emotion regulation skills and eating behaviors. It focused on fathers’ parental attitudes in Turkey, where a collectivistic and patriarchal culture typically has father figures playing an important role in family as well as in society. The Eating Attitude Test (EAT-26), Difficulty in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), and Parental Acceptance-Rejection Questionnaire—Child Form (PARQ-C) were used to collect data from 401 Turkish adolescents. Correlation analyses showed positive correlations between 2 combinations of variables: adolescents’ eating behaviors and emotion regulation skills, and fathers’ parenting and adolescents’ eating behaviors. Multiple regression analysis showed that father’s parenting was predictive of adolescents’ eating behaviors and emotion regulation skills. Based on the results, this research may promote positive social change by identifying the importance of fathers’ parenting attitudes on adolescent health and by raising awareness of eating disorders in Turkey. The study will guide researchers and counselors in designing eating disorders prevention programs and identify tools for involving fathers in developing healthy parenting attitudes and awareness of eating disorders.

They will be interested in his general socio-economic status, his concep tion of self, his attitude toward them, his compe tence, his trustworthiness, etc. Although some of this information seems to be sought almost as an end in itself, there are usually quite practical reasons for acquiring it. Information about the individual helps to define the situation, enabling others to know in advance what he will expect of them and what they may expect of him. Informed in these ways, the others will know how best to act in order to call forth a desired response from him. For those present, many sources of information become accessible and many carriers (or “signvehicles”) become available for conveying this information. If unacquainted with the individual, observers can glean clues from his conduct and appearance which allow them to apply their previ ous experience with individuals roughly similar to the one before them or, more important, to apply untested stereotypes to him. They can also assume from past experience that only individuals of a par ticular kind are likely to be found in a given social setting. They can rely on what the individual says about himself or on documentary evidence he provides as to who and what he is. If they know, or know of, the individual by virtue of experience prior to the interaction, they can rely on assumptions as to the persistence and generality of psychological traits as a means of predicting his present and future behavior. However, during the period in which the indi vidual is in the immediate presence of the others, few events may occur which directly provide the others with the conclusive information they will need if they are to direct wisely their own activity . Many crucial facts lie beyond the time and place of interaction or lie concealed within it. For example, the “true” or “real” attitudes, beliefs, and emotions of the individual can be ascertained only indirectly , through his avowals or through what appears to be involuntary expressive behavior. Similarly , if the individual offers the others a product or service, they will often find that during the interaction there will be no time and place immediately available for eating the pudding that the proof can be found in. They will be forced to accept some events as con ventional or natural signs of something not directly available to the senses.

Analysis of the results of the 13 studies confirmed that robots can have positive immediate effects on the communication skills of children with ASD, which holds promise for future intervention programs and relevant research.","[{'authorId': '1403392965', 'name': 'Christine K.

d6e0672f87f840fa795195de4fb7f51165833fc4,"A significant amount of robotics research over the past decade has shown that many children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have a strong interest in robots and robot toys, concluding that robots are potential tools for the therapy of individuals with ASD. However, clinicians, who have the authority to approve robots in ASD therapy, are not convinced about the potential of robots. One major reason is that the research in this domain does not have a strong focus on the efficacy of robots. Robots in ASD therapy are end-user oriented technologies, the success of which depends on their demonstrated efficacy in real settings. This paper focuses on measuring the efficacy of robots in ASD therapy and, based on the data from a feasibility study, shows that the human-robot interaction (HRI) metrics commonly used in this research domain might not be sufficient.

In the present study, we examine to which extent covert intrapersonal actions (cognitions both related and unrelated to the emotion-eliciting stimulus) as well as overt interpersonal actions (social sharing) account for this variability in emotion duration. Participants were asked to report the duration of their anger, sadness, joy, and gratitude episodes on a daily basis during five days. Furthermore, information was collected with regard to their cognitions during the episodes and their social sharing behavior. Discrete-time survival analyses revealed that for three of the four emotions under study, stimulus-related cognitions with the same valence as the emotion lead to a prolongation of the episode; in contrast, both stimulus-related and stimulus-unrelated cognitions with a valence opposite to the emotion lead to a shortening. Finally, for the four emotions under study, social sharing was associated with a prolongation.

Maltreating mothers and their 6- to 12-year-old children were recruited from two parenting programs affiliated with Children's Protective Services with a control group matched on race, SES, child gender, and child age. Children and their mothers were interviewed individually about their (a) management of emotional expression, (b) strategies for coping with emotional arousal, and (c) anticipated consequences following emotional displays. Compared to controls, maltreated children expected less maternal support in response to their emotional displays, reported being less likely to display emotions to their mothers, and generated fewer effective coping strategies for anger. Maltreating mothers indicated less understanding of children's emotional displays and fewer effective strategies for helping children to cope with emotionally arousing situations than nonmaltreating mothers. Further, findings indicated that maternal socialization practices (e.g., providing support in response to children's emotional display, generating effective coping strategies for their child) mediate the relation between child maltreatment and children's regulation of emotional expression and emotional arousal. These findings suggest that children's emotion regulation strategies are influenced by their relationship with their social environment (e.g., physically maltreating, nonmaltreating) and that the experience of a physically maltreating relationship may interfere with children's emotional development.","[{'authorId': '6924992', 'name': 'Kimberly L Shipman'}, {'authorId': '2245634783', 'name': 'Janice Zeman'}]",241.0,,55.0,Socialization of children's emotion regulation in mother–child dyads: A developmental psychopathology perspective,2001.0

Because any change in human's life, either pleasant or unpleasant, requires some level of adjustment, lack of mental health causes failure to adjust to new conditions (2). Mental health refers to the ability to have harmonious and coordinated relationship with self and others, recognize and accept realities and be able to adjust to them, and resolve personal conflicts and tendencies in a reasonable and appropriate manner (3). Because pregnant women's mental conditions are influenced by several factors including their feelings about feminine identity, husband's family, agreements and contradictions, sexual intercourse, marital life, and choosing to have or not to have child, failure to cope with these issues can lead to serious traumas to them (1). Unhealthy mental conditions during pregnancy can be associated with adverse effects such as premature birth and declined infant growth indices; therefore, it is essential to take into account mental health, alongside physical healthcare services, during pregnancy, and identify women with predisposition to mental disorders and deliver necessary healthcare services to them to prevent many associated problems (4-6). Studies on pregnant women in different cultural and socioeconomic conditions indicated that high levels of stress and lack of adjustment to conditions during pregnancy might lead to spontaneous abortion and neonatal abnormalities (2,7).

Such difficulties in empathy underlie their social-communication difficulties that form a core of the diagnosis. In this paper we ask whether aspects of empathy can be taught to young children with ASC. We review a study that evaluated The Transporters, an animated series designed to enhance emotion comprehension in children with ASC. Children with ASC (4–7 years old) watched The Transporters every day for four weeks. Participants were tested before and after intervention on emotional vocabulary and emotion recognition at three levels of generalization. The intervention group improved significantly more than a clinical control group on all task levels, performing comparably to typical controls at time 2. The discussion centres on how vehicles as mechanical systems may be one key reason why The Transporters caused the improved understanding and recognition of emotions in children with ASC.

De aquí la importancia de la interpretación que realizan las personas al éxito o fracaso de la tarea, en función de sus expectativas previas (Weiner, 1985). Por otra parte, los aspectos motivacionales son apoyados o socavados, ya sea por la satisfacción o insatisfacción, respectivamente, de las necesidades psicológicas básicas, que hacen que las personas actúen de determinada forma (Domenech Betoret y Gómez Artiga, 2011). A su vez, algunos autores han verificado la existencia de relación entre el tipo de motivación y el enfoque de aprendizaje que utilizan los estudiantes (Biggs, 1989; Entwistle, 1987). El presente trabajo pretende explorar los tres constructos mencionados en estudiantes universitarios, con el objetivo de explorar sus enfoques de aprendizaje, necesidades psicológicas básicas y atribuciones motivacionales al logro. BASIC PSYCHOLOGICAL NEEDS, LEARNING APPROACHES AND ALLOCATION OF ACHIEVEMENT MOTIVATION IN COLLEGE STUDENTS. EXPLORATORY STUDY Abstract Several investigations in recent years indicate the importance of considering both the cognitive and motivational aspects involved in learning, emphasizing the interplay between affect and cognition (Rinaudo, Chiecher and Donolo, 2003). Hence, the importance of the interpretation made by individuals to the success or failure of the task, based on their prior expectations (Weiner, 1985). Moreover, the motivational aspects are supported or undermined by either satisfaction or dissatisfaction, respectively, of the basic psychological needs, to make people act in a certain way (Domenech and Gomez Betoret Artiga, 2011). In turn, some authors have verified the existence of a relationship between the type of motivation and learning approach used by students (Biggs, 1989; Entwistle, 1987). This paper aims to explore the three constructs mentioned in university students, in order to explore their approaches to learning, basic psychological needs and motivational attributions to achievement.   ","[{'authorId': '26353070', 'name': 'C.

Theories of human behavior from Plato to Freud have repeatedly emphasized links between emotion and reason, a relationship now commonly attributed to pathways connecting phylogenetically ""old"" and ""new"" brain regions. Expanding on this theory, this study examined functional interactions between specific limbic and neocortical regions accompanying normal and disease-associated shifts in negative mood state.


METHOD
Regions of concordant functional change accompanying provocation of transient sadness in healthy volunteers and resolution of chronic dysphoric symptoms in depressed patients were examined with two positron emission tomography techniques: [15O]water and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose, respectively.


RESULTS
With sadness, increases in limbic-paralimbic blood flow (subgenual cingulate, anterior insula) and decreases in neocortical regions (right dorsolateral prefrontal, inferior parietal) were identified. With recovery from depression, the reverse pattern, involving the same regions, was seen--limbic metabolic decreases and neocortical increases. A significant inverse correlation between subgenual cingulate and right dorsolateral prefrontal activity was also demonstrated in both conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
Reciprocal changes involving subgenual cingulate and right prefrontal cortex occur with both transient and chronic changes in negative mood. The presence and maintenance of functional reciprocity between these regions with shifts in mood in either direction suggests that these regional interactions are obligatory and probably mediate the well-recognized relationships between mood and attention seen in both normal and pathological conditions. The bidirectional nature of this limbic-cortical reciprocity provides additional evidence of potential mechanisms mediating cognitive (""top-down""), pharmacological (mixed), and surgical (""bottom-up"") treatments of mood disorders such as depression.","[{'authorId': '2245080', 'name': 'H.

The aim of this article is to carry out a systematic literature review of the studies on this topic that were published in the last 10 years. We tried to address the following questions: can social robots be a useful tool in autism therapy? We followed the PRISMA guidelines, and the protocol was registered within PROSPERO database (CRD42015016158). We found many positive implications in the use of social robots in therapy as for example: ASD subjects often performed better with a robot partner rather than a human partner; sometimes, ASD patients had, toward robots, behaviors that TD patients had toward human agents; ASDs had a lot of social behaviors toward robots; during robotic sessions, ASDs showed reduced repetitive and stereotyped behaviors and, social robots manage to improve spontaneous language during therapy sessions. Therefore, robots provide therapists and researchers a means to connect with autistic subjects in an easier way, but studies in this area are still insufficient. It is necessary to clarify whether sex, intelligence quotient, and age of participants affect the outcome of therapy and whether any beneficial effects only occur during the robotic session or if they are still observable outside the clinical/experimental context.

 Though substantial research has been dedicated towards using technology to improve education, no current methods are as effective as one-on-one tutoring. A critical, though relatively understudied, aspect of effective tutoring is modulating the student's affective state throughout the tutoring session in order to maximize long-term learning gains. We developed an integrated experimental paradigm in which children play a second-language learning game on a tablet, in collaboration with a fully autonomous social robotic learning companion. As part of the system, we measured children's valence and engagement via an automatic facial expression analysis system. These signals were combined into a reward signal that fed into the robot's affective reinforcement learning algorithm. Over several sessions, the robot played the game and personalized its motivational strategies (using verbal and non-verbal actions) to each student. We evaluated this system with 34 children in preschool classrooms for a duration of two months. We saw that (1) children learned new words from the repeated tutoring sessions, (2) the affective policy personalized to students over the duration of the study, and (3) students who interacted with a robot that personalized its affective feedback strategy showed a significant increase in valence, as compared to students who interacted with a non-personalizing robot. This integrated system of tablet-based educational content, affective sensing, affective policy learning, and an autonomous social robot holds great promise for a more comprehensive approach to personalized tutoring.

Results revealed that family functioning has significant positive relationship with cognitive reappraisal (r=.17, p<0.01), emotional regulation (r=.14, p<0.01) and social competence (r=.36, p<0.01). Social competence has significant positive correlation with suppression (r=.14, p<0.01), cognitive reappraisal (r=.39, p<0.01), and emotional regulation (r=.34, p<0.01). Family functioning (β=.31, p<0.01) and emotional regulation (β=.29, p<0.01) have significantly and positively predicted social competences in college students.

The paper presents our shared experiences (a person with dementia and a researcher) gained from an action research, titled Co-creating Person-Centred Care in Acute Care. We highlight our successes and possibilities for making real impacts on hospital care for patients with dementia by using an appreciative inquiry approach. The project was informed by the core principles of appreciative inquiry. The research involved seven patients with dementia together with a team of 50 interdisciplinary staff to inquire and take actions for improving dementia care in a medical unit. This article draws attention to a range of ethical responsibilities and challenges, which go beyond the traditional principles in University Research Ethics. The strengths and challenges of conducting action research with people living with dementia are discussed.

The robot asks children questions related to their latest science classes to support their understanding of the classes. During interaction, the robot says children's name and distribute its gaze among the group of children by using a face recognition system and a human tracking system. Still, speech recognition is difficult in the noisy elementary school environment; therefore the operator takes over this function during interactions. In this study our result did not show significant effects of the robot for helping children's understanding, but we found several interesting interaction scenes which shows that robot had a certain effect on specific children.","[{'authorId': '2099799', 'name': 'Tsuyoshi Komatsubara'}, {'authorId': '34656564', 'name': 'M.

d91840a3ca3b386b362672950dff1fba257222ed,"OBJECTIVES
To identify the mechanisms involved in the association between self-compassion and depression, we examined whether adaptive emotion regulation would mediate the relationship between self-compassion and depression in individuals with unipolar depression. Furthermore, we explored which specific emotion regulation skills would be most important in this relationship.


DESIGN AND METHOD
Sixty-nine individuals with unipolar depression were assessed with the Self-Compassion Scale and the Emotion Regulation Skills Questionnaire at baseline and with the Beck Depression Inventory-II 1 week later.


RESULTS
The results showed that successful application of emotion regulation skills mediates the association between self-compassion and depression. Among eight specific emotion regulation skills, only the ability to tolerate negative emotions was identified as a significant mediator in the self-compassion-depression relationship.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings provide preliminary evidence that systematically fostering self-compassion might help depressed individuals cope with their symptoms by enhancing their abilities to tolerate undesired emotions.


PRACTITIONER POINTS
Systematically fostering self-compassion through specific compassion-focused interventions might facilitate a reduction in depressive symptoms by improving the person's emotion regulation abilities, especially by improving his or her ability to tolerate negative emotions. Hence, compassion-focused interventions might be particularly promising in depressed patients with a tendency to avoid negative emotions and deficits in tolerating them.","[{'authorId': '40069111', 'name': 'Alice Diedrich'}, {'authorId': '48198809', 'name': 'J.

With a rapidly aging population there is an increasing demand on long-term care facilities to care for older adults. Such facilities need to provide medical services, assistance in activities of daily living, and scheduled leisure activities to improve health and quality of life. However, as the need for long-term care is increasing, the care workforce is faced with decreasing numbers of healthcare staff and high turnover rates. Our research focuses on the design of socially assistive robots to plan, schedule, and facilitate social and cognitive interventions for residents in long-term care facilities. In this paper, we investigate the specific design considerations and the impressions of long-term care residents, healthcare professionals, and family members on a socially assistive robot designed to autonomously facilitate cognitively and socially stimulating leisure activities.

d9e529ca5823ab31c35d7d3f60f15857db597a9c,"Individuals differ in the degree to which they tend to habitually accept their emotions and thoughts without judging them—a process here referred to as habitual acceptance. Acceptance has been linked with greater psychological health, which we propose may be due to the role acceptance plays in negative emotional responses to stressors: acceptance helps keep individuals from reacting to—and thus exacerbating—their negative mental experiences. Over time, experiencing lower negative emotion should promote psychological health. To test these hypotheses, Study 1 (N = 1,003) verified that habitually accepting mental experiences broadly predicted psychological health (psychological well-being, life satisfaction, and depressive and anxiety symptoms), even when controlling for potentially related constructs (reappraisal, rumination, and other mindfulness facets including observing, describing, acting with awareness, and nonreactivity). Next, in a laboratory study (Study 2, N = 156), habitual acceptance predicted lower negative (but not positive) emotional responses to a standardized stressor. Finally, in a longitudinal design (Study 3, N = 222), acceptance predicted lower negative (but not positive) emotion experienced during daily stressors that, in turn, accounted for the link between acceptance and psychological health 6 months later. This link between acceptance and psychological health was unique to accepting mental experiences and was not observed for accepting situations. Additionally, we ruled out potential confounding effects of gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and life stress severity. Overall, these results suggest that individuals who accept rather than judge their mental experiences may attain better psychological health, in part because acceptance helps them experience less negative emotion in response to stressors.","[{'authorId': '5743779', 'name': 'B.

This qualitative study undertaken in Ontario, Canada, examined Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) students’ perceptions of interviewing. Individual interviews were conducted with second-year BSW students (n = 17) following their completion of an interviewing course. The following six themes emerged as to how students perceived learning interviewing skills: 1) emotional responses; 2) physiological responses; 3) psychological responses; 4) coping strategies; 5) the need for constructive criticism; and 6) the role of the course instructor. The study suggests that instructors normalize the presence of negative emotions and provide more structure and instructions for giving and receiving feedback when using role-plays.","[{'authorId': '8322149', 'name': 'Lea Tufford'}, {'authorId': '2065121642', 'name': 'C.

da0f0faecdf6064b327f48a91ab948cab5cf6a08,"OBJECTIVE
To construct growth curves for school-aged children and adolescents that accord with the WHO Child Growth Standards for preschool children and the body mass index (BMI) cut-offs for adults.


METHODS
Data from the 1977 National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)/WHO growth reference (1-24 years) were merged with data from the under-fives growth standards' cross-sectional sample (18-71 months) to smooth the transition between the two samples. State-of-the-art statistical methods used to construct the WHO Child Growth Standards (0-5 years), i.e. the Box-Cox power exponential (BCPE) method with appropriate diagnostic tools for the selection of best models, were applied to this combined sample.


FINDINGS
The merged data sets resulted in a smooth transition at 5 years for height-for-age, weight-for-age and BMI-for-age. For BMI-for-age across all centiles the magnitude of the difference between the two curves at age 5 years is mostly 0.0 kg/m(2) to 0.1 kg/m(2). At 19 years, the new BMI values at +1 standard deviation (SD) are 25.4 kg/m(2) for boys and 25.0 kg/m(2) for girls. These values are equivalent to the overweight cut-off for adults (> or = 25.0 kg/m(2)). Similarly, the +2 SD value (29.7 kg/m(2) for both sexes) compares closely with the cut-off for obesity (> or = 30.0 kg/m(2)).


CONCLUSION
The new curves are closely aligned with the WHO Child Growth Standards at 5 years, and the recommended adult cut-offs for overweight and obesity at 19 years. They fill the gap in growth curves and provide an appropriate reference for the 5 to 19 years age group.","[{'authorId': '113506849', 'name': 'M. de Onís'}, {'authorId': '5889447', 'name': 'A.

In this study, we examined how individual differences in autobiographical reasoning (AR) about self-growth relate to traits and well-being in a national sample of midlife adults (N= 88) who ranged in age from 34 to 68. Two patterns of growth-related AR were identified: (1) positive processing, defined as the average tendency to interpret events positively (vs. negatively), and (2) differentiated processing, defined as the extent to which past events are interpreted as causing a variety of forms of self-growth. Results showed that positive processing was negatively related to neuroticism and predicted well-being even after controlling for the average valence of past events. Additionally, differentiated processing of negative events but not positive events was positively related to openness and predictive of well-being. Finally, growth-related AR patterns independently predicted well-being beyond the effects of traits and demographic factors.","[{'authorId': '6269986', 'name': 'J.

Rather than considering how emotions function within traditional paradigms of attitude change, this research explores the possibility that emotions serve as frames for issues, privileging certain information in terms of accessibility and thus guiding subsequent decision making. This study’s results offer evidence that fear and anger can differentially affect information accessibility, desired information seeking, and policy preference, though these effects may be contingent on schema development. These findings support not only the relationship between emotions and frames but also the importance of the discrete emotion perspective in persuasive contexts.","[{'authorId': '2373933', 'name': 'Robin L.

Two autonomous robots were embedded within two matched classrooms of a primary school for a continuous two week period without experimenter supervision to act as learning companions for the children for familiar and novel subjects. Results suggest that while children in both personalised and non-personalised conditions learned, there was increased child learning of a novel subject exhibited when interacting with a robot that personalised its behaviours, with indications that this benefit extended to other class-based performance. Additional evidence was obtained suggesting that there is increased acceptance of the personalised robot peer over a non-personalised version.

This systematic review deals with the overlaps and differences among the many different terminologies and definitions of self-regulation in childhood and the association with preschooler’s social-emotional and behavioural development. A systematic literature search in bibliographic databases identified 22 studies, published between 2011 and 2017, which met further inclusion criteria. Our review revealed considerable similarities and differences regarding definitions, core components, and measurements of self-regulation. Results regarding preschooler’s social-emotional and behavioural outcomes were heterogeneous, but overall the significance of children’s level of self-regulation was emphasized. In order to make clear statements about the impact on children’s development, self-regulation must be defined uniformly. This study indicates the need for an integrative model for self-regulation in childhood, considering dimensionality, individual components, and its organization.","[{'authorId': '2060612544', 'name': 'Annika Rademacher'}, {'authorId': '5909937', 'name': 'Ute Koglin'}]",27.0,"{'name': 'Early Child Development and Care', 'pages': '2299 - 2317', 'volume': '189'}",99.0,The concept of self-regulation and preschoolers’ social-emotional development: a systematic review,2019.0

Although the same emotional intensity was added to both trustworthy and untrustworthy faces, trustworthy faces who expressed happiness were perceived as happier than untrustworthy faces, and untrustworthy faces who expressed anger were perceived as angrier than trustworthy faces. The authors also manipulated changes in face trustworthiness simultaneously with the change in expression. Whereas transitions in face trustworthiness in the direction of the expressed emotion (e.g., high-to-low trustworthiness and anger) increased the perceived intensity of the emotion, transitions in the opposite direction decreased this intensity. For example, changes from high to low trustworthiness increased the intensity of perceived anger but decreased the intensity of perceived happiness. These findings support the hypothesis that changes along the trustworthiness dimension correspond to subtle changes resembling expressions signaling whether the person displaying the emotion should be avoided or approached.","[{'authorId': '1896078', 'name': 'N.

The ‘Like’—a popular feature on social media—shares features with both monetary and social rewards as a means of feedback that shapes reinforcement learning. Despite the ubiquity of the Like, little is known about the neural correlates of providing this feedback to others. In this study, we mapped the neural correlates of providing Likes to others on social media. Fifty-eight adolescents and young adults completed a task in the MRI scanner designed to mimic the social photo-sharing app Instagram. We examined neural responses when participants provided positive feedback to others. The experience of providing Likes to others on social media related to activation in brain circuity implicated in reward, including the striatum and ventral tegmental area, regions also implicated in the experience of receiving Likes from others. Providing Likes was also associated with activation in brain regions involved in salience processing and executive function. We discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of the neural processing of social rewards, as well as the neural processes underlying social media use.","[{'authorId': '40335340', 'name': 'Lauren E.

However, we actually hold considerable sway over our emotions: We influence which emotions we have and how we experience and express these emotions. The process model of emotion regulation described here suggests that how we regulate our emotions matters. Regulatory strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have quite different outcomes than strategies that act later. This review focuses on two widely used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing how we think about a situation in order to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It involves inhibiting the outward signs of emotion. Theory and research suggest that reappraisal is more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases the experience and behavioral expression of emotion, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease the experience of emotion, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding in both the suppressors and their social partners.","[{'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

In the present study we compared 51 three- to five-year-olds' performance on the Day/Night and the Black/White Stroop alongside other measures of Executive Function and language. As predicted, we found that children make inhibitory errors on the Black/White, while they make both inhibitory and memory errors on the Day/Night. As a result, the Day/Night Stroop underestimates the inhibitory control abilities of some children. Further, we also found that performance on the Black/White task was strongly related to performance on another inhibitory control task, while performance on the Day/Night was not.

de04ee850f2a4255d497f6cf0de986efeb1bffb7,"Obesity represents one of the most serious global health issues with approximately 310 million people presently affected. It develops because of a mismatch between energy intake and expenditure that results from behavior (feeding behavior and time spent active) and physiology (resting metabolism and expenditure when active). Both of these traits are affected by environmental and genetic factors. The dramatic increase in the numbers of obese people in Western societies reflects mostly changing environmental factors and is linked to reduced activity and perhaps also increased food intake. However, in all societies and subpopulations, there are both obese and nonobese subjects. These differences are primarily a consequence of genetic factors as is revealed by the high heritability for body mass index. Most researchers agree that energy balance and, hence, body weight are regulated phenomena. There is some disagreement about exactly how this regulation occurs. However, a common model is the ""lipostatic"" regulation system, whereby our energy stores generate signals that are compared with targets encoded in the brain, and differences between these drive our food intake levels, activity patterns, and resting and active metabolisms. Considerable advances were made in the last decade in understanding the molecular basis of this lipostatic system. Some obese people have high body weight because they have broken lipostats, but these are a rare minority. This suggests that for the majority of obese people, the lipostat is set at an inappropriately high level. When combined with exposure to an environment where there is ready availability of food at low energy costs to obtain it, obesity develops. The evolutionary background to how such a system might have evolved involves the evolution of social behavior, the harnessing of fire, and the development of weapons that effectively freed humans from the risks of predation. The lipostatic model not only explains why some people become obese whereas others do not, but also allows us to understand why energy-controlled diets do not work. Drug-based solutions to the obesity problem that work with the lipostat, rather than against it, are presently under development and will probably be in regular use within 5-10 y. However, several lines of evidence including genetic mapping studies of quantitative trait loci associated with obesity suggest that our present understanding of the regulatory system is still rudimentary. In particular, we know nothing about how the target body weight in the brain is encoded. As our understanding in this field advances, new drug targets are likely to emerge and allow us to treat this crippling disorder.","[{'authorId': '3229359', 'name': 'J.

Recent studies have demonstrated that, in addition to objective characteristics such as the resemblance of the structure of a face to positive and negative emotional expressions, subjective characteristics such as the similarity of another person’s face to one’s own also influence people’s judgments about a person’s character (Bailenson, Iyengar, Yee, & Collins, 2008; DeBruine, 2002, 2005). Coupled with research suggesting that people have overly positive self-views (Taylor & Brown, 1988), including viewing themselves as more trustworthy than the average person (Flynn & Lake, 2008), these findings suggest that people favor those who are physically similar to themselves. Indeed, facial similarity leads to increased attributions of trustworthiness (DeBruine, 2005) and increased cooperation in both trust games (DeBruine, 2002) and common-goods games (Krupp, Debruine, & Barclay, 2008). Although the effects of facial similarity on cooperative interactions are well documented, little is known about whether the perceived similarity between the self and others can change as a result of such interactions. The experience of another’s face being similar to one’s own can be thought of as the felt output of a computational system that utilizes direct, phenotypic cues (e.g., objective facial features) and indirect, contextual cues (e.g., coresidence early in life; DeBruine et al., 2011; Penn & Frommen, 2010) to gauge genetic kinship (cf. Kurzban, Duckworth, Kable, & Myers, in press). If evidence of cooperative intent in others serves as a contextual cue to kinship, then people may perceive another who behaves in a trustworthy way toward them as more physically similar than another who behaves in an untrustworthy way. The influence of trustworthiness on perceived facial similarity was investigated by Verosky and Todorov (2010), who found that untrustworthy-looking faces were viewed as less similar to the self than trustworthy-looking faces were. However, in their study, trustworthiness was manipulated by varying the physical characteristics of the face rather than by varying actual behavior. In the present study, we examined how participants’ perception of facial similarity was affected by taking part in a social interaction (trust game) in which the trustee either rewarded or betrayed the participant’s trust.","[{'authorId': '48016207', 'name': 'H.

Cognitive theory is a prominent framework to study depression in both adults and adolescents. This theory stated that dysfunctional schemas are moderators (known as diathesis) in the association of current stress and psychopathology. However, in adolescents, less evidence has been found so far to corroborate the importance of these schemas. This study aimed to investigate in a cross-sectional design the moderating role of adolescents' early maladaptive schemas (EMS) on depressive symptoms. This will be studied in relation to both important daily stressors (i.e., maternal, paternal and peer rejection) and stressful life events.


METHOD
Adolescents (N = 228, age 12-18 years), selected from inpatient and outpatient clinical settings and a non-referred sample, completed questionnaires and interviews measuring psychopathology, cognitive schemas, peer rejection, maternal and paternal rejection, and stressful life events. Parents completed questionnaires about their adolescent measuring psychopathology, stressful life events and peer rejection, as well as their own parental behaviour.


RESULTS
Correlational analyses revealed significant associations between the study variables. Evidence was found for an interaction effect between the adolescents' EMS and peer rejection in explaining depressive symptoms, but only in late adolescents.


KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE
Stress induced by maternal and, in lesser extent, paternal rejection is contributing to depressive symptoms primarily in younger and to lesser extent in older age groups. The quality of peer relationships becomes an increasingly salient source of distress as adolescence unfolds and is certainly an important mechanism affecting depression in adolescence. Maladaptive schemas only start functioning as a cognitive diathesis in late adolescence, increasing depression in response to peer-related distress. Since maladaptive schemas are not yet operating as cognitive vulnerability factors in early and middle adolescence, early interventions for depressive disorders may be more effective compared with treatment in later adolescence.","[{'authorId': '3768756', 'name': 'C.

Instead, many robots built in recent years have faces that are rendered onto a screen. This gives great flexibility in what a robot’s face can be and opens up a new design space with which to establish a robot’s character and perceived properties. Despite the prevalence of robots with rendered faces, there are no systematic explorations of this design space. Our work aims to fill that gap. We conducted a survey and identified 157 robots with rendered faces and coded them in terms of 76 properties. We present statistics, common patterns, and observations about this data set of faces. Next, we conducted two surveys to understand people’s perceptions of rendered robot faces and identify the impact of different face features. Survey results indicate preferences for varying levels of realism and detail in robot faces based on context, and indicate how the presence or absence of specific features affects perception of the face and the types of jobs the face would be appropriate for.","[{'authorId': '36104366', 'name': 'Alisa Kalegina'}, {'authorId': '39449608', 'name': 'G.

Under certain conditions, however, it is possible to obtain valid estimates of the comparative merits of different treatments from observational data. Causal inference can be conceptualised as a framework aiming to provide valid information about causal effects of treatments using observational evidence. It can be viewed as a missing data problem in which each patient has two outcomes: the observed outcome under the treatment actually received and a counterfactual (unobserved) outcome had the patient received a different treatment.

The epidemic of obesity is not just isolated to the US, but is worldwide,3,,4 including less affluent countries.4

Obesity and overweight have many causes, including genetic, metabolic, behavioural and environmental. The rapid increase in prevalence suggests that behavioural and environmental influences predominate, rather than biological changes.

We summarize data from many studies evaluating the impact of obesity on mortality and morbidity, discuss some controversies and provide practical guidelines for managing obese patients.

Direct associations between obesity and several diseases, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and ischaemic heart disease, are well recognized. Despite this, the relationship between body weight and all-cause mortality is more controversial. A very high degree of obesity (BMI ⩾35 kg/m2) seems to be linked to higher mortality rates,5 but the relationship between more modest degrees of overweight and mortality is unclear.

Initial data from actuarial studies of more than 4 million men and women showed a direct positive association between body weight and overall mortality rates.6 Subsequent studies confirmed increased mortality risk above a certain threshold, but found a U-shaped association between weight and mortality.7,,8 In the Build study,9 there was a higher mortality in lean subjects, but there was no adjustment for smoking. The American Cancer Society found a much stronger association between leanness and mortality, specifically cancer mortality, in the group of smokers compared to non-smokers.10

This is an approach to create an affinity to robots. As a human's preference will be affected by their emotions, we used emotion estimation to learn these preferences. In this paper, we outline the proposed system, experiments, and evaluation of its efficacy. We performed two types of experiments using a simulated robot over one week and four weeks.

While researchers and designers have successfully drawn on studies of human interactions to build models of humanlike behavior and to achieve such integration in robot behavior, the development of such models involves a laborious process of inspecting data to identify patterns within each modality or across modalities of behavior and to represent these patterns as “rules” or heuristics that can be used to control the behaviors of a robot, but provides little support for validation, extensibility, and learning. In this paper, we explore how a learning-based approach to modeling multimodal behaviors might address these limitations. We demonstrate the use of a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) for modeling how humans coordinate speech, gaze, and gesture behaviors in narration and for achieving such coordination with robots. The evaluation of this approach in a human-robot interaction study shows that this learning-based approach is comparable to conventional modeling approaches in enabling effective robot behaviors while reducing the effort involved in identifying behavioral patterns and providing a probabilistic representation of the dynamics of human behavior. We discuss the implications of this approach for designing natural, effective multimodal robot behaviors.

This distance is significant because it encompasses the most common human social interaction distances, the exception being the public distance zone used for formal presentations. The correspondence complements prior, broad surveys of affective expression by reviewing the psychology, computer science, and robotics literature specifically relating the impact of social interaction in non-anthropomorphic and appearance-constrained robots, and summarizing robotic implementations that utilize non-facial and non-verbal methods of affective expression as their primary means of expression.

The World Health Organization has reported that breast cancer, with 502,000 deaths in 2005, surpassed lung, stomach, colorectal, and cervical cancers as the leading cause of death in women. The main objective of the current study was to examine the predictive role of emotional selfregulation in quality of life and perception of suffering among patients with breast cancer. Methods: This was a descriptive-analytical study followed by a correlational design. The sample population consisted of 42 patients with breast cancer selected by the census method. Participants completed questionnaires on emotional self-regulation, quality of life (Aaronson et al., 1987), and perception of suffering. The obtained data was statistically analyzed using the Pearson correlation coefficient and regression analysis via SPSS 22. Results: There was a significant, positive association between emotional selfregulation and the functional and general dimensions of quality of life. A significant, inverse correlation existed between emotional self-regulation and the symptoms dimension of quality of life. The results of the enter regression analysis showed that selfregulation respectively predicted 0.18 of variance in the functional, 0.26 in symptoms, and 0.37 of the variance in the general health dimensions of the quality of life. Emotional self-regulation had a significant, diverse relationship to the physical, psychological, and existential dimensions of perception of suffering. The results of the regression analysis carried out to predict perception of suffering indicated that emotional self-regulation respectively predicted 0.33 of variance in the physical, 0.19 in psychological, and 0.06 of the variance in the existential dimensions of perception of suffering.

With the goal of addressing this research gap, we present a study exploring the dynamic nature of trust. We defined trust of entirety as a measure that accounts for trust across a human's entire interactive experience with automation, and first identified alternatives to quantify it using real-time measurements of trust. Second, we provided a novel model that attempts to explain how trust of entirety evolves as a user interacts repeatedly with automation. Lastly, we investigated the effects of automation transparency on momentary changes of trust. Our results indicated that trust of entirety is better quantified by the average measure of “area under the trust curve” than the traditional post-experiment trust measure. In addition, we found that trust of entirety evolves and eventually stabilizes as an operator repeatedly interacts with a technology. Finally, we observed that a higher level of automation transparency may mitigate the “cry wolf’ effect - wherein human operators begin to reject an automated system due to repeated false alarms.","[{'authorId': '2107541219', 'name': 'X.

The aim of the article is to draw up a structural and functional model of development of profession-oriented and specialized competences of students during the studying of profession-related disciplines and to test this model. The leading method to study this problem is pedagogical modeling, enabling us to consider this problem as the process of development of profession-oriented and specialized competences through self-development and self-fulfillment by doing vocational and pedagogical tasks. The article outlines the structural and functional model of development of profession-oriented and specialized competences of students while studying professionrelated disciplines, consisting of interconnected components: purpose-oriented, theoretical and methodological, informative, organizational and activity-related, assessment and adjustment, and performance-related; an algorithm to introduce this model was also developed. The results of the study contain the invariable foundation of methodological support of profession-oriented disciplines and can be recommended for use for the entire range of educational disciplines for profilisation.

The present review aims to inform educators on what cognitive neuroscience can teach us about self-regulation. To do so, we will focus on a decade-long research program examining children with disruptive behavior problems and their peers, and ask whether neural measures of self-regulation can (a) covary with individual differences in behavioral measures of self-regulation, (b) trace developmental patterns, and (c) predict or trace behavioral change with successful treatment of disruptive behavior problems. We show that several studies begin to converge on a set of neural measures derived from the prefrontal cortex that can be consistently linked to processes of self-regulation.

Men showed significantly greater FWHRs than women, but this difference could be attributed to differences in body size. In addition, I found greater FWHRs in men who competed in sports involving physical contact and those stereotyped as more masculine. Again, these results could be attributed to differences in body size between categories. For women, no differences in FWHR were found regarding the amount of contact involved in a sport and how that sport was stereotyped. Finally, the FWHRs of athletes showed no relationship with the amount of aggression and related traits that were judged as required for success in those sports, although FWHRs did correlate with perceived endurance demands in women.

This path analysis model included features of parenting, emotion regulation, preschool language skills, and attention to predict child outcomes in 1st grade. Early caregiving environments were directly predictive of peer relationship satisfaction, oppositional behavior, social skills, and classroom competence over and above significant mediated effects through preschool self-regulation (language, inattention, and anger/frustration). These results suggest that the characteristics of supportive and stimulating caregiving shift in valence over time, such that qualities of the infant-child relationship that are significant in predicting early childhood outcomes are not the same as the caregiving qualities that move to the foreground in predicting primary school outcomes. Implications for school-readiness programming are discussed, including interventions in the early caregiving system to encourage sensitive and supportive parent-child interactions to bolster school readiness via the development of social-emotional competence.","[{'authorId': '48845969', 'name': 'B.

Human-animal interaction (HAI) is widely used as a method of reducing psychological distress. However, research findings in support of HAI have not kept pace with the widespread prevalence in practice.


OBJECTIVE
I review and synthesize the quantitative evidence for the influence of HAI on psychological distress and outline future directions for research.


RESULTS
The evidence suggests that HAI has a small-to-medium effect on distress but does not clarify whether animals account for the treatment effects. Research also has not determined whether positive effects observed in circumscribed HAI programs extend to companion animal ownership.


CONCLUSION
HAI research needs to address methodological limitations and expand the focus beyond treatment outcome studies. By increasing our understanding of the processes through which HAI reduces distress, the circumstances under which it is most effective at doing so, and the influence HAI has on the animals, we can enhance the impact of HAI.","[{'authorId': '8251390', 'name': 'M.

The CBQ is a caregiver report measure designed to provide a detailed assessment of temperament in children 3 to 7 years of age. Individual differences are assessed on 15 primary temperament characteristics: Positive Anticipation, Smiling/Laughter, High Intensity Pleasure, Activity Level, Impulsivity, Shyness, Discomfort, Fear, Anger/Frustration, Sadness, Soothability, Inhibitory Control, Attentional Focusing, Low Intensity Pleasure, and Perceptual Sensitivity. Factor analyses of CBQ scales reliably recover a three-factor solution indicating three broad dimensions of temperament: Extraversion/Surgency, Negative Affectivity, and Effortful Control. This three-factor solution also appears to be reliably recovered in ratings of children in other cultures (e.g., China and Japan). Evidence for convergent validity derives from confirmation of hypothesized relations between temperament and socialization-relevant traits. In addition, parental agreement on CBQ ratings is substantial. The CBQ scales demonstrate adequate internal consistency, and may be used in studies requiring a highly differentiated yet integrated measure of temperament for children in this age range.","[{'authorId': '4597920', 'name': 'M.

Robot-assisted Therapy (RAT) can improve the behavior of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in a spontaneous and entertaining way. There are no previous experiences of this type of inter vention in our country.


OBJECTIVE
To describe a clinical experience of using RAT and its impact on the behaviors of a group of children with ASD, in a therapeutic context.


PATIENTS AND METHOD
Quasi experimental clinical experience type study. 4 children with a clinical diagnosis of ASD were selected, supported by the ADOS-2 (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule); aged between 9 and 13 years, and normal IQ according to the WISC-III (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children). This study was approved by the Central Metropolitan Ethics Committee. Patients attended 10 structured robot-as sisted therapy sessions, working collaboratively in pairs. Workshop attendance and parent and child satisfaction were evaluated through surveys, the adaptive behavior with the Vineland scale, and so cial interaction with video coding guidelines.


RESULTS
Patients presented a very good adherence and satisfaction with the activity. There was an improvement in socialization behaviors and social age. Video-coding showed an increase in social interaction and improvement in the behavior of the pa tients after attending workshops.


CONCLUSIONS
We observed that the experience with RAT, adapted to the context of a Chilean public health center, was highly attractive and beneficial for patients with ASD, improving core symptoms such as difficulties in social interaction and behavioral problems.","[{'authorId': '2081550381', 'name': 'C.

The health of older adults declines over time, but there are many ways of measuring health. It is unclear whether all health measures decline at the same rate or whether some aspects of health are less sensitive to aging than others.


METHODS
We compared the decline in 13 measures of physical, mental, and functional health from the Cardiovascular Health Study: hospitalization, bed days, cognition, extremity strength, feelings about life as a whole, satisfaction with the purpose of life, self-rated health, depression, digit symbol substitution test, grip strength, activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, and gait speed. Each measure was standardized against self-rated health. We compared the 5-year change to see which of the 13 measures declined the fastest and the slowest.


RESULTS
The 5-year change in standardized health varied from a decline of 12 points (out of 100) for hospitalization to a decline of 17 points for gait speed. In most comparisons, standardized health from hospitalization and bed days declined the least, whereas health measured by activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, and gait speed declined the most. These rankings were independent of age, sex, mortality patterns, and the method of standardization.


CONCLUSIONS
All of the health variables declined, on average, with advancing age, but at significantly different rates. Standardized measures of mental health, cognition, quality of life, and hospital utilization did not decline as fast as gait speed, activities of daily living, and instrumental activities of daily living. Public health interventions to address problems with gait speed, activities of daily living, and instrumental activities of daily living may help older adults to remain healthier in all dimensions.","[{'authorId': '47733232', 'name': 'P.

It is an important form of emotional communication and is a developmental milestone for human infants in their ability to learn about their environment through social means. In this paper, we present a biologically-inspired computational model of social referencing for our expressive, anthropomorphic robot that consists of three interacting systems: emotional empathy through facial imitation, a shared attention mechanism, and an affective memory system. This model presents opportunities for understanding how these mechanisms might interact to enable social referencing behavior in humans.","[{'authorId': '1682788', 'name': 'A.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the neural substrates of these impairments. We compared neural activity recruited by 126 clinically depressed and healthy adolescents (ages 11‐17 years) during social exclusion (Exclusion > Inclusion) using Cyberball. Results revealed significant interaction effects within left anterior insula (AI)/inferior frontal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus. Insula hyperresponsivity was associated with peer exclusion for depressed adolescents but peer inclusion for healthy adolescents. In additional, healthy adolescents recruited greater lateral temporal activity during peer exclusion. Complementary effect size analyses within independent parcellations offered converging evidence, as well as highlighted medium‐to‐large effects within subgenual/ventral anterior cingulate cortex and lateral prefrontal, lateral temporal and lateral parietal regions implicated in emotion regulation. Depressogenic neural patterns were associated with negative self‐perceptions and negative information processing biases. These findings suggest a neural mechanism underlying cognitive biases in depression, as reflected by emotional hyperresponsivity and maladaptive regulation/reappraisal of negative social evaluative information. This study lends further support for salience and central executive network dysfunction underlying social threat processing, and in particular, highlights the anterior insula as a key region of disturbance in adolescent depression.","[{'authorId': '49818941', 'name': 'K.

The degree of difficulty experienced during down-regulation of sadness was higher in depressed individuals. Furthermore, there was greater activation in the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, right anterior temporal pole, right amygdala, and right insula in depressed individuals.

However, most studies have tended to focus on the negative impact of the work, the quantitative evidence has been inconsistent, and the research has primarily been conducted outside the United Kingdom. Objectives This study aimed to assess the prevalence of, and identify predictor variables for, compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress in a group of UK therapists (N=253) working with adult trauma clients. Method An online questionnaire was developed which used The Professional Quality of Life Scale (Version 5) to assess compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress and collect demographics and other pertinent information. Results Whilst the majority of therapists scored within the average range for compassion satisfaction and burnout, 70% of scores indicated that therapists were at high risk of secondary traumatic stress. Maturity, time spent engaging in research and development activities, a higher perceived supportiveness of management, and supervision predicted higher potential for compassion satisfaction. Youth and a lower perceived supportiveness of management predicted higher risk of burnout. A higher risk of secondary traumatic stress was predicted in therapists engaging in more individual supervision and self-care activities, as well as those who had a personal trauma history. Conclusions UK therapists working with trauma clients are at high risk of being negatively impacted by their work, obtaining scores which suggest a risk of developing secondary traumatic stress. Of particular note was that exposure to trauma stories did not significantly predict secondary traumatic stress scores as suggested by theory. However, the negative impact of working with trauma clients was balanced by the potential for a positive outcome from trauma work as a majority indicated an average potential for compassion satisfaction.","[{'authorId': '1400842394', 'name': 'Ekundayo A.

In functional imaging studies comparing MDD subjects to normal controls at baseline, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity has been found to be decreased and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) activity has been found to be increased in MDD. Other regions found abnormal in baseline studies include the anterior cingulate gyrus (AC), temporal lobe, and basal ganglia. Studies examining mood state change (using sleep deprivation, sadness-induction, and tryptophan depletion) and changes from pre- to posttreatment have generally shown improvement of these abnormalities with improved MDD symptoms and worsening of these abnormalities with worsening symptoms. In structural imaging studies, decreased frontal lobe, hippocampal, and basal ganglia volumes are the most commonly reported findings. Several associations can be made between clinical features of MDD and brain function: (1) active sad thoughts/sadness with both decreased DLPFC and dorsal AC activity and increased VLPFC and ventral AC activity (2) psychomotor retardation with decreased left prefrontal activity (3) anxiety with increased left AC activity (4) impaired episodic memory with left prefrontal and medial temporal dysfunction and (5) impaired sustained attention with right prefrontal and parietal dysfunction.","[{'authorId': '5102129', 'name': 'A.

e6429354caad6af30b3ccf4bed4e08c9af97ee30,"Robot emotion representation is gaining increasing attention to facilitate long-term human-robot interaction (HRI) in recent years. In particular, human-like robot emotion elicited through HRI is of great use in creating trust between humans and robots. In attempting to represent robot emotions that lead to gaining social acceptance, psychological studies of human emotion have been extensively performed. Among the various factors that affect the way people express their emotional competencies, we conjecture that two factors, social interaction and experience, can be considered important to elicit human emotions, and therefore can be used to represent robot emotions. We believe that social and developmental interaction paradigms, such as social sharing and social referencing, can shape robot emotions toward promoting social acceptance. Besides, the robot’s previous experience can be a key factor contributing to robot personality formation and development. In this paper, we not only focus on the modeling of two eliciting factors affecting the formation of robot emotion but also examine the decline of memory retention over time. Specifically, the relationship between emotion and memory is investigated to design a filter for the memory consolidation process and memory forgetting mechanism. The mechanism is used to enhance robot memory performance based on emotional salience and time parameters. Experiments were performed with a humanoid robot Pepper having verbal and non-verbal interactions with 24 human subjects. Participants rate their perception of the robot in terms of human-likeness, likeability, safety, and emotional expressions through a questionnaire. The results showed that most of the participants enjoyed interacting with the robot and they wished they could have more interactions in the future. They perceived safety and responded favorably toward the robot emotional expressions.","[{'authorId': '28927648', 'name': 'Ha-Duong Bui'}, {'authorId': '16581312', 'name': 'Thi Le Quyen Dang'}, {'authorId': '1771640', 'name': 'N.

Dynamic signals from movement can be exploited to provide this expression while the robot is acting to perform its task. A research effort has been started to find general emotion expression models for actions that could be applied to any kind of robot to obtain believable and easily detectable emotional expressions. The need for a unified representation of emotional expression emerged. A framework to define action characteristics that could be used to represent emotions is proposed in this paper. Guidelines are provided to identify quantitative models and numerical values for parameters, which can be used to design and engineer emotional robot actions. A set of robots having different shapes, movement possibilities, and goals have been implemented following these guidelines. Thanks to the proposed framework, different models to implement emotional expression can now be compared in a sound way.

Maternal meta-emotion interviews, observations of mother–child interaction and assessments of adolescent adjustment were obtained. Results indicated that mothers of adolescents with high levels of depressive symptoms were less accepting and expressive of their own emotions than were mothers of adolescents with low levels of depressive symptoms. A mother's acceptance of her own emotion was associated with fewer depressive symptoms, higher self-esteem and fewer externalizing problems in young adolescents. A mother's emotion coaching was associated with lower frequency and less likelihood of the reciprocity of aversive and dysphoric affect during mother–child interaction.

Researchers have hypothesized that robots that can adapt to children’s affective states and can also learn from the environment can result in sustaining engagement during cHRI. Recently, researchers have conducted a range of studies where robots portray different social capabilities and have shown that it has positively influenced children’s engagement. However, despite an immense body of research on implementation of different adaptive social robots, a pivotal question remains unanswered: Which adaptations portrayed by a robot can result in maintaining long-term social engagement during cHRI? In other words, what are the appropriate and effective adaptations portrayed by a robot that will sustain social engagement for an extended number of interactions? In this article, we report on a study conducted with three groups of children who played a snakes and ladders game with the NAO robot to address the aforementioned question. The NAO performed 1) game-based adaptations, 2) emotion-based adaptations, and 3) memory-based adaptation. Our results showed that emotion-based adaptations were found out to be most effective, followed by memory-based adaptations. Game adaptation didn’t result in sustaining long-term social engagement.","[{'authorId': '34221329', 'name': 'M.

Two models were tested. The 1st model, derived from developmental theories, proposed that basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness would predict identity and intimacy achievement, which would, in turn, predict academic intrinsic motivation. A 2nd model, based on self-determination theory, proposed that identity and intimacy would predict academic motivation and that this relationship would be mediated by basic psychological needs. Results from path analyses supported the model derived from self-determination theory over the model derived from developmental theories. Competence and identity were found to be the 2 constructs most strongly associated with academic motivation.

We describe a continuing body of research that identifies factors impacting a human's level of trust in a robotic teammate. The factors identified to date can be categorized as human influences (e.g., individual differences in terms of personality, experience, culture), machine influences (e.g., robotic platform, robot performance in terms of levels of automation, failure rates, false alarms), and environmental influences (e.g. task type, operational environment, shared mental models).

In such Human-robot Interaction (HRI), trust and mutual adaption are established and maintained through a positive social relationship between a user and a robot. This social relationship relies on the perceived competence of a robot on the social-emotional dimension. However, because of technical limitations and user heterogeneity, current HRI is far from error-free, especially when a system leaves controlled lab environments and is applied to in-the-wild conditions. Errors in HRI may either degrade a user’s perception of a robot’s capability in achieving a task (defined as performance errors in this work) or degrade a user’s perception of a robot’s socio-affective competence (defined as social errors in this work). The impact of these errors and effective strategies to handle such an impact remains an open question. We focus on social errors in HRI in this work. In particular, we identify the major attributes of perceived socio-affective competence by reviewing human social interaction studies and HRI error studies. This motivates us to propose a taxonomy of social errors in HRI. We then discuss the impact of social errors situated in three representative HRI scenarios. This article provides foundations for a systematic analysis of the social-emotional dimension of HRI. The proposed taxonomy of social errors encourages the development of user-centered HRI systems, designed to offer positive and adaptive interaction experiences and improved interaction outcomes.","[{'authorId': '2988495', 'name': 'Leimin Tian'}, {'authorId': '2807460', 'name': 'S.

However, new theorizing suggests the benefits of emotion regulation should depend on its context. One important contextual moderator might be socioeconomic status (SES), because SES powerfully shapes people’s ecology: lower SES affords less control over one’s environment and thus, the ability to self-regulate should be particularly important. Accordingly, effectively regulating one’s emotions (e.g., using cognitive reappraisal) could be more beneficial in lower (vs. higher) SES contexts. Three studies (N = 429) tested whether SES moderates the link between cognitive reappraisal ability (CRA; measured with surveys and in the laboratory) and depression. Each study and a meta-analysis of the 3 studies revealed that CRA was associated with less depression for lower SES but not higher SES individuals. Thus, CRA may be uniquely beneficial in lower SES contexts. More broadly, the effects of emotion regulation depend upon the ecology within which it is used.","[{'authorId': '4041983', 'name': 'Allison S. Troy'}, {'authorId': '5743779', 'name': 'B.

Confirmatory factor analyses revealed differentiated ratings of oppositional, aggressive, and hyperactive/inattentive behaviors at home. Teacher and peer nominations assessed school adjustment at the end of first grade. As expected from a developmental perspective, aggressive behaviors indicated more severe dysfunction and were more likely to generalize to the school setting than were oppositional behaviors. Hyperactive/inattentive behaviors at home led to more classroom disruption than did aggressive or oppositional behaviors. Co-occurring patterns of oppositional/aggressive and hyperactive/inattentive behaviors were more common than were single-problem patterns, and were associated with broad dysfunction in the social and classroom contexts. The results were interpreted within a developmental framework, in which oppositional, aggressive, and hyperactive/inattentive behaviors may reflect distinct (as well as shared) developmental processes that have implications for the home-to-school generalization of behavior problems and subsequent school adjustment.","[{'authorId': '2596914', 'name': 'Elizabeth A.

Robots should be able to infer conversational failures by detecting human users’ behavioural and social signals. In this paper, we study and analyse these behavioural cues in response to robot conversational failures. Using a guided task corpus, where robot embodiment and time pressure are manipulated, we ask human annotators to estimate whether user affective states differ during various types of robot failures. We also train a random forest classifier to detect whether a robot failure has occurred and compare results to human annotator benchmarks. Our findings show that human-like robots augment users’ reactions to failures, as shown in users’ visual attention, in comparison to non-humanlike smart-speaker embodiments. The results further suggest that speech behaviours are utilised more in responses to failures when non-human-like designs are present. This is particularly important to robot failure detection mechanisms that may need to consider the robot’s physical design in its failure detection model.

Assessment must differentiate anxiety disorders from developmentally appropriate fears as well as medical conditions and drugs that can mimic anxiety states. Aetiology of anxiety disorders in this group encompasses complex genetic and environmental influences. Additional insight into causation is provided by neuroimaging and research into temperament. Recommended interventions include both cognitive-behavioural therapy and pharmacology. Although childhood anxiety disorders generally remit, there remains an increased risk for anxiety and depressive disorders to emerge in adulthood, most likely through heterotypical continuity.","[{'authorId': '6034828', 'name': 'A.

Innovative technology, such as socially assistive robots, has shown to be a viable method for Autism therapy. This paper presents a novel robot-based music-therapy platform for modeling and improving the social responses and behaviors of children with ASD. Our autonomous social interactive system consists of three modules. Module one provides an autonomous initiative positioning system for the robot, NAO, to properly localize and play the instrument (Xylophone) using the robot’s arms. Module two allows NAO to play customized songs composed by individuals. Module three provides a real-life music therapy experience to the users. We adopted Short-time Fourier Transform and Levenshtein distance to fulfill the design requirements: 1) “music detection” and 2) “smart scoring and feedback”, which allows NAO to understand music and provide additional practice and oral feedback to the users as applicable. We designed and implemented six Human-Robot-Interaction (HRI) sessions including four intervention sessions. Nine children with ASD and seven Typically Developing participated in a total of fifty HRI experimental sessions. Using our platform, we collected and analyzed data on social behavioral changes and emotion recognition using Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signals. The results of our experiments demonstrate most of the participants were able to complete motor control tasks with 70% accuracy. Six out of the nine ASD participants showed stable turn-taking behavior when playing music. The results of automated emotion classification using Support Vector Machines illustrates that emotional arousal in the ASD group can be detected and well recognized via EDA bio-signals. In summary, the results of our data analyses, including emotion classification using EDA signals, indicate that the proposed robot-music based therapy platform is an attractive and promising assistive tool to facilitate the improvement of fine motor control and turn-taking skills in children with ASD.","[{'authorId': '3018638', 'name': 'Huanghao Feng'}, {'authorId': '145531712', 'name': 'M.

Neither simply-proactive (e.g. talk to everyone in a sight) nor passive (e.g. wait until being talked to) strategies are desired. This paper reports our modeling of polite approaching behavior. In a shopping mall, there are service staff members who politely approach visitors who need help. Our analysis revealed that staff members are sensitive to ‘intentions’ of nearby visitors. That is, when a visitor intends to talk to a staff member and starts to approach, the staff member also walks a few steps toward the visitors in advance to being talked. Further, even when not being approached, staff members exhibit ’’availability’’ behavior in the case that a visitor’s intention seems uncertain.

e8cfbfb00dd1b3c86d8eb6c000f37aba6139629a,"Trust is a critical factor for achieving the full potential of human-robot teams. Researchers have theorized that people will more accurately trust an autonomous system, such as a robot, if they have a more accurate understanding of its decision-making process. Studies have shown that hand-crafted explanations can help maintain trust when the system is less than 100% reliable. In this work, we leverage existing agent algorithms to provide a domain-independent mechanism for robots to automatically generate such explanations. To measure the explanation mechanism's impact on trust, we collected self-reported survey data and behavioral data in an agent-based online testbed that simulates a human-robot team task. The results demonstrate that the added explanation capability led to improvement in transparency, trust, and team performance. Furthermore, by observing the different outcomes due to variations in the robot's explanation content, we gain valuable insight that can help lead to refinement of explanation algorithms to further improve human-robot trust calibration.","[{'authorId': '2152169632', 'name': 'Ning Wang'}, {'authorId': '1748597', 'name': 'D.

We investigated whether adult attachment styles and personality disorders share a common underlying structure, and how both kinds of variables relate to family background factors, including parental death, parental divorce, and current representations of childhood relationships with parents. A nonclinical group of 1407 individuals, mostly adolescents and young adults, were surveyed about their attachment styles, parental marital status, parental mortality status, perceptions of treatment by parents in childhood, and 13 personality disorders. Results indicated substantial overlap between attachment and personality-disorder measures. Two of the personality-disorder dimensions are related to the two dimensions of the attachment space; that is, there is a two-dimensional space in which both the attachment patterns and most of the personality disorders can be arrayed. The one personality-disorder factor that is unrelated to attachment appears akin to psychopathy. Both personality disorders and attachment styles were associated with family-of-origin variables. Results are discussed in terms of encouraging further research to test the idea that insecure attachment and most of the personality disorders share similar developmental antecedents.","[{'authorId': '47484526', 'name': 'Kelly A.

Typically, features of emotion regulation are assessed with self-report questionnaires. Heart rate variability (HRV) is an objective measure proposed as an index of emotional regulation capacity. A limited number of studies have shown that self-reported difficulties in emotion regulation are associated with HRV. However, results from prior studies are inconclusive, and an ecological validation of the association has not yet been tested. Therefore, further exploration of the relation between self-report questionnaires and psychophysiological measures of emotional regulation is needed. The present study investigated the contribution of self-reported emotion regulation difficulties on HRV in a student sample. We expected higher scores on emotion regulation difficulties to be associated with lower vagus-mediated HRV (vmHRV). Sixty-three participants filled out the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale and their resting HRV was assessed. In addition, a subsample of participants provided ambulatory 24-h HRV data, in order to ecologically validate the resting data. Correlation analyses indicated that self-reported difficulties in emotion regulation was negatively associated with vmHRV in both resting HRV and 24-h HRV. Specifically, when exploring the contribution of the different facets of emotion dysregulation, the inability to accept negative emotions showed the strongest association with HRV. The results are discussed and need for future research is described.","[{'authorId': '6708093', 'name': 'Endre Visted'}, {'authorId': '1400858442', 'name': 'L.

e98ec5467e4fb7154132ee1e833b347cdefdf85f,"Background Low social support is consistently associated with postpartum depression. Previous studies do not always control for previous mental health and do not consider what type of support (tangible, emotional, informational or positive social interaction) is most important. The objectives are: to examine if low social support contributes to subsequent risk of depressive or anxiety symptoms and to determine which type of support is most important. Methods Data from the All Our Families longitudinal pregnancy cohort were used (n=3057). Outcomes were depressive or anxiety symptoms at 4 months and 1 year postpartum. Exposures were social support during pregnancy and at 4 months postpartum. Log binomial models were used to calculate risk ratios (RRs) and absolute risk differences, controlling for past mental health. Results Low total social support during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.82) and anxiety symptoms (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.93) at 4 months postpartum. Low total social support at 4 months was associated with an increased risk of anxiety symptoms (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.09) at 1 year. Absolute risk differences were largest among women with previous mental health challenges resulting in a number needed to treat of 5 for some outcomes. Emotional/informational support was the most important type of support for postpartum anxiety. Conclusion Group prenatal care, prenatal education and peer support programmes have the potential to improve social support. Prenatal interventions studies are needed to confirm these findings in higher risk groups.","[{'authorId': '145655648', 'name': 'Erin Hetherington'}, {'authorId': '143613324', 'name': 'S.

A Continuous Performance Task and a Working Memory Task were used to measure cognitive functions. Sixty-five male participants from the Royal Norwegian Navy participated. HRV was measured during baseline, test conditions and recovery. Participants were randomly assigned into non-threat and threat groups. Based on the median split of the high frequency (HF) spectral power, groups were divided into two additional groups. Overall, the high HRV participants showed superior performance on cognitive tasks independent of non-threat or threat conditions. During threat condition the low HRV group showed improved performance. Thus, individuals with high HRV were more stress tolerant and resilient in the face of environmental changes. The results from the study might have implications with regard to performance in operational settings, but also for other fields of psychological research such as individual differences, anxiety and coping.","[{'authorId': '5691200', 'name': 'A.

Previous studies have attempted to replicate Asch’s experiment with a group of robots but have failed to observe conformity [7], [25]. One explanation can be made using Hodges and Geyers work [17], in which they propose that people consider distinct criteria (truth, trust, and social solidarity) when deciding whether to conform to others. In order to study how trust and truth affect conformity, we propose an experiment in which participants play a game with three robots, in which there are no objective answers. We measured how many times participants changed their preliminary answers to match the group of robots’ in their final answer. We conducted a between-subjects study (N = 30) in which there were two conditions: one in which participants saw the group of robots’ preliminary answer before deciding their final answer, and a control condition in which they did not know the robots’ preliminary answer. Participants in the experimental condition conformed significantly more (29%) than participants in the control condition (6%). Therefore we have shown that groups of robots can cause people to conform to them. Additionally trust plays a role in conformity: initially, participants conformed to robots at a similar rate to Asch’s participants, however, many participants stop conforming later in the game when trust is lost due to the robots choosing an incorrect answer.","[{'authorId': '3220164', 'name': 'Nicole Salomons'}, {'authorId': '144778466', 'name': 'Michael van der Linden'}, {'authorId': '36152065', 'name': 'S.

Robots will need to predict and adapt to the actions of human collaborators in order to achieve good performance and improve safety and end-user adoption. This paper evaluates a human-robot collaboration scheme that combines the task allocation and motion levels of reasoning: the robotic agent uses Bayesian inference to predict the next goal of its human partner from his or her ongoing motion, and re-plans its own actions in real time. This anticipative adaptation is desirable in many practical scenarios, where humans are unable or unwilling to take on the cognitive overhead required to explicitly communicate their intent to the robot. A behavioral experiment indicates that the combination of goal inference and dynamic task planning significantly improves both objective and perceived performance of the human-robot team. Participants were highly sensitive to the differences between robot behaviors, preferring to work with a robot that adapted to their actions over one that did not.","[{'authorId': '2118484076', 'name': 'Chang Liu'}, {'authorId': '2158860', 'name': 'Jessica B.

Objective This single-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to investigate the use of PARO, a therapeutic, socially assistive pet robot, in improving mood, and stimulating social interaction and communication for people with dementia in the community. Methods For the study, 40 community-dwelling older Chinese adults (≥60 years) with mild to moderate dementia will be recruited and randomly assigned to the PARO therapy group or the psychosocial activities control group. Both treatments consist of six, 30-minute weekly sessions, which will be conducted in a geriatric day hospital. Subjects in both groups will be assessed by a trained research assistant at baseline (pre-), during, and post-treatment. Mood (assessed with a simplified face scale), social interaction, and communication (ie, facial expressions and reactions towards each treatment, assessed with an observation table) will be the primary outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures will include assessments on cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination) and depressive symptoms (Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia), as well as caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Inventory). Subjective impression towards each treatment and qualitative comments from the caregivers, facilitator, and therapists will also be obtained. Results Recruitment to the pilot study began in 2014 and the last subject is expected to complete their post-treatment assessment in 2015. Conclusions This will be the first RCT using PARO to improve mood, and stimulate social interaction and communication in the care of older people with dementia, as well as provide an evidence basis for the use of PARO in dementia care in Hong Kong.

Despite this knowledge, many educational tools, such as vocabulary training programs, still model the interaction in a tutoring scenario as unidirectional knowledge transfer rather than a social dialog. Therefore, ongoing research aims to develop virtual agents as more appropriate media in education. Virtual agents can induce the perception of a life-like social interaction partner that communicates through natural modalities such as speech, gestures and emotional expressions. This effect can be additionally enhanced with a physical robotic embodiment. This paper presents the development of social supportive behaviors for a robotic tutor to be used in a language learning application. The effect of these behaviors on the learning performance of students was evaluated.

A random stratified two-stage sampling is used to obtain the results; descriptive and ANOVA analyses with different factors are performed. The evolution shows how the numbers of students who combine work and study has increased, especially among those whose parents have little education. Furthermore, this means that lower marks are obtained and that there is a greater degree of inequality in labour market insertion, depending on the educational background of the family of origin.

The present study was conducted to investigate the mediating role of emotional regulation in the relationship between spiritual health with quality of life, psychological health, and burnout. Method : In this study, 231 staff from Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences completed Spiritual Well-Being Scale (SWBS), Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28), and Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). The gathered data were analyzed using Pearson correlation, Hierarchical Regression analysis, and Sobel’s test. Results: All variables were correlated with one another (p<0.001). The hierarchical regression analysis and Sobel’s test indicated that the emotional regulation have a relative mediating role in the relationship between spiritual health and quality of life (ß=0.53, Z=4.05, p<0.001) and a complete mediating role in the relationship between spiritual health with mental health (ß=0.68, Z=5.62, p<0.001) and burnout (ß=0.70, Z=6.12, p<0.001). Conclusion: There is a complex and non-linear relationship between spiritual health and the areas of quality of life, mental health and burnout. This relationship is potentially influenced by emotional regulation.","[{'authorId': '35918320', 'name': 'M.

Although self-compassion has been studied primarily in healthy populations, one particularly compelling clinical context in which to examine self-compassion is social anxiety disorder (SAD). SAD is characterized by high levels of negative self-criticism as well as an abiding concern about others’ evaluation of one's performance. In the present study, we tested the hypotheses that: (1) people with SAD would demonstrate less self-compassion than healthy controls (HCs), (2) self-compassion would relate to severity of social anxiety and fear of evaluation among people with SAD, and (3) age would be negatively correlated with self-compassion for people with SAD, but not for HC. As expected, people with SAD reported less self-compassion than HCs on the Self-Compassion Scale and its subscales. Within the SAD group, lesser self-compassion was not generally associated with severity of social anxiety, but it was associated with greater fear of both negative and positive evaluation. Age was negatively correlated with self-compassion for people with SAD, whereas age was positively correlated with self-compassion for HC. These findings suggest that self-compassion may be a particularly important target for assessment and treatment in persons with SAD.","[{'authorId': '4534592', 'name': 'K.

The motivation for bullying perpetration often relates to one's social standing in the group. Peer bystanders are typically present when bullying takes place, often providing the perpetrators with social rewards. The more such rewards (e.g., laughing, cheering) are present and the less the victimized children are supported and defended, the more likely bullying is maintained in a classroom or a peer group. However, bystanders are not necessarily aware of the consequences of their responses when witnessing bullying, and they may not know how to support and defend vulnerable peers. In interventions aiming to reduce bullying, peer bystanders' awareness of their own role, their empathy toward victimized youth, as well as their self-efficacy related to defending those youth should be enhanced. Intervention evaluations have shown that changing bystander responses to bullying is a fruitful way to reduce bullying and victimization.","[{'authorId': '2999418', 'name': 'C.

The recent literature on emotion regulation (ER), however, highlights that humans typically make efforts to control emotion experiences. This leaves open the possibility that decision effects previously attributed to acute emotion may be a consequence of acute ER strategies such as cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. In Study 1, we manipulated ER of laboratory-induced fear and disgust, and found that the cognitive reappraisal of these negative emotions promotes risky decisions (reduces risk aversion) in the Balloon Analogue Risk Task and is associated with increased performance in the prehunch/hunch period of the Iowa Gambling Task. In Study 2, we found that naturally occurring negative emotions also increase risk aversion in Balloon Analogue Risk Task, but the incidental use of cognitive reappraisal of emotions impedes this effect. We offer evidence that the increased effectiveness of cognitive reappraisal in reducing the experience of emotions underlies its beneficial effects on decision making.","[{'authorId': '3980206', 'name': 'Renata M Heilman'}, {'authorId': '33089090', 'name': 'L.

Human service professionals are concerned with the intervention and empowerment of vulnerable social populations. The human service industry is laden with employment-related stressors and emotionally demanding interactions, which can lead to deleterious effects, such as burnout and secondary traumatic stress. Little attention has been given to developing knowledge of what might enable human service workers to persist and thrive. Cultivating and sustaining resilience can buffer the impact of occupational stressors on human service professionals. One of the psychological factors associated with cultivating resilience is mindfulness.


OBJECTIVE
The aim of this current research is to improve our understanding of the relationship between resilience, mindfulness, burnout, secondary traumatic stress, and psychological distress among human service professionals.


METHODS
The current study surveyed 133 human service professionals working in the fields of psychology, social work, counseling, youth and foster care work to explore the predictive relationship between resilience, mindfulness, and psychological distress.


RESULTS
The results showed that higher levels of resilience were a significant predictor of lower levels of psychological distress, burnout and secondary traumatic stress. In addition, higher levels of mindfulness were a significant predictor of lower levels of psychological distress and burnout.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings suggest that cultivating resilience and mindfulness in human service professionals may assist in preventing psychological distress burnout and secondary traumatic stress. Limitations of this study are discussed together with implications for future research.","[{'authorId': '15052383', 'name': 'Rachel Harker'}, {'authorId': '30785656', 'name': 'Aileen M Pidgeon'}, {'authorId': '20697601', 'name': 'F.

Delivering this adjunct in a controllable robot form allows us to examine its efficacy for therapeutic applications such as anxiety management. With an approach grounded in social cognitive theories for human-animal relations, we deployed a social robot, the Haptic Creature, in an interaction designed to be calming: participants held the robot on their laps and stroked it as it was breathing. As a result, their heart and respiration rates significantly decreased relative to stroking a non-breathing robot.

In contrast to drive models of anxiety but consistent with social learning theory, it is argued that the cognitive state of the individual mediates both affective arousal and behavior. The tradi- tional inverted-U relation between anxiety and performance is reexamined in this light. Implications of the approach for counseling situations are considered, especially the recommendation that treatments be tailored to the specific type of self-presentational problem encountered by clients,","[{'authorId': '34424326', 'name': 'B.

This study applied machine-learning algorithms to categorize EEG dynamics according to subject self-reported emotional states during music listening. A framework was proposed to optimize EEG-based emotion recognition by systematically 1) seeking emotion-specific EEG features and 2) exploring the efficacy of the classifiers. Support vector machine was employed to classify four emotional states (joy, anger, sadness, and pleasure) and obtained an averaged classification accuracy of 82.29% ± 3.06% across 26 subjects. Further, this study identified 30 subject-independent features that were most relevant to emotional processing across subjects and explored the feasibility of using fewer electrodes to characterize the EEG dynamics during music listening. The identified features were primarily derived from electrodes placed near the frontal and the parietal lobes, consistent with many of the findings in the literature. This study might lead to a practical system for noninvasive assessment of the emotional states in practical or clinical applications.","[{'authorId': '47904249', 'name': 'Yuan-Pin Lin'}, {'authorId': '2116630640', 'name': 'Chi-Hong Wang'}, {'authorId': '144437435', 'name': 'T.

There seems to be multiple views of workplace spirituality. It could be argued that there are different definitions for the meaning of “spirituality” due to the very strong personal nature of the word itself. We argue that this multiple view of spirituality is a positive thing for organizations if managers attempt to understand differing spiritual views and also encourage all views within an organization. In this paper, we summarize the different perspectives of spirituality, discuss the benefits of encouraging spirituality within organizations, and examine different perspectives of implementing a spirituality‐based culture within firms.","[{'authorId': '35131997', 'name': 'Sukumarakurup Krishnakumar'}, {'authorId': '72178150', 'name': 'Christopher P.

Two forms of motivation were studied: autonomous motivation, in which employees act with volition,; and controlled motivation, in which they act under internal or external pressure. Data were collected at two time points nine months apart from a sample of 586 school principals in Quebec, Canada. SEM analysis results support the hypothesized model. Specifically, job resources had a positive effect on autonomous motivation but a negative effect on controlled motivation. In addition, taking into account the cross-lagged effects of job resources on commitment and exhaustion, autonomous motivation had a negative effect on exhaustion but a positive effect on commitment whereas controlled motivation had a positive effect on exhaustion. These results advance the understanding of why work motivation acts on employee functioning and how it can play an active role in both the motivational and energetic processes of the job demands-resources model. Practical implications and further theoretical implications are discussed.","[{'authorId': '4210065', 'name': 'Claude Fernet'}, {'authorId': '3912871', 'name': 'S.

Social robots dedicated to assisting persons with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are rarely used in clinics. In a collaborative effort to bridge the gap between innovation in research and clinical practice, a team of engineers, clinicians and researchers working in the field of psychology developed and tested a robot-assisted educational intervention for children with low-functioning ASD (N = 20) A total of 14 lessons targeting requesting and turn-taking were elaborated, based on the Pivotal Training Method and principles of Applied Analysis of Behavior. Results showed that sensory rewards provided by the robot elicited more positive reactions than verbal praises from humans. The robot was of greatest benefit to children with a low level of disability. The educators were quite enthusiastic about children's progress in learning basic psychosocial skills from interactions with the robot. The robot nonetheless failed to act as a social mediator, as more prosocial behaviors were observed in the control condition, where instead of interacting with the robot children played with a ball. We discuss how to program robots to the distinct needs of individuals with ASD, how to harness robots' likability in order to enhance social skill learning, and how to arrive at a consensus about the standards of excellence that need to be met in interdisciplinary co-creation research. Our intuition is that robotic assistance, obviously judged as to be positive by educators, may contribute to the dissemination of innovative evidence-based practice for individuals with ASD.","[{'authorId': '2607018', 'name': 'V.

Novel interventions are required that target underlying factors of multiple disorders. Aims To evaluate the efficacy of a transdiagnostic trait-focused web-based intervention aimed at reducing symptoms of common mental disorders in university students. Method Students were recruited online (n = 1047, age: M = 21.8, SD = 4.2) and categorised into being at high or low risk for mental disorders based on their personality traits. Participants were allocated to a cognitive-behavioural trait-focused (n = 519) or a control intervention (n = 528) using computerised simple randomisation. Both interventions were fully automated and delivered online (trial registration: ISRCTN14342225). Participants were blinded and outcomes were self-assessed at baseline, at 6 weeks and at 12 weeks after registration. Primary outcomes were current depression and anxiety, assessed on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD7). Secondary outcome measures focused on alcohol use, disordered eating, and other outcomes. Results Students at high risk were successfully identified using personality indicators and reported poorer mental health. A total of 520 students completed the 6-week follow-up and 401 students completed the 12-week follow-up. Attrition was high across intervention groups, but comparable to other web-based interventions. Mixed effects analyses revealed that at 12-week follow up the trait-focused intervention reduced depression scores by 3.58 (p<.001, 95%CI [5.19, 1.98]) and anxiety scores by 2.87 (p = .018, 95%CI [1.31, 4.43]) in students at high risk. In high-risk students, between group effect sizes were 0.58 (depression) and 0.42 (anxiety). In addition, self-esteem was improved. No changes were observed regarding the use of alcohol or disordered eating. Conclusions This study suggests that a transdiagnostic web-based intervention for university students targeting underlying personality risk factors may be a promising way of preventing common mental disorders with a low-intensity intervention.

Overweight and obesity in childhood are known to have significant impact on both physical and psychological health. Overweight and obese children are likely to stay obese into adulthood and more likely to develop non-communicable diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases at a younger age. The mechanism of obesity development is not fully understood and it is believed to be a disorder with multiple causes. Environmental factors, lifestyle preferences, and cultural environment play pivotal roles in the rising prevalence of obesity worldwide. In general, overweight and obesity are assumed to be the results of an increase in caloric and fat intake. On the other hand, there are supporting evidence that excessive sugar intake by soft drink, increased portion size, and steady decline in physical activity have been playing major roles in the rising rates of obesity all around the world. Childhood obesity can profoundly affect children's physical health, social, and emotional well-being, and self esteem. It is also associated with poor academic performance and a lower quality of life experienced by the child. Many co-morbid conditions like metabolic, cardiovascular, orthopedic, neurological, hepatic, pulmonary, and renal disorders are also seen in association with childhood obesity.","[{'authorId': '39472251', 'name': 'K.

edd5adccfcd717d6f3f967621222d4e83091fb0c,"Social Robots need to communicate in a way that feels natural to humans if they are to effectively bond with the users and provide an engaging interaction. Inline with this natural, effective communication, robots need to perceive and manage multimodal information, both as input and output, and respond accordingly. Consequently, dialogue design is a key factor in creating an engaging multimodal interaction. These dialogues need to be flexible enough to adapt to unforeseen circumstances that arise during the conversation but should also be easy to create, so the development of new applications gets simpler. In this work, we present our approach to dialogue modelling based on basic atomic interaction units called Communicative Acts. They manage basic interactions considering who has the initiative (the robot or the user), and what is his/her intention. The two possible intentions are either ask for information or give information. In addition, because we focus on one-to-one interactions, the initiative can only be taken by the robot or the user. Communicative Acts can be parametrised and combined in a hierarchical manner to fulfil the needs of the robot’s applications, and they have been equipped with built-in functionalities that are in charge of low-level communication tasks. These tasks include communication error handling, turn-taking or user disengagement. This system has been integrated in Mini, a social robot that has been created to assist older adults with cognitive impairment. In a case of use, we demonstrate the operation of our system as well as its performance in real human–robot interactions.","[{'authorId': '1410567607', 'name': 'Enrique Fernández-Rodicio'}, {'authorId': '2824276', 'name': 'Álvaro Castro González'}, {'authorId': '1401846718', 'name': 'F.

To address some investigative questions in plastic surgery, randomized controlled trials are not always indicated or ethical to conduct. Instead, observational studies may be the next best method of addressing these types of questions. Well-designed observational studies have been shown to provide results similar to those of randomized controlled trials, challenging the belief that observational studies are second rate. Cohort studies and case-control studies are two primary types of observational studies that aid in evaluating associations between diseases and exposures. In this review article, the authors describe these study designs and methodologic issues, and provide examples from the plastic surgery literature.","[{'authorId': '102906965', 'name': 'Jae-Wook Song'}, {'authorId': '145070103', 'name': 'K.

Those 4-year-old children who delayed gratification longer in certain laboratory situations developed into more cognitively and socially competent adolescents, achieving higher scholastic performance and coping better with frustration and stress. Experiments in the same research program also identified specific cognitive and attentional processes that allow effective self-regulation early in the course of development.

These basic motoric experiences of action are influenced by social hierarchies, leading to surprising and morally significant results. Here we ask whether, under coercion, the sense of agency and responsibility pass from the person who receives orders to the person who gives them. Volunteers took turns to play the roles of ‘commander’, ‘agent’ or ‘victim’ in a task where the commander coerced the agent to deliver painful shocks to the ‘victim’. We used ‘intentional binding’ as an implicit measure of sense of agency in both commanders and agents, in conditions of coercion and free-choice. We observed a reduced sense of agency when agents received coercive instructions, relative to when they freely chose which action to execute. We also found that sense of agency in the commanders was reduced when they coerced agents to administer the shock on their behalf, relative to when they acted by themselves. This last effect was associated with the commander’s self-reported level on a psychopathy scale. Thus, coercion resulted in neither commander nor agent feeling agency for the effect of the action, as measured through implicit methods. Our results could have profound implications for social decision-making and social regulation of moral behaviour.","[{'authorId': '2688955', 'name': 'E.

Here we report on the short- and long-term (1 yr) clinical outcomes and tolerance of DBS in eight TRD patients. Electrodes were implanted bilaterally in the subgenual cingulate gyrus (SCG; Broadman areas 24-25), and stimulated at 135 Hz (90-μs pulsewidth). Voltage and active electrode contacts were adjusted to maximize short-term responses. Clinical assessments included the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17; primary measure), the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale. In the first week after surgery, response and remission (HAMD ⩽7) rates were, respectively 87.5% and 50%. These early responses were followed by an overall worsening, with a response and remission rates of 37.5% (3/8) at 1 month. From then onwards, patients showed a progressive improvement, with response and remission rates of 87.5% and 37.5%, respectively, at 6 months. The corresponding figures at 1 yr were 62.5% and 50%, respectively. Clinical effects were seen in all HAMD subscales without a significant incidence of side-effects. Surgical procedure and post-operative period were well-tolerated for all patients. This is the second independent study on the use of DBS of the SCG to treat chronic depression resistant to current therapeutic strategies. DBS fully remitted 50% of the patients at 1 yr, supporting its validity as a new therapeutic strategy for TRD.","[{'authorId': '4364836', 'name': 'D.

ef398db34b09003c96ec91e8e18b26ce7d4d358b,"Connectivity analyses and computational modeling of human brain function from fMRI data frequently require the specification of regions of interests (ROIs). Several analyses have relied on atlases derived from anatomical or cyto‐architectonic boundaries to specify these ROIs, yet the suitability of atlases for resting state functional connectivity (FC) studies has yet to be established. This article introduces a data‐driven method for generating an ROI atlas by parcellating whole brain resting‐state fMRI data into spatially coherent regions of homogeneous FC. Several clustering statistics are used to compare methodological trade‐offs as well as determine an adequate number of clusters. Additionally, we evaluate the suitability of the parcellation atlas against four ROI atlases (Talairach and Tournoux, Harvard‐Oxford, Eickoff‐Zilles, and Automatic Anatomical Labeling) and a random parcellation approach. The evaluated anatomical atlases exhibit poor ROI homogeneity and do not accurately reproduce FC patterns present at the voxel scale. In general, the proposed functional and random parcellations perform equivalently for most of the metrics evaluated. ROI size and hence the number of ROIs in a parcellation had the greatest impact on their suitability for FC analysis. With 200 or fewer ROIs, the resulting parcellations consist of ROIs with anatomic homology, and thus offer increased interpretability. Parcellation results containing higher numbers of ROIs (600 or 1,000) most accurately represent FC patterns present at the voxel scale and are preferable when interpretability can be sacrificed for accuracy.

efabde2a959fbb3dddd8165c8cd36934c58162d3,"Human–robot interactions are often affected by error situations that are caused by either the robot or the human. Therefore, robots would profit from the ability to recognize when error situations occur. We investigated the verbal and non-verbal social signals that humans show when error situations occur in human–robot interaction experiments. For that, we analyzed 201 videos of five human–robot interaction user studies with varying tasks from four independent projects. The analysis shows that there are two types of error situations: social norm violations and technical failures. Social norm violations are situations in which the robot does not adhere to the underlying social script of the interaction. Technical failures are caused by technical shortcomings of the robot. The results of the video analysis show that the study participants use many head movements and very few gestures, but they often smile, when in an error situation with the robot. Another result is that the participants sometimes stop moving at the beginning of error situations. We also found that the participants talked more in the case of social norm violations and less during technical failures. Finally, the participants use fewer non-verbal social signals (for example smiling, nodding, and head shaking), when they are interacting with the robot alone and no experimenter or other human is present. The results suggest that participants do not see the robot as a social interaction partner with comparable communication skills. Our findings have implications for builders and evaluators of human–robot interaction systems. The builders need to consider including modules for recognition and classification of head movements to the robot input channels. The evaluators need to make sure that the presence of an experimenter does not skew the results of their user studies.","[{'authorId': '9936335', 'name': 'M.

Two therapeutic robots were introduced into a care facility, and activated for over 9 h each day to interact with the residents. This paper presents the results of the first month of this experiment. To investigate the psychological and social effects of the robots, each subject was interviewed, and their social network was analyzed. In addition, the activities of the residents in public areas were recorded by video cameras during daytime hours (8:30-18:00). For physiological analysis, residents' urine was obtained and analyzed for hormones 17-ketosteroid sulfate and 17-hydroxycorticosteroids. The experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethical committee of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology. The results indicate that interaction with the seal robots increased their social interaction. Furthermore, the urinary tests showed that the reactions of the subjects' vital organs to stress improved after the introduction of the robots.","[{'authorId': '33228483', 'name': 'K.

f03c01ed0ec002b81b4882b17d435cedbe0a0f7e,"Awareness of the emotion of those who communicate with others is a fundamental challenge in building affective intelligent systems. Emotion is a complex state of the mind influenced by external events, physiological changes, or relationships with others. Because emotions can represent a user's internal context or intention, researchers suggested various methods to measure the user's emotions from analysis of physiological signals, facial expressions, or voice. However, existing methods have practical limitations to be used with consumer devices, such as smartphones; they may cause inconvenience to users and require special equipment such as a skin conductance sensor. Our approach is to recognize emotions of the user by inconspicuously collecting and analyzing user-generated data from different types of sensors on the smartphone. To achieve this, we adopted a machine learning approach to gather, analyze and classify device usage patterns, and developed a social network service client for Android smartphones which unobtrusively find various behavioral patterns and the current context of users. Also, we conducted a pilot study to gather real-world data which imply various behaviors and situations of a participant in her/his everyday life. From these data, we extracted 10 features and applied them to build a Bayesian Network classifier for emotion recognition. Experimental results show that our system can classify user emotions into 7 classes such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, sadness, fear, and neutral with a surprisingly high accuracy. The proposed system applied to a smartphone demonstrated the feasibility of an unobtrusive emotion recognition approach and a user scenario for emotion-oriented social communication between users.","[{'authorId': '2176177', 'name': 'Hosub Lee'}, {'authorId': '2555850', 'name': 'Youngsang Choi'}, {'authorId': '3077590', 'name': 'Sunjae Lee'}, {'authorId': '123733635', 'name': 'I.

Three domains of determinants are identified (personal psychological resources of parents, characteristics of the child, and contextual sources of stress and support), and a process model of competent parental functioning is offered on the basis of the analysis. The model presumes that parental functioning is multiply determined, that sources of contextual stress and support can directly affect parenting or indirectly affect parenting by first influencing individual psychological well-being, that personality influences contextual support/stress, which feeds back to shape parenting, and that, in order of importance, the personal psychological resources of the parent are more effective in buffering the parent-child relation from stress than are contextual sources of support, which are themselves more effective than characteristics of the child.","[{'authorId': '145642829', 'name': 'J.

Progression of Alzheimer dementia (AD) is highly variable. Most estimates derive from convenience samples from dementia clinics or research centers where there is substantial potential for survival bias and other distortions. In a population-based sample of incident AD cases, we examined progression of impairment in cognition, function, and neuropsychiatric symptoms, and the influence of selected variables on these domains.


DESIGN
Longitudinal, prospective cohort study.


SETTING
Cache County (Utah).


PARTICIPANTS
Three hundred twenty-eight persons with a diagnosis of possible/probable AD.


MEASUREMENTS
Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating sum-of-boxes (CDR-sb), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).


RESULTS
Over a mean follow-up of 3.80 (range: 0.07-12.90) years, the mean (SD) annual rates of change were -1.53 (2.69) scale points on the MMSE, 1.44 (1.82) on the CDR-sb, and 2.55 (5.37) on the NPI. Among surviving participants, 30% to 58% progressed less than 1 point per year on these measures, even 5 to 7 years after dementia onset. Rates of change were correlated between MMSE and CDR-sb (r = -0.62, df = 201, p < 0.001) and between the CDR-sb and NPI (r = 0.20, df = 206, p < 0.004). Female subjects (LR χ = 8.7, df = 2, p = 0.013) and those with younger onset (likelihood ratio [LR] χ = 5.7, df = 2, p = 0.058) declined faster on the MMSE. Although one or more apolipoprotein E ε 4 alleles and ever use of FDA-approved antidementia medications were associated with initial MMSE scores, neither was related to the rate of progression in any domain.


CONCLUSIONS
A significant proportion of persons with AD progresses slowly. The results underscore differences between population-based versus clinic-based samples and suggest ongoing need to identify factors that may slow the progression of AD.","[{'authorId': '35217393', 'name': 'J.

Many methods for eliciting emotions have been developed. In general, they involve presenting a stimulus to evoke a response from one or more emotion response systems. The nature of the stimulus varies widely. Passive methods include the presentation of images, film clips, and music. Active methods can involve social or dyadic interactions with other people, or behavior manipulations in which an individual is instructed to adopt facial expressions, postures, or other emotionally-relevant behaviors. This chapter discusses exemplar methods of each type, discusses advantages and disadvantages of each method, and briefly summarizes some additional methods. Keywords/keyphrases affect elicitation, emotional images, emotional film clips, emotional music, backward masking, behavior manipulation, social interaction, dyadic interaction Glossary Affect elicitation: Methods used to evoke (or induce) affective responses in individuals. These methods generally involve presenting a stimulus or immersing the subject in a situation to evoke a response from one or more emotion response systems. The nature of the stimulus varies and could include the presentation of images, film, or music; adopting facial expressions or postures; and social or dyadic interactions, among others. Emotional images: Digital images or photographs that have been carefully selected and evaluated for their potential to evoke affective states in the viewer. Emotional film clips: Short movie segments, usually including both images and sound, which have been selected and evaluated for their potential to evoke affective states in the viewer. Emotional music: A recorded musical piece that has been selected and evaluated for its ability to evoke affective states in the listener. Backward masking: A method used to block conscious awareness of a visual stimulus. The target stimulus is shown to an individual very briefly (such as 15-60ms), followed immediately by a “mask” stimulus shown for a longer time (such as 500ms). Individuals report being consciously aware of only the mask. Behavior manipulation: A method in which individuals are instructed to adopt particular behaviors – such as body postures or facial expressions – in order to induce particular affective states. Social interaction: A relationship between two or more individuals, that may be fleeting or enduring, in which an individual’s actions and behavior are responsive to the actions and behavior of the other individuals. In one affect elicitation method, researchers try to create realistic social interaction scenarios that might evoke emotions in a more naturalistic context. Dyadic interaction: A social interaction specifically between two individuals (see Social Interaction). One affect elicitation method focuses on bringing pairs of individuals together to engage in an unrehearsed, minimally structured conversation in order to evoke affective states in a more naturalistic context.","[{'authorId': '70067892', 'name': 'Jacqueline Kory'}, {'authorId': '1383996606', 'name': 'S.

The function of such working models is to guide an individual's own behavior toward the attachment partner and to interpret and forecast the partner's behavior. So far, however, research on internal working models has largely focused on attachment from the filial rather than the parental perspective even when adults were studied. To remedy this situation, 36 middle-class mothers were interviewed regarding their attachment relationship with their 25-month-old children. Attachment-relevant interview questions were open-ended, allowing the mothers to produce their own descriptive categories. The interview took about an hour. Two analyses were performed on the interview transcripts: a content analysis of specific attachment themes and a global evaluation of attachment quality as conveyed by the interview text as a whole. The content analysis provided interesting findings regarding mother-child affect communication, mother-child separation, and autonomy negotiations. For the global analysis a sensitivity/insight scale was applied to the interview text. This scale was significantly correlated with other attachment measures for the same children at 18 months (Strange Situation), 25 months (Waters &Deane Q-sort), and 37 months (Separation-Reunion Procedure, Attachment Story Completion Task). The sensitivity/insight scale was also significantly and meaningfully correlated with maternal and questionnaire data regarding infant temperament, maternal personality and family climate. In sum, the Parent Attachment Interview provides new insights into parental experiences of the attachment relationship and can also serve as an alternative or additional measure of attachment quality.","[{'authorId': '5638493', 'name': 'I.

Prior research analyzing surface acting—employees' regulation of emotional expressions—has mostly focused on the interactions between front-line employees and their customers in service industries and paid very little attention to intra-organizational relationships. With an aim to shed light on this important yet relatively unexplored area, I developed a theoretical model analyzing the antecedents and outcomes of surface acting within organizations, by drawing on the sociometer theory and self-presentation theory frameworks. 
 
 
 
To test the model, I conducted a cross-level field study in a sample of 65 work groups and 478 employees in two organizations, located in a large city in Northern California. I have collected the data from two sources, including employees and their supervisors who rated their performance. Results indicated that employees were more likely to engage in surface acting when their affective traits and personal goals were less congruent with work environment. Surface acting was also positively related to perceived organizational politics and self-monitoring. As for outcomes, surface acting was positively related to emotional exhaustion and negatively to performance. I discuss limitations, implications, and future research direction.

As a Latin proverb states: ‘The face is the portrait of the mind; the eyes, its informers’. This presents a significant challenge for Computer Graphics researchers who generate artificial entities that aim to replicate the movement and appearance of the human eye, which is so important in human–human interactions. This review article provides an overview of the efforts made on tackling this demanding task. As with many topics in computer graphics, a cross‐disciplinary approach is required to fully understand the workings of the eye in the transmission of information to the user. We begin with a discussion of the movement of the eyeballs, eyelids and the head from a physiological perspective and how these movements can be modelled, rendered and animated in computer graphics applications. Furthermore, we present recent research from psychology and sociology that seeks to understand higher level behaviours, such as attention and eye gaze, during the expression of emotion or during conversation. We discuss how these findings are synthesized in computer graphics and can be utilized in the domains of Human–Robot Interaction and Human–Computer Interaction for allowing humans to interact with virtual agents and other artificial entities. We conclude with a summary of guidelines for animating the eye and head from the perspective of a character animator.","[{'authorId': '38592832', 'name': 'K.

f20f2645fca8d2e251ce17924e746b09a0db6fb4,"Therapists, psychologists, family counselors and coaches in youth care show a clear need for social technology support, e.g. for education, motivation and guidance of the children. For example, the Dutch Child and Family Center explores the possibilities of social robot assistance in their regular care pathways. This robot should address the affective processes in the communication appropriately. Whereas there is an enormous amount of emotion research in human-robot interaction, there is not yet a proven set of models and methods that can be put into this practice directly. Our research aims at a model for robot's emotional recognition and expression that is effective in the Dutch youth care. Consequently, it has to take account of personal differences (e.g., child's developmental phase and mental problems) and the context (e.g., family circumstances and therapy approach). Our study distinguishes different phases that may partially run in parallel. First, possible solutions for affective computing by social robots are identified to set the general design space and understand the constraints. Second, in an exploration phase, focus group sessions are conducted to identify core features of emotional expressions that the robot should or could process, including the context-dependencies. Third, in the testing phase, via scenario-based design and child-robot interaction experiments a practical model of affect processing by a social robot in youth care is derived. This short paper provides an overview of the general approach of this research and some preliminary results of the design space and focus group.","[{'authorId': '39542483', 'name': 'Anouk Neerincx'}, {'authorId': '2042283295', 'name': 'A.

In the present account, we propose a new linkage between mindfulness and improved emotion regulation—one that highlights the role played by executive control. Specifically, we suggest that the present-moment awareness and nonjudgmental acceptance that is cultivated by mindfulness training is crucial in promoting executive control because it increases sensitivity to affective cues in the experiential field. This refined attunement and openness to subtle changes in affective states fosters executive control because it improves response to incipient affective cues that help signal the need for control. This, in turn, enhances emotion regulation. In presenting our model, we discuss how new findings in executive control can improve our understanding of how mindfulness increases the capacity for effective emotion regulation.","[{'authorId': '4732534', 'name': 'Rimma Teper'}, {'authorId': '4726670', 'name': 'Z.

Brain imaging studies, in particular, have found a correlation between amygdala activation during encoding and subsequent memory. Because of the design of these studies, it is unknown whether this correlation is based on individual differences between participants or within-subject variations in moment-to-moment amygdala activation related to individual stimuli. In this study, participants saw neutral and negative scenes and indicated how emotionally intense they found each scene. Separate functional magnetic resonance imaging responses in the amygdala for each scene were related to the participants' report of their experience at study and to performance in an unexpected memory test 3 weeks after scanning. The amygdala had the greatest response to scenes rated as most emotionally intense. The degree of activity in the left amygdala during encoding was predictive of subsequent memory only for scenes rated as most emotionally intense. These findings support the view that amygdala activation reflects moment-to-moment subjective emotional experience and that this activation enhances memory in relation to the emotional intensity of an experience.","[{'authorId': '9082064', 'name': 'T.

In this work, we have focused on this skill in order to stimulate better learning. The proposal relies on stimulating the cognitive visual-motor skills of individuals with Down Syndrome (DS) using exercises with a gestural interaction platform based on the KINECT sensor named TANGO:H, the goal being to improve them. To validate the proposal, an experimental single-case study method was designed using two groups: a control group and an experimental one, with similar cognitive ages. Didactic exercises were provided to the experimental group using visual cognitive stimulation. These exercises were created on the TANGO:H Designer, a platform that was designed for gestural interaction using the KINECT sensor. As a result, TANGO:H allows for visual-motor cognitive stimulation through the movement of hands, arms, feet and head. The “Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities (ITPA)” was applied to both groups as a pre-test and post-test in its four reference sections: visual comprehension, visual-motor sequential memory, visual association, and visual integration. Two checks were made, one using the longitudinal comparison of the pre-test/post-test of the experimental group, and another that relied on comparing the difference of the means of the pre-test/post-test. We also used an observational methodology for the working sessions from the experimental group. Although the statistical results do not show significant differences between the two groups, the results of the observations exhibited an improvement in visual-motor cognitive skills.","[{'authorId': '1405338464', 'name': 'P.

To display either a positive or a negative mood, we modulated 41 co-verbal gestures by adjusting behavior parameters that control spatial extent and motion dynamics, without modifying gesture function. Unique in this study is that (a) the robot gave an actual lecture to real students, (b) the interaction is one-to-many and relatively long (30 min), and (c) mood modulation was applied to a large set of behaviors. The robot presented the same lecture either in a positive or a negative mood to two audiences (between subjects). Although statistical analysis does not show that participants consciously recognized the robot mood, the results do show that participants in the positive mood condition rated their own arousal significantly higher than in the negative condition. Further, video annotation showed increased valence and arousal of the audience in the positive condition. Finally, participants' ratings of the lecturing quality and the gesture quality of the robot are higher in the positive condition, demonstrating the importance of robot mood expression in a one-to-many interaction setting.","[{'authorId': '34859885', 'name': 'Junchao Xu'}, {'authorId': '1735303', 'name': 'J.

Here, a comparative/evolutionary anatomy framework is presented to motivate the idea that long-range, distributed circuits involving the midbrain, thalamus, and forebrain are central to emotional processing. It is proposed that emotion can be understood in terms of large-scale network interactions spanning the neuroaxis that form “functionally integrated systems.” At the broadest level, the argument is made that we need to move beyond a Newtonian view of causation to one involving complex systems where bidirectional influences and nonlinearities abound. Therefore, understanding interactions between subsystems and signal integration becomes central to unraveling the organization of the emotional brain.","[{'authorId': '145094838', 'name': 'L.

In this paper we chose to use a PAD Emotional Space [5] to simulate the emotional state of a NAO Robot (NAO is the name of a humanoid robot developed and commercialized by Aldebaran Robotics). But one difficulty is to write an algorithm that makes evolve the emotional state according to external and internal stimuli. Simulating a coherent Emotional State over the time is a real challenge for designing a virtual personality. As human emotions are fuzzy by nature, many researchers explored using Fuzzy State Machine [6], [7] or Fuzzy Logic [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] to control the emotions of a virtual character or robot. Following the same approach, in this paper we propose to use a Fuzzy Control System [13] to control the emotional state of a NAO robot by injecting attractors in his PAD Emotional Space. Fuzzy Control Systems are usually good controller of uncertainty and easy to write thanks to their syntax close to the human language. The result of our experiments showed that the evolution of the Emotional State of our NAO robot was smooth and coherent with the situation met when interacting with humans. Moreover with different set of rules it becomes easy to switch the personality of the robot (meaning the robot can react differently to the same stimuli according to the different set of rules used).","[{'authorId': '3400605', 'name': 'Alban Nanty'}, {'authorId': '2238119', 'name': 'R.

Hence promoting children's agency and social participation requires their self-expression to be facilitated in their interaction with adults. The analysis in this article of a set of interactions in Italian schools sheds light on how promotion of children's self-expression succeeded or failed through specific adult intervention and forms of communication. This analysis may be interesting for a reflection on how to promote children's participation and self-expression in education systems.,"[{'authorId': '91557304', 'name': 'Claudio Baraldi'}]",33.0,,46.0,Promoting Self-Expression in Classroom Interactions,2008.0

Tutored students scored in the 95th percentile, or two sigmas above the mean, on average, compared to students who received traditional classroom instruction. In human-robot interaction research, however, there is relatively little work exploring the potential benefits of personalizing a robot’s actions to an individual’s strengths and weaknesses. In this study, participants solved grid-based logic puzzles with the help of a personalized or non-personalized robot tutor.

Methods: The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children was used for psychiatric evaluations. Emotion recognition skills were evaluated using Faces Test and Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test. The Difficulties in Emotions Regulation Scale was used for evaluating skills of emotion regulation. Results: Children with obesity had lower scores on Faces Test and Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, and experienced greater difficulty in emotional regulation skills. Conclusions: Improved understanding of emotional recognition and emotion regulation in young people with obesity may improve their social adaptation and help in the treatment of their disorder.

f5fd33af7c5be2af49ca4b8172e25cde136069fc,"The authors present the design and implementation of an exploratory virtual learning environment that assists children with autism (ASD) in learning science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) skills along with improving social-emotional and communication skills. The primary contribution of this exploratory research is how educational research informs technological advances in triggering a virtual AI companion (AIC) for children in need of social-emotional and communication skills development. The AIC adapts to students’ varying levels of needed support. This project began by using puppetry control (human-in-the-loop) of the AIC, assisting students with ASD in learning basic coding, practicing their social skills with the AIC, and attaining emotional recognition and regulation skills for effective communication and learning. The student is given the challenge to program a robot, Dash™, to move in a square. Based on observed behaviors, the puppeteer controls the virtual agent’s actions to support the student in coding the robot. The virtual agent’s actions that inform the development of the AIC include speech, facial expressions, gestures, respiration, and heart color changes coded to indicate emotional state. The paper provides exploratory findings of the first 2 years of this 5-year scaling-up research study. The outcomes discussed align with a common approach of research design used for students with disabilities, called single case study research. This type of design does not involve random control trial research; instead, the student acts as her or his own control subject. Students with ASD have substantial individual differences in their social skill deficits, behaviors, communications, and learning needs, which vary greatly from the norm and from other individuals identified with this disability. Therefore, findings are reported as changes within subjects instead of across subjects. While these exploratory observations serve as a basis for longer term research on a larger population, this paper focuses less on student learning and more on evolving technology in AIC and supporting students with ASD in STEM environments.","[{'authorId': '2056019735', 'name': 'Charles E.

One of the most important social skills that are affected by ASD is the ability to pay attention; ASD introduces unnecessary temporal delays in the attentional behavior of children toward external stimuli. This research focuses on identifying the effect of different social stimuli from robotic agents to assess the attentional behavior of children with ASD. Latencies in shifting attention and the number of attentions paid to a stimulus are defined as indexes of attentional behaviors for children with ASD. Nine children with ASD (seven males and two females, mean: 7.57 ± 2.57 years) that had minimal to no symptoms of autism participated in this study. Two robotic agents presented visual, speech, and motion social stimuli to the participants. Regarding social stimuli, a significant effect on the latency in shifting attention (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\chi ^{2}(2)=9.55$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\text {p} = 0.008$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) and the number of attentions paid (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\chi ^{2}(2)=9.56$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, p = 0.008) was observed in children with ASD. The speech stimulus captured the children’s attention faster than the visual and motion stimuli in terms of latency in shifting attention and the number of attentions paid. Moreover, significant positive correlations were found for some pairs of stimuli among visual, speech, and motion stimuli for latencies in shifting attention, as well as the number of attentions paid using Pearson’s correlation analysis. This study contributes to the literature in terms of the impact of robotic stimuli on the attentional behavior of children with ASD.","[{'authorId': '1443781694', 'name': 'Faisal Mehmood'}, {'authorId': '3401601', 'name': 'Hamed Mahzoon'}, {'authorId': '2836701', 'name': 'Y.

For instance, cognitive reappraisal (reframing an emotional situation) is generally an adaptive emotion-regulation strategy (i.e., it is associated with increased psychological health). However, a person-by-situation approach suggests that the adaptiveness of different emotion-regulation strategies depends on the context in which they are used. Specifically, reappraisal may be adaptive when stressors are uncontrollable (when the person can regulate only the self) but maladaptive when stressors can be controlled (when the person can change the situation). To test this prediction, we measured cognitive-reappraisal ability, the severity of recent life stressors, stressor controllability, and level of depression in 170 participants. For participants with uncontrollable stress, higher cognitive-reappraisal ability was associated with lower levels of depression. In contrast, for participants with controllable stress, higher cognitive-reappraisal ability was associated with greater levels of depression. These findings support a theoretical model in which particular emotion-regulation strategies are not adaptive or maladaptive per se; rather, their adaptiveness depends on the context.","[{'authorId': '4041983', 'name': 'Allison S.

We therefore investigated alexithymia and early life stress in a high alexithymic but healthy community sample (n 46) in comparison with low alexithymic healthy subjects (n 44).

There was a significantly positive correlation between alexithymia and early emotional neglect (EN) in the total sample (r .37; p .001), while physical or sexual traumata were not associated with high alexithymic features. EN also predicted the overall level of alexithymia. Within the high alexithymic group only, EN was related to significantly increased emotional dysfunction when controlling for alexithymia.

Indeed, child-robot interactions are increasingly being explored in domains which require longer-term interactions, such as healthcare and education. For a robot to behave in an appropriate manner over longer time scales, its behaviours have to be contingent and meaningful to the unfolding relationship. Recognising, interpreting and generating sustained and engaging social behaviours is as such an important—and essentially, open—research question. We believe that the recent progress of machine learning opens new opportunities in terms of both analysis and synthesis of complex social dynamics. To support these approaches, we introduce in this article a novel, open dataset of child social interactions, designed with data-driven research methodologies in mind. Our data acquisition methodology relies on an engaging, methodologically sound, but purposefully underspecified free-play interaction. By doing so, we capture a rich set of behavioural patterns occurring in natural social interactions between children. The resulting dataset, called the PInSoRo dataset, comprises 45+ hours of hand-coded recordings of social interactions between 45 child-child pairs and 30 child-robot pairs. In addition to annotations of social constructs, the dataset includes fully calibrated video recordings, 3D recordings of the faces, skeletal informations, full audio recordings, as well as game interactions.","[{'authorId': '2497939', 'name': 'Séverin Lemaignan'}, {'authorId': '144665503', 'name': 'C.

Although the relative role of cognitive versus physiological processes in emotion has been debated, it is acknowledged that in almost all cases, measurable physiological changes co-occur with emotion, for example: changes in heart rate, sweat level, muscle tension, breathing rate, facial expression and electrical activity in the brain. By sensing these changes we can hope to build computer systems that can automatically recognize emotion by recognizing patterns in these sensor signals that capture physiological responses. This chapter will give a detailed introduction to measuring physiological signals that reflect affect (emotion) with a focus on measuring cardiac activity and skin conductance. The discussion will include why these signals are important for measuring emotional activity, how they are most commonly measured, which features are most often extracted for use in recognition algorithms and the trade-offs between signal quality and wearability and convenience for different sensing systems.","[{'authorId': '144139962', 'name': 'Jennifer Healey'}]",28.0,,58.0,Physiological Sensing of Emotion,2015.0

It was hypothesised that student mathematics achievement would be contingent on the combined effects of teacher and student control: it would be highest when both teacher and student control is high, and would be lowest when both of them are low. Student adoption of self-regulated learning strategies would be linked to the net effect of student control: they would be highest when student control is high and teacher control is low, and would be lowest when teacher control is high and student control is low. The data tended to support these hypotheses, indicating that both achievement and self-regulation strategies were contingent on classroom processes.","[{'authorId': '35207456', 'name': 'Y.

with entry into nursing education programs and continues with the completion of nursing 
education and entry into the work environment. In order to improve this process, its reinforcing 
factors must be identified. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the relationship 
between emotional intelligence and professional socialization of nursing students of Tabriz 
University of Medical Sciences, Iran. 
Methods: In this correlational study, after calculating the sample size, all nursing students of 
Tabriz University of Medical Sciences in their 6 
th, 7th 
, and 8th semesters were studied. Data 
collection tools consisted of demographic characteristics questionnaire, Toit’s Professional 
Socialization Scale, and Shiring/Siberia Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire. All data were 
analyzed using SPSS software and descriptive and analytical statistics. 
Results: The professional socialization and emotional intelligence of nursing students was above 
average level. Total emotional intelligence and its subscales had no significant correlation with 
students’ professional socialization score. However, professional socialization had significant 
correlation with gender, grade point average of previous semesters, and hope for future career. 
Conclusion: It seems that the professional socialization of nursing students is impacted by 
learning in cognitive and psychomotor domains more than by their emotional intelligence. 
However, considering the importance of the emotional domain in comprehensive and humane 
care, emotional intelligence skills training seems necessary for students.

Whereas the experience felt is real, the mediated encounter or message often is fabricated, just fiction, and involves artificial non-existent characters. An intriguing question is thus ‘why does media use feel so real and how are emotions induced by processing media?’ The current entry aims to answer that question by outlining the neuropsychological underpinnings of emotional responsiveness to media. We discuss how emotions and emotion regulation are processed in the brain and exemplify neuropsychological models. Key is the fast processing of feelings and emotions, mostly operated in subcortical-limbic brain regions, relative to slower and more reflective processing through the prefrontal cortex, which dynamically interact as one system. Then, we outline the neural underpinnings of the rewarding and disturbing effects of (social) media use. Finally, we show how the parallel processing of emotions in neuropsychological models may explain the oftenfound emotion-bias in media use. In all, this entry aims to provide insights in the psychology behind media use and open new perspectives for relevant media psychological research.","[{'authorId': '3132010', 'name': 'E.

The objective of this Presidential Address is to review what is known circa the year 2000 of the processes and mechanisms of visceral sensory psychobiology, often called interoception. Methods Over 1000 publications that have appeared since the 19th century were reviewed to prepare this review, including a group that are specifically cited here. Results Factors and data were reviewed that were identified as germane to understanding interoception. These included definitional issues, historical roots, the neural basis, studies and results in the cardiovascular-respiratory and alimentary-gastrointestinal systems, studies of emotion, and studies in people with mental disorders. Drug and hormone effects, pain, proprioception, and phantom limb or organ factors, and the role of awareness were briefly described.

Most of the recent deep learning solutions for facial expression recognition under-perform when deployed in Human-Robot-Interaction scenarios, although they are capable of breaking records on the most varied benchmarks on facial expression recognition. The main reason for that we believe is that they are using techniques that are developed for recognition of static pictures, while in real-life scenarios, we infer emotions from intervals of expression. Utilising on the feature of CNN to form regions of interests that are similar to human gaze patterns, we use recordings from human-gaze patterns to train such a network to infer facial emotions from 3 seconds video footage of humans expressing 6 basic emotions.","[{'authorId': '1562122009', 'name': 'Anne C.

The sample was composed of 424 non-clinical children from 3 to 6 years of age (60% male). Use of a structural equation model revealed effortful control-mediated relations between reactive temperament traits and behavioural problems. Nevertheless, uniquely and directly, negative affect predicted externalizing problems and extraversion predicted internalizing problems. Assessment of invariance by children’s sex showed that the mediating role of effortful control tends to be stronger for externalizing problems in boys than in girls. Results showed no significant age differences. According to these results, effortful control as a method of self-regulation seems to be an essential process through which reactive temperament traits affect a child’s psychological adjustment.","[{'authorId': '145124056', 'name': 'M.

Subjects were 55 psychiatric outpatients and 11 normal controls (aged 7 through 17 years). Both parents and children were used as informants. Concurrent validity of the screen criteria and the K-SADS-PL diagnoses was assessed against standard self-report scales. Interrater (n = 15) and test-retest (n = 20) reliability data were also collected (mean retest interval: 18 days; range: 2 to 36 days).


RESULTS
Rating scale data support the concurrent validity of screens and K-SADS-PL diagnoses. Interrater agreement in scoring screens and diagnoses was high (range: 93% to 100%). Test-retest reliability kappa coefficients were in the excellent range for present and/or lifetime diagnoses of major depression, any bipolar, generalized anxiety, conduct, and oppositional defiant disorder (.77 to 1.00) and in the good range for present diagnoses of posttraumatic stress disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (.63 to .67).


CONCLUSION
Results suggest the K-SADS-PL generates reliable and valid child psychiatric diagnoses.","[{'authorId': '49117973', 'name': 'J. Kaufman'}, {'authorId': '5141715', 'name': 'B.

Moreover, no tests are currently available that allow clinicians and researchers to examine cognitive and affective theory of mind (ToM) and understanding of social norms within the same test. To address these limitations, we present the Edinburgh Social Cognition Test (ESCoT) which assesses cognitive and affective ToM and inter- and intrapersonal understanding of social norms. We examined the effects of age, measures of intelligence and the Broader Autism Phenotype (BAP) on the ESCoT and established tests of social cognition. Additionally, we investigated the convergent validity of the ESCoT based on traditional social cognition measures. The ESCoT was administered alongside Reading the Mind in Films (RMF), Reading the Mind in Eyes (RME), Judgement of Preference and Social Norm Questionnaire to 91 participants (30 aged 18–35 years, 30 aged 45–60 years and 31 aged 65–85 years). Poorer performance on the cognitive and affective ToM ESCoT subtests were predicted by increasing age. The affective ToM ESCoT subtest and RMF were predicted by gender, where being female predicted better performance. Unlike the ESCoT, better performance on the RMF was predicted by higher verbal comprehension and perceptual reasoning abilities, while better performance on the RME was predicted by higher verbal comprehension scores. Lower scores on inter-and intrapersonal understanding of social norms were both predicted by the presence of more autism-like traits while poorer interpersonal understanding of social norms performance was predicted by increasing age. These findings show that the ESCoT is a useful measure of social cognition and, unlike established tests of social cognition, performance is not predicted by measures of verbal comprehension and perceptual reasoning. This is particularly valuable to obtain an accurate assessment of the influence of age on our social cognitive abilities.","[{'authorId': '144055498', 'name': 'R. A.

fae19c24b82ca7a5437b8c60596363f4f8cf34cd,"It is well established that emotional responses to stimuli presented to one perceptive modality (e.g., visual) are modulated by the concurrent presentation of affective information to another modality (e.g., auditory)—an effect known as the cross-modal bias. However, the affective mechanisms mediating this effect are still not fully understood. It remains unclear what role different dimensions of stimulus valence and arousal play in mediating the effect, and to what extent cross-modal influences impact not only our perception and conscious affective experiences, but also our psychophysiological emotional response. We addressed these issues by measuring participants’ subjective emotion ratings and their Galvanic Skin Responses (GSR) in a cross-modal affect perception paradigm employing videos of ballet dance movements and instrumental classical music as the stimuli. We chose these stimuli to explore the cross-modal bias in a context of stimuli (ballet dance movements) that most participants would have relatively little prior experience with. Results showed (i) that the cross-modal bias was more pronounced for sad than for happy movements, whereas it was equivalent when contrasting high vs. low arousal movements; and (ii) that movement valence did not modulate participants’ GSR, while movement arousal did, such that GSR was potentiated in the case of low arousal movements with sad music and when high arousal movements were paired with happy music. Results are discussed in the context of the affective dimension of neuroentrainment and with regards to implications for the art community.","[{'authorId': '35072671', 'name': 'J.

The essay has three parts. In the first, I review two influential theories from the Philosophy of Science to help reflect on the nature of design theory, concluding that research through design is likely to produce theories that are provisional, contingent, and aspirational. In the second part, I discuss three possible interpretations for the diversity of approaches to research through design, and suggest that this variation need not be seen as a sign of inadequate standards or a lack of cumulative progress in the field, but may be natural for a generative endeavour. In the final section, I suggest that, rather than aiming to develop increasingly comprehensive theories of design, practice based research might better view theory as annotation of realised design examples, and particularly portfolios of related pieces. Overall, I suggest that the design research community should be wary of impulses towards convergence and standardisation, and instead take pride in its aptitude for exploring and speculating, particularising and diversifying, and - especially - its ability to manifest the results in the form of new, conceptually rich artefacts.","[{'authorId': '2487205', 'name': 'William W.

fb0daef399a813dfeee339d7b9a688ef8c91f39a,"ABSTRACT The social origins and functions of emotion norms are examined. Emotion norms both reflect and sustain the social structures in which they develop. Individuals undergo emotional socialization and are subject to pressures to conform, especially adults in service and professional jobs, who actively manage reactions that violate social expectations. Efforts at emotional conformity help to sustain the social order, maintain hierarchy, and build solidarity. Emotional deviants are usually stigmatized and subjected to social control, but under some conditions they can become agents of social change. An experiment by Dutton and Aron (1974) is often used in psychology textbooks to illustrate the role of cognition in emotional experience. The study was intended to demonstrate that physiological arousal can be misattributed to the wrong cause. Men who were approached by an attractive experimenter after crossing a suspension bridge over a deep gorge were more likely to indicate romantic or sexual interest in the experimenter, in contrast to men who had crossed a low wooden bridge over a stream. Dutton and Aron concluded, consistent with Schachter's two-factor theory of emotion (Schachter & Singer, 1962), that emotions are in part determined by available cognitive cues, not by physiological reactions alone.","[{'authorId': '6079863', 'name': 'P.

The adolescent years are characteristic of changes in body composition (location and quantity of body fat), physical fitness and decreased insulin sensitivity during puberty. This period of growth and maturation is also marked with behavioural changes in diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviour and psychological health. Physical activity and sport participation decline during adolescence especially in teenage girls, while sedentary behaviour, risk for depression and body esteem issues increase during the teenage years. These physiological and behavioural changes during adolescence warrant the attention of health practitioners to prevent the onset and continuation of obesity throughout the lifespan.","[{'authorId': '4484716', 'name': 'A.

The last decades have seen a growing interest in the automatic detection of such states from voice, facial expression, and physiological signals, primarily with the goal of enhancing human-computer interaction with an affective component. With the advent of brain-computer interface research, the idea of affective brain-computer interfaces (aBCI), enabling affect detection from brain signals, arose. In this article, we set out to survey the field of neurophysiology-based affect detection. We outline possible applications of aBCI in a general taxonomy of brain-computer interface approaches and introduce the core concepts of affect and their neurophysiological fundamentals. We show that there is a growing body of literature that evidences the capabilities, but also the limitations and challenges of affect detection from neurophysiological activity.","[{'authorId': '1753164', 'name': 'C.

This Report then reviews a recent and persuasive body of rigorous research, to determine whether children’s emotional adjustment can be significantly affected by interventions implemented in the preschool and early school years. Results of this review suggest that family early educational, and clinical interventions offer policy makers a wide array of choices in ways that they can make sound investments in young children’s emotional development and school readiness. This research suggests that, while young children’s emotional and behavioral problems are costly to their chances of school success, these problems are identifiable early, are amenable to change, and can be reduced over time. What kinds of investments should policy makers be advised to make, at what point in young children’s development, and in what settings? While modest investments in low-cost interventions initially may seem appealing, this report suggests that there are few bargains to be had when investing in young children’s emotional adjustment. With this caveat in mind, the findings of this report suggest that policy makers should broaden early elementary educational mandates for school readiness to include children’s emotional and behavioral adjustments as key programmatic goals. Policy makers should consider targeting young children’s emotional adjustment prior to school entry, in diverse settings such as Head Start, child care settings, as well as in the first few years of school. Finally, young children’s emotional adjustment can serve as an important benchmark of programmatic success in other policy arenas focusing on child welfare, family support, and economic self-sufficiency, as well as in education.","[{'authorId': '5169917', 'name': 'C.

Humanoid and androids, which have various modalities, can communicate with humans as new information media. In this talk, we argue how to develop the interactive robots and how to evaluate them as introducing several robots developed in ATR Intelligent Robotics and Communications Laboratories and Department of Adaptive Machine Systems, Osaka University. Especially, we focus on a constructive approach to developing the interactive robots, cognitive studies using the humanoids and androids for evaluating the interactions, and long-term field experiments in an elementary school.The talk consists of two parts. There are two relationships between robots and humans: one is inter-personal and the other is social. In the inter-personal relationships, the appearance of the robot is a new and important research issues. In the social relationships, a function to recognize human relationships through interactions is needed for robots of the next generation. These two issues explore new possibilities of robots.In these issues, the appearance problem bridges between science and engineering. In the development of humanoids, both the appearance and behavior of the robots are significant issues. However, designing the robot's appearance, especially to give it a humanoid one, was always a role of the industrial designer. To tackle the problem of appearance and behavior, two approaches are necessary: one from robotics and the other from cognitive science. The approach from robotics tries to build very humanlike robots based on knowledge from cognitive science.

Involving patients in the development of the hospital environment can be a way to create more responsive services. To date, few studies have involved the direct voice of patients with dementia about their experiences of the hospital environment. Design and method Using an action research approach, we worked with patients with dementia and a team of interdisciplinary staff on a medical unit to improve dementia care. The insights provided by patients with dementia in the early phase shaped actions undertaken at the later stage to develop person‐centred care within a medical ward. We used methods including go‐along interviews, video recording and participant observation to enable rich data generation. Aim This study explores the perspectives of patients with dementia about the hospital environment. Results The participants indicated that a supportive hospital environment would need to be a place of enabling independence, a place of safety, a place of supporting social interactions and a place of respect. Conclusions Patient participants persuasively articulated the supportive and unsupportive elements in the environment that affected their well‐being and care experiences. They provided useful insights and pointed out practical solutions for improvement. Action research offers patients not only opportunities to voice their opinion, but also possibilities to contribute to hospital service development.

Pikul et al. used fixed-length fiber mesh embedded in a silicone elastomer to transform a flat object into a 3D structure by inflating membranes (see the Perspective by Laschi). Painted models of rocks and plants were also created that could be morphed to fully blend into their surroundings. Science, this issue p. 210; see also p. 169 Pneumatically altering 2D surfaces into complex hierarchical 3D shapes camouflages them in their background environments. Technologies that use stretchable materials are increasingly important, yet we are unable to control how they stretch with much more sophistication than inflating balloons. Nature, however, demonstrates remarkable control of stretchable surfaces; for example, cephalopods can project hierarchical structures from their skin in milliseconds for a wide range of textural camouflage. Inspired by cephalopod muscular morphology, we developed synthetic tissue groupings that allowed programmable transformation of two-dimensional (2D) stretchable surfaces into target 3D shapes.

fc1c1c3e263449ae5b3ed807160af0fd225e792f,"Recognizing cross-subject emotions based on brain imaging data, e.g., EEG, has always been difficult due to the poor generalizability of features across subjects. Thus, systematically exploring the ability of different EEG features to identify emotional information across subjects is crucial. Prior related work has explored this question based only on one or two kinds of features, and different findings and conclusions have been presented. In this work, we aim at a more comprehensive investigation on this question with a wider range of feature types, including 18 kinds of linear and non-linear EEG features. The effectiveness of these features was examined on two publicly accessible datasets, namely, the dataset for emotion analysis using physiological signals (DEAP) and the SJTU emotion EEG dataset (SEED). We adopted the support vector machine (SVM) approach and the “leave-one-subject-out” verification strategy to evaluate recognition performance. Using automatic feature selection methods, the highest mean recognition accuracy of 59.06% (AUC = 0.605) on the DEAP dataset and of 83.33% (AUC = 0.904) on the SEED dataset were reached. Furthermore, using manually operated feature selection on the SEED dataset, we explored the importance of different EEG features in cross-subject emotion recognition from multiple perspectives, including different channels, brain regions, rhythms, and feature types. For example, we found that the Hjorth parameter of mobility in the beta rhythm achieved the best mean recognition accuracy compared to the other features. Through a pilot correlation analysis, we further examined the highly correlated features, for a better understanding of the implications hidden in those features that allow for differentiating cross-subject emotions. Various remarkable observations have been made. The results of this paper validate the possibility of exploring robust EEG features in cross-subject emotion recognition.","[{'authorId': '2144439454', 'name': 'Xiang Li'}, {'authorId': '48437245', 'name': 'D.

Although how these mechanisms select for cooperation has been explored extensively, their potential to select simultaneously for complex cheating strategies has been largely overlooked. Tactical deception, the misrepresentation of the state of the world to another individual, may allow cheaters to exploit conditional cooperation by tactically misrepresenting their past actions and/or current intentions. Here we first use a simple game-theoretic model to show that the evolution of cooperation can create selection pressures favouring the evolution of tactical deception. This effect is driven by deception weakening cheater detection in conditional cooperators, allowing tactical deceivers to elicit cooperation at lower costs, while simple cheats are recognized and discriminated against. We then provide support for our theoretical predictions using a comparative analysis of deception across primate species. Our results suggest that the evolution of conditional strategies may, in addition to promoting cooperation, select for astute cheating and associated psychological abilities. Ultimately, our ability to convincingly lie to each other may have evolved as a direct result of our cooperative nature.","[{'authorId': '2665733', 'name': 'L.

fcd377802681d9e70296eba90d520e170f2d3a0b,"Background Research in embodied artificial intelligence (AI) has increasing clinical relevance for therapeutic applications in mental health services. With innovations ranging from ‘virtual psychotherapists’ to social robots in dementia care and autism disorder, to robots for sexual disorders, artificially intelligent virtual and robotic agents are increasingly taking on high-level therapeutic interventions that used to be offered exclusively by highly trained, skilled health professionals. In order to enable responsible clinical implementation, ethical and social implications of the increasing use of embodied AI in mental health need to be identified and addressed. Objective This paper assesses the ethical and social implications of translating embodied AI applications into mental health care across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology and Psychotherapy. Building on this analysis, it develops a set of preliminary recommendations on how to address ethical and social challenges in current and future applications of embodied AI. Methods Based on a thematic literature search and established principles of medical ethics, an analysis of the ethical and social aspects of currently embodied AI applications was conducted across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, the analysis was structured around the following three steps: assessment of potential benefits; analysis of overarching ethical issues and concerns; discussion of specific ethical and social issues of the interventions. Results From an ethical perspective, important benefits of embodied AI applications in mental health include new modes of treatment, opportunities to engage hard-to-reach populations, better patient response, and freeing up time for physicians. Overarching ethical issues and concerns include: harm prevention and various questions of data ethics; a lack of guidance on development of AI applications, their clinical integration and training of health professionals; ‘gaps’ in ethical and regulatory frameworks; the potential for misuse including using the technologies to replace established services, thereby potentially exacerbating existing health inequalities. Specific challenges identified and discussed in the application of embodied AI include: matters of risk-assessment, referrals, and supervision; the need to respect and protect patient autonomy; the role of non-human therapy; transparency in the use of algorithms; and specific concerns regarding long-term effects of these applications on understandings of illness and the human condition. Conclusions We argue that embodied AI is a promising approach across the field of mental health; however, further research is needed to address the broader ethical and societal concerns of these technologies to negotiate best research and medical practices in innovative mental health care. We conclude by indicating areas of future research and developing recommendations for high-priority areas in need of concrete ethical guidance.","[{'authorId': '46217950', 'name': 'A.

fd507903ed5fc0b5e03862a1edd4eabf260f8aa4,"Background Emotion regulation is a key transdiagnostic risk factor for a range of psychopathologies, making it a prime target for both prevention and treatment interventions in childhood. Existing interventions predominantly rely on workshops or in-person therapy-based approaches, limiting the ability to promote emotion regulation competence for children in everyday settings and at scale. Purrble is a newly developed, inexpensive, socially assistive robot—in the form of an interactive plush toy—that uses haptic feedback to support in-the-moment emotion regulation. It is accessible to children as needed in their daily lives, without the need for a priori training. Although qualitative data from previous studies show high engagement in situ and anecdotal evidence of the robot being incorporated into children’s emotion regulation routines, there is no quantitative evidence of the intervention’s impact on child outcomes. Objective The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of a new intervention model for child-led emotion regulation—Purrble—that can be deployed across prevention and treatment contexts. Methods Overall, 134 children aged 8 to 10 years will be selected from an enriched nonclinical North American population; for inclusion, the cutoff for the parents’ rating of child dysregulation will be ≥10 points in the total difficulties score on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. This cutoff was selected to obtain a measurable, but not necessarily clinical, level of the child’s emotion regulatory difficulties. The selected families will be randomly assigned with .5 probability to receive either a Purrble or an active control (noninteractive plush toy). The primary outcome will be a daily ecological momentary assessment measure of child emotion regulation capability (as reported by parents) over a period of 4 weeks. Exploratory analyses will investigate the intervention impact on secondary outcomes of child emotion regulation, collected weekly over the same 4-week period, with follow-ups at 1 month and 6 months postdeployment. Quantitative data will be analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. A proportion of families (approximately 30% of the sample) will be interviewed after deployment as part of the process analysis. Results The study is funded by the UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship (MR/T041897/1) and an in-kind contribution from the Committee for Children. This study received ethical approval from the Pearl institutional review board (#18-CFC-101). Participant recruitment started in February 2021, with the 1-month deployment in April-May 2021. The results of this analysis will be published in 2022. Conclusions This study will be the first quantitative evaluation of the efficacy of an innovative, proof-of-concept intervention model for an in situ, child-led emotion regulation intervention. Insights into the trajectory of daily changes, complemented with weekly questionnaire batteries and postdeployment interviews, will result in an in-depth understanding of whether and how the hypothesized intervention logic model works, leading to further intervention optimization.

fdf1c67b0c967be5777220fda42aa8355f03e2f3,"In this paper we specify and validate three interaction design patterns for an interactive storytelling experience with an autonomous social robot. The patterns enable the child to make decisions about the story by talking with the robot, reenact parts of the story together with the robot, and recording self-made sound effects. The design patterns successfully support children’s engagement and agency. A user study $(\mathrm{N}=27$, 8-10 y.o.) showed that children paid more attention to the robot, enjoyed the storytelling experience more, and could recall more about the story, when the design patterns were employed by the robot during storytelling. All three aspects are important features of engagement. Children felt more autonomous during storytelling with the design patterns and highly appreciated that the design patterns allowed them to express themselves more freely. Both aspects are important features of children’s agency. Important lessons we have learned are that reducing points of confusion and giving the children more time to make themselves heard by the robot will improve the patterns efficiency to support engagement and agency. Allowing children to pick and choose from a diverse set of stories and interaction settings would make the storytelling experience more inclusive for a broader range of children.

fdf33bc28bc2203a470092e2565d8f618af91228,"""Potential space"" refers to the psychoanalyst D. W. Winnicott's description of the psychological ""place"" people inhabit when involved with works of art. The abstract qualities Winnicott ascribes to potential space were corroborated by the answers of a group of student readers to a questionnaire on their physical and mental experiences when reading short stories. Potential space thus can illuminate literary space, or the relationship readers form with literary texts. Winnicott's concept is placed in the context of speculations by literary critics on the ways people become absorbed in literature, including theories of Norman Holland, Louise Rosenblatt, and Murray Schwartz. Finally, the concept of potential space gives teachers and students new metaphors to understand responses to literature, and may require us to seriously re-evaluate classroom practices and goals. ""For heaven's sake, go away and stay out of her life, you bastard!"" Who said this? Was it: (1) the angry third party in a triangular love affair admonishing the extra boyfriend to get lost; (2) a protective mother to her daughter's abusive husband; or (3) a moviegoer at a showing of the film ""New York, New York,"" shouting at Robert DeNiro's character, out of concern for Liza Minelli's character? It was number three. When my fellow-watcher irately spoke out, I had to laugh. Her verbal outburst exactly matched my own hostile feelings toward DeNiro's character. Yet my own distinction between the actor's character as a fiction and the on-screen character as a ""real"" person had not blurred to the point where I reacted as though he were physically present. The blurring, however, had almost gone that far, which provoked my amusement. At least since Aristotle developed his theory of catharsis to explain the pity and fear aroused in the viewer of tragedy, people have been bemused by and challenged to explain our emotionally intense reactions to plays, novels, poems, and other art forms. I will briefly summarize a line of commentary by literary critics that runs from Dr. Johnson to Coleridge and to contemporary psychoanalytic and transactive critics. Finally, I discuss the concept of ""potential space"" as some critics use it to describe the state of mind in which a reader blurs the distinction between reality and art.

fe127afdd8e431a4974619df828b2fa070213601,"Background: Loss of insight is a core diagnostic criterion for frontotemporal dementia (FTD), whereas failure to recognise cognitive deficits and unawareness of disease (anosognosia) are well established findings in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, self awareness of personality has not been quantified in these patient groups. Methods: Twenty two patients (12 with frontal variant FTD; 10 with early AD) and 11 older adult normal controls completed self report questionnaires (the Interpersonal Adjectives Scales) describing their current personality. First degree relative informants completed two questionnaires, one describing the subject’s current personality, the other retrospectively describing the subject’s personality before disease onset. Differences between subject and informant reports of current personality were used to measure the accuracy of self awareness. Results: Discriminant function analysis showed significant differences in self awareness among the three groups, with those in the FTD group showing the greatest magnitude of error in the largest number of personality dimensions (dominance, submissiveness, cold heartedness, introversion, and ingenuousness). Despite personality changes over time, patients with AD showed accurate self awareness in all personality dimensions except submissiveness and extraversion. Normal controls showed a pattern of underestimating positive qualities, whereas patients with FTD exaggerated positive qualities and minimised negative qualities. For the personality facets showing impaired insight, the self reports of patients with FTD and AD most closely matched their premorbid personalities, suggesting a failure to update their self image after disease onset. Conclusions: This study operationalises research criteria for loss of insight in FTD.","[{'authorId': '2920066', 'name': 'K. Rankin'}, {'authorId': '117704444', 'name': 'E.

Building on studies suggesting that the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (rVLPFC) is associated with regulation of negative emotions, the present experiment tests the hypothesis that decreasing the cortical excitability of the rVLPFC may increase negative emotional reactions to social exclusion. Specifically, we applied cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the rVLPFC and predicted an increment of negative emotional reactions to social exclusion. In Study 1, participants were either socially excluded or included, while cathodal tDCS or sham stimulation was applied over the rVLPFC. Cathodal stimulation of rVLPFC boosted the typical negative emotional reaction caused by social exclusion. No effects emerged from participants in the inclusion condition. To test the specificity of tDCS effects over rVLPFC, in Study 2, participants were socially excluded and received cathodal tDCS or sham stimulation over a control region (i.e., the right posterior parietal cortex). No effects of tDCS stimulation were found. Our results showed that the rVLPFC is specifically involved in emotion regulation and suggest that cathodal stimulation can increase negative emotional responses to social exclusion.","[{'authorId': '37814606', 'name': 'P.

They completed self-report measures assessing binge behaviors and Emotion Regulation strategies. No differences resulted between adolescents assuming binge behaviors and no bingers as regards CR; conversely, adolescents engaging in binge eating and in both binge behaviors reported the highest levels of ES. Furthermore, both Emotion Regulation strategies were significant predictors of binge eating. The present study suggested that binge behaviors were strongly associated with adolescent’s ability to evaluate and manage their emotions, so that adolescents may benefit from more precise and specific prevention and treatment approaches focused on training to use more adaptive and effective strategies to regulate their emotions.","[{'authorId': '2662040', 'name': 'F.

This paper presents a socio-cognitive engineering (SCE) methodology that guides the ongoing research & development for an evolving, longer-lasting human-robot partnership in practice. The SCE methodology has been applied in a large European project to develop a robotic partner that supports the daily diabetes management processes of children, aged between 7 and 14 years (i.e., Personal Assistant for a healthy Lifestyle, PAL). Four partnership functions were identified and worked out (joint objectives, agreements, experience sharing, and feedback & explanation) together with a common knowledge-base and interaction design for child's prolonged disease self-management. In an iterative refinement process of three cycles, these functions, knowledge base and interactions were built, integrated, tested, refined, and extended so that the PAL robot could more and more act as an effective partner for diabetes management. The SCE methodology helped to integrate into the human-agent/robot system: (a) theories, models, and methods from different scientific disciplines, (b) technologies from different fields, (c) varying diabetes management practices, and (d) last but not least, the diverse individual and context-dependent needs of the patients and caregivers. The resulting robotic partner proved to support the children on the three basic needs of the Self-Determination Theory: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. This paper presents the R&D methodology and the human-robot partnership framework for prolonged “blended” care of children with a chronic disease (children could use it up to 6 months; the robot in the hospitals and diabetes camps, and its avatar at home). It represents a new type of human-agent/robot systems with an evolving collective intelligence. The underlying ontology and design rationale can be used as foundation for further developments of long-duration human-robot partnerships “in the wild.”","[{'authorId': '1784286', 'name': 'Mark Antonius Neerincx'}, {'authorId': '3459095', 'name': 'W.

Results from the revised theoretical framework revealed that all three psychological conditions exhibited signie cant positive relations with engagement. Meaningfulness displayed the strongest relation. Job enrichment and work role e t were positively linked to psychological meaningfulness. Rewarding co-worker and supportive supervisor relations were positively associated with psychological safety, whereas adherence to co-worker norms and self-consciousness were negatively associated. Psychological availability was positively related to resources available and negatively related to participation in outside activities. Finally, the relations of job enrichment and work role e t with engagement were both fully mediated by the psychological condition of meaningfulness. The association between adherence to co-worker norms and engagement was partially mediated by psychological safety.

It was previously evidenced to onset before formal schooling at the kindergarten age (Gilmore et al., 2007) and was assumed to map onto pre-existing nonsymbolic (i.e., abstract magnitudes) representations. With a longitudinal study (Experiment 1), we show, for the first time, that nonsymbolic and symbolic arithmetic demonstrate different developmental trajectories. In contrast to Gilmore et al.’s (2007) findings, Experiment 1 showed that symbolic arithmetic onsets in grade 1, with the start of formal schooling, not earlier. Gilmore et al. (2007) had examined English-speaking children, whereas we assessed a large Dutch-speaking sample. The Dutch language for numbers can be cognitively more demanding, for example, due to the inversion property in numbers above 20. Thus, for instance, the number 48 is named in Dutch “achtenveertig” (eight and forty) instead of “forty eight.” To examine the effect of the language of numbers, we conducted a cross-cultural study with English- and Dutch-speaking children that had similar SES and math achievement skills (Experiment 2). Results demonstrated that Dutch-speaking kindergarteners lagged behind English-speaking children in symbolic arithmetic, not nonsymbolic and demonstrated a working memory overload in symbolic arithmetic, not nonsymbolic. Also, we show for the first time that the ability to name two-digit numbers highly correlates with symbolic approximate arithmetic not nonsymbolic. Our experiments empirically demonstrate that the symbolic number system is modulated more by development and education than the nonsymbolic system. Also, in contrast to the nonsymbolic system, the symbolic system is modulated by language.","[{'authorId': '1398183917', 'name': 'Iro Xenidou-Dervou'}, {'authorId': '40661140', 'name': 'C.

Although these robots are highly successful in their respective niches, a lack of planning capabilities limits the range of tasks for which currently deployed robots can be used. In this article, we highlight key conclusions from a workshop sponsored by the National Science Foundation in October 2013 that summarize opportunities and key challenges in robot planning and include challenge problems identified in the workshop that can help guide future research towards making robot planning more deployable in the real world.","[{'authorId': '1682091', 'name': 'R.

ff73ad05e0e9e2aab3cc37335eae24a0cd21032e,"Objectives: To characterize the cost of caring for an outpatient in Canada with Alzheimer disease (AD) based on disease severity, and to describe how costs change with increases in disease severity. Method: Community-dwelling patients with mild-to-moderate AD were enrolled in a 3-year, naturalistic, observational study. Assessments included cognition (Mini Mental Status Examination), global ratings (Global Deterioration Scale [GDS]), and daily function (Functional Autonomy Measurement System) as part of the Canadian Outcomes Study in Dementia. Direct (medical and nonmedical) and indirect costs were collected using resource use questionnaires. Costs at baseline were compared with costs at follow-up and correlated with disease severity. Results: Total costs associated with treating AD were significantly higher with greater disease severity. The mean total cost to treat patients with very mild AD (GDS = 2) was $367 per month, compared with $4063 per month for patients with severe or very severe AD (GDS = 6). From baseline to follow-up, the greatest changes in cost were observed in the group of patients with the most severe AD as measured by all scales. The largest component of total cost was indirect costs at most severity levels, though medication costs contributed the most in patients with very mild AD. Significant independent contributors to cost were being female, having more impaired activities of daily living, and exhibiting more neuropsychiatric symptoms. Conclusions: Costs for treating a patient with AD were strongly associated with disease severity, even though none of the patients were institutionalized. Delaying the progression of AD may reduce indirect costs and burden to caregivers.","[{'authorId': '144528209', 'name': 'N. Herrmann'}, {'authorId': '2530895', 'name': 'D.

ff825a46f0a4e9f6ad748aeefd18f34f6b4addfb,"Abstract Background: Individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) have difficulties recognizing mental states in others. Most research has focused on recognition of basic emotions from faces and voices separately. This study reports the results of a new task, assessing recognition of complex emotions and mental states from social scenes taken from feature films. The film format arguably is more challenging and ecologically closer to real social situations. Sample and method: A group of adults with ASC (n=22) were compared to a group of matched controls from the general population (n=22). Participants were tested individually. Results: Overall, individuals with ASC performed significantly lower than controls. There was a positive correlation between verbal IQ and task scores. Using task scores, more than 90% of the participants were correctly allocated to their group. Item analysis showed that the errors individuals with ASC make when judging socioemotional information are subtle. Conclusions: This new test of complex emotion and mental state recognition reveals that adults with ASC have residual difficulties in this aspect of empathy. The use of language-based compensatory strategies for emotion recognition is discussed.","[{'authorId': '2100443', 'name': 'O. Golan'}, {'authorId': '1390019127', 'name': 'S.

ffad55bd69728976e6a532e75b92f62a0e78d29b,"Social robots are becoming an integrated part of our daily lives with the goal of understanding humans' social intentions and feelings, a capability which is often referred to as empathy. Despite significant progress towards the development of empathic social agents, current social robots have yet to reach the full emotional and social capabilities. This paper presents our recent effort on incorporating an automated Facial Expression Recognition (FER) system based on deep neural networks into the spoken dialog of a social robot (Ryan) to extend and enrich its capabilities beyond spoken dialog and integrate the user's affect state into the robot's responses. In order to evaluate whether this incorporation can improve social capabilities of Ryan, we conducted a series of Human-Robot-Interaction (HRI) experiments. In these experiments the subjects watched some videos and Ryan engaged them in a conversation driven by user's facial expressions perceived by the robot. We measured the accuracy of the automated FER system on the robot when interacting with different human subjects as well as three social/interactive aspects, namely task engagement, empathy, and likability of the robot. The results of our HRI study indicate that the subjects rated empathy and likability of the affect-aware Ryan significantly higher than non-empathic (the control condition) Ryan. Interestingly, we found that the accuracy of the FER system is not a limiting factor, as subjects rated the affect-aware agent equipped with a low accuracy FER system as empathic and likable as when facial expression was recognized by a human observer.","[{'authorId': '2314025', 'name': 'A.
